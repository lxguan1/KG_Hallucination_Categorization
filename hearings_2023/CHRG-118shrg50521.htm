STATEMENT OF MR. RANDY MOORE, CHIEF, U.S. FOREST SERVICE


               opening statement of senator jeff merkley


    Senator Merkley. Good morning. Chief Moore, welcome. And we 
will have other colleagues who will be joining us. This is an 
important hearing on the fiscal year 2024 President's Budget 
for the United States Forest Service. It is great to have you 
with us.
    This is our first hearing of the year. I am excited that 
the leadership on the Full Committee, Chair Murray and Vice 
Chair Collins, are working in a bipartisan manner to move our 
appropriation bills down the fiscal year 2024 path, through 
committee and to the floor. They believe our committee members 
have a lot of shared bipartisan priorities that will power us 
through to enact appropriation bills this year, and I think it 
is so important that we try to establish that rhythm. I think 
we all agree that a continuing resolution, or government 
shutdown, would be a disaster.
    So we are ready to get to work. And here we are at our 
first hearing.
    I know a lot has been made of the split between the defense 
and non-defense funding; it is something we grapple with every 
year. I feel strongly that if we want to build a safer, more 
competitive country, we can't give up on the need to invest 
right here at home. And funding for the Forest Service is a 
perfect example of why we need to invest in non-defense 
spending, to defend our communities from wildfire, improve 
public health, protect jobs, and increase the health and 
resiliency of our forests.
    Indeed, the budget request for fiscal year 2024 gives us 
another stark reminder that our forests are in peril, and that 
we need these investments. We know that climate chaos is 
unrelenting. It is working through a cast of henchmen, drought, 
invasive pests, diseases that, together, are causing an 
inevitable scourge of catastrophic wildfire.
    And we can no longer view these villains as natural 
disasters, what they really are, are human-caused unnatural 
disasters brought on by our collective failure to effectively 
confront climate chaos, and the carbon dioxide that is warming 
the planet.
    When these unnatural disasters strike people lose their 
homes, they lose their livelihood, they even lose their lives. 
People who live even hours away lose their municipal water 
source, suffer the health impacts of the smoke, and the 
particulate matter in the air, and lose the joy of recreation, 
and the peace of nature.
    I will never forget traveling on Labor Day 2020, over 600 
miles from the northern border to the southern border of Oregon 
and back again, and never getting out of the smoke. And we have 
seen town, after town, after town, burned to the ground, that 
looked like World War II firebombed cities, and it has really 
affected the psychology of my state, and concern of folks about 
increasing the fire resilience of the forest, through thinning, 
through mowing, through prescribed fire, and try to minimize 
the chance of these types of catastrophes happening again.
    Everywhere I go in Oregon I hear people say: Let us do 
everything we can to make the forest more resilient, to defend 
our communities, keep our towns from being wiped out by blow 
torch style fires, and preventing these catastrophes is much 
better than investing on the backend.
    Looking back over the last 10 years, we have about doubled 
our annual investments in the Forest Service. In fiscal year 
2013 funding was $4.5 billion, of which $2.1 billion was for 
fighting fires, and $2.4 billion for other forest management 
activities.
    Ten years later, fiscal year 2023, it is $8.2 billion, so 
that is a big change over a decade, $4.3 billion for fire, and 
$3.9 billion forest management. The entire pot is growing, but 
certainly firefighting costs just continue to rise 
exponentially.
    So we need to double down on other forest management 
activities critical to forest resilience and forest health, 
watershed and habitat restoration, control of invasive species, 
thinning, prescribed burns, and grants to states for their best 
efforts.
    There are three major pieces of legislation that will 
provide an additional $12.6 billion over the course of a decade 
on top of that annual funding; that will enable us to radically 
step up our campaign to reinvigorate the resiliency of our 
forested lands: The Great American Outdoors Act, the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Bill, and the Inflation Reduction Act. All three 
provide transformative investment.
    Of course, they are not permanent, so we have to make the 
best use of every bit of those funds while they exist. And 
focusing only on responding to wildfires does not and will not 
help us take care of and restore our forests for the future. So 
we have to bring balance to our forests through collaboration, 
we need to work across the lines, the divisions of the timber 
wars of the past.
    I have to say, in Oregon, collaboration has greatly 
expanded bringing together the timber community, the 
environmental community, and the local stakeholders to work on 
the management of the forest. And that is why the Collaborative 
Forest Landscape Restoration Program is really such a success. 
We have many collaboratives in Oregon, but now five that are 
part of the Federal Program, and others that would like to be.
    When those various groups can work out a prescription for 
how to thin or treat the forest, their trust grows in each 
other, it gets easier over time, and the result is effective 
treatment of the forest, but also saw logs to the mill, and 
projects that are staying out of the courts.
    Hazardous fuels reduction continues to be very important, 
and between the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and Inflation 
Reduction Act, Congress invested more than $3 billion in the 
Forest Service's hazardous fuels work, huge increase over what 
we were doing a decade ago. It will at least double the impact 
of what we have done, even with just annual budgets alone.
    The Forest Service is prioritizing multiple high-risk areas 
in Oregon with these funds, around Mount Hood in the north, 
Malheur National Forest in the east, in Central Oregon, and in 
the Klamath Basin.
    There are other areas that need more treatment, like the 
Rogue Valley, and areas outside the wildland-urban interface, 
that those programs weren't designed to deliver to. So we will 
keep pushing for hazardous fuels reduction in the Interior Bill 
to keep up the momentum.
    One of the things I have talked to the Forest Service about 
is; where the location is of the acres that have gone through 
the environmental process and are ready for treatment, and 
those acres are often not near the towns because they are often 
the ones that were kind of the cheapest per acre to do. And 
this is why we really have to push to map the acres around our 
most vulnerable towns, and how we thin and treat those forests 
even if they are more expensive per acre, it is more important 
to slow down the fire close to town than it is far away.
    The budget also proposes a new program, it is a program--
actually I can't say it is really new and that we funded it in 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act--but it will be new to our 
annual Appropriations, and that is Burned Area Rehabilitation. 
And when we see things like the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, we see 
just how important that is; post-wildfire restoration, 
improving the watershed and forest conditions over a three-year 
period after a fire.
    Finally, touching back on wildland fire, I appreciate the 
significant investment that the President proposes to properly 
support the Federal Wildland Firefighting Force. This effort 
really began with passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill 
which boosted the pay of firefighters and built a more 
professional, year-round, firefighting workforce.
    And we are really looking at the model of how to keep 
people employed year-round, so that when they are not fighting 
fires they can be doing forest treatments, and thereby not have 
the massive turnover, and really retain the expertise that are 
developed. Our efforts in the Interior Appropriations Bill have 
built a more permanent backbone to sustain those investments.
    It is a credit to you, Chief Moore, for not just proposing 
better pay for firefighters, but also proposing investments in 
their health, and life--work, balance. Life--work, balance: 
that is something we struggle with here all the time.
    Our firefighters need support to combat the real danger of 
injury and fatigue, another consequence of the more 
catastrophic wildfires and never-ending fire seasons. While we 
need our authorizing committees to establish a special salary 
table, and other compensation reforms, we stand ready to 
continue working toward a better cared-for firefighting 
workforce.
    Chief, I appreciate that the request continues the Wildfire 
Suppression Reserve Fund at the authorized level of $2.65 
billion. I am concerned that the levels agreed to in 2018 may 
no longer be adequate based on the trend of wildfire costs in 
the years since. So this is why we included an additional $450 
million for Wildfire Suppression in the fiscal year 2023 
Omnibus, depending on what happens with the fires this coming 
summer, it may be very important for us to be able to do so 
again.
    And so I am looking towards the vision of planning for 
that. And then if it is not needed, though, that would be 
great. But we just don't know how this year is going to play 
out yet, we have got a lot of intensive firefighting months to 
come. So I hope we will have the administration's support for 
doing so.
    With all that, I will have a few questions about the 
investments after your presentation. I am sure my colleagues 
will as well.
    And now I will turn to Senator Murkowski, the Co-Chair, for 
any opening comments she would like to make.


                  statement of senator lisa murkowski


    Senator Murkowski. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Appreciate the 
opportunity to be back at work here on the Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies; and to kick off our hearings 
with the Chief of the Forest Service. So welcome to you.
    You have appropriately focused on the issues related to 
wildland fires and the impact that we see across the country, 
and certainly appreciate the challenges that that faces from a 
budget perspective, and how we do right there.
    Before I turn, though, to speak about some of those issues 
and the specifics in the fiscal year 2024 President's Budget 
Request, Chief, I just want you to hear directly from me again, 
on the record, my disappointment with the administration's 
decision regarding the management of the Tongass National 
Forest, our Nation's largest national forest.
    This January this administration reinstated, the 2001 
National Roadless Rule on the Tongass National Forest, 
basically abandoning the Alaska-specific Rule, and all the data 
and all the analysis that had supported it.
    So now, rather than providing the access needed to 
responsibly harvest timber, minimal amounts of timber, I might 
add, and as well as developing other natural resources on a 
fraction of the nearly 17 million acres within the Tongass, the 
administration has made it virtually impossible to have a 
sustainable, regional economy there, which is a far, far cry, 
from what Secretary Vilsack promised me, and the Alaska 
delegation, when he talked about a transition to harvesting 
young growth timber, in which he said, the Tongass was going to 
retain a small but a viable timber industry. That was the 
commitment there.
    We have come so far from that commitment unfortunately. And 
it seems, sadly, that all those years of work by good people 
has been cast aside, and it is especially bitter for those who 
took an early leap of faith, collaborated with the agency, with 
the environmental groups, and the tribes, and invested in his 
promise to transition.
    So all this work, all the timber program in the Tongass is, 
effectively, all but dead. I have long said that I do not 
believe that we have to choose between a healthy forest and a 
healthy economy. I just continue to be amazed that the 
administration does not agree that Southeast Alaska can and 
should be allowed to have both.
    So Chief, I am just going to ask you once again to work 
with me to provide some level of opportunity for the people of 
Southeast Alaska. I will be addressing that more in my 
questions to follow here. But as the Chairman has pointed out, 
certainly fire is at the top of his list of worries, certainly 
for us in Alaska, it is as well. Last year, in my state, we had 
the fastest start to the wildfire season on record, with over 
one million acres burning in June alone. By July that number 
leapt to well over two million acres.
    So we are this. We are seeing this impact, climate change 
has certainly focused--or manifesting itself through these 
wildfire threats, and we are seeing them, undoubtedly, evolve. 
All you need to do is drive through the Mat-Su Valley, or down 
on the Kenai Peninsula to see the impact of the beetle kill, 
the threat of fire that it poses to our Alaskan communities.
    I know that my colleagues in the Lower 48 are dealing with 
similar tree mortality issues, they have been long battling 
drought, so I, too, I am going to be interested in the wildfire 
outlook, and what the planning for this year looks like.
    One thing I do want to applaud the Forest Service for is 
working collaboratively with the Department of Interior on a 
proposal to modernize and reform Wildland Fire Workforce pay. 
It is so important that we make the pay competitive with other 
firefighting agencies, as well as doing things, like investing 
in housing, investing in mental health. We owe it to our 
frontline firefighters to have a plan, have a strategic plan to 
help them, and really to care for them as they engage in this 
dangerous line of work.
    In addition to a more full-time, permanent wildland 
firefighters across the country, each of my colleagues who 
interact with the Forest Service--are surely going to be 
identifying their agency needs in their states. In Alaska we 
need increased capacity to facilitate our robust recreation 
industry. You hear me talk about the need for those permits, 
support for critical mineral mining projects in the region, 
broadband access, and of course, again a timber supply for our 
withering timber industry.
    And we believe that we must empower our Tribes to be 
partners with the Federal Government as they are critical to 
expanding that capacity. And so that is why I am interested in 
hearing not only how the budget request proposes to address 
these capacity issues, but also what the Forest Service is 
actually, doing right, now to address them, especially in light 
of the billions of dollars in annual appropriations, what we 
have included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill as well as 
the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The agency has received a lot of money going in that 
direction, so interested in knowing: What are we seeing? How 
are we seeing those dollars translate into action? Also, 
knowing forward to hearing about your vision for the 
President's fiscal year 2024, and to learn more about your 
priorities for the Forest Service, and how those priorities can 
improve the health and resilience of our Nation's forest.
    So thank you for being here this morning; looking forward 
to the opportunities for questions back and forth.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much.
    And now, Chief Moore, we would like to hear from you.


                 summary statement of hon. randy moore


    Mr. Moore. Okay, great. Thank you. Chair Merkley, Ranking 
Member Murkowski, and Members of the Committee; thank you for 
inviting me to testify before you today.
    I appreciate the opportunity to share how the Forest 
Service is putting America's money to work. The fiscal year 
2024 request focuses on three primary areas: modernizing the 
wildland fire management system, confronting the wildfire 
crisis, and ensuring equitable access to and benefits from 
National Forest System.
    The people we serve deserve nothing less than to see the 
value of their money at work and to see their benefits, 
national forest and grasslands cover about 193 million acres, 
some 180 million people, and over 68,000 communities rely on 
these lands to capture and filter their drinking water. Our 
work contributes to over 373,000 jobs, $40.3 billion to the 
GDP, we work with tribes, states and local governments, private 
landowners, and many other partners across the country to keep 
forests and grasslands healthy and safe.
    Today, America's forests face dire threats from wildfire, 
climate change, and insects and disease, particularly in the 
West. This is an emergency situation in many places and we are 
acting with a sense of urgency in collaboration with 
communities and with our partners.
    Our top priority is to reduce wildfire threats by 
safeguarding communities and critical infrastructure, and 
creating healthy and resilient forests. Through our Wildfire 
Crisis Strategy, we have ramped up to treat the right places at 
the right scale using an All Lands/All Hands approach.
    This past January we announced investments of $930 million 
in 21 high-risk landscapes in the West, benefitting, roughly, 
200 communities and many other resources that people value. In 
addition, we have awarded nearly $200 million in Community 
Wildfire Defense Grants towards 100 projects, to 22 states, and 
seven tribes including $22.5 million in Oregon.
    Recent investments by Congress give us a historic 
opportunity to take bold and strategic actions. We are working 
to do just that, to put every dollar to good use. We are 
grateful to Congress and this Committee, in particular, for 
investing foundational funding to do this work.
    Sustained execution depends on continued Federal 
investments. The proposed fiscal year 2024 budget responds to 
this need. This budget also calls for a $1.4 billion investment 
in salaries, health, safe, and wellbeing for firefighters. A 
suite of new actions will permanently increase pay, improve 
options for housing, and provide better care and support for 
physical and mental health. It also increases the number of 
firefighters. While firefighters represent the backbone of our 
wildfire system we also need active and aggressive land 
management to confront the wildfire crisis.
    This budget invests $300 million in hazardous field 
treatments, it supports execution of the Wildfire Crisis 
Strategy, and it targets investments in burn area 
rehabilitation of $56 million to expedite recovery on wildfire. 
It supports use of the latest research, including grants to 
universities to support educational and technical assistance 
for innovative wood products.
    National forests and grasslands belong to every American. 
We are grateful for the Great American Outdoor Act funds that 
reduced our $7.7 billion maintenance backlog and ensure 
increase to--for public access.
    We are also invested in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds 
to repair historic cabins in Alaska. Every person should feel a 
personal invitation and connection to these lands. We remain 
committed to removing barriers to, so all people can enjoy 
National Forest System lands and services, particularly tribes 
and underserved community.
    We continue to focus policies, accountability, and training 
to ensure an equitable, respectful, and harassment-free work 
environment for all of our employees. We know what is at stake 
if we don't address the effects of climate change and the 
wildfire crisis, the health of our forests, and communities, 
clean water, a vibrant wood product industry, and jobs, and 
resources that Americans depend on.
    We need to act now to meet the challenges before us.
    Thank you. And I am grateful for your support. And I 
welcome any questions that you may have.
    [The statement follows:]
                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Randy Moore
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to testify on the 
President's fiscal year (FY) 2024 Budget request for the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service.
    The fiscal year 2024 President's Budget for the USDA Forest Service 
discretionary appropriations totals $7.4 billion for base programs and 
$2.3 billion for the wildfire suppression cap adjustment (in the 
Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund). The fiscal year 2024 
request focuses on three primary areas: modernizing the wildland fire 
management system; confronting the wildfire crisis; and ensuring 
equitable access to and benefits from the National Forest System.
    The investments highlighted below reflect services the Forest 
Service delivers through work on National Forests, partnerships with 
State, Private, and Tribal landowners, and our Research and Development 
mission area. These investments enable the Forest Service to restore 
long-term forest health and resiliency across landscapes the American 
people rely-on while ensuring equitable access to the resources on 
National Forest lands. Alongside our partners, the Forest Service will 
continue to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires to communities in 
FY 2024 through investments in the highest priority landscapes 
identified within the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. The Forest Service will 
maximize every dollar invested into our agency, making every dollar 
work for the American people. The people we serve deserve nothing less 
than to see the value of their money at work for their benefit.
The President's FY 2024 Budget Request for Specific Priorities to 
        Support Focal Areas
    The following investments align with and enhance the agency's 
efforts to modernize the wildland fire management system:

  --$1.4 billion for Wildland Fire Manage me nt Salarie s and Expe 
        nses: Investing in our wildland firefighting workforce is a 
        matter of national security as critical infrastructure, homes, 
        communities, structures, and natural resources are at grave and 
        growing risk of catastrophic wildfire. The FY 2024 budget funds 
        a permanent increase in pay for the wildland firefighter 
        workforce, providing a more livable wage, enhancing 
        recruitment, and supporting retention. Specifically, this 
        request includes:

    --$180 million for increasing base pay for Federal wildland 
            firefighters to ensure that this crucial workforce does not 
            face a pay cliff at the end of this year

    --$69 million to support cost of living increases for FY 2024

    --$259 million for increasing Federal firefighting capacity (an 
            estimated 970 additional Federal firefighters and 
            personnel) to expand our ability to address the wildfire 
            crisis and reduce the strain on our current workforce

    --$10 million for vital health and well-being assistance to more 
            comprehensively support our wildfire firefighter workforce;

    --$50 million to address the urgent need for wildland firefighter 
            housing through necessary maintenance and repairs of Forest 
            Service housing units that will support our recruitment, 
            hiring, and retention efforts.

  --$323 million for Hazardous Fue ls Reduction: To mitigate wildfire 
        risk on 4.2 million acres in high priority and high-risk 
        firesheds, building on hazardous fuels funding from the 
        Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act and 
        aligned with the agency's 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy.

    The following investments ensure that national forests and 
grasslands continue to provide experiences, services, and products to 
the American public by focusing on the restoration, enhancement, and 
resilience of the Nation's forests and grasslands:

  --$56 million for the Burne d Area Re habilitation: to build on 
        capacity created with the $65 million per year seed money from 
        the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to rehabilitate burned areas 
        and free up existing funding for more proactive forest health 
        work.

  --$94 million for Recreation, Heritage, and Wilde rne ss: to increase 
        support of critical recreation operations, planning, services, 
        and improvements, with particular emphasis on creating 
        welcoming, sustainable, and equitable recreation opportunities 
        for all Americans with a focus towards underserved and Tribal 
        communities.

  --$50.5 million for Vegetation and Watershe d Manage me nt: to 
        support healthy and resilient watersheds and landscapes, 
        sustain the production of clean and abundant air and water, 
        assist with meeting the Administration's climate goals, and 
        contribute to healthy and productive communities and Tribal 
        Nations.

  --$45 million for Mine rals and Geology Manage me nt: to locate and 
        prioritize orphaned oil and gas wells for remediation and the 
        inventory, environmental analysis, and clean-up of mine 
        reclamation sites.

  --$7.8 million for Grazing Manage me nt: to support post-fire 
        restoration, provide for strategic incentives to grazing 
        permittees, and build vibrant rural economies.
  --$55 million for Forest Health Management: to ensure healthy forests 
        and functional landscapes on Federal and non-federal lands in 
        support of the conservation priorities of the Administration.

  --$80 million for Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program: 
        to invest in communities and regions with a collaborative, 
        common purpose in reducing wildfire risk and improving forest 
        health and resiliency.

  --$1.7 billion for National Forest Syste m Salarie s and Expe nses: 
        to support the agency's 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy as 
        well as critical non-fire programs, which have decreased in 
        funding over time as wildland fire response needs escalated.

    Further investments ensure that the Forest Service relies on the 
latest science and technology to deliver results on the ground and for 
the people:

  --$502 million for Information Technology Capabilitie s: to continue 
        modernization of our Information Technology systems that allow 
        the public to better access our services, sustain emergency 
        communication systems, and provide our workforce the tools they 
        need to carry out our conservation mission safely and 
        efficiently.

  --$72 million for Zero Emissions Vehicle s: included across several 
        program funding requests to invest in replacing vehicles within 
        the agency fleet and to provide for employees and visitors with 
        charging infrastructure.

  --$349 million for Forest and Rangeland Research: to continue 
        investments in research priorities, with a focus on climate 
        change-related research including reforestation, carbon 
        accounting, and fire and fuels research.

  --$6 million for USDA Climate Hubs: to accelerate science production 
        and technology transfer that will aid management agencies, 
        private landowners, and agricultural producers adopt 
        scientifically sound climate adaptation practices.
                    confronting the wildfire crisis
    The Forest Service's paramount focus continues to be combatting the 
threat and impact of destructive wildfire to our Nation's communities, 
critical infrastructure, forests, rangelands, water supplies, and 
wildlife. Changing environmental conditions have lengthened fire 
seasons into fire years and worsened wildfires across the West. 
Expanding development into the wildland/urba n interface (WUI) 
increasingly puts more homes into fire-prone landscapes and increases 
the challenge and complexity of wildfire suppression and fuels 
reduction work. Most wildfires that cause significant damage to a large 
number of homes and other structures are human caused; 97% of wildfires 
threaten homes; and almost one-third of American homes are within the 
WUI.
    The Forest Service has a historic opportunity now, between the 
investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation 
Reduction Act, and our annual appropriations, to implement solutions at 
a large scale. We are now entering our second year of carrying out our 
10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. The Wildfire Crisis Strategy aims to 
increase science-based fuels treatments by up to four times previous 
treatment levels, especially in those areas at highest risk. By working 
in the right places at the right scale, our treatments can reduce 
wildfire risk and better protect communities, infrastructure, and 
natural resources while helping wildland firefighters respond to 
wildfires safely and effectively.
    The Forest Service cannot succeed in this alone. The highest risk 
firesheds are typically in multiple land ownerships. The Forest Service 
will continue to strengthen our long-standing work and relationships 
with Tribes, States, local communities, private landowners, and other 
stakeholders to adapt lessons learned into a coordinated and effective 
program of work as outlined in the 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. 
Through government-to-government consultation with Tribes, expanded 
partnerships and co-stewardship, and broader community support, the 
Forest Service will increase the use of prescribed fire, fuel 
treatments, and the management of unplanned ignitions to reduce long-
term wildfire risks. Fortunately, we have decades of experience working 
through collaborative partnerships based on common values and shared 
goals across shared landscapes as set out in the National Cohesive 
Wildland Fire
                          management strategy
  ensuring equitable access to and benefits from the national forest 
                                 system
    The Forest Service will continue to invest in actions that create 
broad and efficient access to the vital resources our forests and 
grasslands provide. This effort is twofold. First, we must ensure that 
those who rely on these services and benefits can access those benefits 
safely. Therefore, we are committed to improving the operation and 
maintenance of our extensive infrastructure portfolio that includes 
buildings, dams, communication sites, recreation sites, roads, trails, 
and bridges. Second, to carry out this work effectively, the Forest 
Service is committed to continued intentional internal and external 
engagement with Tribal Nations whose ancestral homelands are within or 
adjacent to federally managed public lands, and communities that live 
by, visit, and depend on national forests. The Forest Service is 
committed to identifying and removing barriers to access Forest Service 
programs and services for historically underserved communities. This 
will be done by integrating equity-centered criteria in the design, 
funding, and prioritization of all policies, programs, and activities 
to center equity considerations as part of the decision process. The 
Forest Service will also work to advance mission critical work, remove 
barriers and boost economic opportunities through improved access to 
contracts, grants and agreements, and permits.
               leveraging additional funding authorities
    Along with the tools and investments proposed in the FY 2024 
Presidents Budget, the Forest Service will leverage funding within the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) to confront the wildfire crisis, create new markets and 
technology for wood products, promote economic development, and restore 
forest health and resiliency through partnerships and collaboration 
across landscapes.
    Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Congress provided 
a $1.4 billion down payment that greatly assists in putting our 
Wildfire Crisis Strategy into action with investments on 10 landscapes 
in eight Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, 
New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington). Through work on these landscapes 
and others, we completed treatments on 3.2 million acres nationally in 
2022. We also accomplished these treatments in 118 of the 250 high-risk 
firesheds identified in the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. This work was 
accomplished despite numerous challenges including workforce capacity 
and high post-fire workloads from historic wildfire activity across the 
country the past several years. The work on these acres directly 
reduced risk to communities, infrastructure, and critical watersheds.
    The Inflation Reduction Act provides the Forest Service an 
additional $1.8 billion for hazardous fuels funding in the WUI. With 
IRA funding, we recently selected 11 additional landscapes for 
treatment in seven Western States (Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, 
Oregon, Utah, and Washington). Combined with the initial BIL investment 
landscapes, our actions will span nearly 45 million acres across 134 of 
the 250 high-risk firesheds in the western U.S., with a total 
investment to date of $930 million on 21 landscapes in 2023. These 
investments will help reduce the risk of wildfire to at-risk 
communities, Tribal lands, critical infrastructure, utility corridors, 
and public water sources. We listened to our partners, the public we 
serve, Tribes and many others regarding what mattered most to them, 
where opportunity is, and where challenges remain. Their feedback and 
our experience on these landscapes helped us identify both challenges 
to implementation and enabling conditions for future success.
    Through Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) (Public Law 116-152) 
funding for the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund, 
the Forest Service continues to repair and upgrade vital infrastructure 
and facilities in the National forests and grasslands. The GAOA also 
permanently funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with 
which the Forest Service invests in conservation and recreation 
opportunities in public and private lands through the Forest Legacy 
Program and Federal Land Acquisition.
    According to the agency's 2020 economic analysis, Forest Service 
GAOA deferred maintenance projects are projected to support 
approximately 4,400 jobs and contribute $420 million to the Gross 
Domestic Product on an average annual basis over the 5-year 
authorization of the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration 
Fund. In FY 2024, the Forest Service proposes $94.3 million for the 
Forest Legacy Program, $123.9 million for Federal Land Acquisition, and 
$285 million for the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration 
Fund. The FY 2024 project lists are included in the FY 2024 Budget 
request.
    In closing, the President's FY 2024 Budget request for the Forest 
Service proposes a landmark investment in wildland fire, establishes 
funding priorities for risk-based wildfire reduction, and improves 
overall access and utilization of our National Forests System. The FY 
2024 Budget request underscores our commitment to long-overdue 
investments in our wildland firefighter workforce to provide them with 
the compensation that they deserve, along with critical investments to 
support health and wellbeing, and expanded options for housing. The FY 
2024 Budget also highlights the importance of restoring and creating 
resilient landscapes, improving infrastructure, and removing barriers 
to access. We look forward to working with this subcommittee to fulfill 
the President's goals and our key responsibilities for the long-term 
benefit of the Nation's forests and grasslands, and for all Americans. 
I will be glad to answer your questions.

    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much, Chief Moore. And we 
are going to have, I think, seven-minute rounds of questions, 
and we will be able to go back through.
    And a special welcome to Katie Britt, good to have you on 
this subcommittee.
    Let us dive into that firefighter workforce issue. Last 
year the Forest Service's target for firefighters was 11,300. 
How close did you get to that target? And what did we learn 
about that challenge that will help us improve recruitment for 
this coming year?
    Mr. Moore. Senator we got about 10,965, or roughly 97 
percent of that goal of 11,300 firefighters. What we learned is 
that, because of the pressures of recruitment and retention, 
that we were facing, really, an uphill battle. I would be happy 
to tell you that the proposed fiscal year 2024 President's 
Budget addresses a lot of the concerns and challenges we have 
with the recruitment and retention.
    Senator Merkley. So one of the issues I keep hearing about 
is housing; any insights on that?
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. In the President's Budget it does address 
a number of things. It addresses the housing issue, so we have 
money set aside there, about $45 million. It also looks at 
about $10 million for the Forest Service, and $10 million for 
Department of Interior to look at mental care and wellbeing. 
And it also addresses, you know, just the challenges with the 
pay gap between the Federal and non-Federal firefighters. So we 
think it addresses a number of those issues that was really 
affecting our ability to recruit, retain a lot of our 
firefighters going forward.
    Senator Merkley. So one of the things that we have talked 
about is trying to increase the workforce by not having the 
interruption of folks being on fires and then having to figure 
out the rest of their life during the non-fire season, and thus 
the potential synergy between being in the firefighter role and 
being in the role of forest management. What do you see as the 
prospects or possibilities for that helping to increase 
retention from year to year?
    Mr. Moore. Well, you know, my experience, you know, working 
in the Forest Service for 40-plus years, you know, it varied 
over the years. Lately, what we are seeing is, the primary 
reason that I have been hearing, personally from firefighters, 
is the pay gap.
    You know, it is easier when you are a beginning firefighter 
it used to be easier, I should say, but as you get older and 
have families the salaries become even more important. And 
Forest Service salaries--I should say, Federal salaries, in 
many of the locations across the country is not holding up to 
salaries in other non-Federal jobs.
    When you have a minimum pay of $15 per hour, you would have 
to be a minimum of a GS-5 to be comparable to that minimum 
wage. And many of our locations the minimum wage is not enough 
to sustain a fair way to live. And we are seeing more and more 
of that pop up, particularly across the West, but it certainly 
holds true all across the country, where the cost of living is 
continuing to rise, and our salaries are staying, fairly, the 
same.
    Senator Merkley. So last year we set the floor at $15, but 
are there plans for it to go higher than that?
    Mr. Moore. Well, what happened, that is a temporary fix, we 
looked at about a $20,000 bump in pay that stemmed the tide of 
a lot of our employees leaving. I think the challenge now is 
that if that is permanent, which is proposed in the President's 
fiscal year 2024 budget, we think that that is going to be a 
huge help.
    One of the other things we have, in addition to the health 
and wellbeing of our employees, is looking at the housing issue 
that we are trying to address, which we have a severe shortage 
in many of our small rural locations across the country. We 
think that the budget that is proposed really addresses that 
issue.
    And then the other piece that I think is really significant 
which I think will make a huge difference, is what we call 
portal-to-portal pay, and not only does that pertains to our 
full-time firefighters, but it is also what we call the Militia 
Workforce in the Forest Service, it is our wildlife biologists, 
our foresters who have certifications in certain parts of the 
fire program that goes out to fight and suppress fires. And 
that would pertain to all employees that have qualifications 
and certifications to participate in fire suppression 
activities.
    Senator Merkley. So I want to shift gears. The Bipartisan 
Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction Act provided for 
investment in high-risk firesheds, and the Forest Service has 
targeted areas of my State of Oregon in the North, South, East, 
and Central Oregon. The Rogue Valley is considered the highest 
risk fireshed, and it is not targeted by the Forest Service in 
part because there is not a lot of Forest Service land there. 
So a lot of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land, and other 
multiple land-ownership.
    The Forest Service does, however, have other funds that are 
available to work with states, with private landowners, for 
cross-boundary work with BLM. Is that flexible enough to 
provide help with the Rogue Valley fireshed?
    Mr. Moore. Yes. Senator, I am glad you have asked that 
question, because it comes up fairly often. And you know, we of 
course have focused on the 21 landscapes that have been 
identified, but we have other dollars in the budget where we 
work in other areas that are also at high fire risk, or those 
important areas. The Collaborative Forest landscape Restoration 
Program, we call it CFLRP, it is one of those areas where we 
have a community of people coming together to look at those 
areas that are important.
    And those projects or programs are funded. So we have a lot 
of work that has been done outside of the 21 landscape that 
really gets at the issue of reducing, not only the potential to 
high fire danger, but also for disease of insects, and some of 
the other types of issues that we are dealing with in our 
forest today.
    You know, Secretary Vilsack just announced earlier this 
week $197 million for Community Wildfire Defense Grants, six of 
those grants have been awarded in Southern Oregon, which goes 
directly into the areas that you have mentioned.
    Senator Merkley. And thank you very much.
    Mr. Moore. For the tune of $22.5 million. And so the point 
that I am making is that we have other opportunities to work in 
other areas outside of the 21 landscapes, because we know that 
there are some important issues all across the National Forest 
System. And that is why we are maximizing and utilizing our 
dollars to the best.
    Now, the other thing that I would just add on this 
particular piece too is that, you know, we are trying to 
leverage every dollar we get with partner-matching 
contributions. And so far, our work with our partners has 
really exceeded even the amount of money that we are getting 
now, whether it is through a BIL, or IRA, or the appropriated 
budgeted process, and even Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) 
dollars.
    You didn't ask this question, but I will say that even 
through GAOA dollars, our partners have brought in an 
additional $200 million towards backlog, and deferred 
maintenance, and restoration efforts.
    Senator Merkley. Great. Thank you. Well, forest issues are 
certainly an issue in Oregon and also in Alaska.
    And so we will turn to Senator Murkowski, as Ranking 
Member.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chief, I want to start my questions with some of the issues 
associated with tree mortality. As you know, we have been hit 
really hard in Alaska with spruce bark beetle. It has been 
observed on roughly 193,500 acres statewide, more than 98 
percent of those acres mapped in 2021, being in South Central 
Alaska, which of course is where our population is 
concentrated.
    The outbreak is estimated to be now in its seventh year, it 
has affected over 1.6 million acres since first being 
documented in 2016. It was around a lot earlier than that, but 
I think that was when we started really mapping it, but it is a 
huge issue, and one that we pay close attention to it because 
of what it means, for not only the mortality, but then what 
that might mean as regards to a fire threat.
    How is Forest Service utilizing the funding that we 
provided here through Congress to address the outbreak in 
Alaska? I thought that we were going to be a little more 
competitive, perhaps, in the Community Wildfire Defense Program 
Grant, and especially in view of the vast need that we have, 
but I have learned that only one community in Alaska has 
received benefits from that grant.
    So how do you get money to communities in these areas where 
the beetle kill really does pose significant threat? And if 
there is a challenge with the way we have written that, let me 
know. So if you can speak to some of the threat that we are 
seeing with the spruce bark beetle?
    Mr. Moore. Sure. Senator Murkowski, you are correct; the 
outbreak of the beetle has been devastating there in Alaska. 
Well, what we are seeing is a little bit of a challenge because 
even we are seeing a change, because even though last year's--
look, it was 198,000 acres, or so; we also did survey, aerial 
survey analysis for fiscal year 2022, last year, and what we 
are seeing is a rapid decline in the amount of acres that has 
been affected. In fact, we only saw about 48,000 acres compared 
to 197,000 the year before.
    But even saying that, we have been working with some of the 
locals there, putting together a plan, and we are planning to 
work together to look and see: if there is really a continued 
concern of the beetle; has it reached its peak? So we are going 
to be monitoring that very closely. But what we are seeing is a 
trend down currently.
    In terms of the Wildfire Community Defense Grants, this was 
only the first round. We will have many more rounds coming up. 
In fact, this was the first $197 million, we have an additional 
$800 million, where we are going to be looking at opportunities 
to do a lot of work, and so I am sure Alaska will fit into some 
of those future projects.
    Senator Murkowski. So it is not necessarily a question of 
the criteria for the grants themselves. Was it a matter of how 
much was allocated in that first round and--it just, it is 
inconceivable to me; I mean when you talk about 1.6 million 
acres of a beetle kill, seems to me that our communities would 
be eligible for more than one of these Community Grant 
Programs.
    So if there is--again, if there is an issue with how we are 
competing for those let us talk about it. If it is an issue 
that we haven't done much to provide for a bigger grant funding 
pool, let us talk about that, or if it is, again, the criteria; 
you know: Is it based on population that might be impacted? 
Well, I will share with you, and if you haven't seen it, just 
driving down the road, driving down the road.
    Let me ask though, because I am talking about the impact in 
South Central because of the spruce bark beetle, but down in 
the Tongass we just--you know, spruce bark beetle really hasn't 
been a significant threat or concern, and in just the past few 
years now, we have seen the black-headed budworm that is just 
absolutely wreaking havoc on the coastal hemlock, and the 
spruce down there in southeast.
    So this is new for us. And what we are seeing, it is 
traveling like wildfire, and what you look at, as you are as on 
the coast, or flying above, you can visually see the movement 
there. Nobody is really talking about it, but it is an outbreak 
that I am really concerned about. And again, as we are seeing 
warmer temperatures, we never used to worry about wildfire in 
the Tongass because the Tongass is a rainforest. Well, that 
rainforest is not always wet, and if we are seeing this level 
of mortality brought about by a different invasive species, 
what is the plan here?
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, we do have our researchers looking 
at that area, particularly with the outbreak of insects, as 
well as diseases there in the area. So we will be paying close 
attention to that, and we will be working with the community 
there. So we have not, and will not forget Alaska, and how it 
fits into having some of these opportunities to get these grant 
proposals. And like I said this first round was really looking 
at high wildfire potential. And I hear you that there is 
potential there that didn't used to be there, particularly 
since it is supposed to be a rainforest, but not every year is 
the same.
    But just know that we are paying attention to Alaska, we do 
intend, and I would say that, for sure, that there would be an 
opportunity to fund some of those areas in Alaska. This was 
really only the first go-round, and we were really focused on 
high fire danger, and potential areas there.
    The other thing that--and Alaska is starting to do this, is 
working with community leaders, looking at areas to focus on. 
And so when you are applying for these grants, we are looking 
to see what the state has done to map out some of these areas; 
and where this first go-round it went--a lot of those projects 
went to states that have already done a lot of their mapping 
throughout the state.
    Alaska is working on that now. We have a group there that 
we are working with, and I am confident that Alaska will be 
competitive, going forward.
    Senator Murkowski. Chief, my time has expired. But I do 
want to impress upon you that right now the community leaders, 
the mayors of the Borough of the Kenai Peninsula, as well as 
within the Anchorage area, they are coming to me, not for more 
in appropriations, because they are not counting on that, they 
are counting on me for congressionally directed spending.
    They want me to take care of their number one priority, 
which is the fire threat to their region, very immediate, very 
real, and so I would ask that we have a little better 
understanding in terms of what more we can be doing to help 
these threatened communities.
    Thank you Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Britt.
    Senator Britt. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Ranking Member. It is a pleasure to be with you all today.
    Chief Moore, appreciate you being in front of this 
committee, and the important work that you do. I also want to 
say thank you for sending me a welcome letter, and welcoming 
me, obviously, to the Senate and to this Committee. I certainly 
look forward to being able to work with you.
    As you know, forests are incredibly important to Alabama, 
they are one of the main reasons our state is known by many as 
``Alabama the Beautiful''. Alabama is home to over 23 million 
forest land acres, the third-most in the Continental United 
States. The people of Alabama are hard at work putting that 
land to good use. In fact, forestry contributes to 1,100 jobs--
excuse me--over 100,000 jobs in our state. All of the work 
leads to a total economic output of about $27.7 billion.
    The state produces almost every wood product you could 
possibly imagine, from lumber, to paper, to cabinetry, to 
pallets, to flooring, to oriented strand board. These products 
are used by Alabamians, by our neighbors, and all across the 
globe. Thankfully, we are able to export about $1.3 billion in 
products overseas.
    With an industry this productive, and resources so crucial 
to our state, Alabama forest owners know that we have to take 
care of the gift that God gave us, and the greater forestry 
community in Alabama has demonstrated that principally, 
incredibly well.
    Private landowners know that they must take care of their 
land if they are going to leave things better than they found 
them, leave things better for their kids and their grandkids. 
And as I consistently say, there are no greater stewards of our 
lands than our farmers, foresters, and cattlemen.
    I think that is why over 91 percent of Alabama's forests 
are privately owned, and the state still continues to add 2 to 
2.5 percent of tree volume year over year. The administration's 
fiscal year 2024 Budget for the Forest Service includes $60 
million to install charging equipment for electric vehicles on 
public lands, which is clear that the Green New Deal has 
certainly made its way into the Forest Service budget.
    However, that very same budget cuts $3 million from 
Landscape Scale Restoration Grant funding. I believe this 
funding, obviously, has supported efforts to reduce wildlife 
fire risk, its improved forest conditions, and also mitigated 
disease, and blight conditions that are facing our Nation's 
forest. In Alabama we have found these funds to be useful to 
expand the use of drones, and train drones, pilots, to combat 
and prepare forest fires.
    In your experience how effective have we been in using 
drones to track the spread of forest fires? To use that 
information to assist us as we fight forest fires in their 
efforts in the future?
    Mr. Moore. So Senator Britt, again, welcome and thank you 
thank you question.
    Senator Britt. Thank you.
    Mr. Moore. I might add too, in terms of wood innovations, 
you know, one of the things that we bragged about Alabama last 
week, was that you also have a cross-laminated timber facility 
there as well. And so I know Georgia would like to have their 
own, but right now they are borrowing from Alabama, so good on 
Alabama.
    Senator Britt. Yes. We are proud to be a leader.
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. The other part of your question, though, I 
think Alabama, but as well as the South, in general, plays 
prominently in how we look at wood, and how we look at the 
innovations of wood, but also, you know, looking at the use of 
drones.
    The Forest Service had just recently gotten into the use of 
drones to do a lot of different types of forest management, 
including wildfire suppression, prescribed burning as well. In 
fact, we call it: the southern region is right now it is 
leading the nation in prescribed burning, but also using drones 
to help with that facility. We know that there is always a 
safety risk when we use helicopters to look at increasing the 
amount of prescribed burning that we are doing, and so one of 
the alternatives to mitigating that safety issue is to look at 
drones to do prescribed burning.
    So we are moving into that arena in a really rapid way, and 
we have already started licensing and certifying a lot of our 
employees to operate the drones. And so we are headed in that 
direction, and we are going as quickly as we possibly can.
    Senator Britt. Well, thank you. I hope that we continue to 
use those resources to make smart decisions moving forward. And 
I want to thank you for the work that you and the Forest 
Service continue to put into Alabama and helping keep Alabama 
beautiful, and obviously, protecting the many livelihoods that 
you just referenced yourself.
    I was happy to see the emphasis you placed when you wrote 
me that welcome letter, on collaboration, and working to avoid 
these catastrophic events, wildfires, and other things in areas 
like Alabama, that would require robust local engagement to 
make good land management decisions.
    And so the Forest Service received about $10 billion in 
fiscal year 2023. How are you using those funds to address and 
mitigate threats of cross-boundary fires, you know, that start 
on Federal lands and obviously cross over into private forests?
    Mr. Moore. You know, one of the strategies of the plans we 
have in the Wildfire Crisis Strategy that we have developed, is 
to look at two pieces. We have said that we want to address 20 
million acres of Federal lands, of Forest Service lands, as a 
matter of fact, but an additional 30 million acres of other 
Federal, tribal, and private lands throughout the country.
    Senator Britt. Okay.
    Mr. Moore. And so when we look at addressing to scale, we 
are looking at landscapes, and when we look at landscapes it is 
multiple jurisdictions.
    Senator Britt. Okay.
    Mr. Moore. And so we want to be able to deploy the work in 
a way where it is effective. So we will be looking at 
strategically placed treatments across the landscape. In fact, 
our scientists are telling us that when you look at a fireshed, 
as an example, which is about a 250,000-acre block, we only 
need to treat anywhere between 20 to 40 percent of that to have 
a positive effect on how that fire behaves when it moves 
through that fireshed.
    Senator Britt. Okay.
    Mr. Moore. And so we are looking at that. We are using 
science as a foundation for making decisions of how we approach 
that, and we also know that the only way forward is to do it in 
a collaborative manner, where we invite a community of people 
into the decision space to talk about what we need to do out 
there together.
    Senator Britt. Thank you.
    Mr. Moore. And so that is the direction that we are headed 
in. We know that we need to invite the people into the decision 
space not just, you know, in the position of giving us their 
recommendation, but making them a part of the, deciding what 
the problem is, defining what the problem is, but also helping 
to pursue the solution together as well.
    Senator Britt. No. I certainly appreciate that spirit of 
collaboration, and letting everybody have a seat at the table. 
I see that my time has expired, and so I will submit my 
additional questions for the record, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. And if you have the time to stay 
approximately 15 minutes from now, you will get another 
opportunity.
    Senator Britt. Okay sounds good.
    Senator Merkley. Great. Thank you, Senator Britt.
    So I want to jump into the complexity of the funding to 
fight fires, we have the Base Funding, we have the Reserve 
Fund, we have the Supplemental, and we have Carryover, all of 
which can get very confusing. But the Reserve Fund is set up 
under a legislation that essentially increases it by $100 
million a year. So fiscal year 2024 request is $2.650 billion 
rather than $2.550 billion.
    And is it, given the accelerating costs of the wages, the 
investments in housing, the expansion of the fire season, the 
increased number of acres being burned, is that enough? Or do 
we need to fix the Fire Fix?
    Mr. Moore. First of all, I want to thank Congress for the 
Fire Fix, because it certainly helped in terms of limiting our 
ability, and really stopping our ability to use other non-fire 
dollars to use toward fire suppression when we have exceeded 
the cap. So we will always be grateful and thankful to Congress 
for the Fire Funding Fix.
    What we are seeing though, over the last 3 years, two of 
those years we have exceeded $3 billion for fire suppression, 
and when we looked at that legislation, Senator, we had no idea 
that we would reach this point this early in time. And we 
already are getting forecast from our researchers telling us 
that between now and fiscal year 2027, that we are going to be 
seeing those calls exceed, or up to $4 billion per year for 
fire suppression.
    And so if that continues, and if the legislation expires, 
then we may be returning back to fire borrowing as we did in 
the past, which would really be devastating to all of the 
efforts that we are trying to put forward now, looking at 
trying to reduce the wildfire crisis.
    Senator Merkley. Yeah, absolutely. We are determined to try 
to prevent that fire borrowing, which is why we are keeping the 
window open for a supplemental of another $450 million. When 
you have to shut down all the other things you do and then wait 
for us to do an emergency supplemental to refund you before you 
can pick up your other responsibilities; that is just 
unacceptable in terms of the stewardship and management of our 
forests.
    The Civilian Conservation Corps folks, we have a number of 
them in Oregon, and they really give a second chance to a lot 
of folks, 16 through 24, who are looking to get their feet back 
on the ground after maybe going off track. And the forestry 
programs they offer are quite significant and popular. The 
students can be paid when they work fighting fires, but they 
are not--the Forest Service is not authorized to pay them when 
they do non-fire work, in terms of forest stewardship, forest 
maintenance, and yet they are working right alongside others 
who are getting paid.
    Do you support Congress giving you the authority so these 
folks can be paid when they are doing forest management, as 
well as when they are doing firefighting?
    Mr. Moore. Yes. Senator I would always support justice and 
equality. Yeah, we currently have limited authority to 
compensate Job Corps students, primarily because they are not 
Federal employees, they are not contractors, nor are they part 
of a non-government organization. So our staff and our legal 
counsel, right now, are completing their review of the proposed 
language, and we will be responding shortly back to you on 
suggested edits, if needed.
    Senator Merkley. Great. We look forward to your suggestions 
on that area. I want to turn to tribal co-management. The 
Klamath Tribe in the southern part of Oregon, their reservation 
was taken back by the Government when the tribe was terminated. 
The tribe was restored but they did not get their reservation 
back, but they would like to have co-management ability on the 
Winema, and the Warm Springs Tribe would like to be able to do 
that on the Mount Hood Forest.
    What can we do to actually implement significant co-
management work that I find completely appropriate and 
valuable?
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. I would like for you to know that I share 
your perspective on this. We have increased a number of shared 
stewardship agreements with tribes, we are looking at plenty of 
other opportunities where we can co-manage some of our 
facilities. We are looking at one now up on the Pactola, up in 
South Dakota, as an opportunity to co-manage that particular 
area there.
    So it is going to take time, but we agree with that 
philosophy, that approach, that we would like to do more 
working together with the tribes.
    Senator Merkley. Good. Well, I really hope we can see that 
unfold. I think it would be very significant to the tribe. 
After all, these forests are on the traditional tribal lands, 
and they have high unemployment rates, they have a lot of 
Klamath forest management knowledge to bring to bear. And so it 
could be a real win-win.
    You had mentioned the work on staff housing, but right now 
it is just kind of a line item. I mean we have buildings that 
have to be reopened, or we have to build new buildings. Is 
there a detailed plan? Certainly without places, where people 
can stay, or afford to stay, it is very hard to relocate in a 
lot of our rural areas where the Forest Service does its work.
    Mr. Moore. Yes, Senator. I will check to see if we have a 
detailed plan but we know that we have a lot of housing 
facilities that need some significant remodeling and investing 
in. And I am happy to report that the President's Budget has 
put aside $50 million to look at this issue, and we think that 
that is going to go a long ways in restoring a lot of our 
facilities.
    Senator Merkley. Great. I look forward to a detailed plan 
on how we can use that effectively to expand the availability, 
because I am just hearing from everyone that in terms of hiring 
people, and retaining them in remote areas, it is almost 
impossible, as there is no place to live. Somehow the prospect 
of working for the Forest Service while you live in your car is 
not such an entertaining one.
    I noted with interest a recent request for proposals from 
the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky where they 
required that all proposed designs utilize mass timber. Mass 
timber is a very significant product in Oregon. And it 
sequesters carbon in buildings, it has more earthquake 
resistance, it really is a fabulous kind of engineering 
advance. How about we make this requirement for all the Forest 
Service RFPs?
    Mr. Moore. Well, if Congress decides to do that we will 
certainly give it our best shot to make it happen.
    Senator Merkley. Well, I think it is actually something 
that you would have the power to do without legislation, just 
as we have seen the model in Kentucky, but I will keep raising 
it.
    Okay, let me turn to Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. I would like defer to, also another new 
member of our committee. It is nice to have Senator Fischer on. 
So before I go to my second round, I will defer to her.
    Senator Merkley. A pleasure to have you Senator Fischer. 
Sorry I didn't look over, and see you had arrived; welcome.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Senator Murkowski.
    Nebraska has experienced a significant number of wildfires 
the past couple of years, including the second-highest year on 
record in 2022. In a rural state like mine, where nearly 94 
percent of the fire departments, are entirely volunteer-run, 
programs like the Volunteer Fire Assistance Program are 
crucial.
    The Nebraska Forest Service helped hundreds of fire 
districts in my state, 475 in 2022 alone, improved their 
ability to prepare for and suppress wildfires. While we 
understand that this program did receive some Infrastructure 
Bill funding, I was disappointed to see the program level 
funded in your fiscal year 2024 budget request, along with 
other important programs, like the State Fire Assistance 
Program.
    Given the increased threat that wildfires pose, and the 
resources needed by these communities, like those in Nebraska, 
can you discuss how that decision was made to level that 
funding?
    Mr. Moore. I cannot, Senator, tell you what went into the 
decision to level that funding. What I can tell you, though, is 
that as we look at many places like Nebraska, and certainly 
Nebraska, there are many other opportunities where we are 
working with the State National Association of State Foresters, 
and in this case your State Forester, looking at other programs 
that we work through the state, with the state, to look at 
reducing the fire opportunities throughout.
    Now, if you have a particular area, then I would address 
that specifically, but I am not familiar enough with Nebraska, 
and what we are doing specifically there, but I would be 
certainly happy to work with you and to look further into this.
    Senator Fischer. We have tens of thousands of acres of 
Forest Service land, probably unusual from the Oregon land that 
they have, because ours are grasslands, and they are sparsely 
populated areas. So the Forest Service is very, very dependent 
upon neighbors for ranchers to come in and help control those 
fires, because as you can imagine, in the Sandhills of 
Nebraska, in the grasslands that we have when it is--when we 
are suffering drought, as we have been for several years, when 
the winds are blowing, when you have fires started, they don't 
just remain on Forest land.
    Mr. Moore. Right.
    Senator Fischer. They cover miles, and miles, and miles of 
acres. And so our volunteer fire departments are essential to 
helping to control fires that are on Federal lands as well. So 
I hope you could get back to us on why we are not seeing an 
increase in the funding to help those volunteer fire 
departments that would be helpful for us?
    Mr. Moore. Certainly.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. In your written testimony you 
highlighted the fiscal year 2024 request for $72 million across 
several areas of the Forest Service, for zero-emission vehicles 
and charging infrastructure. When you think of all the 
challenges that are facing the Forest Service, do you think 
that electric vehicles and charging infrastructure should 
really be an area that Federal funds are prioritized for?
    Mr. Moore. So from my experience, Senator, you know, we try 
and serve the American people, and what we have noticed is that 
more and more people are buying electric cars and they are 
visiting the national forest. And the ideal that you would be 
able to visit the national forest and not worry about whether 
you need to charge your car to get back home, you know, it is 
an opportunity for us to try and respond to that part of 
America. And so that is the ideal there.
    Now, looking at the funding itself, it is for the 
infrastructure as well as for the vehicles themselves, and I 
believe the Federal Government is looking at: What are the 
opportunities to look at having some of our Federal vehicles 
that are electric, to look at this greener environment. So 
there is a lot of reasons to want to support that.
    Senator Fischer. You know, with all due respect, sir, I 
would point out that the first two programs that I mentioned 
were to help and prevent wildfires.
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. I believe your duty is to properly manage 
the land that is held by the Federal Government, and be able 
to, as I said, manage it, and manage it properly. When we 
looked at those other two programs, dealing with managing 
wildfires which I pointed out in my area, can whip up in dry 
conditions, devastating wildfires across grassland and across 
private land as well. But yet we saw level funding, or a 
decrease in funding in your budget request for that. I am 
appalled by that.
    I respect the tough decisions that you have to make on 
where funds are allocated, but when you look at $72 million 
requested for Electric vehicles (EVs) and charging 
infrastructure, while only 21 million is being requested to 
assist these volunteer fire departments, that are vital in 
wildfire suppression, that does give me pause. And I will 
continue to advocate for more funding for programs that truly 
are able to take care of the land that the Federal Government 
has.
    We are looking at 97 percent of Nebraska's land that is 
privately owned, so when we have partnerships with our Forest 
Service, the state foresters, and local landowners, that is, to 
me extremely important in keeping that land healthy, in keeping 
that land productive.
    The Nebraska Forest Service was able to help over 1,300 
landowners receive educational or technical assistance in 2022. 
So that is over 40,000 acres that are now covered by new or 
revised forest stewardship plans, and 33,000 of those acres are 
identified as important forest research areas.
    So I was glad to be able to see the President's Budget 
request ask for a slight increase in that funding to $14 
million. As I said, my job I think is to be able to focus on 
the land, and the care of that vital resource that the Federal 
Government has control over. So I do thank you for that 
request.
    My time is up; but if I could submit a question for the 
record? Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Absolutely.
    Senator Fischer. Could you let us know how that program 
which I just referenced would help private landowners to 
develop management plans, and what you see as the importance, 
in your decisionmaking, and making that slight increase in 
funding? Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator.
    And Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member 
for holding this, what is a very important hearing. And thank 
you for being here, Chief Moore.
    Montana, we rely on access to our national forest to help 
drive a $7 billion outdoor recreation economy. It is critically 
important because it employs a lot of people. I am in 
agriculture, and I am proud of the fact that agriculture is the 
number one industry, but it could be argued and pretty 
effectively, quite frankly, the outdoor recreation is the 
number one issue, and our public lands rely on that. Our 
forests, our watersheds, the collaborative relationships with 
your agency, with partners, and responsibility to manage 
timber, that drive the economy in many towns in Montana. And we 
rely, our communities rely on your agency to protect 
watersheds, shield them for the worst impacts of wildfire, and 
I do look forward to hearing how the Forest Service are going 
to do that.
    But I want to talk a little bit about categorical 
exclusions for a second. How do you see--Congress gave you 
categorical exclusions, how do you see the Forest Service using 
those?
    Mr. Moore. We are using them quite extensively, Senator.
    Senator Tester. Okay, for?
    Mr. Moore. Well, a range of projects. Whether it is 
primarily within the timber arena, we are certainly using 
categorical exclusions there. We also have the ability to look 
at, particularly where we have the emergency landscapes, to use 
some of the emergency authorities that had been granted to us. 
So the Secretary has given me the authority as Chief, to look 
at using the emergency authorities on projects within those 
high fire; firesheds.
    Senator Tester. So I would say, by your description you 
gave right now, that would be Congressional intent. That is how 
I believe categorical exclusions should be used too.
    Unfortunately, and I do say ``unfortunately'' with the 
strongest of terms, a categorical exclusion was used not to cut 
trees, or not to prevent forest fires, but to allow a 
corporation to set up in our forested lands, in our national 
forests, a facility that would include a lot of potential 
devastating impacts. And it was done using the categorical 
exclusion, which means no public input. Could you tell me why 
that was done that way?
    Mr. Moore. Well, categorical exclusion doesn't mean there 
is no public input, categorical exclusion means that generally, 
that the issues are not of a significant nature to warrant an 
environmental assessment, an EA or an environmental impact 
statement
    Senator Tester. A very good point. They didn't think it 
would have to have an environmental impact and what criteria 
did they use on that, to allow a corporation to come into 
Montana to set up and this was in the Seeley area--to set up a 
huge recreation resort, and I can tell you, unequivocally, the 
people were not heard and decisions were made by the Forest 
Service, by folks on the ground, without taking public input.
    And if the people wouldn't have stood up and said: Foul, 
this is baloney, this project would have been built. Using a 
categorical exclusion, by the way, that was meant for cutting 
trees not for recreational purposes, at least that is why I 
believe a categorical exclusion was put in.
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, I will look into this and get back 
with you. But you can use category exclusion for more than just 
cutting trees.
    Senator Tester. I got you.
    Mr. Moore. Okay.
    Senator Tester. The question is: Is that Congressional 
intent? And I am going to tell you that I would never, ever, 
ever have voted for a categorical exclusion for the purpose of 
making some corporation rich off our public lands, never 
happen, never going to happen. But if you want to use it to 
protect the community due to wildfire, now that is why you have 
a categorical exclusion.
    And that is the point I am trying to make here, is that I 
think--I will be honest with you, I am not saying it was you, 
but you are the boss, so you have got to take the heat for 
everybody below you. But I think somebody said they found a 
loophole here, and they cut a deal. And the Government should 
never be cutting a deal. They should be listening to the people 
on the ground, because it is really important, especially, in a 
state like Montana, where our national forests are so 
critically important to our economy in a number of different 
ways, both Recreation and through wood products.
    And so I want you to go out and find out. This has been 
something that has given Government a bad name. And it is in 
the Forest Service's lap, and folks need to step up and say 
look--and I think they have, but not without--it would never 
happen without incredible public input, letters to the editor, 
town hall public meetings. Where, by the way, Democrats, 
Republicans, and Independents. I mean the Forest Service did a 
great job uniting these folks, which is good we need--we have 
got too much division in this country, but this isn't how we 
should be doing it. Okay? And that is the point I am trying to 
make.
    So I appreciate you look into this, hold people 
accountable, make sure that the folks that are on the ground 
are listing to people on the ground because it is really 
important.
    Now, I want to talk a little bit about fuel mitigation and 
priority landscapes, which we are spending hundreds of millions 
of through IGA to proactively address the wildfire crisis 
because of climate change, it truly is a crisis. I mean, we 
have got beetle-killed trees, we have got longer and more 
intense fire seasons. And I appreciate the work that you are 
doing in the Kootenai, but at the end of the day we have got 
tremendous need for hazardous fuel treatments to protect 
wildland, urban interface, transmission lines, and municipal 
watersheds.
    And I would ask that that how were Montana landscapes, with 
significant Bowie municipal watersheds, and standing dead trees 
bypassed in this process, because they were bypassed? So how 
could that happen?
    Mr. Moore. So they were not bypassed. And this is not the 
only opportunity that we have to do work in Montana.
    Senator Tester. Yes.
    Mr. Moore. We are doing a lot of work in Montana.
    Senator Tester. Yes.
    Mr. Moore. We will continue to do work in Montana, Senator, 
and we just don't have, as good as the budget is, we don't have 
the amount of money to go around to everyone, and do all of the 
work that is really needed. And I would agree with you, 
Montana, but so many other communities, has so much work and so 
many areas that need attention.
    And while I would hate to ever say that we can't get 
everywhere, Senator, we can't go everywhere, but we are going 
to try. We are paying attention to Montana. We are doing a lot 
of work in Montana.
    Senator Tester. So I would just say this. The Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Bill that the Ranking Member and I helped write, 
with eight other people, gave significant money to the Forest 
Service. And for the forest in Montana, and we have many of 
them, and you are intimately familiar with them to be bypassed 
in this last round is--of IIJ dollars, does not does not make a 
lot of sense to me, quite frankly, but I have got, you know, 
this is, I am looking at it from a Montana point of view.
    But I would just tell you, I look forward to working with 
you, and the Kootenai, and Basin Creek, and all sorts of other 
places, to get more hazardous fuel reduction, because I think 
it is critically important. We have got too many dead trees.
    I want to thank the Chairman for letting me go over. Thank 
you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much, Senator Tester. And a 
lot of your forest issues are similar to what we have 
throughout the West, including Oregon.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chief, I want to discuss the issue of opportunity between 
the Forest Service and many of our tribes, specific to tribal 
co-management. As you are aware, we had the this blueprint for 
Southeast Alaska that was developed a couple years ago, issued 
actually April of 2021, but it had a lot of actionable 
priorities, including some strategies to extend to the 19 
tribes in the region more decisionmaking through tribal 
management and co-management opportunities, specifically to 638 
contracts.
    We are looking at the Farm Bill, moving forward and 
different initiatives within that measure right now. But we 
have got a situation with regards to opportunities with 638 
contracts that we may need to address some of the language.
    In the 2018 Farm Bill it authorized the use of Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act's Agreement, the 638 
ISDEAA, for a few projects under the Tribal Forest Protection 
Act, but under this Act tribes are restricted to contracting 
only for projects on Federal lands that quote, ``Border or are 
adjacent to the Indian forest or rangeland.''
    So of course, this doesn't work in Alaska, and it is also 
restrictive in the Lower 48. We have got folks in Alaska, 
again, that are interested in this. We are going to have a 
hearing in Indian Affairs this afternoon, it is a roundtable on 
Farm Bill. But one of the witnesses there, Richard Peterson, 
who is the President of Tlingit & Haida, Central Council, is 
going to be speaking specifically to how the 638 Authorities 
will be important for workforce development, for food security, 
for increased economic opportunities. They are looking specific 
to what can be done with regards to tribal management there at 
Mendenhall Glacier.
    So there is a lot of interest in this, but we have heard 
that the 638 contracting needs to be broadened, as well as 
including some technical assistance. Can you speak to this 
issue on whether or not you see this as an opportunity?
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, you described it accurately in terms 
of what the concerns are, and what the issues are under the 
2018 Farm Bill. And we will be more than happy to work with you 
on this issue, looking at a potential new Farm Bill.
    Senator Murkowski. So do you think then that we need to 
address this language that limits it to these Federal lands 
that are either bordering or adjacent to, because it is not 
just Alaska, it would be throughout the Lower 48, where you 
have got some challenges there.
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. Senator, I think the word that was used 
specifically there, is that they would have to have trust lands 
that are adjacent to or border national forest, and since my 
understanding, with the exception of one tribe, there are no 
trust lands in Alaska. So as you look at the new Farm Bill that 
is where we would be happy to work with you going forward on 
this issue.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. So maybe you can work with us on 
some of this TA that we are looking for?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. I appreciate that. Let me ask, 
back to Southeast here, as you know, pretty much that entire 
region is, thankfully, powered by hydropower, it helps with 
offsetting some of the other high costs that they have right 
there, but hydropower projects in the region are hard to 
develop of course the Roadless Rule makes it even more 
difficult.
    One example is Thayer Creek. This is a hydro project that 
needs limited road development that relies on rights-of-way 
granted by the Forest Service to access the project, so what we 
have got going now, is we have got state and Federal highway 
funding that is available for the road development, but the 
funds can't be used for roads with controlled access, which is 
the very condition that Forest Service requires in order to 
grant the necessary right-of-way.
    So it puts everything at an impasse. We need some help 
working through this because obviously you want to be able to 
have these--I mean these are very small hydro projects which 
are able to take communities off of their present power 
generation which is diesel, which is nobody's alternative.
    Mr. Moore. Right.
    Senator Murkowski. But yet we have got this impasse. So I 
don't know, again, if you can give me somebody to help us 
through this. But if we are going to be looking at a situation 
where the Roadless Rule is going to be this wet blanket on top 
of us, we can't be in a situation where we have got an impasse 
like this; would you agree?
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. I certainly would agree. And I can give 
you someone to work with, as we work through that. And let me 
say, too though, we recognize that with the Federal lands that 
is in Alaska that we need to be working across the aisles to 
make sure that Alaskans have the necessary way of life, if you 
will, to exist.
    And so we will look into that. I will give you a point 
person to work with, or your staff, and we will see what 
opportunities we may have to pursue.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. Well, we don't want a project like 
that to be the poster child for what most would look at and 
say: There is a common sense, straightforward solution here to 
getting communities off diesel power generation. And it is our 
own policies that are blocking or impeding that.
    As we are talking about opportunities within southeast, we 
have got one project there that, again, kind of defies 
understanding as to why we can't advance something as small as 
this. The Hoonah Indian Association, working with the 
Southeast--excuse me--the Sustainable Southeast Partnership, 
and this is exactly what these things are designed to do. They 
have they have got this idea that they can take the Icy 
Strait's Lumber Mill, a small, little lumber mill to handle 
young growth to establish locally sourced lumber for housing, 
and a housing manufacture facility there in Hoonah.
    So super-small scale, but basically designed to get a 
little bit of product to meet the housing issues that the 
Chairman has noted, are just very, very problematic, and 
certainly within this region.
    The bipartisan Infrastructure Bill provided 400 million for 
financial assistance to facilities that use ecosystem 
restoration byproducts. It is exactly what we are talking about 
here. So I am not asking you to put your finger on the scale, 
but projects like what we are talking about in Hoonah, the Icy 
Strait's project would seem to me are just tailor-made for what 
we are talking about with that program.
    So I am hoping that Forest Service could potentially look 
to projects like this. And again, if what we are trying to 
address are some of the housing needs in the area we have the 
opportunity for a locally sourced product there.
    What more can we be doing working with Forest Service and 
USDA for projects just like this? It is not only the housing it 
is the jobs that come associated with a small mill project like 
this?
    Mr. Moore. You know, Senator, while I am not familiar with 
this particular project, I am familiar, and I am aware that 
there are many small communities, particularly small rural 
communities in Alaska, that is having challenges to affordable 
housing. And the conversation that you are bringing is one that 
I think we need to have.
    You know, what are the opportunities we have to really 
address this whole affordable housing issue? And while I don't 
have the answers yet, I would be keenly interested in working 
with you, or your staff, to see what flexibility we might have 
to look at addressing this issue, because I think that if we 
can come up with a solution, it is a more widespread than 
Alaska.
    So I am very interested in seeing what is possible. And if 
we can move the dial a little bit on this issue, I am in for it 
100 percent.
    Senator Murkowski. Mr. Chairman, I have I have two more 
quick ones. But I will defer to you if you are going to go 
forward with more rounds.
    Senator Merkley. I will go ahead and do my final two.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. Go ahead.
    Senator Merkley. And I will turn it back to you.
    So Chief Moore, the budget proposes to move the Hazardous 
Fuels Program from the National Forest System Account to the 
Wildland Fire Management Account, and yet if I turn the clock 
back a few years, the request was the reverse. And given that 
year-round wildfire is becoming the norm, it is difficult to 
understand how fuels projects would be completed if 
firefighters are routinely called up for wildfire duty. Can you 
just comment on this philosophical change, that would be 
involving returning the fuels line to wildland fire management?
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, I think, you know, you are you are 
hitting on something that puzzles me as well. We have gone back 
and forth on this issue, and each time we have gone back and 
forth we have had really good rationale for making that 
decision, and I do believe that no matter which way you go 
here, if that is a good rationale for it.
    One of the things that I support is putting it back into 
the NFS side, because when you look at prescribed burning as an 
example, it is about more than just the firefighters. We have a 
large militia part of the workforce that are qualified and 
certified to do the different fire activities. And so I think 
we have to look at: how do we continue to cross integrate all 
of our employees into an area that we are trying to increase a 
lot of growth in? That is prescribed burning.
    When we look at the Wildfire Crisis Strategy we say we need 
to do a couple of things: One, we need to go in and do a lot of 
forest thinning, and after the thinning we need to run a 
prescribed burn through it. The Bootleg Fire is one of those 
examples where we hold up as a model for how we should treat 
the landscape to really get at this wildfire crisis issue.
    And I don't know if you have seen the poster, or not, but 
it is three, and it is a really good display of the different 
treatment methods, or versus non-treatment methods, what helps 
us most is our, what we call ADs Administrative Determined 
employees. But also our non-firefighter workforce who has a lot 
of skill sets to make that happen
    Senator Merkley. Well, I can see the argument both ways, 
and we will continue in that discussion. Certainly, the idea 
that many folks do, it is appropriate for them to move into 
forest management work when they are not fighting fires. It is 
just one direction, your point, that these are two separate 
functions. One, and sometimes separate training in which you 
are doing the work to prevent fires versus fighting fires is 
the other, and it is clear that that argument is going back and 
forth.
    Northwest Forest Plan Revisions. I understand the Forest 
Service intends to establish a Federal Advisory Committee to 
advise and recommend revisions of the current management plan. 
And we were asked to nominate individuals. I have nominated 
several. Can you tell me when the committee will be formally 
seated to begin work on this important planning process?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, we have just finished up our part of that 
nomination, and we sent it over to the Secretary's Office for 
him to make the final decision.
    Senator Merkley. Great. Thank you.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I had mentioned in my last question there, Chief, the 
Southeast Alaska Sustainable Strategy, $25 million spent so far 
and, it is always described as quote, ``An initial 
investment''. So I don't know if you have any update for me on 
what more might be included. Will those funds be targeted 
towards long-term economic sustainability?
    It kind of ties into my question about the Hoonah modular 
housing and manufactured Lumber proposal. You know, maybe 
something like this, again, could be part of what you are 
thinking about in terms of the Southeast Alaska Sustainable 
Strategy (SASS).
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. I don't have any information at this 
point, Senator. But I would be happy to follow up with you to 
go into a little bit more specifics on the SASS.
    Senator Murkowski. Right. I would look forward to that. I 
had an opportunity to meet with some folks from the Southeast 
Alaska Economic Council, and part of Alaska Municipal League 
(AML), talking about exactly, the initiatives that would be 
available through the Sustainability Strategy.
    So there is a lot of interest in knowing: All right, what 
comes next? Because if what you are saying is that you are 
going to take the entire Tongass off limits when it comes to 
economic activity because of application of the Roadless Rule, 
and you are saying $25 million is it. If we are talking initial 
investment which is what the administration had indicated, then 
let us talk about what comes after the initial investment. So I 
would like to have more conversation with your team about that.
    I do want to thank you for your assistance in finalizing 
the Chugach Region Land Study, appreciate that. As always, 
there is always one more thing to do after that, so I am hoping 
that we can count on the same kind of can-do working 
relationship on the Chugach land, exchange proposal, it may end 
up requiring legislation.
    The hope is that we can reach agreement on the contours of 
the exchange in the coming year. So I would just really ask for 
your commitment to work with me and Chugach to make this a 
reality.
    Mr. Moore. Absolutely, yes.
    Senator Murkowski. Good, I thank you for that. And then a 
project that I have been interested in and believe me there is 
a lot of excitement about the prospects for the Alaska Long 
Trail. This is a 500-mile trail to connect between Seward and 
Fairbanks, a portion, includes the Southern Trek of the 
Iditarod in the Chugach.
    But a lot of our small communities are excited about this. 
The businesses that depend on tourism and outdoor recreation 
are excited about that. So as we do have portions of the trail 
that cross Forest Service lands, just looking for a commitment 
to work with me to maintain and improve the recreation 
opportunities within this exciting project.
    Mr. Moore. Yes. We are committed to working with you, and 
particularly looking at improving recreational opportunities.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. And then last point is the things 
for what we are doing there, particularly in the Tongass, but 
the Chugach as well, with regards to public use of cabins; 
again, very, very popular in the region. This came to my 
attention because the cabins were being destroyed, or removed 
if they needed maintenance, instead of allowing for a more 
cooperative effort.
    So the $20 million that was included within the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Bill is important. I am hoping that you are 
going to be able to provide us a little bit more of a plan, a 
detailed plan so we can share with people in the region what 
the status of those public-use cabins will be going forward?
    Mr. Moore. Yes. We will be happy to provide that to you.
    Senator Murkowski. Good, thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator.
    And thank you, Chief Moore. Obviously a lot of 
responsibilities that end up affecting many different 
communities, and many different forests, and look forward to 
continuing the partnership and working with you and your team. 
Any final comments you would like to make?
    Oh, well. Here we are seconds from the gavel which was just 
coming down.
    Senator Hoeven. He thought he was safe.
    Senator Merkley. Well, Senator, we will turn it over to 
you.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I know the 
Chief thought he was in great shape, all done. I know he had 
mastered all the questions just right. But one of the things I 
want to start with.
    And please--thank you, Mr. Chairman; and Ranking Member for 
allowing me to ask my questions.
    We are unique in terms of the Forest Service, and then we 
have the grasslands in North Dakota, and it is very important 
that you come out and see them because--just to get an 
understanding, because it is different than traditional forest, 
obviously. But also I think it is incredibly important for the 
people that live, and work, and ranch out there, and because we 
have the multiple uses out there, everything from, you know, of 
course ranching, but also incredible energy development, like 
the Ranking Member is very involved with, but also tourism, and 
other things as well.
    So I would like to ask you to work with us to bring you out 
to--of course now it is spring--so you know, we haven't quite 
gotten rid of winter yet, but we are getting to a real nice 
time of year. And I would very much like you to come out. And 
it is not only important in terms of your understanding of the 
grasslands, but also they the folks out there need to see you.
    Mr. Moore. Yeah.
    Senator Hoeven. And know that you are finding out what is 
going on, and listening to them. So that is kind of a long 
invitation, but I would like you to come out to North Dakota, 
and spend some time in the grasslands.
    Mr. Moore. Senator, can I say that I would love to come out 
to North Dakota. And you might be pleased to know that I used 
to live in North Dakota.
    Senator Hoeven. No way. Did you say that to every member, 
that you used to live in their state?
    Mr. Moore. I started my career in North Dakota, in 
Dickinson, Lakota, lived that whole area. So I contoured North 
Dakota. I was just out there about six weeks ago as well.
    Senator Hoeven. Oh; fantastic.
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. But I am very fond of North Dakota. It 
used to be my home.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, that is great. Then, you know how to 
get there, and you will be welcomed. And it really is important 
that, it makes such a difference in terms of the folks that 
live and work out there, as you know, having been out there.
    One of the things that we worked on is, we have really 
worked to secure some funding and find ways to bring the 
grazing associations together with the counties and the 
townships, and your folks, the Forest Service folks, the State 
of North Dakota, in an effort to make improvements out there.
    And that is a bit of a challenge, because some folks want 
improvements for ranching, some folks want improvements for 
tourism. And you know, so there is a natural tug and pull 
there. And we have set up a working committee to kind of 
oversee some of the funding that we have put together for that 
which includes both Federal, state, and local funding. And so 
are you willing to commit to work with us on that?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, I am; absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Good. And so that that just dovetails very 
well with a trip out there.
    Staffing, how are you doing on your--I know you have real 
challenges on staffing--how are you doing there? How can we be 
helpful?
    Mr. Moore. So you know, it is a really great question. I 
will give you an ideal of the staff. And last year we hired 
about 3,500 employees, but we lost 2,700 through attrition. And 
so all of that hiring we did only netted about 800 in terms of 
capacity. And so we are seeing that, we don't know how much of 
a trend that is, but we are going back out again to advertise 
for about 2,500 additional employees to see if we can't look at 
getting our capacity up to really look at implementing the 
Wildfire Crisis Strategy, but also to look at, say, implement 
other parts of the program like, Great American Outdoor Act 
Funds, as well as IRA and BIL Funds.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. And you feel you are going to make 
some progress?
    Mr. Moore. I do feel that we will make progress. Yes.
    Senator Hoeven. The other thing I want to ask you, the 
Joint Chiefs Program. So Senator Bennett and I, on a bipartisan 
basis, have legislation, and it really provides for this 
coordination, I think out there. And in respect of fire, for 
example, as well as, the landscape restoration, actually we 
called our legislation the Joint Chiefs' Landscape Restoration 
Partnership Act, but again it is about, you know, a kind of a 
joint effort out there. Because again, there is different 
ideas, in terms of, if you are really tourism focused in some 
of those groups they want a certain approach, and then our 
grazers need another approach.
    And so that was really the effort behind the Joint Chiefs' 
Legislation that Bennett and I have. So talk a little bit how 
that works, and particularly in regard to fire resilience, as 
well as the, you know, the landscape restoration, and 
maintenance, and so forth.
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. So I will start by saying that Secretary 
Vilsack has insisted that USDA operate as one, that fits quite 
nicely with the Joint Chiefs' projects, my colleague, Chief 
Cosby, for NRCS, and I, we have regular meetings to look at 
opportunities to have Joint Chief projects.
    So we just looked at a round of projects just not too long 
ago to fund, and I don't have, at my fingertips, the number of 
projects or the location of them yet, but we do feel that this 
is an opportunity to really work across boundaries, to look at 
both Federal, state, and private lands trying to improve the 
work, that particularly those areas have been affected by fire, 
or disease, and insects for some of those types of problems.
    Senator Hoeven. And you would be supportive of 
reauthorization of the Joint Chiefs' Program in the Farm Bill?
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Hoeven. And the other thing we do a lot of, is we 
were doing a lot with unmanned aerial systems, unmanned, and so 
in terms of, you know, the grasslands, fire suppression, fire 
management, any thoughts on you using some of that new 
technology? But then also, are you really committed to work 
again with the ranchers out there, because the control burns, 
and that kind of thing can be a real problem if you are not 
coordinating closely. And you know, most of the emergency 
response out there is volunteer.
    Mr. Moore. Yeah. So we are really moving into using the 
drones for a lot of different purposes, fire is one of those 
purposes. But just looking at natural resource management, we 
are looking at how can we use drones more? We currently have 
about 100 employees that have been certified for drones, and we 
are going to continue to look in that arena, and to expand our 
opportunities to utilize that type of equipment. We do believe 
that that is the future, and we really want to lean into it.
    Senator Hoeven. And close coordination with the people on 
the land out there on fire management?
    Mr. Moore. Absolutely, close coordination.
    Senator Hoeven. Thanks, Chief, appreciate it very much. And 
again, Thank to the Chairman and Ranking Member.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator. You timed it just 
perfectly.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    If there are no other statements, and I don't think there 
are, the hearing record will be open until the close of 
business on April 5th, 2023.
    Thank you very much, Chief Moore.

     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
                  APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              


                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 2023

                         DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

STATEMENT OF HON. DEB HAALAND, SECRETARY

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY

    Senator Merkley. The Interior Subcommittee of the Committee 
on Appropriations will come to order. This hearing is titled, A 
Review of the fiscal year 2024 President's Budget for the 
Department of the Interior. And we are most privileged to have 
with us today Secretary Haaland, welcome.
    And we have with her also the Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget, Joan Mooney, 
welcome. And also, the Department's Director of Budget, Denise 
Flanagan. So, welcome to you. Today's hearing will review the 
Department of Interior's fiscal year 2024 budget request.
    As I commented at our first hearing, I fully support Chair 
Murray and Vice Chair Collins in their resolve to move 
appropriation bills through committee and onto the floor this 
year. And I appreciate the aggressive schedule that they have 
laid out with that goal in mind and look forward to getting to 
work with my partner in this effort, Ranking Member Senator 
Murkowski.
    We must recognize as a Congress that non-defense funding is 
just as important as defense spending. Non-defense funding 
means investing in Americans, investing in childcare, in 
housing, in transportation infrastructure. And in this 
subcommittee, it means supporting tribal Governments, 
preventing catastrophic wildfire, protecting our land and 
waters from pollution and degradation. Madam Secretary, thank 
you so much for journeying to Oregon two weeks ago.
    It seems like longer, but we had quite an opportunity to 
travel around the State. And you took the time not just to 
travel, but to listen to various communities within Oregon and 
the challenges they face.
    It was very meaningful. Thank you for taking that trip. It 
was fitting that, as we began our travels through the ancestral 
homeland of many tribes, you visited with Oregon's tribal 
leaders, leaders of tribal bands that struggled to survive a 
century of devastating national policies and wars.
    You listened to their concerns about public safety and 
housing and health care and water infrastructure and heard how 
their traditional ecological knowledge influences the tribe's 
modern practices in forest management and land conservation, 
and how it can inform better policies across the State of 
Oregon and across the country.
    Your position as the first Native American Cabinet 
Secretary is historic, but the time that you took to make 
personal connections with the community, including a special 
session with the Klamath tribal community, was absolutely 
inspiring and made a big impact on all present.
    You also met with Oregon leaders in outdoor recreation to 
discuss improving access to our Federal lands and outdoor 
recreation as an economic driver. Outdoor recreation is indeed 
an economic force in Oregon, generating $13 billion in our 
economy. You took the opportunity to visit two of Oregon 
special places, Crater Lake National Park, the deepest lake in 
North America, and a reminder of the extraordinary power of the 
Cascade volcanoes.
    And you visited the Cascade Siskiyou National Monument, 
where because of its location at the crossroads of the Cascade, 
Klamath and Siskiyou Ranges, the monument is an ecological 
wonder and absolutely deserving and needing protection.
    It is a product of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a 
critical tool for creating pathways to protect habitat for 
animals moving between these mountain systems such as deer, 
elk, bear, cougar, foxes, and so forth. And over 100 different 
butterflies in that monument, which is an indication of the 
extraordinary diversity of those different ecosystems, 
including the Great Basin that comes in there. And so, the 
monument will increase public access, but we have to work to 
make it so, and we heard a lot of suggestions on how to make 
that happen. I appreciate the Interior Department's work on the 
revised monument plan, the management plan for the monument, 
and the scheduled completion by October of 2024. I certainly 
urge, if anything, earlier, if possible.
    One of the aspects of that planning will be wildfire risk 
reduction. Wildfires are having such a big impact on our 
natural lands and our communities, and Congress has provided 
significant funding for wildfire risk reduction.
    One of my goals, and I think it is shared by Senator 
Murkowski, is that we invest on both ends on making our forests 
healthier and more fire resilient on the front end with forest 
management, and also investing to make sure we have the 
resources to fight the fires on public lands as needed because 
our fire season is longer, hotter, and more savage.
    The funding was provided for this effort in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act and in our 
annual appropriation bills. But the Interior Department is 
charged with making sure the funding is spent in the right 
places. And one of the things that I wanted to just mention is 
that the Rogue Valley is the highest risk fire shed in the 
State of Oregon.
    It desperately needs those investments from the Department, 
and I will certainly be working with you towards that goal. A 
factor aggravating the ferocity of these fires is climate 
chaos, longer, hotter fire seasons, smaller average snowpacks 
that affect the size and temperature of our streams and rivers.
    It has a big impact, with smaller, warmer streams hurting 
our trout and or our salmon, and it means a lot less water for 
our ranchers, a lot less water for our farmers, and that has 
just been a huge challenge in multiple regions suffering multi-
year droughts. And I wanted to show a picture from our visit to 
Crater Lake.
    We met with two volunteer park rangers, and I must say, 
being assigned, and you get these volunteer park rangers work 
for a period of several months, 3 months at a time, and they 
have housing and food covered and work every day and have a 
phenomenal experience.
    I was kind of envious of their jobs. And this is a picture 
of Ellie Paxson, and she was joined in a presentation by Cassie 
Padula.
    They both were incredibly knowledgeable about the ecosystem 
of Crater Lake and about the impact of climate change, and 
pointed out many of the changes that we could observe just from 
where we were standing.

[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    And then Ellie provided this chart, which is an indication, 
and I have seen many, that the average snowpack in the Cascades 
is dropping decade after decade, which is why we are having 
troubles with our streams and with our irrigation water.
    And she really dramatized it with this chart that I had not 
seen before, where 90 years ago the average snowfall over the 
decade was 614 inches, and it just drops decade after decade 
after decade. We are down to now about 370 inches or 
approaching half of what it was 90 years ago.
    And that amount of water stored, and when we think about 
some--well, we are looking at 240 inches lost. That is 20 feet 
of snow, 20 feet of water stored that isn't there now that was 
there before. And, of course, the IPCC report paints an even 
bleaker picture of the challenges worldwide.
    So, it is so important that we quickly and dramatically 
pivot from a fossil fuel energy economy to a renewable energy 
economy. I am disappointed that the Administration has issued 
new leases for oil and gas or new projects, because it is so 
important as we try to tackle this challenge that America lead 
the way. And to lead the way, we have to have the power of our 
example.
    And we also need to be thoughtful about how we build out 
the new energy economy. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 
BOEM, it has a top-down process, and this is really a difficult 
system for offshore wind because off the coast of Oregon, we 
have all of these stakeholder communities. We have folks who 
are trawling for groundfish, for whiting, for salmon, and for 
shrimp.
    We have a robust crab industry. And the concept of floating 
turbines, which may end up being a huge contributor to 
renewable energy, is untested and not well understood. And we 
are being told that the anchors will have a 7 to 1 ratio, which 
means if you go a mile deep in the ocean, you have a seven-
mile-long anchor.
    How does that affect all these other industries? These 
other industries are absolutely terrified. And we don't have 
transparency. We don't have an understanding of the technology, 
and how to make these various pieces fit cleanly together.
    And so, my argument here is, let's have a process that 
develops a full understanding of what those floating wind 
turbines would look like and how to make them completely 
compatible and in partnership with the existing stakeholders on 
our offshore or sea life stakeholders.
    So, appreciate any help you can give to develop a better, 
more collaborative approach in that regard. Again, thank you 
for your deep concern for our public lands, how to make them 
accessible, how to protect them for the next generation.
    And, I know you are working every moment of every day 
towards that goal. Let me turn to the Ranking Member of the 
subcommittee, Senator Murkowski.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. 
And good morning, Madam Secretary, to you and to your team. I 
join Senator Merkley, the chairman here, in welcoming you back 
to the committee.
    I am pleased to have the opportunity this morning to 
discuss the President's budget request, along with some of the 
issues that are very important to me and to my State. And to 
begin with, I will begin with a topic that you and I have 
shared conversation on most recently.
    Just last week, you have heard me express my deep, deep 
frustration and concern with regards to the people of King Cove 
and the fact that they lack a lifesaving road. And Madam 
Secretary, I want to acknowledge first the appreciation that I 
have that you and your team joined me in King Cove last year so 
you could not only see, but you could hear directly from the 
people there.
    You could hear their concern, try to walk in their shoes 
for a brief moment in time. I also acknowledge the fact that 
your Deputy Secretary and Rayna Thiele, I believe, are out 
there. If not today, they were out there this week. In 
fairness, I hadn't heard what the weather was like and whether 
they have made it in and out.
    But I know that this was an effort for them to do follow 
on, to have further discussion. But as you know, the 
announcement that was made last week to withdraw from the 
litigation was shocking to the people of King Cove, and I 
appreciate the fact that you had a direct conversation by Zoom 
with them.
    I have had subsequent conversations and I will share with 
you, they are somewhat confused. They don't know who to believe 
anymore. That is the problem. And I think part of this stems to 
a lack of trust.
    A lack of promises made and promises unfulfilled. A little 
bit of a pulling the rug out from underneath us. Lucy and the 
football, take your analogy, but a concern that once again this 
might not be anything more than a false promise and that 
deeply, deeply concerns them because they need action that 
helps solve problems, not actions that further delay solutions. 
They need to be respected for the care that they have shown to 
their lands, and I think you heard that. You saw that.
    They need to have these medevacs as nothing more than a 
memory, not a life-threatening reality in times of crisis. And 
Madam Secretary, I use the word to you in our private meeting, 
and I will repeat it here at this hearing, they need you to be 
a warrior for them. They need to know that you recognize the 
long-standing suffering that they have faced and that you will 
stand with them to work with them.
    And I take you at your word that you were prepared to do 
this for this community. But know the reservation that they 
have. I will have an opportunity to ask a question in more 
detail about that, but I do want to acknowledge the voices of 
some extraordinary, extraordinary coalition of Alaska native 
leaders and the individuals that came together to make their 
voices heard about the importance of the reapproval of the 
Willow Project, not only to those who work and raise their 
families on the North Slope of Alaska, but to our nation's 
economic security, our energy security, and our national 
security.
    And I am so very grateful and appreciative that the 
President listened to the voices of those Alaskans and took 
another step towards making this project in the National 
Petroleum Reserve a reality.
    Now, unfortunately, those who are disappointed in this 
decision are going to try to mire the project down in the 
courts in an attempt to prevent production, but it is my hope 
that this environmentally sound and balanced domestic project 
will not be delayed too much longer. I truly believe our 
national security requires that we increase our domestic supply 
of resource, including from our offshore areas.
    And speaking to that, I would like to raise the recently 
leaked memo regarding the Cook Inlet Outer Continental Shelf 
lease sale that was required by the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Mr. Chairman, we are going to submit a copy of that memorandum 
for the record.
    [The information follows:]

https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23695673/doi-0001.pdf


    Senator Merkley. Without objection.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Like many of my colleagues, I 
was dismayed. I was really actually stunned by the 
recommendations that were contained in that leaked memo and the 
direction that it represents for this Administration when it 
relates to energy policy. According to the memo, Principal 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Lands and Mineral Management 
signed off on a plan that rejected the option that would have 
improved energy reliability and affordability for Alaskans.
    This was stated in the memo, in favor of an alternative 
that was admittedly aimed at discouraging development. Admits 
that that was the intended purpose here. This obviously 
represents the exact wrong direction for Alaska, certainly the 
wrong direction for a country. And when you think about the 
message that it sends about this Administration's desire for 
energy security, again, it is almost mind boggling to me.
    Right now, within the South-Central area that relies on 
natural gas to keep our lights on, to keep the economy moving 
here, we are looking at a situation where the region that hosts 
about one half the population of the State of Alaska is looking 
at brownouts as a reality of diminishing supplies there in Cook 
Inlet.
    And the thought that we may be importing LNG from Canada. 
To me, as an Alaskan, from a State that has extraordinary 
natural gas reserves, the fact that we would even be uttering 
these words is almost inconceivable to me.
    A failure to have meaningful oil and gas programs, 
including in the 1002 area where the Administration is 
illegally disregarding the law, will reduce domestic investment 
at the worst possible time for our country and our global 
allies.
    Domestic supply matters to our energy security and also 
matters to our mineral security. And I have long pointed to the 
dangers of our growing dependence on foreign minerals and 
advocated for a strong domestic supply for our national 
security, economy, and competitiveness.
    Like offshore oil and gas, one of the keys to permitting 
this challenge is for the Department to actually make mine 
permit determinations in a timely manner. If we want to be 
competitive in the global market, a producer and not just an 
importer, we cannot afford for it to take 10 years to permit a 
mine on our public lands. Alaska is willing and able to 
increase our Nation's and our allies energy security.
    All we need is permission from the Federal Government, 
access to our Federal lands, and the timely approval of our 
permit applications. And when we do get those approvals, 
Alaskans, we get it. We cherish, we respect our lands, our 
waters, while developing these resources and doing it in a 
responsible manner.
    So, to turn to other areas here and certainly areas the 
chairman has noted we have agreement on, and that's working 
together to provide resources for our tribal communities. Our 
subcommittee plans to have a hearing with Assistant Secretary 
for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland and IHS Director Tso regarding 
tribal programs where I am going to go in-depth on our shared 
tribal commitments.
    But I do also want to join the Chairman in thanking you for 
your efforts on behalf of tribes. Whether it is public safety 
and justice, natural resources, or construction programs, 
working to address the tribal needs has always been a 
bipartisan, bicameral priority. We know that the appropriations 
process is never easy.
    It is never quick, that is for sure. But it is important 
for us to continue our bipartisan approach to these issues to 
ensure success across Indian country. Public lands, certainly a 
key attraction for visitors to Alaska and drivers of economic 
activity. And while we have not seen a complete return to pre-
COVID tourism numbers, visitation is certainly increasing.
    I am pleased the Department is working to get Alaska's 
national parks and preserves ready to welcome visitors this 
summer. But our parks are far more than playgrounds. They are 
set aside for harvesting wildlife as laid out in Alaska 
National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), and the 
Department is improperly trying to interfere with subsistence 
hunting practices.
    So, these are just a few of the issues that are on my mind 
this morning as they relate to Alaska, but we have of course, 
broader and shared interests at the national level. Madam 
Secretary, I do appreciate your willingness to work with me on 
areas that we have agreement.
    As you continue to hear from and listen to Alaskans, I hope 
that we can even find greater areas of how we can be working 
together to grow Alaska's role in our nation's economy or 
energy or mineral security, while also cherishing and 
protecting our lands, our people, and our culture.
    So, again, look forward to the questions this morning. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Madam Secretary, the floor is yours.

                 SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON. DEB HAALAND

    Secretary Haaland. Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, 
and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity 
to testify in support of Interior's fiscal year 2024 budget 
request. Our 2024 budget totals $18.9 billion in current 
authority, an increase of $2 billion from the 2023 level.
    First, I want to highlight several important proposals. 
These include significant reforms to support the wildland fire 
workforce. Mandatory funding for future Indian water rights 
settlements, expanding good neighbor and stewardship 
contracting authorities to include Fish and Wildlife Service 
and National Park Service, reclassifying legally required 
tribal sovereignty payments, contracts, and leasing costs from 
discretionary to mandatory funding, and $6.5 billion over 20 
years from the Department of State to fund economic assistance 
under the Compacts of Free Association.
    Let me begin with our Indian Affairs budget request. This 
Administration has made a steadfast commitment to strengthen 
Government to Government relations with our country's Indian 
tribes. With a total request of $4.7 billion for Indian affairs 
programs, investments will address missing and murdered 
indigenous peoples, the legacy of Federal Indian boarding 
schools, and the native language revitalization.
    Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget includes $48 million 
for the Tribal Climate Resilience Program to support climate 
resilience planning, including relocation. In response to 
concerns by tribal leaders for public safety in their 
communities, the budget includes an increase of nearly $86 
million above 2023. We also request $1.6 billion for Indian 
education programs.
    Notably the 2024 request for Bureau of Indian Education 
(BIE) construction will support seven school projects. Turning 
to Wildland Fire, the 2024 budget honors President Biden's 
commitment to address this issue and to assist firefighters 
supporting an additional 370 Federal and 55 tribal fire 
personnel.
    Complementing Wildland firefighter pay reforms, we also 
include $293.3 million for fuels management activities, an 
increase of $46.3 million above 2023. These investments are 
crucial as wildfires were noticeably higher in 2022 than the 
10-year average.
    Stewardship of our natural resources is a core mission for 
us as Interior manages about 20 percent of America's lands. Our 
request covers $3.2 billion in annual funding for conservation 
efforts that supports key initiatives such as wildlife 
corridors and youth corps partnerships.
    The request also includes $140 million for Fish and 
Wildlife Service partnership programs that support voluntary 
conservation on public and private lands, which is a key focus 
of the America the Beautiful Initiative. To complement the $681 
million in mandatory funding for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, I am proud to propose $12 million in 
discretionary funding for a new tribal Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF) program, which is a top priority for 
tribes.
    At the Department, science is our foundation. The United 
States Geological Survey works with partners across the country 
to maintain 20,000 groundwater monitoring wells, 11,800 stream 
gauges and 3800 earthquake sensors and directly monitor 70 
volcanoes. The budget includes $128 million that supports nine 
regional climate adaptation science centers with university 
partners.
    We are also looking forward to the Landsat Next mission 
that will take advantage of new technologies for global imaging 
data. When it comes to energy, we are excited to be on our way 
to achieve the Administration's goals to deploy 30 gigawatts of 
offshore wind capacity by 2030. As of last month. Bureau of 
Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has conducted 11 energy lease 
sales for areas in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
    That is more than the 2.5 million acres of commercial wind 
energy lease areas. The budget includes over $64 million for 
BOEM's renewable energy program, including a $12 million 
increase for permitting. Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) is also making progress to permit 25 gigawatts of 
renewable energy on public lands by 2025.
    BLM has permitted more than 126 renewable energy projects, 
processed many more, and is willing to support much needed 
transmission lines. To meet these needs, we include $72 million 
for BLM's renewable energy program. At the end of 2020, 
Interior staffing was at a 10 year low of around 60,500.
    When fully enacted, the budget would support an increase of 
4,000 personnel to over 68,000. Regarding infrastructure, our 
request includes more than $3 billion for operations and 
maintenance. In addition, there is, $1.6 billion in mandatory 
funding available each year through 2025 through the Legacy 
Restoration Fund.
    At the end of 2023, our Legacy Restoration Fund program 
will have initiated 276 projects, touching all 50 States, 
Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Those projects will address $3.4 billion of our deferred 
maintenance backlog, creating an average of 17,000 jobs each 
year.
    Overall, the President's budget for Interior invests in 
programs to strengthen our nation for all Americans. I look 
forward to doing this work together. Thank you, and we are all 
pleased to answer any questions that you have today.
    [The statement follows:]
                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Deb Haaland
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of 
the Interior Department's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request.
    It is an honor and privilege for me to be here with you today to 
speak on behalf of the President's 2024 Budget for the Department of 
the Interior. I value and appreciate Interior's long tradition of 
working together with the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to 
accomplish great things for the American people. This Subcommittee 
plays a vital role in the success of the Department of the Interior 
(DOI). As the 118th Congress begins, I look forward to working with the 
Members of this Subcommittee this year, both new and returning, in 
continued collaboration to address some of our country's most pressing 
challenges.
    As the steward of 20 percent of America's lands, the DOI serves 
several important roles for America. Interior's programs are important 
to the Nation's economy: generating jobs, supporting local economic 
growth, building resilience to our changing climate, and man aging 
important natural resources. Interior is also charged with unique 
responsibilities and legal obligations to protect Indian trust assets 
and resources and provide direct services to federally recognized 
Tribes, Alaska Natives, and individual Indian beneficiaries to honor 
the Nation's Federal Indian trust responsibilities.
    The Department's 2024 budget totals $18.9 billion in current 
authority--an increase of $2.0 billion, or 12 percent, from the 2023 
enacted budget. For programs within the jurisdiction of this 
Subcommittee, our request is $16.9 billion in net discretionary 
authority--an increase of $2.0 billion or 13 percent from the 2023 
enacted appropriation. The net discretionary request assumes Contract 
Support Costs and 105(l) Tribal Leases are reclassified as mandatory 
funding in 2024 and are not included in the total. An additional $350.0 
million is accessible through a budget cap adjustment for wildfire 
suppression to ensure funds are available in the event the regular 
annual appropriation is inadequate to meet suppression needs. Within 
the increase for 2024, $438.5 million will be used to cover fixed-cost 
increases, such as rent and Federal salary adjustments needed to 
maintain Interior's core operations carried out by close to 70,000 
people living and working in every corner of the country.
    This budget allocates important mandatory funding available through 
the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA), including $1.6 billion for 
deferred maintenance projects through the Legacy Restoration Fund (LRF) 
in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and the Bureau of Indian Education 
(BIE). The budget also allocates $681.9 million in mandatory funding 
for Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) programs.
    The President's 2024 Budget complements the landmark investments in 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA). Those funds are providing the significant boost needed to 
address long-standing challenges, from reclaiming lands to tackling 
critical drought and threats of wildland fires. These targeted 
investments address specific objectives, but they do not supplant the 
need for the annual appropriations supporting our on- going base 
programs and operations.
                       2024 legislative proposals
    The 2024 President's Budget includes several important legislative 
proposals and technical budget adjustments.
    Wildland Firefighting Workforce--The budget proposes legislation 
and funding to implement significant reforms to better support the 
wildland fire management workforce. The Administration proposes 
legislation to establish a special base rate salary table for wildland 
firefighters, create a new premium pay category that provides some 
additional compensation for all hours a wildland fire responder is 
mobilized on an incident, and establish a pay cap that provides waiver 
authority to the Secretary using specific criteria. The budget supports 
this legislative proposal with funding for these Federal pay reforms 
and similar pay increases for Tribal personnel. These proposals build 
upon the historic reforms in BIL to ensure wildland fire personnel 
receive the enhanced support they need to meet evolving mission demands 
as both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are 
expected to continue to increase due to climate change.
    Indian Water Rights Settlements--Building upon investments in the 
BIL, the budget proposes $2.5 billion in mandatory funding over 10 
years to expand the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund to 
cover the costs of enacted and future water rights settlements and 
$340.0 million in mandatory funding over 10 years for ongoing costs 
including operations and maintenance costs associated with enacted 
water settlements managed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation). 
Providing a stable, dedicated funding source for Indian water rights 
settlements helps to ensure these commitments are honored and Tribal 
communities have safe, reliable water supplies to support public and 
environmental health and economic opportunity.
    Good Neighbor and Stewardship Contracting Authority--The budget 
proposes to expand Good Neighbor and Stewardship Contracting 
authorities currently available to BLM and the U.S. Forest Service 
(USFS) to include FWS and NPS. Including these bureaus would allow them 
to enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with States, Tribes, 
and counties to perform watershed restoration and forest management 
services on bureau lands. Expanding stewardship contracting authority 
would enable FWS and NPS to enter into stewardship contracts or 
agreements to achieve bureau land and resource management goals. These 
contracts enable agencies to apply the value of timber or other forest 
products removed from the lands as an offset against the cost of land 
and resource management services provided through the agreement. The 
budget also proposes appropriations language to extend current Good 
Neighbor Authority for BLM and USFS which expires at the end of FY 2023 
by 1 year.
    Contract Support Costs and Payments for Tribal Leases--The budget 
proposes to reclassify funding for payments required by law to 
reimburse Tribes for costs associated with carrying out Federal 
functions under a self-determination contract or self-governance 
compact, from discretionary to mandatory funding in 2024. Contract 
Support Costs funding is a critical Tribal sovereignty payment enabling 
Tribes to assume responsibility for operating Federal programs by 
covering the costs to administer the programs. Section 105(l) of the 
Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act provides that 
Tribes and Tribal organizations carrying out contracted or compacted 
Federal functions may enter into a lease agreement with the Department 
of the Interior for the tribally owned or rented facility used to carry 
out those functions. These legally required critical Tribal sovereignty 
payments bring Tribes closer to meeting the full cost to administer and 
operate Federal functions, including costs associated with the use of 
Tribal facilities.
    Compacts of Free Association (COFA)--The Administration supports 
funding the renewal of our COFA relationships with the Federated States 
of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and 
the Republic of Palau. The 2024 budget will seek $6.5 billion in 
economic assistance over 20 years to be provided through a mandatory 
appropriation at the Department of State, with language calling for 
continued implementation by the Department of the Interior. The total 
amount requested as part of a COFA mandatory proposal will also include 
$634 million for continued U.S. Postal Service services to the Freely 
Associated States (FAS). Funding for postal services will be requested 
as a direct payment to the Postal Service Fund. The United States 
remains committed to its long-standing partnerships with the 
governments and the people of the FAS as we work together to promote a 
free and open Indo-Pacific.
    Injurious Species--The budget supports congressional efforts to 
amend Title 18 of the Lacey Act to return the longstanding authority of 
FWS to prohibit interstate transports of injurious species. Recent 
incidences of injurious species, such as invasive mussels contaminating 
commercial products, demonstrate the need to restore this authority.
                      strengthening tribal nations
    This Administration has made a steadfast commitment to honor our 
Nation's Tribal trust responsibilities and strengthen government-to-
government relationships with Tribal Nations. This budget maintains 
that commitment to support and expand this work with a total request of 
$4.7 billion for Indian Affairs programs, an increase of $690 million 
from 2023. The 2024 budget makes significant investments to strengthen 
Tribal Nations, their sovereignty and revitalization, providing new and 
expanded funding opportunities and resources for Tribes to manage and 
support their lands, waters, and communities. These investments include 
continuing support addressing matters deeply important to Native 
Americans to address Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples, the 
legacy of the Federal Indian Boarding Schools, and Native Language 
Revitalization.
                    investing in tribal communities
    The request includes $3.0 billion for Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(BIA) programs, an increase of $482.8 million above 2023 enacted. The 
BIA budget contains several significant investments in Tribal 
communities, including $78.1 million for the Tiwahe Initiative, an 
increase of $33.5 million from 2023. Under Tiwahe, a portion of the 
funding assists Tribes at selected sites to implement a tribally driven 
approach to deliver essential services more effectively and 
efficiently. Since 2015, the Tiwahe Initiative has focused primarily on 
promoting family stability though several Human Services programs. The 
Department's 2024 budget further expands Tiwahe in Social Services, 
Indian Child Welfare Act, Housing, Tribal Justice Support, and Economic 
Development programs.
    Tribal leaders across the country have expressed increased concern 
for public safety in their communities. Their elevated level of concern 
is coupled with emerging needs to expand services to address the McGirt 
v. Oklahoma decision and the needs of 31 Tribes that have been eligible 
for but have not received BIA public safety and justice funding. 
Interior's 2024 budget submission includes $717.1 million for Public 
Safety and Justice Programs and related construction, an increase of 
$85.8 million above the 2023 enacted level. That amount includes $316.3 
million for Criminal Investigations and Police Services programs, an 
increase of $42.2 million above 2023. At the increased 2024 level, all 
Tribes currently receiving funds would receive an equal share of the 
increase--including those newly participating Tribes that elect to 
receive BIA law enforcement services available in 2023. The budget 
includes $154.6 million, an increase of $18.3 million above the 2023 
level, to support the operational needs of detention and corrections 
programs encountering growing personnel, equipment, and technology 
costs.
    Complementing those operational increases, the budget includes 
$75.3 million for construction supporting public safety and justice 
programs, an increase of $23.8 million.
    The budget includes $385.9 million, an increase of $52.7 million 
above 2023 enacted, for Trust Natural Resource Management programs 
which includes Tribal forestry, irrigation, energy and minerals, water 
resources, climate resilience, co-stewardship, and other activities. In 
a separate account, the 2024 budget includes $12.0 million for a new 
Tribal LWCF Land Acquisition program. During LWCF listening sessions 
last year, one of the top priorities sovereign Tribes identified was 
having direct access to LWCF funding for conservation and recreation 
projects without partnering with or applying through States. Through 
this BIA program, Tribes would have the opportunity to acquire lands or 
easements to protect and conserve natural resource areas, which may 
also be of cultural importance to the Tribe or have significant 
recreational benefits for Tribal communities, consistent with the 
purposes of LWCF funding.
    During Tribal consultations and listening sessions on Federal 
Subsistence Management programs, Tribal participants consistently 
pointed to the adverse impacts the changing climate is having on Alaska 
Native subsistence practices and Alaska Native communities and the need 
to expand Tribal co-management partnerships and incorporate indigenous 
knowledge into subsistence management. In response to these 
recommendations, the 2024 budget proposes to transfer the functions of 
the Office of Subsistence Management from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service to the Office of the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs, along 
with an increase of $2.5 million for the program. The budget includes 
additional increases in the land management bureaus--FWS, NPS, and 
BLM--to support resource management associated with Alaska Native 
subsistence.
                       advancing indian education
    The 2024 budget includes $1.6 billion for Indian Education 
programs, an increase of $209.2 million above 2023 enacted. Native 
students face stark inequities in access to education, many of which 
were highlighted and exacerbated by the pandemic. To help address that 
gap, the budget invests in the day-to-day operations of BIE-funded 
elementary and secondary schools. The budget includes $508.7 million 
for Indian Student Equalization Program formula funds, which provide 
the primary support for academic activities in the classroom, 
instructional services, and teacher training, recruitment, and 
retention. The budget includes resources to operate and maintain BIE-
funded schools and fully funds the estimated $98.7 million requirement 
for Tribal Grant Support costs to cover the administration costs for 
Tribes that choose to operate BIE- funded schools.
    The budget includes $189.6 million for postsecondary schools and 
programs, including $133.5 million for Haskell Indian Nations 
University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute and for Tribal 
colleges, universities, and technical colleges; and $56.1 million for 
expanded Tribal scholarships and adult education programs.
    Addressing BIE-funded school facilities in poor condition and 
deferred maintenance backlogs at more than 180 schools in the BIE 
school system continues to be a top priority for the Department--45 
percent of BIE schools are currently identified as in ``poor'' 
condition. The 2024 budget includes $416.2 million in annual funding 
for Education Construction, an increase of $148.3 million over the 2023 
enacted level. The 2024 request for School and Facility Replacement 
Construction will support seven school projects. The budget also 
includes $160.1 million for facilities operation and maintenance, to 
help maintain the condition of schools. An additional $95.0 million in 
mandatory funding for BIE school construction through the GAOA will be 
available in 2024 to support the replacement of two additional school 
campuses. The continued emphasis on BIE school infrastructure 
conditions has produced tangible results, with two new campuses opened 
to students in 2022.
            meeting financial tribal trust responsibilities
    The budget includes $109.1 million to support the Tribal financial 
functions managed by the Bureau of Trust Funds Administration (BTFA). 
BTFA currently serves as the financial manager for more than $8 billion 
of Indian Trust Funds and provides services for 4,100 Tribal accounts 
and roughly 408,000 Individual Indian Money accounts. The 2024 budget 
continues to propose BTFA as a stand-alone bureau with critical 
independent functions for effective management of Indian assets and 
service to Indian Country. The Department held listening sessions on 
the future of BTFA, and the input received showed Tribes did not want 
to eliminate BTFA or its functions, and some Tribes would like to have 
expanded services from BTFA. The Department looks forward to working 
with Congress to ensure BTFA is fully recognized as a bureau to allow 
the organization to focus on its mission of serving Indian Country.
         addressing climate challenges and building resilience
    The United States faces a profound climate crisis that is rapidly 
changing how we consider the future, evaluate risk, and protect 
resources. Together with agencies across the Federal Government, 
States, Tribes, and other partners, the Department of the Interior is 
working in real time to address the immediate and long-term needs 
driven by the changing climate. Catastrophic fire, flood, and drought 
events brought about by the climate crisis are increasingly top-of-mind 
considerations. These events demand immediate attention and resources, 
but long-term success requires more work to build resilience to better 
meet these challenges.
                         wildland fire reforms
    The National Interagency Fire Center reports 68,988 wildfires 
occurred across the United States in 2022, burning 7.5 million acres. 
The number of wildfires was noticeably higher than the 10- year 
average, which has been consistently increasing. The 2024 President's 
Budget expands the Nation's response to the impacts of wildland fire 
beyond the near term to include aggressive longer-term actions. The 
2024 budget honors President Biden's commitment to wildland 
firefighters by taking significant steps forward in ongoing bipartisan 
efforts to build a more professional, year-round workforce, better 
aligned with the challenges of today's wildfire activity.
    Enacting these reforms is essential to meet the challenges posed by 
longer and more intense fire seasons while providing wildland 
firefighters a more livable wage, addressing long-term competitiveness 
and equity issues, helping prevent burnout and fatigue, and ensuring 
stable recruitment and retention. The cornerstone of these long-term 
reforms is a permanent increase in pay. The Administration proposes 
legislation to establish a special base rate salary table, create a new 
premium pay category to provide additional compensation for all hours a 
wildland fire responder is mobilized on an incident, and institute pay 
cap authority that provides waiver authority to the Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture using specific criteria. The 
budget funds these Federal pay reforms and similar pay increases for 
Tribal fire personnel.
    The 2024 budget request for the Department's Wildland Fire 
Management programs is nearly $1.7 billion, including $1.3 billion for 
the Wildland Fire Management account and $350.0 million for the 
Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund. This request is an 
increase of $243.1 million, or 17 percent above the comparable 2023 
enacted amount for base fire programs. Of this, $72.0 million supports 
the pay increases for Federal and Tribal wildland firefighters. In 
addition, the 2024 budget provides an increase of $45.0 million more 
than the comparable 2023 enacted amount to increase firefighting 
capacity by an estimated 325 Federal and 55 Tribal full- time 
equivalents (FTEs). In total, DOI's request for wildland fire 
management will support an additional 370 Federal and 55 Tribal FTEs.
    The 2024 budget also addresses challenges concerning recruiting and 
retaining wildland firefighters with an increase of $10.0 million for 
Interior (and another $10.0 million for the Department of Agriculture) 
to establish a comprehensive joint Interior-Agriculture program to 
enhance firefighters' mental and physical health and well-being. The 
budget also includes a $22.0 million increase to repair, renovate, and 
construct housing for wildland firefighting personnel, which can be 
inadequate or unaffordable in certain geographic locations. To further 
build fire program capacity, the budget increases funding for aviation 
contracts and uncrewed aerial systems support by $20.0 million, program 
management for incident support by $18.3 million, and increases funding 
for Tribal contract and administrative support and Reserved Treaty 
Rights Lands projects by $9.0 million.
    The President's 2024 Budget, featuring this suite of workforce 
reforms, will transform interagency Wildland Fire Management by 
improving recruitment and retention and laying the foundation for 
further advancements. The Administration looks forward to working with 
Congress to enact this important legislation and the requested funds 
needed to implement these reforms in FY 2024.
    Complementing this wildland fire package of reforms, the budget 
includes $293.3 million for Fuels Management activities, an increase of 
$46.3 million above 2023 enacted. This request maintains Interior's 
strong support for a pro-active Fuels Management program to reduce 
wildland fire risk from burnable plant materials which can pile up and 
make fires burn hotter, larger, longer, and faster.
                    supporting community resilience
    Persistent drought conditions across the West are exacerbating fire 
risk and increasing concerns for water availability. Prolonged drought 
in much of the West and low runoff conditions accelerated by climate 
change have led to historically low water levels in Lakes Powell and 
Mead, and many other reservoirs are also being affected by drought. In 
the Colorado River Basin, the period from 2000 through 2022 was the 
driest 23-year period in more than 100 years of record-keeping. Extreme 
drought conditions across the West are forcing very difficult 
challenges and choices to manage available water supplies. Although the 
Bureau of Reclamation, which comes before the Energy and Water 
Appropriations Subcommittee, is at the forefront of Interior's drought 
response, mitigation, and resilience efforts, the historic drought 
conditions facing our country is a concern shared across the agency.
    As a land and resource manager for more than 480 million acres of 
lands across the United States, climate related challenges from 
drought, wildfire, floods, invasive species are real day-to- day 
considerations. Interior's significant stewardship mission requires us 
to be an active partner in ongoing efforts to understand, mitigate, and 
build resilience to these climate impacts on our natural resources and 
resident species. The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) programs are key 
contributors to this effort.
    The 2024 budget includes $120.3 million for the USGS Groundwater 
and Streamflow Information Program, which maintains a nationwide 
network of streamflow and water level information collected from more 
than 31,000 sites. The information from the network is available online 
to help States, Tribes, natural resource managers, scientists, and 
emergency managers across the country with monitoring for floods and 
drought and with forecasting water availability for crops and natural 
resource management. The USGS request also includes $74.7 million for 
Water Availability and Use Science programs, which includes funding to 
apply fire and drought science to support natural resource management.
    The budget includes $63.0 million for the USGS Coastal and Marine 
Hazards program, which leverages field research, high-resolution data, 
and modeling to help communities plan for and respond to changes in 
coastal landscapes. Agencies and communities use this science to plan 
evacuation notices, inform city planning, and construct storm-resistant 
infrastructure. Others use program information to restore coastal 
ecosystems, developing infrastructure that can buffer future storm 
damage and coastal erosion.
    Interior is also working to address climate resilience in Tribal 
communities. The BIA's 2024 budget includes $48.0 million for the 
Tribal Climate Resilience program to support climate resilience 
planning, assessment, and adaptation activities. The program also 
provides funding for planning and design work for Tribal communities 
evaluating the need for or pursuing climate- related relocation. 
Building on the success of this program, Interior has leveraged BIL and 
IRA funding to join with the Federal Energy Management Agency and the 
Denali Commission to launch a new Voluntary Community-Driven Relocation 
Program.
    The budget includes $120.8 million for Assistance to Territories, 
which supports the Insular Areas through the provision of basic 
services and targeted investments related to climate change, including 
$3.5 million for work related to coral reef ecosystems and other 
natural resource needs and $15.5 million to promote renewable energy 
and grid infrastructure in the Insular Areas.
                     conservation and healthy lands
    Interior manages more than 480 million acres of lands across the 
United States and is responsible for the protection and recovery of 
more than 2,375 endangered and threatened species, of which 1,678 are 
in the United States. This significant stewardship mission requires 
Interior to be among the leaders as an active partner in ongoing 
efforts to understand and mitigate climate impacts on natural 
resources, promote biodiversity, and ensure these valuable assets 
remain available for the public to experience and enjoy. Interior's 
conservation and adaptive management work relies heavily on 
partnerships and interagency collaboration to leverage information and 
resources.
    Interior's work to strengthen the resilience of natural resources 
through conservation, restoration, recovery, and adaptive management is 
a fundamental part of our mission. The Department estimates the budget 
includes $3.2 billion in annual funding for conservation efforts. This 
includes dedicated funding increase to expand natural resource program 
in the NPS, BLM, and FWS totaling $2.5 billion for critical restoration 
and improvements supporting healthier lands, waters, and ecosystems and 
their resident species. Within that amount, the budget supports key 
conservation and ecosystem management initiatives such as the National 
Seed Strategy, Migration Corridors, and youth corps partnerships.
    The 2024 budget also invests in conservation programs which greatly 
leverage Federal efforts by engaging a wide variety of partners. The 
request includes $140.3 million, an increase of $34.2 million from 2023 
enacted, for FWS partnership programs including Partners for Fish and 
Wildlife, Candidate Conservation, Coastal Programs, and Migratory Bird 
Joint Ventures programs. These programs support voluntary conservation 
on public and privately-owned lands--a key focus of the America the 
Beautiful initiative.
    The Great American Outdoors Act established permanent, mandatory 
funding totaling $900.0 million a year for Land and Water Conservation 
Fund programs to advance conservation and outdoor recreation. These 
funds are allocated to the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture 
for a combination of Federal land acquisition and grant programs. The 
LWCF programs support a wide variety of Federal, State, and local 
conservation and outdoor recreation opportunities in communities large 
and small across our country.
    The 2024 budget proposes $681.9 million for Interior's mandatory 
funded LWCF programs. This includes $306.2 million for Interior land 
acquisition and $375.7 million for grant programs. Interior's land 
acquisition programs prioritize projects as authorized for the National 
Parks, National Wildlife Refuge areas, and BLM public lands, which 
feature strong local partner engagement, protect at-risk natural or 
cultural resources, and advance the mission of the bureaus. In addition 
to the mandatory LWCF funding to be allocated in 2024, another $117.9 
million in GOMESA oil and gas revenue is estimated to be available for 
LWCF State formula grants.
    The 2024 budget also proposes $12.0 million in discretionary 
funding to establish a new Tribal LWCF Land Acquisition program in BIA. 
The program will enable Tribes to directly participate in the LWCF for 
the first time to acquire lands for the purposes of natural and 
cultural resources conservation and recreation access. It is envisioned 
this program would provide funds for eligible land acquisition projects 
submitted by Tribes, although BIA plans to hold formal Tribal 
consultation on the establishment of the program. This new program, 
together with the proposed mandatory funding allocation, and 
anticipated GOMESA revenue, increases Interior's total LWCF funding to 
$811.7 million in 2024.
                           leveraging science
    Interior actively incorporates science to inform and enhance 
delivery of core mission activities. The 2024 budget includes roughly 
$1.5 billion across Interior for scientific work and research. This 
commitment to science is evident in Interior's collection of natural 
resource data from years of day-to-day field measurements and recorded 
land, water, and species conditions, which help inform resource 
management decisions at Interior and a wide range of partners, States, 
Tribes, and the public. Interior is leveraging this information and 
applying new technologies and understanding to develop forecasting and 
modeling tools to inform and improve how we manage challenging 
conditions, such as water supply and demand or increasingly severe 
wildland fires. Interior also conducts basic and applied research to 
better understand and identify solutions to emerging challenges, such 
as harmful algal blooms, invasive carp, white nose syndrome in bats, 
and avian influenza.
    The 2024 budget includes $1.8 billion for USGS programs and 
operations, an increase of $288.3 million from the 2023 enacted amount. 
To provide timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and 
its processes, USGS works with a variety of partners across the country 
to maintain roughly 20,000 groundwater monitoring wells, more than 
11,800 stream gages and 3,800 earthquake sensors, and USGS directly 
monitors 70 volcanoes.
    The 2024 budget includes $128.0 million for the USGS Climate 
Adaptation Science Centers and Land Change Science Program, which 
provide information, tools, and science applications to meet current 
and emerging challenges that threaten the sustainability of natural 
resources and our cities, infrastructure, and rural communities. USGS 
has nine Regional and one National Climate Adaptation Science Centers 
across the country, which are affiliated with university partners. The 
centers work with a wide range of resource managers and other partners 
to address specific climate-related challenges to natural and cultural 
resources.
    Through the Landsat program, the country has maintained a 50-year 
observational record of the Earth's surface, providing invaluable 
scientific information. The Department of the Interior continues to 
work closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) to develop the upcoming Landsat Next mission, which will involve 
launching a constellation of three satellites into orbit at the same 
time. The Landsat Next mission concept will take advantage of new 
technologies, such as smaller satellites and improved sensors, to 
sustain consistent imaging data and deliver far more capabilities than 
Landsat 8 and 9, meeting more user needs with improved spatial 
resolution and faster revisit times. The USGS will also establish a 
commercial data pilot program to augment data from the Landsat 
satellites. The FY 2024 budget includes an increase of $17.0 million to 
support these efforts.
     creating jobs and meeting energy and environmental challenges
    Interior's programs create jobs and spur economic growth in a 
variety of areas--energy and minerals, recreation and tourism, grants 
and payments, and infrastructure investment. The 2024 budget maintains 
a consistent strategy to emphasize investment in areas that better 
position the country to be more competitive in the changing economy and 
environment.
    Congress has enacted historic investments launching Federal and 
private-sector infrastructure projects that will build climate 
resilience and create more American jobs. The focus now is on project 
implementation to put those funds to work as soon as possible. The 
Administration is coordinating efforts across Federal agencies to 
streamline processes as appropriate to responsibly get these projects 
underway. Interior is actively engaged in those efforts, primarily as 
they concern statutorily required Endangered Species Act (ESA) permit 
reviews.
    The FWS budget includes $171.4 million, an increase of $50.5 
million from 2023, to increase the bureau's environmental permitting 
capacity to accelerate and improve environmental reviews supporting 
responsible development of priority infrastructure projects funded 
through the BIL and IRA. In addition, the budget includes a new 
government-wide General Provision to expand authority beyond existing 
reimbursable and Economy Act authorities by enabling Federal agencies 
to more effectively transfer funds provided under the BIL to FWS and 
the National Marine Fisheries Service to complete permitting 
activities. This authority in concert with existing authorities will 
improve efficiencies and increase capacity for environmental planning 
and consultation to better support the implementation of infrastructure 
investments now underway.
    FWS will continue to advance electronic permitting efforts in 2024, 
and the budget proposes to consolidate all ePermitting efforts into a 
single activity to better manage the program's resources and provide 
additional visibility to this important effort. The program helps 
applicants properly identify and submit complete application packages 
and supports more efficient and effective processing. Although FWS has 
achieved a secure and modern system that enables permit applicants to 
apply and pay processing fees for permits online, work remains to be 
done to build and optimize features to better achieve efficiency and 
streamlining.
                    moving forward with clean energy
    The 2024 budget includes increases in offshore and onshore 
renewable energy programs building upon the tremendous growth 
accomplished by these programs the past year. We are on our way to 
achieve the Administration's goals to deploy 30 gigawatts (GW) of 
offshore wind capacity by 2030, 15 GW of floating wind by 2035, and 
continued growth thereafter. In FY 2022, the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management (BOEM) approved the South Fork project, initiated 
Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for two projects, published 
draft EISs for two projects, and began the environmental review process 
for the construction and operation of offshore wind projects in the New 
York Bight.
    As of February 2023, the BOEM has conducted 11 competitive wind 
energy lease sales for areas in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 
representing more than 2.5 million acres of commercial wind energy 
lease areas offshore California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New 
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and 
Virginia. Together, leases from these sales have the potential to 
support 43.5 GW of offshore wind. BOEM conducted the first renewable 
energy lease sale ever off the California coast on December 6, 2022, 
and the agency plans to hold the first renewable energy lease sale in 
the Gulf of Mexico in FY 2023. The bureau is in the planning stages of 
identifying additional areas in the Gulf of Maine, and offshore the 
Central Atlantic, Hawaii, and Oregon. BOEM has also received 
unsolicited lease requests for areas offshore Washington and will 
continue to assess interest in those areas.
    As of February 2023, BOEM has approved two construction and 
operations plans, and those projects are under construction. BOEM is 
actively processing 16 additional plans and expects to receive one more 
plan in 2023. If fully approved, these 19 projects have the potential 
to support more than 30 GW of generation capacity and power 10.6 
million homes. The IRA authorized BOEM to conduct offshore wind leasing 
in the U.S. Territories. In FY 2023, BOEM will move forward with its 
lease planning process in Puerto Rico, and the 2024 budget includes an 
increase of $6.0 million to continue this planning in the U.S. 
Territories.
    The 2024 budget includes $64.5 million for BOEM's Renewable Energy 
program, an increase of $21.6 million above the 2023 enacted level. 
This request includes a $12.0 million increase to support permitting. 
The budget includes $92.8 million for BOEM's Environmental Programs, an 
increase of $10.4 million, which includes funding for environmental 
review associated with renewable energy projects.
    The budget for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement 
(BSEE) includes $8.4 million to continue to support offshore Renewable 
Energy deployment and oversight. BSEE anticipates receiving more than 
40,000 wind engineering, construction, and other technical reports for 
review through the end of FY 2024. BSEE is working closely with BOEM to 
develop the necessary framework to ensure offshore renewable energy 
projects are implemented safely and responsibly.
    BLM's onshore renewable program is also making tremendous progress 
to achieve the Energy Act of 2020 goal to permit 25 GW of renewable 
energy on public lands by 2025. The BLM has permitted more than 126 
renewable energy projects in solar, wind, and operating geothermal 
power plants. They are processing 68 priority utility-scale onshore 
clean energy projects proposed on public lands in the western United 
States, including solar, wind, geothermal, and associated interconnect 
transmission line projects that are vital to grid connection. If 
approved, these projects would provide more than 35 GW of renewable 
energy to the western electric grid.
    In addition to the 68 priority projects currently underway, BLM has 
over 120 pending ending applications for processing when transmission 
capacity is available, with the potential to support 50 GW of solar and 
wind energy. The BLM is taking additional steps to prepare for this 
increase in demand, including working to revise seven interstate 
transmission corridors designated under Section 368 of the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005. This effort involves amending 19 land use plans to 
remove barriers or conflicts in the currently designated corridor 
network to improve the siting, permitting, and review of electricity 
transmission projects.
    The bureau is also initiating a programmatic environmental impact 
statement in support of utility-scale solar energy planning. In light 
of improved technology, new transmission, and ambitious clean energy 
goals, the BLM is updating the 2012 Solar PEIS and considering adding 
more States, adjusting exclusion criteria, and potentially identifying 
new or expanded areas to prioritize solar deployment.
    The 2024 budget includes $72.5 million for BLM's Renewable Energy 
program, an increase of $31.6 million from the 2023 enacted level. This 
funding supports the bureau's Renewable Energy Coordination Offices and 
includes increases to build staffing capacity and support planning and 
permitting efforts to accommodate the surge in demand and workload. The 
request supports proactive programmatic assessments and consultations 
with FWS under Section 7(a)(1) of the ESA. This work will review 
ecological regions for appropriate renewable energy deployment 
scenarios in key areas where substantial renewable energy development 
interest exists. This approach is an efficient alternative to project-
by-project consultation. BLM estimates using the ecological region 
assessment approach will result in ESA project-consultation reviews 
completed up to 90 percent faster and deliver substantially improved 
species conservation outcomes.
                          conventional energy
    The budget for BOEM provides $72.3 million for conventional energy 
programs to support Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning, leasing, 
and oversight, including inventorying oil and gas reserves, overseeing 
ongoing activities, ensuring adequate financial assurances for 
decommissioning liability and risk management, developing and 
implementing the National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program (National 
Five-Year OCS Program), reviewing and administering oil and gas 
exploration and development plans and geological and geophysical 
permits, and conducting economic analyses and resource evaluation. The 
budget also includes $92.8 million for Environmental Studies, 
supporting conventional and renewable energy activities.
    As directed by the IRA, in 2022, Interior reinstated bids from 
Lease Sale 257 and on December 30, 2022, held Lease Sale 258 in Cook 
Inlet offshore Alaska. BOEM is proceeding with congressional direction 
to prepare two lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, Lease Sales 259 and 
261. The bureau is on track to meet the statutory requirements that 
Lease Sale 259 be held by March 31, 2023, and Lease Sale 261 by 
September 30, 2023. BOEM is continuing development of the next National 
OCS Leasing Program.
    The 2024 budget for BSEE includes $217.1 million for conventional 
energy programs to support OCS permit application reviews, regulation 
and standard development for offshore activities, verification and 
enforcement of operator compliance with all applicable environmental 
laws and regulations, technical reviews of planned operations and 
emerging technologies to properly identify and mitigate risks, a robust 
inspection program employing an annual inspection strategy that 
includes risk-based inspections, and incident investigations. BSEE's 
budget also includes $30.0 million to fund the decommissioning of 
orphaned offshore oil and gas infrastructure. This funding, along with 
funding from other sources, will be used to address the most immediate 
and urgent well, pipeline, and platform decommissioning needs to help 
reduce the risks to environmental health and safety.
    The 2024 budget includes $123.5 million for BLM's Oil and Gas 
Management program, an increase of $10.6 million from the 2023 enacted 
amount. The BLM budget also includes $51.0 million for Oil and Gas 
Inspection Activities and proposes to offset the cost of this program 
through the establishment of onshore inspection fees. Increases in the 
2024 budget support increased program capacity and support to implement 
requirements in the IRA, which modernized the Mineral Leasing Act and 
mandates collecting royalties on all extracted methane. In addition to 
administering oil and gas leasing and ensuring environmentally 
responsible development, the budget request includes funding to 
remediate legacy well sites in the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska.
    The 2024 budget includes $13.8 million for onshore and offshore 
carbon sequestration programs in BLM, BOEM, and BSEE. Incentives 
included in the IRA are expected to rapidly increase interest in carbon 
sequestration, and Interior's bureaus are laying the groundwork to help 
ensure that these efforts are implemented responsibly and safely. BOEM 
and BSEE are working together to develop and publish a carbon 
sequestration notice of proposed rulemaking for review and public 
comment. While the rule is under development, BOEM and BSEE will 
continue to develop their carbon sequestration programs to facilitate 
program implementation upon final rule publication.
                            reclamation jobs
    To complement significant BIL investments in abandoned coal mine 
reclamation projects, the 2024 budget provides annual ongoing support 
for other related reclamation activities addressing State and Tribal 
reclamation needs associated with abandoned hardrock mines, legacy 
pollution on Interior's lands, and economic development projects with a 
nexus to abandoned coal mine lands. These projects address legacy 
pollution--which harms the environment and often risks the public 
health of communities--while creating good-paying jobs, advancing long 
overdue environmental justice, and restoring lands for other uses.
    The budget includes $30.0 million for the Abandoned Hardrock Mine 
Reclamation Program authorized in the BIL to support State, Tribal, and 
Federal efforts to inventory and address legacy sites on their lands. 
Many States, Tribes, and Federal land programs do not have good 
inventories or strong programs to manage Abandoned Hardrock Mine sites. 
This program targets the need to build capacity and begin to address 
these long-standing risks to health and safety.
    The 2024 budget includes $62.8 million for BLM's Abandoned Mine 
Lands and Hazardous Materials Management program, an increase of $5.6 
million more than the 2023 enacted amount, which will operate in tandem 
with the national Abandoned Hardrock Mine Reclamation Program to 
increase efforts to inventory and remediate those sites on BLM lands.
    Interior has also spearheaded an Interagency Working Group on 
Mining Regulations, Laws, and Permitting (IWG) to examine the existing 
statutory and regulatory framework for hardrock mining. The group will 
identify and recommend potential improvements to Federal mining laws 
and mine permitting processes, while better ensuring new mining 
activity engages local and Tribal communities and meets strong 
environmental standards. These efforts will help promote sustainable 
and responsible domestic production of critical minerals that are vital 
to achieving a clean energy economy. The IWG has hosted extensive 
listening sessions to solicit input from a multitude of stakeholders 
and will be releasing its report with recommendations in FY 2023. The 
Administration looks forward to working with Congress in FY 2023 and FY 
2024 to implement much needed mining reforms that will ensure strong 
social, environmental, and labor standards while making improvements in 
the efficiency, transparency, and inclusiveness of the Federal mine 
permitting system.
    Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 
(OSMRE) works with States and Tribes to regulate active coal mines to 
ensure mining is done in an environmentally- responsible manner occur 
and to remediate abandoned coal mines to address health and safety 
hazards. High priority abandoned mine land problems pose an immediate 
threat to health, safety, and the general welfare of communities and 
can include clogged streams/stream lands, dangerous piles or 
embankments, dangerous highwalls, and underground mine fires, and 
polluted water. OSMRE manages the State and Tribal abandoned mine 
reclamation grant programsauthorized by the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act and the BIL. In 2022, OSMRE invested nearly $1 billion 
in coal communities, including making nearly $725 million available to 
22 States and the Navajo Nation for reclamation as part of the BIL and 
$144.0 million available through the traditional, fee-funded, mandatory 
AML grant program.
    The 2024 budget includes $135.0 million for the Abandoned Mine Land 
Economic Revitalization (AMLER) grant program, which administers grants 
to 6 States and 3 Tribal Nations to return legacy coal mining sites to 
productive uses and foster economic and community development. The 
AMLER program has made more than $750 million available to the Nation's 
current and former coal communities to provide economic and community 
development and achieve reclamation of historic abandoned mine sites.
 promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion of underserved communities
    Interior continues to work across the Department to expand equity, 
diversity, and inclusion beyond day-to-day management policies to 
incorporate this concept in the delivery of our missions. This effort 
is consistent with the Administration's whole-of-government approach to 
advance equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity. 
Interior's 2024 budget request supports the actions needed to recognize 
and redress inequities and to proactively advance diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and accessibility within the Department's workforce. The 
Department seeks to ensure that everyone, no matter their background or 
ZIP Code, can enjoy the benefits of green spaces and the outdoors.
                increasing representation and inclusion
    Reflecting the Administration's commitment to accessibility and 
inclusion, the budget includes an additional $10.0 million as part of 
the Increasing Representation in Our Public Lands initiative. Funding 
is included in the budgets of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at 
$4.0 million; the BLM at $3.0 million; and the NPS at $3.0 million. The 
initiative will provide support for recent or potential new 
designations that preserve important places and tell the stories of 
those that have been historically underrepresented, such as the recent 
designations of the New Philadelphia and the Blackwell School National 
Historic Sites.
    The Administration remains committed to efforts to strengthen 
Tribal Sovereignty including Tribal and Federal co-stewardship of 
Federal lands, waters, and wildlife, through collaborative and 
cooperative agreements with Tribal Nations. At the end of 2022, 
Interior and the USDA Forest Service had signed more than 20 new co-
stewardship agreements with Tribes, Alaska Native corporations, and 
consortiums. Interior's 2024 budget includes targeted increases to 
expand Tribal co-stewardship across the Department. The NPS budget 
includes $7.1 million to directly support Tribal participation in 
management of Federal lands and waters with cultural and natural 
resources of significance and value to Indian Tribes and their 
citizens, including sacred religious sites, burial sites, wildlife, and 
sources of indigenous foods and medicines.
    The budget for the FWS includes increases of $3.5 million to 
advance improved co-stewardship and engagement with Tribes on 
Indigenous Knowledge research and conservation planning.
    Implicit in the Marine Mammal Protection Act is the realization 
that cooperative management of subsistence harvests between FWS and 
Alaska Native organizations is more likely to achieve the goals of the 
Act than management by a Federal agency alone. The budget provides 
strong support to continue to build these relationships with partners 
such as the Eskimo Walrus Commission and Alaska Nannut Co-management 
Council, which is the FWS co-management partner for polar bears.
    Many of Interior's bureaus have dedicated Tribal liaison services 
to support Tribal engagement. The NPS 2024 budget proposes separate 
funding for Tribal Heritage Grants within the Historic Preservation 
Fund to support Indian Tribes, Alaska Native villages and corporations, 
and Native Hawaiian organizations for the preservation and protection 
of their cultural heritage, in addition to other important ongoing 
Tribal programs. The USGS budget includes an increase of $7.2 million 
for Tribal climate adaptation science as well as geospatial and 
geologic research focused on Tribal lands.
               ongoing commitment to diversity and equity
    The Department is responsible for protecting and preserving the 
treasures of this Nation and aims to build a workforce that represents 
the treasures of this Nation--its people.
    In 2022, the Department published its first Equity Action Plan, 
which outlined efforts to advance equity through all DOI operations, 
remove barriers to equal opportunity, and deliver resources and 
benefits equitably to the general public. The Equity Action Plan is a 
key part of Interior's efforts to implement Executive Order 13985, 
Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through 
the Federal Government, and Executive Order 14091, Further Advancing 
Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The 
Federal Government, which calls on Federal agencies to advance equity 
by identifying and addressing barriers to equal opportunity that 
underserved communities may face as a result of some government 
policies and programs.
    In support of the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility 
(DEIA) Action Plan, the 2024 budget includes program increases of $11.1 
million for the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Civil Rights; 
Office of Human Capital; and Office of Collaborative Alternative 
Dispute Resolution to do the following:

  --Provide resources to the Department's first-ever DEIA Council to 
        coordinate, develop, and implement policies and initiatives 
        promoting the integration of DEIA across the agency.

  --Conduct barrier and workforce analyses and increase equal 
        employment opportunity (EEO) and DEIA training to employees 
        across the agency.

  --Address EEO adjudication resourcing and compliance gaps identified 
        by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission resulting from 
        two technical assessments of DOI's EEO program.

  --Improve the Department's Public Civil Rights reporting and tracking 
        capabilities.

  --Strengthen the Department's Affirmative Employment Programs, 
        including the development of diversity and recruitment 
        flexibilities and assessment of hiring programs to improve 
        recruitment results.

  --Expand capacity for alternative dispute resolution and EEO 
        complaint mediation.

    The budget also includes $2.0 million to coordinate and manage 
Departmentwide Justice40 efforts to help deliver at least 40 percent of 
the overall benefits from certain Federal investments to disadvantaged 
communities.
                        building agency capacity
    Interior is strengthening the Department's delivery of core 
programs and services for the American people. Efforts related to 
improving Interior's workforce and operations and better leveraging 
technology and information are underway across the Department.
                interior's workforce and infrastructure
    Interior's mission activities rely on a talented and dedicated 
workforce, and many bureau operations are labor intensive and complex. 
At the end of 2020, however, Interior's staffing was at a 10-year low, 
with 60,558 FTE. Despite the pandemic, by the end of 2022, staffing had 
increased to 61,857 FTE. When fully enacted, the Department's 2024 
budget would support an estimated 68,329 FTE, an increase of 4,009 FTE 
from the estimated 2023 level. As the Department rebuilds its 
workforce, Interior is working to recruit, hire, and train the next 
generation of talented people who will reflect the diversity and 
strength of the United States.
    The NPS depends on a talented staff to carry out its mission at 
national park areas across the country. Over time, full-time staffing 
across the National Park system has eroded due to absorption of fixed 
costs and other challenges. As part of a multiyear effort, NPS is 
working to build up its full-time Federal staff across the park system. 
The 2024 budget includes an increase of $25.4 million to continue this 
support to build operational capacity across all park areas, the
                u.s. park police, and nps special agents
    Interior manages an infrastructure portfolio valued at more than 
$400 billion, which includes a variety of structures, including dams, 
storage buildings, and national icons. The Department is responsible 
for roughly 43,000 buildings, 115,000 miles of road, and 83,000 
structures.
    Operations, maintenance, renewal, and modernization of 
infrastructure are a significant focus of Interior's funding that 
directly help to create jobs and benefit local economies.
    The 2024 budget includes more than $3.0 billion, $40.5 million 
above the 2023 level, to address the Department's infrastructure 
operations, maintenance, renewal, and modernization needs.
    Interior's annual request for infrastructure funding is in addition 
to $1.6 billion in mandatory funding available to Interior each year 
through 2025 through the National Parks and Public Land Legacy 
Restoration Fund (LRF) included in the GAOA. Those funds are available 
to address the Department's deferred maintenance backlog in the NPS, 
FWS, BLM, and BIE schools. The USFS also receives up to $285 million in 
LRF funding each year.
    At the end of 2023, Interior's LRF program will have initiated 276 
projects touching all 50 States; Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. When completed, those projects are estimated to 
address $3.4 billion of Interior's deferred maintenance backlog, create 
an average of 17,000 jobs each year, and contribute an average of $1.8 
billion each year to the overall gross domestic product. The 2024 
budget proposes another $1.6 billion in identified LRF projects across 
the country.
    In addition, the budget includes $53.6 million across multiple 
bureaus to support a multi-year plan to fully transition the 
Department's light duty fleet acquisitions to zero-emission vehicles 
(ZEVs). This funding will be used to conduct fleet planning (including 
ZEV integration), electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) site 
evaluations, EVSE installation, and ZEV acquisition. This planning 
helps to ensure ZEVs are integrated into Interior fleet plans; 
prioritize facilities for deployment; determine infrastructure needs, 
such as increased electrical supply and access for EVSE; and coordinate 
installation to ensure Interior can maximize the use of the charging 
stations across the bureaus and other Federal agencies.
           investing in technology and information management
    The 2024 budget includes $4.5 million in the Appropriated Working 
Capital Fund, complemented with $200,000 in BTFA, to help improve 
Interior's customer service by better understanding our customers, 
reducing administrative hurdles and paperwork burdens, and redesigning 
compliance-oriented processes to improve the customer experience. 
Interior is targeting these efforts in four specific programs: Bureau 
of Indian Affairs probate activities; Bureau of Trust Funds 
Administration management of Individual Indian Money accounts and 
beneficiary services; FWS trip planning through fws.gov; and NPS 
digital experience and volunteer services.
    The 2024 budget includes $10.1 million to enhance data management 
practices and conduct program evaluations to inform evidence-based 
decisions. That amount includes $2.1 million to establish a robust data 
management program to organize data through an enterprise data 
inventory to better support analysis and evaluation across the agency. 
Another $6.1 million will support evidence and program evaluations of 
programs, initiatives, and processes across Interior to assess how well 
they are working to achieve the intended goals.
    To better support that data-driven work, the 2024 budget includes 
$59.7 million for the operation and maintenance of the Financial and 
Business Management System (FBMS), an increase of $5.3 million from the 
2023 enacted amount. The request includes funding required for ongoing 
operations and maintenance of the Department's integrated FBMS system 
of record.
    Modernizing Interior's core business system to ensure a strong 
administrative backbone is critical to the continued execution of 
Interior's mission activities.
    The 2024 budget includes $67.8 million to fund cybersecurity 
efforts, an increase of $23.4 million. The budget continues to fund 
extremely high-priority, recurring operations and maintenance costs for 
incident remediation activities and provides resources to be directed 
against emerging threats. The request includes an increase of $23.4 
million to support a Zero Trust (ZT) architecture, which will advance 
Interior's adaptation of a modern security model founded on a principle 
requiring all devices and users, regardless of whether they are inside 
or outside an organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, 
and regularly validated before being granted access. Within the $23.4 
million increase is $5.0 million for a secure access service edge 
(SASE) solution, which focuses on securing access points to meet the 
required ZT security and performance standards.
    The 2024 budget proposes appropriations language to establish a 
nonrecurring expenses fund (NEF), which will allow the Department to 
transfer unobligated balances of expired discretionary funds from 2024 
and subsequent years, no later than the fifth fiscal year after the 
last fiscal year of availability, to the NEF as no-year funds to 
support specific purposes. The NEF will provide funding for critical 
infrastructure projects that may require significant one-time 
investments, such as information technology modernization projects. 
Those requirements often do not coincide with the timing of the budget 
formulation process and are difficult to forecast. In many cases, those 
costs either cannot be accommodated within existing funds or are 
emergency requirements that would otherwise require the Department to 
reprogram existing funds from other priority projects.
    The 2024 budget includes $185.4 million for the Office of Natural 
Resources Revenue (ONRR) to ensure revenue from Federal and Indian 
mineral leases is effectively, efficiently, and accurately collected, 
accounted for, analyzed, audited, and disbursed in a timely fashion. 
The request will fund additional staff and counsel support and 
strengthen ONRR's audit and compliance activities as well as expand 
ONRR's Tribal audit program to include agreements with two additional 
Tribes. The budget includes an increase of $5.0 million to address new 
royalty rates and other changes enacted in the IRA, which are expected 
to increase the complexity of royalty reporting and audit requirements.
    Interior's operations rely heavily on field communications which in 
some places, the Department's legacy land mobile radio system, a 
technology largely unchanged since the 1950s, is the first and often 
only source of communication. The 2024 budget includes $32.2 million 
for DOI's Field Communications Modernization (DIFCOM) as part of a 
multiyear investment which includes the BIA, BLM, FWS, NPS, and USGS, 
and the Office of the Chief Information Officer.
                               conclusion
    The 2024 President's Budget for Interior invests in programs to 
strengthen our Nation for all Americans, protect our environment, and 
ensure our future generations continue to not only enjoy, but improve 
our way of life. I look forward to doing this work together. Thank you 
again for having me, and I am pleased to answer any questions you may 
have.

                     PUBLIC SAFETY ON TRIBAL LANDS

    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. And 
we are going to have seven-minute rounds of questioning. I am 
going to try to get through three tribal questions during that 
seven minutes.
    And I wanted to start with the issue of the importance of 
public safety and justice funding for our tribes. We have a 
complicated system of jurisdiction over law enforcement on 
tribal lands. Sometimes the tribe is responsible. Sometimes the 
Federal Government is responsible.
    We also have a complicated system of funding for tribal, 
public safety and justice programs. There are tribes that are 
eligible for receiving Federal funding but are not able to kind 
of get inside the club, if you will, including five tribes in 
Oregon and some 30 tribes nationwide.
    For this reason, I advocated for and we included in last 
year's funding bill $7 million for startup funding for the 
Department to begin consultations with tribes to determine the 
extent of the problem and to provide a small amount of base 
funding to the tribes that now want to participate who would 
otherwise be eligible but have been excluded so far. Can you 
update us on how the consultation is proceeding and how the 
money will be spent under this program?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Chairman, and we appreciate 
the support on that. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is finalizing 
the list of eligible Tribes, and we expect to deliver that to 
Congress in the coming weeks. As soon as that list is provided, 
we will announce the consultation with the impacted tribes 
regarding how the funding should be allocated.
    Senator Merkley. And do you have some sense of how the 
allocation formula might work?
    Secretary Haaland. We are happy to get back with your 
office on those specific details.
    [The information follows:]
    tribes not subject to public law 83-280 that do not receive law 
  enforcement services or funding from the office of justice services
    The table below identifies the Tribes eligible for the additional 
funds provided by Congress in FY 2023. BIA held a consultation 
regarding this issue, including on how the funding should be allocated, 
on May 23, 2023. Of the 31 Tribes invited, 10 Tribes attended. The 
deadline for Tribes to request a portion of this funding was extended 
from June 6, 2023 to June 23, 2023. The deadline for submission of 
written comments was also extended to June 23.

                TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT: CRIME PREVENTION

    Senator Merkley. Great. Okay. I am going to turn to the 
second question, which is the budget you have put before us 
proposes $642, I am rounding off, million for Bureau of Indian 
Affairs' public safety and justice programs.
    And boosting the boots on the ground, if you will, across 
Indian country seems to be a central tenet of this request. The 
Tribal Law and Order Act report shows an unmet need of $3.5 
billion for public safety, so we obviously have a huge 
disparity or a huge challenge in that regard. But in addition 
to boots on the ground, is this a goal of, well, preventing 
crime before it happens.
    Always better if a problem never occurs, a crime is never 
committed. Can you describe how your budget addresses not just 
the need for law enforcement, but also crime prevention and the 
Tiwahe Initiative?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you so much for that 
question. First, I will just say that tribal public safety and 
justice are one of the top priorities of Tribes across the 
country. And so, we understand the need for this. I just want 
to say that there is always a need to make sure that we have 
the staffing in those areas.
    And, part of that is making sure that the benefits and pay 
for these tribal communities are at a level that helps them to 
want to stay where they are. We have had a problem with 
retention, you know, we train tribal police officers up and 
then they find a better paying job elsewhere.
    And so, we are working very hard to retain the staff that 
we have in those areas. And I think that is one of the largest 
issues.
    Senator Merkley. And this particular initiative that began 
in 2015, as I understand it, Tiwahe, means family in the Lakota 
language and symbolizes the interconnectedness of all beings, 
and was launched with a series of pilot projects in six 
communities with the goal of reducing crime on the front end. 
Any update on how those pilot programs are going?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we will be happy to update your 
staff specifically on the Tiwahe initiative, if that is okay 
with you. I will get with you soon.

              INDIAN AFFAIRS SECTION 105(1) LEASE PROGRAM

    Senator Merkley. Thank you. That would be great. And then I 
am happy to see the President's budget requests reclassifying 
contract support costs and 105(l) building leases as mandatory 
funding. And you know, that is a mouthful, contract support 
costs and 105(l) leases. And what are those?
    Well, essentially, they are the administrative overhead and 
leasing costs that a tribe bears when it options to self-
Government. And twin court cases have affirmed that the Federal 
Government is required to reimburse tribes for these costs, and 
I want to emphasize that word, ``required''.
    And so, what are these costs, really? Well, what they are 
is the cost of a tribe exercising its sovereignty to run their 
own programs. And for this reason, the term that I have been 
encouraging is to call these tribal sovereignty payments 
because they are required, and therefore, it makes sense that 
they are done as mandatory funding.
    And so, I don't know if that term is one that resonates 
with you, but I thought I would ask you in terms of its role. 
And if you would like to elaborate on this goal of having those 
two required expenses classified as mandatory funding.
    Secretary Haaland. I appreciate your support of this, 
Chairman. And yes, I mean, you said it all. They are required 
by law. These costs are not optional. And so, it stands to 
reason that there is no option for this, so we have to pay.
    So, for example, if a Tribe requests compensation for the 
use of law enforcement facilities they built and paid for, the 
BIA must develop a 105(l) lease agreement and provide the 
associated funding. So, these are things that we have to do. 
So, we appreciate the support on that. And thank you for 
supporting Tribes.
    Senator Merkley. Do you like that term, tribal sovereignty 
fees?
    Secretary Haaland. I think it is great.
    Senator Merkley. Great. Thank you. I will turn this over to 
Senator Murkowski.

                           KING COVE, ALASKA

    Senator Murkowski. Madam Secretary, let's begin with the 
first part of my opening statement, which was reference to the 
people of King Cove. And I talked about the medevacs. We want 
to put that into just nothing more than bad memories.
    But there have been more than 200 medevacs that King Cove 
has endured over the past 9 years, 28 of those by the Coast 
Guard. Risks their crew lives, costs tax taxpayer dollars. You 
have heard it all.
    You have not yet had an opportunity to speak on the record 
yet about what your Department is doing with regards to the 
situation in King Cove and why. So, if you can this morning say 
to the committee about why your Department withdrew from the 
land exchange agreement, and more importantly, what can you 
tell the Alaska Native people of King Cove to assure them that 
you will finally be the Secretary that protects their health 
and safety?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Senator, for that 
question. So, the land exchange that we withdrew, as I 
mentioned to you when we spoke, was essentially flawed. And we 
felt that by the time it wound its way through, that it would 
take a very long time and that perhaps we could work toward a 
better solution in a quicker timeframe.
    With respect to the people of King Cove. Yes, I have 
visited there, like it happened yesterday. My time there with 
them and with you last year resonates with me, and I have met 
twice with them virtually and once in person. So, I have heard 
the stories and I understand how difficult it is for the people 
there to get the services they need.
    We also visited the clinic. There is no way for them to--it 
can't be, Anchorage General Hospital on King Cove. The medical 
services they get there are limited, so we completely 
understand that, too. And the weather.
    So, doctors can't even get into the community at times. So, 
we understand all of those challenges, and I really want to 
find a solution for the people of King Cove so that they don't 
have to worry about getting the medical care that they need.
    You know, what I said in my last meeting virtually with the 
leadership at King Cove was that, I know that people tell them, 
move to Anchorage. Why don't you move somewhere where you can 
get the health care you need? And that is not for us to decide.
    We have, our Department has, an obligation to our nation's 
Indian Tribes. We have a trust and treaty obligation. That 
absolutely includes health care, education, housing, and so 
forth. We are committed to ensuring that the people of King 
Cove can once and for all find a solution to this terrible 
tragedy in so many ways.
    And so, I just want you to know that two of my high level 
staff were just there in King Cove yesterday. As promised, we 
are following through with our commitment to meet with them, to 
keep them informed.
    We want to make sure that we are informing them every step 
of the way. And so, I just want to let you know that I am 
committed to a solution there.
    Senator Murkowski. And Madam Secretary, I appreciate that 
you say you are committed to a solution. Are you committed to a 
land exchange that will allow for the ten-mile, one lane 
gravel, noncommercial use road that will allow the people of 
King Cove to gain access to transportation, to take them to the 
public health facilities that they need?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, all of these things are pre-
decisional and I don't want to cause any part of this to fail 
on my part. So, I just want to assure you that we are committed 
to a viable solution for the people of King Cove. And we will 
keep them informed of that.
    Senator Murkowski. You and I recognize that processes like 
a land exchange cannot be done with a snap of a finger. Cannot 
be done overnight. They take time. We can all count backwards 
from the end of a term.
    We can all look at steps along the way when it comes to a 
required Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and how long the 
process takes. And I would suggest to you that we do not have 
unlimited time to do this under your watch. And if you are 
committing to the people of King Cove and you are committing to 
me that you will find a solution that will address their public 
safety concerns. We don't have the luxury of time.
    And so, the promise to just keep us informed, in my view, 
is not satisfactory. If we are going to accomplish this, if we 
are going to address the wrongs that have been, have literally 
been perpetuated on these native people by a Government that 
basically came in and said this area that you have utilized, 
that you have used for access, for hunting, for your cabins, we 
are going to designate as a wilderness, as a refuge area, and 
no consultation, no input whatsoever, just cut off. You know 
that is not right. They know that is not right.
    And we need to rectify this. We have been working on this 
now for over 30 years. Two hundred medevacs, people died and 
you have talked to, you have heard from those whose lives have 
been forever changed by the inability to gain access to a 
simple, one lane gravel, and noncommercial use road. It ought 
to not be this hard.
    I need you to be this warrior. I want us to be looking at 
how we can legislate, because we know that that will be the 
quicker route. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much, Senator. I am going 
to turn to the chair of the Appropriations committee, Senator 
Murray.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Merkley 
and Ranking Member Murkowski. I am really pleased that both of 
you are leading this important subcommittee, because I know 
both of you understand, like Vice Chair Collins and I do, that 
we have a responsibility to work in a timely fashion, in a 
bipartisan way, to pass these funding bills that keep our 
families safe and our nation strong and competitive.
    So, I look forward to working with both of you to do just 
that as we return to regular order. And this hearing is an 
important reminder on how these issues this subcommittee deals 
with are critical to all of our families back home. For one, we 
have to make sure our nation lives up to its commitment to our 
tribes, providing the necessary Federal support and honoring 
our commitment to their sovereignty.
    That is why I want to underscore my support for Chair 
Merkley's efforts on tribal sovereignty payments. We also have 
a moral obligation to leave the next generation a world in 
better shape than we found it. So, we have to keep in mind 
defense spending isn't the only way that we protect our nation.
    The critical issues we are talking about here today are 
directly connected to the security of our country and the 
strength of our economy. We have to protect and restore our 
environment so we can pass on to our kids clean air and 
thriving forests and healthy ecosystems that support strong 
communities.
    And we must ensure that our kids have safe drinking water 
free of lead contamination and harmful chemicals like Per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Our national parks are 
national treasures, bringing in tourists and dollars from 
around the world to local communities in every corner of our 
nation, and giving our families a great place to see the 
outdoors and explore our country.
    They also remind us that our security and our strength 
directly connected to how well we care for our environment, our 
ability to tackle the climate crisis, for instance, because 
families are less safe when climate disasters become more 
frequent, when wildfires devastate our communities.
    Any Western State can tell you that when ecosystems are 
upended by invasive species, like we are dealing with European 
green crab in Washington State right now, or when rising 
temperatures create prolonged droughts impacting our farmers 
and our wildlife and our day-to-day life.
    And when we fail to prevent and respond to those disasters, 
we are weaker and less competitive in the world as well. In my 
home State of Washington, salmon is a way of life. They are a 
huge part of our economy, our history, and our culture. 
Protecting and restoring salmon habitat and increasing salmon 
runs is key to our state's strength and its future. And saving 
salmon is also a part of meeting our obligation to our tribes.
    And there are so many other examples like this that make 
clear why protecting our land and our water and our air and our 
environment is so important to our country's future. So, I am 
very glad to have this opportunity to just discuss how we can 
invest in doing just that, to strengthen our nation. So, 
Secretary Haaland, welcome to the committee.

                           SALMON HATCHERIES

    Senator Murray. As I mentioned, salmon is a way of life in 
my home State. Can you talk about how this budget will help 
with salmon recovery and what investments will support hatchery 
maintenance and operations?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Chair Murray. And 
yes, salmon is a way of life for so many communities, and I 
have been able to visit many of those communities, so I 
understand that it is not just the food you eat, but it is a 
cultural way of life for so many people.
    I am very proud of our fish hatcheries. In fact, I went to 
a fish hatchery when I was in Oregon just a couple of weeks 
ago. Around 1 million to 2 million salmon now return to the 
Columbia Basin annually. Of those, a majority are hatchery 
fish. Those are important entities that we want to make sure 
that we support.
    The budget maintains support for hatchery operations and 
includes a significant increase of $15 million to address 
hatchery deferred maintenance work. The budget proposes an $80 
million for national fish hatchery operations, a $7 million 
increase including $23 million for hatchery maintenance and 
equipment.
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you. Well, this is something I 
follow very closely, as I know both of our committee chair and 
ranking member will as well. I wanted to ask you about the 
European green crab.
    It is a globally damage invasive species that is of 
particular concern in my home State. We need to get ahead of 
this now to protect the native crab populations. How does U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service intend to work with National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration to address this threat?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you. Invasive species, of course, 
across the country is a giant concern for all of us. The Fish 
and Wildlife Service continues to coordinate and participate in 
European green crab control efforts.
    And we work with partners, they work with partners to 
develop a draft national control plan, and that is expected in 
April. And also, the Fish and Wildlife Service conducts early 
detection, monitoring, control, and removal of these crabs on 
Pacific Northwest refuges, the refuges that Fish and Wildlife 
Service manages.
    It also provides grants to States to implement statewide 
aquatic nuisance species management plans. We will work with 
States to make sure that we can help with this invasive 
species.

                        DOI-WIDE DROUGHT EFFORTS

    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you. We will be working with 
you on this as we move forward. And finally, in the west, 
wildfire and droughts are actually two sides of the same coin. 
While this year's atmospheric rivers have given us a lot of 
rain, we know that climate change is impacting the long-term 
hydrology across our country.
    I recently spoke with Commissioner Townsend about 
reclamation work on drought. So, I wanted to ask you about 
agencies within Interior, how do they work in tandem to deal 
with the issue of drought?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you. So, we take an all of 
Department of Interior approach to address drought, 
specifically in the West, because we know we need to build long 
term resilience. And that includes making sure that we are 
working not only with States, local communities, but also with 
Indian tribes.
    The Geological Survey, as well as the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, both play a critical role in working to remedy these 
impacts of our changing climate. And they provide actionable 
science for land and water managers that inform resource 
management activities.
    In 2024, the U.S. Geological Survey proposes $6.5 million 
to provide resource managers with decision support tools to 
better understand this issue.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much, Chair Murray. And we 
are going to turn to Senator Fischer.

                    AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL INITIATIVE

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member. Madam Secretary, thank you for being here today. I 
would like to start by discussing the Administration's America 
the Beautiful Initiative. Could you tell us to date how much 
funding has DOI spent on implementing the America the Beautiful 
Initiative?
    Secretary Haaland. I appreciate the question. And I would 
actually, if it is okay with you, Senator, we can get back to 
your office with the exact funding. I don't have that in front 
of me at the moment.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. For example, can you tell me if 
staffing resources have been used to plan for it, coordinate, 
implement, or track the initiative?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you so much. The America the 
Beautiful supports public/private conservation partnerships for 
example we have $140 million, which is an increase of $34 
million for Fish and Wildlife Service partnership programs. I 
apologize, I just got the list.
    If that is okay, I will tell it to you. $182 million, which 
is an increase of $8 million for Fish and Wildlife Service 
Conservation Grant Programs, where people can apply for those 
grants to help their projects. And $306 million for National 
Park Service (NPS) Land and Water Conservation Fund grants.
    Senator Fischer. Now, is that funding that has been 
currently spent or what you are planning to spend?
    Secretary Haaland. Well, we are asking for increases in our 
going partnership programs and conservation grants.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. I know in in your request, you have 
listed the America the Beautiful Initiative at least 86 times 
throughout the budget justification. I just wanted to bring to 
your attention that Nebraska is a private property State. 
Ninety-seven percent of our land is privately owned.
    And as we look at this initiative, the fact that there is 
no clear authorization or appropriations from Congress means 
that there is no guardrails that is there, and I don't believe 
there is any accountability for how you would spend those 
funds. So that has caused a lot of concern with my 
constituents.
    In fact, we have at least 70 counties in Nebraska that have 
issued resolutions of disapproval for the 30 by 30 initiative. 
Nebraskans are concerned that this effort is an attempt at a 
land grab by the Federal Government at worst, and it is a 
failure of the Administration to recognize that private 
landowners are the best managers of their land at best.
    So, given the level of concern that we see from Nebraskans 
and the majority of Nebraskans, can you tell me how the 
Administration and how you are defining conservation in 
relationship to the goal that is listed with the America the 
Beautiful Initiative, and how much land today would meet that 
definition?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you. First of all, I will say that 
we are working on an atlas that would essentially, count the 
land and track conservation efforts. We also want to mention 
that the America the Beautiful initiative, is really based on 
locally led conservation.
    There are a lot of private landowners who feel very 
strongly about conserving resources on their lands, and they 
designate certain areas for certain things or animals. And so, 
we are happy to work with private landowners.
    We know that they are the best stewards of their own lands 
as well, and we respect and appreciate that. So, it supports 
locally led conservation partnerships. Those are the 
conversations we are having now. I recognize that there might 
be a concern, but the America the Beautiful Initiative is based 
on a voluntary opportunity for----
    Senator Fischer. Right. But I would point out, as you are 
working on this and working with mapping, Congress hasn't 
provided any funds for this initiative. And I believe your job 
is to implement programs that Congress has provided funds for.
    So, I would appreciate an accounting of any past or planned 
expenditures that you have, salaries, programs, IT, 
reprograming, and the whole thing. That is going to, I think, 
be very helpful as we look at the Interior appropriations bill. 
So, I hope that you do follow up with my staff.
    Secretary Haaland. We absolutely. Thank you, Senator.
    [The information follows:]
           america the beautiful expenditures--past & planned
    The America the Beautiful is an interagency initiative to support 
locally led, partnership driven conservation and restoration 
nationwide. Interior is an active Federal partner in supporting the 
initiative driven by our mission and responsibilities for land and 
resource management. DOI's participation in America the Beautiful comes 
through established DOI programs which support the goals of the 
initiative, but the Department does not track funding for it as it 
would a formal program.
    During the hearing, Secretary Haaland gave examples of funding 
requested for several DOI programs which help to support the objectives 
of America the Beautiful including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. The budget proposes $79.7 
million in FY 2024 for the Partners program, an increase of $19.5 
million above FY 2023 enacted. The program is authorized by the 
Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act (16 U.S.C. 3771- 3774) to establish 
a program that works with private landowners to conduct cost-effective 
habitat projects for the benefit of fish and wildlife resources in the 
United States.
    The Partners Program works in all 50 States and territories, to 
consult with landowners to help them conserve and improve wildlife 
habitat. Landowner conservation is important because nearly 70 percent 
of land in the United States is privately owned. Public and private 
landowners are critical partners in ensuring the health and 
sustainability of America's fish, wildlife and plant species. Projects 
are voluntary and customized to meet landowners' needs. Participating 
landowners continue to own and manage their land while they improve 
conditions for wildlife.
    Many Partners for Fish and Wildlife projects take place on working 
landscapes such as forests, farms and ranches. FWS efforts focus on 
areas of conservation concern, such as upland forests, wetlands, native 
prairies, marshes, rivers and streams and designing projects to benefit 
Federal trust species including migratory birds, endangered, threatened 
and at-risk species.
    All private landowners interested in restoring wildlife habitat on 
their land are eligible to participate. Current partners include 
farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, recreational landowners, 
corporations, local governments and universities. In addition to 
private landowners, the program partners with other Federal agencies, 
State agencies and non-governmental organizations to complete projects 
on private lands. Participating landowners do not forfeit any property 
rights and are not required to allow public access.
    Another example mentioned at the hearing is the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund State Grants program managed by the National Park 
Service, which was permanently reauthorized in the Great American 
Outdoors Act. The program receives mandatory funding which is allocated 
annually by Congress through Appropriations. The budget proposes $305.5 
million in FY 2024 for these competitive and formula matching grants to 
States.
    The State grants support the acquisition and development of land 
and facilities that will provide the public with access to new 
opportunities to engage in outdoor recreation. Grants to States also 
provide for continuing State planning efforts to address outdoor 
recreation needs. Since 1965, more than $5.2 billion has been 
apportioned to the States, resulting in the award of over 45,000 
grants. States, Tribes, and localities have matched this amount at 
least dollar-for-dollar, doubling the Federal investment.
    This program has successfully allowed States to take greater 
responsibility for the protection and development of open space and 
outdoor recreation resources. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act 
of 1965 (54 U.S.C. 2003), provides funds and authorization for funding 
to the States in planning, acquisition, and development of needed land 
and water areas and facilities.

                        ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING

    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Thank you very much. Also, 
within the President's budget request, it includes one $171.4 
million to increase the environmental permitting capacity of 
the Fish and Wildlife Service.
    And DOI has requested Congress to provide legislative 
authority for other agencies to transfer funds from the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill to the Fish and Wildlife Service 
for Endangered Species Act consultations. I voted for the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill, and I voted for it to build 
infrastructure, not to fund Federal Government permitting. And 
I want to be very, very blunt about this.
    I will strongly oppose moving any of those taxpayer dollars 
from the bipartisan infrastructure bill that we passed on a 
bipartisan basis to increase any more Federal permitting. I am 
curious on what actions you have taken to streamline the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultations to ensure that they 
are not holding up bipartisan infrastructure dollars.
    Secretary Haaland. Endangered Species Act, yes. Thank you. 
First of all, we are happy to get back with you on all of the 
things that you asked us about. We are happy to contact your 
staff as soon as we get back to the office. The Endangered 
Species Act, is 50 years old and has been a godsend to so many 
animals. The animals--you know, what we try to do really is 
recovery.
    We work with communities, people on the ground, local 
Governments to ensure that we recover species. And we really 
don't want to lose species. We want to make sure that we are 
doing the work ahead of time so that they don't get to that 
level.
    Senator Fischer. Right. But you should not be using 
bipartisan infrastructure bill dollars in order to do that. 
That should be, in my opinion, a separate line item for that 
agency to take care of the Act. So, I see my time is up. If we 
can follow up with my staff, I would sincerely appreciate.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, we will. Thank you.
    [The information follows:]
             streamlining esa consultations on bil projects
    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is working diligently to 
help Federal action agencies advance their BIL and IRA projects on 
schedule, which includes meeting their statutory ESA section 7 
responsibilities in a defensible manner. To handle the large, 
anticipated increase for Section 7 consultation services, FWS is 
focused on building the capacity needed to carry out the consultations 
and environmental reviews to assist agencies consistent with their 
project schedules. For FY 2024, the President's budget for FWS requests 
$171.4 million for planning and consultation activities, an increase of 
$50.5 million which would support an increase of 225 FTEs to address 
the anticipated demand.
    FWS is also working to develop funding agreements with BIL-funded 
agencies. Division J of the BIL authorized the Forest Service (USFS) to 
transfer funds to the FWS to ensure adequate staff capacity to provide 
ESA section 7 consultation to support Wildfire Risk Reduction 
activities. The USFS and FWS developed an interagency transfer funding 
agreement that provides the funds to hire dedicated consultation staff, 
establishes standard national processes for coordinating on workload 
and funding needs, and clarifies expectations around deliverables, 
accountability, reporting, and issue resolution. The dedicated staffing 
established through this agreement ensures FWS can adequately assist 
the USFS to deliver on their specific priority projects and 
implementation schedule. FWS has successfully developed similar funding 
agreements with the DOI Office of Wildland Fire and the BLM and is 
actively pursuing other funding agreements with additional BIL-funded 
agencies.
    While authority already exists to enter into reimbursable funding 
agreements with other BIL- funded agencies, the FY 2024 President's 
Budget also proposes appropriations language to provide BIL-funded 
agencies funds transfer authority to support agreements with the FWS to 
carry out ESA section 7 consultations. This additional authority would 
help expedite interagency agreements for section 7 activities and 
minimize processing time and overhead costs as compared to other forms 
of interagency funding agreements.
    FWS is also working to facilitate environmental reviews and 
consultations by continuing to invest in and enhance a web-based 
project planning and consultation tool called IPaC (Information 
Planning and Consultation system). IPaC streamlines the environmental 
review process. One of the most active public uses for IPaC is to 
receive an official species list as part of early project planning and 
design. Through IPaC, Federal agencies or partners can draw a polygon 
over a specific area in the U.S. and receive a list of all of the 
federally listed, proposed, and candidate species that may be present 
in that location. In FY 2022, the IPaC program generated over 103,500 
species lists in response to user requests. This online system allows 
FWS biologists to work in real-time with project managers from other 
Federal agencies as they review documents and identify areas of concern 
during the environmental review process.
    Additional investments can tailor IPaC functionality to the needs 
of specific action agencies and greatly streamline consultations on 
many types of routine predictable agency actions.

    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator Fischer. Senator 
Peters.

                   GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Haaland, 
it is great to see you here today, and thank you for all of the 
work that you are doing in a very important position. 
Secretary, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was 
established in 2009 to accelerate efforts to protect and 
restore one of the largest systems of fresh water on the 
surface in the entire world, and that is the Great Lakes.
    And as Michiganders, the Great Lakes are not only in our 
DNA, but are a critical resource for drinking water. In fact, 
over 40 million people drink water out of the Great Lakes, 
economic growth as well as job creation. And since 2010, the 
GLRI has provided over a $2.9 billion to fund more than 6,000 
projects throughout the Great Lakes region, including $762 
million for 880 projects just in Michigan alone.
    As one of 16 Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) 
regional working group members, the Department of the Interior 
awards competitive grants to assist organizations and 
communities who are taking very creative approaches to improve 
habitats as well as overall water quality.
    So, my question for you, ma'am, is can you speak to how the 
Department of Interior utilizes GLRI funding to help improve 
water quality, and in the process will accelerate Great Lakes 
protection, as well as restoration?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator. Our bureaus work closely with the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the Great Lakes--as part of 
this initiative. It is an important program for us, and we are 
grateful that we can partner on those things.
    The United States Geological Survey (USGS) work through the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative focuses on research to 
prevent the establishment of invasive carps in the Great Lakes. 
And as you mentioned, invasive species is an issue across the 
country.
    Our scientists, the USGS scientists are also leading 
efforts in the Great Lakes to adaptively manage common reed, 
improve control of zebra and quagga mussels, and control 
invasive crayfishes.
    So, with our budget, we propose $104 million for work in 
the Great Lakes including USGS Research, Fish and Wildlife 
Service Conservation restoration work, refuges and facility 
operations and National Park operations.
    Senator Peters. Wonderful. Well, we appreciate your 
continued focus on that. The other issue that I am particularly 
interested in discussing with you involves National Park 
employee wages, specifically looking at them at a more granular 
level to better reflect the cost of living that they face based 
on where they may be working.
    You know, for instance, employees working at the Sleeping 
Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, located in Northern Michigan, 
might be paid a lower rate than those working at a Park Service 
site, say, in Detroit.
    But the cost of living, especially for seasonal workers, is 
extremely high. So, when I was up there recently visiting you, 
you have an amazing park facility there. But it is a fairly 
remote area and the only housing available is immediately 
around the park. And especially in peak season with tourism, 
that is prime, prime real estate.

                 PARK EMPLOYEE HOUSING AND RECRUITMENT

    Senator Peters. And it is difficult for folks to find 
housing, particularly in Michigan, which is very seasonal as 
they come up in the summer. Trying to get employees and workers 
is incredibly difficult given the cost of living just around 
the confines of the park, that they would have to travel very 
long distances in order to be there and it causes a real 
problem.
    So, I would hope that the panel will take a closer look and 
deciding how to the pay needs are different depending on park 
locations and in a more granular level than is currently used, 
and would hope to get your commitment to look at that and 
certainly welcome any thoughts you have on how we might 
approach it.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. Housing is an issue across 
the country, and in many of our national parks, the gateway 
communities we know are expensive. And so, we work with 
partners.
    And not only that, but climate change has been an issue as 
well. Some housing was washed away, quite frankly, at 
Yellowstone in the last flood they had. So, we are working on 
the housing issue and we are working to bring people together 
to figure that out.
    But also, I just want to assure you that we have Government 
wide recruitment and retention incentives available, and those 
are available to all agencies, and so we are working hard to 
make sure that we can offer those incentives, those pay 
incentives to the folks who take these important jobs in those 
remote areas.
    So, we will keep you informed, but appreciate you caring 
about that. And we know that there are two sides to that, the 
housing plus the pay, so we are working on both.
    Senator Peters. Right. Good. Good to hear. We will look 
forward to continuing to work with you as well. National 
heritage areas have also proven a record of fostering job 
creation and advancing economic, cultural, historic, natural, 
as well as community development.
    And in addition to creating jobs, national heritage areas 
generate valuable revenue for local Governments and help 
sustain Governments through revitalization efforts, as well as 
heritage tourism, which is a larger growing industry.
    They have enjoyed very long-standing bipartisan support, 
and through an innovative public, private partnership, NHAs 
have effectively leveraged Federal resources, attracting on 
average of $5.50 of private funding for each dollar 
appropriated, providing nearly a 6 to 1 return on investments 
for taxpayers, which is a pretty powerful investment.
    Having spent a lot of years in the investment business 
prior to being in public service, if you tell investor for 
every dollar you invest, you get six people are usually very 
happy with that. And Michigan Motor City's national heritage 
area alone has created an economic impact of nearly $490 
million.
    My question for you, Madam Secretary. Last year's passage 
of the National Heritage Area Act authorizing seven new NHAs, 
could you speak to the importance of ensuring that this program 
has the necessary funding to be effective and successful in all 
of these new areas?

                        NATIONAL HERITAGE AREAS

    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. Well, we always appreciate 
locally driven partnerships and (NHAs) are one way that people 
invest there, so thank you for that. The 2024 budget maintains 
funding for NHA's at the 2023 level. It is $29 million.
    The funding includes initial support for the areas 
established in 2023, at $150,000 each, and reduces amounts for 
areas which received more than $500,000 in 2023. So, we are 
working to balance out funding. We will support them as much as 
we can and appreciate your support as well.
    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Mr. Chairman, 
thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator Peters. Senator Britt.

                        WARRIOR MET COAL PERMIT

    Senator Britt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member. 
Madam Secretary, thank you for being here today and testifying 
before this committee. Our nation's public lands are an amazing 
resource and we have a responsibility to manage them 
effectively.
    Effective stewardship, however, does not mean simply 
closing them off from all humanity. Stewardship of our public 
lands includes finding appropriate economic development to 
sustain local businesses and our national economy.
    Warrior Met Coal is one of our U.S. companies trying to 
work with the Federal Government to be a good steward of our 
public lands. Warrior Met Coal is an important economic driver 
in the State of Alabama.
    They employ 1,000 people and are the largest customer of 
our port of Mobile. The company focuses on mining met coal. And 
as you know, met coal is a specific type of coal needed to make 
specialty steel used for roads, bridges, automobiles, renewable 
energy components, and a wide array of other critical uses.
    The Department currently has a moratorium on the mining of 
thermal coal, which is used for energy production. However, we 
know that met coal is not the same as thermal coal, and the 
Department of Justice has stated that met coal is not subject 
to the reinstatement of the Federal coal moratorium.
    Warrior Met Coal has had an application with the Department 
of Interior to develop 24 million tons of met coal on Federal 
lands right next to their current operations in Tuscaloosa 
County, Alabama. Warrior Met developed their application in 
cooperation with the Department, a process they started in 2009 
and then restarted in 2014.
    They have jumped through every hoop that the Department has 
asked because they want to make sure that they are good 
stewards of our public lands. Frustratingly, it has been nearly 
a year since they have received a substantial update from the 
Department. We believe that enough is enough.
    We find the lack of transparency and communication entirely 
unacceptable, as do many Alabamians negatively impacted by this 
bureaucratic stonewall. The only feedback the company has heard 
is, ``the environmental analyst for this application is 
currently under technical and legal review.''
    Madam Secretary, how long do you think a complete 
application should take to review? It would seem to me that 
this is something that we could commit to finishing in a few 
weeks, and if not, months.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator. And I know that these things can be frustrating some 
time. What I will say that the BLM has made me aware of the 
importance of this project to you and the State, and I 
understand that it is under review and ongoing now.
    An important part of the BLM's review is ensuring that it 
is consistent with any and all court decisions, recent court 
decisions, and so I know that they are working through all of 
those issues as well.
    We are more than happy to make sure that you get updated, 
that we get in touch with your staff and update you on the 
status of this project. I wish there was more that I could 
report now, but as soon as we can, you know, get a firm update, 
we are happy to get back in touch with you. I know that is not 
what you want to hear, but we will do our best.
    Senator Britt. Madam Secretary, I appreciate it. And what I 
hear from you is a commitment to keep me updated on this. I 
would love to have your senior staff come over and brief me on 
any problems with the application.
    We have a lot of jobs and people who are working to achieve 
the American dream and all of that is hanging in the balance on 
this decision and we want to be good stewards of the land. We 
want to make this work in a way that works with the Department. 
We are doing our part.
    We need you all to do yours. So will you commit to me that 
you will send senior staff over to brief me on any type of 
impediments that we are having so that we can find a way to 
work through those and get this back on track.
    Secretary Haaland. One of my staff will be in touch with 
your staff very soon and we will figure out a time and day that 
suits you.
    Senator Britt. Thank you. I very much appreciate that. 
Completing that application would mean a great deal not only to 
the hardworking men and women at Warrior Met, but obviously the 
community and the Port of Mobile and our State, so I appreciate 
that.
    Also, we want to make sure that everyone understands that 
the status quo just keeps the Chinese Communist Party in 
control and they produce the same kind of coal with obviously 
without environmental standards that we have in the U.S., so I 
think improving this lease would elevate our economy, keep 
production of this critical met coal in the U.S., and provide a 
cleaner solution than what we are doing for what they are doing 
there in China. So, I believe it is a win for everyone.
    So, look forward to meeting with your staff and figuring 
out how we can cut through the red tape. Madam Secretary, I 
want to flag for you that the Biden Administration's new Waters 
of the U.S. rule is particularly harmful for the State of 
Alabama.
    This new rule is going to negatively impact over 64,000 
small businesses in the great State of Alabama. Did you have a 
chance to review the rule during the interagency review 
process?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I apologize. I will have to get 
back with you about that rule, and we are happy to be in touch 
with you about that.
    [The information follows:]
           interagency review of the waters of the u.s. rule
    The Department of the Interior Department was provided the 
opportunity to review the Waters of the United States rule during the 
rule making process; and did not provide feedback.

    Senator Britt. Okay.
    Secretary Haaland. And noted your opposition to it.
    Senator Britt. Yes. I just, I am hopeful that it wasn't 
rushed through for political purposes. This has significant 
impact. Alabama has a lot of private landowners adjacent to 
public lands.
    And as I consistently say, there are no greater stewards of 
our lands than our farmers, our foresters, and our cattlemen. 
And when we increase the burdens on these private landowners, 
we make it hard for them to care for their lands.
    And when their lands are harder to steward, I believe it 
has a negative impact on taking care of our public lands.
    So, I hope that you will consider taking a look at this. I 
would love to have further dialog so that we can make sure that 
protecting our public lands by defending private landowners 
from unnecessary burdens that our Government places on them. 
One last final question, since I have a few more seconds.
    I am also concerned about the Biden Administration's 
consistent opposition to oil and gas. I want you to know that 
the Green New Deal policies and the foot dragging have 
downstream impacts for the people of Alabama. Two years ago, a 
gallon of gasoline in Alabama cost less than two bucks. Since 
then, prices have risen over 50 percent.
    Alabamans depend on affordable gas to get groceries to 
drive to work, to pick up their kids from school, and to go to 
church. I hope that you and the rest of this Administration 
will start considering how the Green New Deal policies are 
failing the American people. Thank you very much for your time, 
and I look forward to following up on these important issues.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you.
    Senator Tester. Senator Van Hollen.

                             CHESAPEAKE BAY

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Tester. 
Madam Secretary, great to see you. Thank you for your service. 
I know you have got a lot of territory to cover at the 
Department of Interior of the entire United States, but I don't 
think you will be surprised that I focus on the Chesapeake Bay 
watershed.
    And when it comes to protecting this national treasure and 
natural treasure, the EPA has a very important role when it 
comes to water quality. But the Department of Interior also has 
important roles through the Fish and Wildlife Service, through 
the National Park Service, and some of the other agencies.
    So, one of the things we created in Congress on a 
bipartisan basis years ago was the Wild Program under the Fish 
and Wildlife Service to protect habitat around the Chesapeake 
Bay and also protect the water quality of the bay.
    It was also consistent with President Biden's America the 
Beautiful plan, protecting 30 percent of our lands. So, Madam 
Secretary, I will say I was very disappointed, very 
disappointed that the budget that was submitted by the Biden 
Administration zeroed out the funding for this program.
    It was $8 million provided by Congress last year. In your 
budget submission, it was zero. You have given lots of vocal 
support to protecting the bay, but you are in front of an 
appropriations committee.
    We tend to measure commitment by whether it is backed up by 
resources and investment. So, could you just talk about that 
decision and whether you remain committed, nevertheless, to 
protecting the Chesapeake Bay?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Senator. And yes, 
we are committed to the Chesapeake Bay. Personally, I have been 
going there since I was a kid, so I completely understand that. 
It is an important resource.
    The ecosystem is important. Our budget includes $36 million 
for work in the Chesapeake Bay, including restoration 
activities and management of parks and refuge lands. And the 
goals of the Chesapeake WILD are consistent with the 
Administration's emphasis on locally driven conservation and 
equitable access to the outdoors. So, we will absolutely 
continue to make sure that Chesapeake Bay is a priority for us.
    Senator Van Hollen. All right, Madam Secretary. I be 
working within this committee with my colleague, Senator 
Tester, the chair, the ranking member, and others, and I am 
confident we will restore it.
    But it does not send a good signal about the Department of 
Interior's commitment to the Chesapeake Bay that that program 
got the zeroed out. I understand there are other issues there. 
I do want to commend you and the National Park Service for the 
work done by the National Parks Services Office in Annapolis.
    We are working here on the Hill to establish a Chesapeake 
National Recreation area, and the superintendent there and the 
Department of Interior have provided important technical 
assistance to our efforts.
    Congressman Sarbanes, in the House and I in the Senate, 
hope to introduce legislation to establish the Chesapeake 
National Recreation Area in the coming months and look forward 
to working with you and your team to get that done. Do we have 
your commitment to work with us on that?
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. Yes, we will work with you 
on everything, Senator.
    Senator Van Hollen. Yes. No, I look, I understand the 
budgets have to go through OMB. I get that. But I was 
surprised. I just have to say, on the zeroing out the Wild 
program.

                       NPS CHEASAPEAKE BAY OFFICE

    The other issue regards the Chesapeake Bay office of the 
National Park Service, because in last year's budget, you 
provided an increase in that budget to help it with its 
operations, which also include administering right now what is 
called the Chesapeake Gateways and Trails Program.
    After we passed the budget, that additional increase for 
the Annapolis National Park Service was not implemented. So, 
this year, we are going to be working with you and your team to 
make sure that the increases that are reflected in your own 
budget are passed on.
    And we think this is a priority. So, do we have your 
commitment to work on that?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes. And the budget for the Chesapeake 
Bay office in 2024 is $1.05 million. So, we will make sure that 
that office gets the----
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. No, yes, as I said, what 
happened with last year was the number in the budget was one 
thing, but when it was actually implemented, that increase for 
that office did not go through.
    So, when we see the number of increase, we really need to 
make sure that office is funded. They are taking on a lot of 
responsibility right now. Let me just turn finally to offshore 
wind deployment. Maryland has a very ambitious offshore wind 
program, and I shouldn't say ambitious because we are actually 
implementing it.

                       OFFSHORE WIND IN MARYLAND

    We are going to have two major offshore wind projects which 
will power, provide power for over 600,000 Maryland homes and 
is estimated to provide 10,000 jobs. In fact, the Department of 
Commerce has already been providing grants on apprenticeships 
and workforce training. This is all very, very real.
    So, we want to make sure that we maximize the ability to, 
you know, catch wind power. There will be issues coming up 
around the total expanse of area that will be available for 
wind power. And we look forward to working with you to try to 
achieve, make sure we can maximize that.
    And I just want your commitment that you will work with us 
to expand the reach of our wind power operations in Maryland 
and the mid-Atlantic.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. Yes, we would love to have 
your support and appreciate it very much.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you and your team. And 
thank you for your service. And look, on this budget issue, I 
know you have to make choices, but this is one that we had been 
led to believe was something that the Department was fully 
committed to. I know you are, but budgets matter.
    Secretary Haaland. I understand. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Hoeven.

                    FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE SALES

    Senator Hoeven. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Secretary, earlier 
this week, a Federal judge issued a preliminary injunction and 
ordered the Department of Interior to resume quarterly Federal 
oil and gas lease sales in North Dakota, Federal District Court 
judge in North Dakota, finding that the BLM failed to follow 
the law and hold lease sales in 2021 and 2022. And so, my 
question to you is, will you commit to complying with the 
court's ruling and within two weeks provide a schedule of 2023 
lease sales for North Dakota on BLM land?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question, Senator. And 
I know that ruling was very recent. We are reviewing that 
ruling and what impact it will have. And of course, we are 
happy to keep you informed as to how we move forward with that 
and appreciate it. But we will follow the law.
    Senator Hoeven. So, you commit to complying with their 
ruling, and will you, within two weeks provide a schedule of 
2023 lease sales for North Dakota on BLM lands?
    Secretary Haaland. I can say that we are committed to 
following the law and we are moving forward with regular 
onshore lease sales.
    Senator Hoeven. When can we anticipate getting a schedule 
from you?
    Secretary Haaland. As soon as we get back to my office, I 
will ask my staff and we are happy to keep you informed.
    [The information follows:]
        status of 2023 blm lease sale schedule for north dakota
    The 2023 North Dakota oil and gas leases are scheduled for the 
following dates:

  --2nd Quarter: June 27, 2023
  --3rd Quarter: September 12, 2023
  --4th Quarter: December 5, 2023

    Senator Hoeven. We would like that schedule so we can 
inform our people.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Senator.

                      APPROVAL OF PREMITS TO DRILL

    Senator Hoeven. Last week I joined Senator Mullin and 
others in sending a letter to BLM Director Tracy Stone Manning 
requesting clarification on the bureau's accounting for 
approval of permits to drill (APD). As you know, BLM recently 
lowered the number of unused APDs from 9,000 to 6,600.
    That puts into question the use of the Biden 
Administration's using erroneous data as a reason not to follow 
the statutory requirement for timely lease sales. Gas prices 
are 41 percent higher nationally than when the President, the 
current President, took office.
    U.S. oil production is down nearly a million barrels a day 
since the current Administration took office. In general, do 
you agree that prices are higher for a product when demand is 
greater than supply?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question, Senator. I 
just want to say that on Federal lands, permits are high. There 
is more production on Federal lands than any time in history, 
right now.
    Senator Hoeven. Do you agree with Energy Secretary 
Granholm's call on oil and gas companies to increase production 
to help minimize harm to American families?
    Secretary Haaland. I appreciate the question. I want you to 
know that we are moving forward with the permitting. And yes, 
the permitting count difference was due to a database failure. 
And since that has been fixed, we still have thousands of 
permits that are unused. So, production is moving forward at a 
very high rate.
    Senator Hoeven. Do you acknowledge that you took--first you 
had a moratorium on production on all Federal lands, then you 
came back and agreed to only 20 percent of the lands being 
available, and you increased the royalty rates by 50 percent. 
Now, do you think that would help increase production or deter 
production in your opinion?
    Secretary Haaland. What I can say is that production is up. 
It's at an all-time high.
    Senator Hoeven. So, you think by restricting access, by 
slowing down permits, and by increasing royalty rates, that 
increases supply? Now, remember, gas prices are almost 50 
percent higher today than when you came into office. And you 
are telling me that you think those actions helped increase 
supply, when we are down a million barrels a day in production, 
domestic production?
    Secretary Haaland. If I could just say, with all due 
respect, Senator, we are moving the permits through, since I 
have been in this position. Our office has continually moved 
permits through and there was a lot of land leased. We are 
moving those permits through. Those are being processed and 
production is at an all-time high currently.

                    ON SHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

    Senator Hoeven. Do you think restricting access to Federal 
lands and increasing royalty rates helps or hurts production 
and supply, which?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I really just want to let you 
know that we are moving those permits through and that 
production is at an all-time high.
    Senator Hoeven. And that is why production in this country 
is down a million barrels a day, right, because of what you are 
telling me.
    Secretary Haaland. The production on Federal lands is not 
down. It is actually up.
    Senator Hoeven. When you talk about Federal lands, very 
often out there, there is a split estate. In other words, there 
is private minerals or minerals owned by non-Federal entities, 
but also owned by Federal entities.
    Because the BLM and other Federal entities are continuing 
to hold up these leases that disenfranchises the other mineral 
owners. Do you think that is fair to those mineral owners and 
what should be done about it?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question, Senator. I 
know that creating efficiencies is helpful all the way around. 
We really want to help solve problems. The BLM's core 
responsibility is to ensure development on Federal lands is 
done in compliance with Federal requirements.
    We are always going to follow the law. Of course, we want 
to be helpful where we can, and we will help to solve problems 
where we can. We are happy to discuss this with you in detail 
and see how we can work together.
    Senator Hoeven. Do you think it is better for our country 
to get oil and gas from Federal lands in this country with our 
environmental standards, or is it better to get it from places 
like Venezuela, Russia, Middle East, and other places with 
vastly inferior environmental standards? Where would you prefer 
that that oil and gas come from?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, what I can say is that 
President Biden is dedicated and committed to making sure that 
we have an energy independent nation.
    Senator Hoeven. But the response to my question, where 
would you prefer to get that oil and gas?
    Secretary Haaland. As I have mentioned many times, the oil 
production in this country is up on Federal lands. We are 
moving those permits through. We are doing our jobs. And I 
appreciate the question.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, but you do acknowledge that you have 
restricted access as far as production on Federal lands and you 
have raised royalty rates. Do you at least acknowledge that?
    Secretary Haaland. We are working to make sure that the 
work on our public lands is balanced, and we care deeply about 
the energy future of this country.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

                          TRIBAL PUBLIC SAFETY

    Senator Tester. I want to start by thanking Senator 
Murkowski and Senator Merkley for having this hearing. I want 
to thank you for being here, Madam Secretary, and your crack 
staff. I appreciate you appearing in front of the committee.
    Normally I would have to explain this situation but you are 
a Native American, I think you understand the situation. I am 
from Montana and I literally hear every week about law-and-
order issues on the ground due to lack of officers and due to 
four facilities. Most recently, it has been the Northern 
Cheyenne.
    But the truth is, it happens in every reservation where we 
don't have adequate facilities and we certainly don't have 
enough law enforcement officers. I understand the BIA has been 
working with the Northern Cheyenne tribe to improve public 
safety. Which, by the way, from my perspective, is a disaster.
    Public safety is a disaster. And I appreciate the BIA 
working, I appreciate you working to try to improve this 
situation. During a meeting with the tribe in January, BIA 
committed to doing everything it can to fill the vacant 
positions, increase community recruitment at the Rocky Mountain 
Regional Detention Facility, and hire a chief of police. Can 
you tell me where the BIA stands in fulfilling those 
commitments?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you so much for your 
commitment to tribes as well. And yes, Tribal public safety and 
law enforcement is probably the most prioritized issues of 
Tribes across the country. So, we hear about it often and we 
work very hard to remedy these situations.
    The BIA, Office of Justice Services (OJS) team is working 
closely with the Indian Affairs Office of Human Capital on 
several strategies to support recruitment and retention. That 
is really one of the big issues. The foremost strategy is the 
pay parity initiative, which will bring BIA law enforcement pay 
levels in line with other Federal law enforcement agencies.
    Senator Tester. And we will get into that in a second. Can 
you tell me, as per the Northern Cheyenne tribe, where we, from 
a BIA perspective, are so fulfilling the commitments. And look, 
Bryan was out there a month or so ago, and I appreciate the 
fact that he was out there multiple times.
    But and I don't have to tell you this because I think you 
know this, literally every day that goes by without them having 
the police that they need, people are dying. And it is not just 
a couple, it is a lot.
    Do you know where the BIA is in the commitment to 
fulfilling the Northern Cheyenne's needs?
    Secretary Haaland. With all due respect, Senator, we will 
get back with you on those specific details of Northern 
Cheyenne, but I want you to know that we all care deeply about 
this.
    [The information follows:]
          addressing northern cheyenne's law enforcement needs
    There are currently 19 filled law enforcement positions at Northern 
Cheyenne including a newly hired Chief of Police. The Bureau of Indian 
Affair's (BIA's) foremost strategy to increase staffing for the highest 
priority locations like Northern Cheyenne is a pay parity initiative, 
to bring BIA law enforcement pay levels in line with other Federal law 
enforcement pay. This change can result in up to an additional $30,000 
in annual pay for BIA law enforcement officers.
    BIA is already experiencing public safety attrition rates at 
roughly half the level experienced this time last year and we believe 
this trend represents an early signal of the pay initiative's
    success. BIA is also working with the DOI Human Capital office and 
the Office of Personnel Management to explore the possibility of direct 
hire authorities and is conducting an analysis of hiring data for law 
enforcement positions for the last 2 years to provide documentary 
evidence of the need. In addition, BIA is using the Schedule A non-
competitive hiring authority for Indian Preference (IP) eligible 
candidates for recruitment activities during events like the Gathering 
of Nations. This strategy allows BIA to move forward with interviews 
during recruiting events for qualified IP candidates.

    Senator Tester. Okay, so, as do. I mean, and then the 
problem is, this isn't an isolated case. This is a case that 
continues. If it isn't Northern Cheyenne, it is going to be 
Blackfeet, or it is going to be Fort Peck, or it's going to be 
somebody else. But I think Northern Cheyenne has the most acute 
problems right now.
    So, I would appreciate your attention to this. Now, I want 
to talk about what you were talking about, and that is your 
budget in regard to workforce recruitment and retention. You 
have got about $641 million in this request, fiscal year 2024 
request, $470 million going to staffing, recruitment, retention 
efforts, police services, detention and corrections. You put 
the number in. Is this your number or is this OMB's number?

            TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

    Secretary Haaland. After careful consultation, with OMB, it 
is our number.
    Senator Tester. So, do you believe that this will 
adequately put you in a position to be able to not only recruit 
new officers, but retain the ones you have?
    Secretary Haaland. We think that it will be a good start 
and a good help. Of course, tribal justice and law enforcement 
has been underfunded for decades and decades.
    Senator Tester. It has. And we have had crime in Indian 
Country due to a lot of things, poverty included, that has put 
us in a situation where it is unacceptable. It is just flat 
unacceptable.
    And I don't care what Administration it is, it is 
unacceptable. You happen to be Native American. I don't have to 
explain the situation to you. I would hope that you would put 
the resources necessary to make sure that we do our level best 
and make the trust responsible as we have to make sure these 
tribes are safe.

                     FORT BELKNAP WATER SETTLEMENT

    Let me talk a little bit about Fort Belknap water 
settlement. It is the last water settlement in Montana. It is 
almost ready for prime time. It is my understanding that the 
tribe and the DOI are ironing out details now.
    The notch has been removed. And I know that was not an easy 
decision and probably not a popular decision in Fort Belknap. 
But because of that, they were able to get Senator Daines and 
Phillips County on board.
    I believe that is true. That is what my notes tell me. I 
haven't been told that directly. If that is the case, I think 
there is a real possibility that this bill can pass and we can 
finish the last water settlement we have for Montana.
    I don't think this is going to happen without somebody like 
you in your position as Secretary of interior intervening and 
making this a priority. It has been waiting a long time. I 
voted and we passed the Blackfeet water settlement when I was 
in the State legislature 20 years ago. We are still working on 
it at the Federal level now.
    So, can I get your commitment that you will do your best to 
make sure this is a top priority for not only the Department 
but for you to get this water settlement approved?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes.
    Senator Tester. That is an easy answer. Thank you very 
much. I have only got 44 seconds left, and if I got into what 
happened at the park last year, it is just going to require a 
lot of resources. And I would say this as long as I got 30 
seconds left, the disasters that are being caused by climate 
this year is just absolutely devastating in. And I am going to 
tell you that that one incident in Gardner was $1 billion.
    And I don't know if that is a conservative figure or not. 
And so, and we have got another year coming now where we going 
to have the snow starting to melt as we speak, as spring and 
summer comes on, but resiliency is really important. And I know 
you know that. And we have got to do everything we can. Last 
thing I would say is, St Mary's project is important.
    They had a study for ability to pay it. It came back, said 
they had no ability to pay. I would hope that you continue to 
look at that project too, along with Fort Belknap project 
because they are connected, so we can get these projects done 
in Montana. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam 
Secretary.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Senator.

                       ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING

    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator Tester. And Madam 
Secretary, about ten miles from my house, there is a Maya Lin 
designed bird blind on the Columbia River, where Lewis and 
Clark camped. And that bird blind is constructed so that as you 
are inside of it, you really can't see out.
    But what you do see is on the slats of the bird blind, it 
has the species that were recorded in Lewis and Clark's journal 
and then it says whether they are endangered or whether they 
are extinct. And it is really quite stunning to think that in 
the very modest amount of time since Lewis and Clark came to 
the region, how many species that they saw have become 
endangered or extinct.
    And we know that's an ongoing process. And climate chaos is 
aggravating it even more, along with the development of our 
industrialized world. The Endangered Species Act is an effort 
not just to focus on a species, but on an ecosystem that 
supports that species.
    And your budget for the Fish and Wildlife Service includes 
$133 million for the recovery and listing of species, or $15 
million more than fiscal year 2023.
    Funding is used to minimize or remove threats that led to 
species listing in the first place. Can you explain how the 
proposed funding level would be used to address the extinction 
crisis?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you--or, Chairman, thank 
you so much for the question. As you probably know, the ESA is 
50 years old this year, and we are very proud of the work that 
we have been able to do to protect species. One of the main 
things, of course, is recovering so that the species don't have 
to be listed.
    Since the ESA became law in 1973, more than 99 percent of 
species listed under law are still with us today, so that is 
something to be proud of. The budget includes a $19 million 
increase for recovery planning, monitoring, and management in 
close coordination with service partners.
    And Fish and Wildlife Service's Recovery Program works with 
partners to address threats to the species and improve their 
status so that protection under the Act is no longer necessary. 
So, we recognize this. It is a priority for us, and we will 
continue to work on it.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And I think if I had a magic 
wand, I would, you know, throw a couple more billion dollars 
into these key ecosystems that are threatened. But I don't have 
a magic wand. But we do have a collaborative process to point 
out the challenges. And one of those challenges is to insects.
    And I have told many people the story of how when I was a 
kid and we would drive North and South through the Willamette 
Valley, we would stop at every gas station to take all the 
insects off our windshield. And that now if there is a single 
insect in the windshield, it is rare.

                          MONARCH BUTTERFLIES

    And I was really struck by a letter to the editor in a 
newspaper last week that told exactly the same story from 
another individual about how insects have vastly disappeared. 
And one of those insects that you and I have been engaged in, 
it is such a charismatic species, is the monarch butterfly.
    And can I just tell you I really love your earrings today 
that represent the monarch and that the Department of Interior, 
under your leadership was so helpful in holding a monarch 
summit to bring together the scientists, all the collaborators 
on what is going on there.
    We were down for the Western monarch in 2022, less than 
2,000 surviving butterflies, which is incredible. When we were 
talking about many, many millions in the 80s and 90, just 
2,000.
    But they have rebounded in the last few years. When they 
have a good year, they can rebound, but they are still 90 
percent down from the historic numbers. And I am waiting to get 
a report now on the freak snowstorms that hit the coast in 
California because they may have dramatically devastated once 
again the overwintering butterflies.
    Those overwintering butterflies cannot survive in cold 
weather and so they hover along the coast to get more temperate 
air, to be less likely to freeze. But a snowstorm, well, that 
doesn't belong in Southern California, and it certainly could 
have devastated them once again.
    So, they are deeply endangered, but they are not recognized 
as endangered. Is it possible for us to--well, I know there is 
a long list of species that are under consideration, but is it 
possible for us to get the monarch into kind of the top of the 
list for consideration?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Chairman. I don't think there 
is any person in this world that doesn't care about monarchs.
    So, you have a whole Department who really understands the 
value of these beautiful butterflies, and so we absolutely will 
work with partners to enhance the inventory, monitoring of 
these pollinator populations across the national wildlife 
refuge systems. That is where we can really give monarchs and 
other insects and species opportunities to flourish.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. Because I know there's hundreds 
of things under study, but sometimes the dramatic change is so 
evident.
    And when you go from millions down to just 2,000 
butterflies and have an overwintering population that a freak 
storm could devastate the remaining population because--it is 
just like, they need to be put at the top of the list for 
consideration of being labeled as endangered. And there is so 
much we learn from studying their migration and the impacts 
along the way.
    There was $7 million in the last appropriation bill for the 
Western monarchs and other pollinators. Can we ensure that the 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), collaborative 
model continues its momentum?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, Senator, we will do whatever we 
can.
    Senator Merkley. Okay. There is a lot of power in that and 
the ability. I have used up my entire seven minutes on the 
monarch, which I am proud to do, because can you imagine the 
next generation of children growing up that never see a 
monarch? And actually, right now in Oregon, it is extremely 
rare to see one.
    And so, this is kind of a last ditch five alarm fire, but I 
have a lot more questions to come following my colleague and 
partner, Senator Murkowski.

              ALASKA NATIVE VIETNAM VETS ALLOTMENT PROGRAM

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary 
let's talk about the Alaska Native Vietnam Vets Allotment 
Program. This is something that is also very challenging. You 
certainly have a legal obligation to Alaska Native Vietnam era 
vets to ensure their allotment applications are completed in a 
timely and an efficient manner.
    And I am really concerned about where we are in the 
process. There have been different iterations, different ways 
to try to advance this, but I am really concerned that right 
now BLM, BIA don't have the capacity to meet this task. The 
program expires in December 29th of 2025.
    That is actually not that far away. And we are in a place 
right now where potentially about 2,900 applications could be 
received. I know for a fact that there is over 500 in the 
Southeast region down in the Tongas. That are not participating 
because they don't feel that there are lands that are 
accessible to them.
    So, excuse me, right now, eight, eight veterans have 
received their allotment under the program. In fiscal year 
2023, we got almost $5 million to implement the program and you 
are continuing this funding level for fiscal year 2024.
    But how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it? 
How can you assure me that not only we have the resources, but 
what are the nonmonetary challenges that BLM is facing? Thank 
you. Please go ahead.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Senator. And yes, we are 
working very hard on this issue as you know, there's roughly 29 
million acres of public lands for selection. We recognize that 
some lands are were not included in the law.
    So, it is unfortunate for those veterans who want lands in 
areas where they weren't included. So as of March, the BLM 
received 266 Alaska native, Vietnam era veterans' allotment 
program applications. A lot of the veterans who were eligible, 
we didn't have the right contact information. We reached out to 
Veterans Affairs. They are helping us with that.
    So, we are doing what we can to make sure that all veterans 
have this opportunity. And I just want to assure you that it is 
a priority for me. It is a priority for the BLM. And we will 
continue to work on this as quickly as we possibly can. I think 
that part of the issue was that we weren't able to reach them 
all, but we found some help with Veterans Affairs, so we feel 
like, you know, it is an all of Government approach.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, and Madam Secretary, if I may, 
because I was at that roundtable with Secretary McDonough. 
Senator Sullivan had brought together a group of Vietnam 
veterans and they had the Secretary of the VA in front of them. 
They could have talked about anything.
    They could have talked about health care, they could have 
talked about housing, education. But all they talked about was 
the injustice that they felt in having been denied their native 
allotment and a fear that they were dying off, they were 
leaving this earth before the promise was going to be kept to 
them.
    And so, I think I think it actually motivated the Secretary 
to see what more he could do in his capacity, so I am glad to 
know that he visited with you and he shared a follow-on call 
with me and said he discussed this with you. We need to 
identify.
    But when you say, yes, there is 29 million acres that have 
been made available. When you are in a State that is one fifth 
the size of the United States of America, and you tell a native 
veteran and in Hoonah that they are able to select lands up in 
the interior, it may as well be telling them that they can 
select lands in Iceland.
    It is just not feasible and not possible. So. I am deeply 
frustrated because even with the good intentions of those who 
want to see these allotments move, advancing eight through this 
process out of a potentially close to 3,000 it doesn't work. It 
doesn't work for the veterans. It doesn't work for any.
    And so, we have so much more to do. I think, you know, that 
the answer is going to be making more lands accessible in areas 
where our veterans are. And that is going to require some 
cooperation with the Department of Interior. So, I am just 
asking you to keep your foot on the gas with this on because 
these honored veterans are passing every day. I want to ask 
about the tribal LWCF fund that you mentioned.

            TRIBAL LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND PROGRAM

    You are proposing an additional 12 million in discretionary 
spending for land and water conservation under a new fund for 
tribal land acquisition. What I don't understand on this is why 
Department of Interior did not propose this under the mandatory 
$900 million from the Great American Outdoors Act, and kind of 
what the plan is for this.
    This is the first time that I have heard about it was in 
this budget presentation, so I am not quite sure why it was 
such a big priority, why it wasn't incorporated in the LWCF 
initially, maybe as a tribal set aside. But now you are adding 
$12 million on top of a $900 million mandatory spending.
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you so much for the 
question. And so, of course, we have done more tribal 
consultation in this Administration than likely for a very long 
time. This is something that tribes spoke with us about.
    It is important for them to have a dedicated program, and 
it is carved out of discretionary funding to avoid competition 
between new and established programs. The funds will support 
tribal acquisition of lands for conservation and outdoor 
recreation consistent with the purposes of LWCF.
    I mean, I apologize. I don't know of the precise reasons 
why it was done this way. Of course, we are happy to be in 
touch with your office with complete details about how this 
came about and what the thinking was behind all of it.
    [The information follows:]
                  fy 2024 tribal lwcf program proposal
    The FY 2024 budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs includes $12.0 
million in discretionary unobligated LWCF funds to establish a new 
Tribal Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) land acquisition 
program. During LWCF listening sessions with Tribes held in 2022 and in 
ongoing meetings of Interior's Tribal Budget Council, Tribes have 
identified direct access to LWCF funding for conservation and 
recreation LWCF projects without the existing requirements to partner 
with or apply through States, as a top funding priority.
    For this reason, the President's 2024 budget request proposes to 
fund this new program with discretionary funding which allows for full 
consideration of the importance of Tribal inclusion in the LWCF without 
concern for the potential impact on funding for the established LWCF 
programs. Including Tribes in LWCF as direct applicants for funding is 
a meaningful opportunity to not only strengthen conservation and 
outdoor recreation opportunities in Indian Country but to demonstrate 
the Administration's strong commitment to Tribal sovereignty and self-
determination. This new program will further enhance the ability of 
Tribes to address the climate crisis, support Tribal sovereignty and 
self-determination, and provide another important tool to support 
Tribal co-stewardship.
    With regard to the structure of this program, the Department 
expects BIA would award the funding competitively for land acquisition 
projects or easements which advance conservation and outdoor recreation 
on Tribal lands. The bureau is working to hold Tribal consultation this 
Fall on the proposed structure of the program as well as the criteria 
and program requirements.

    Senator Murkowski. Well, my time is expired, but know that 
we do want to follow up with you on this. I am just not certain 
that there is a plan there with the distribution and what the 
process would be, how you are identifying willing sellers and 
the like. So, we will need to do some follow up. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.

                           MONARCH BUTTERFLY

    Senator Merkley. Madam Secretary, back to monarchs for just 
a moment. One of the things that came out of that gathering of 
the summit that we held was that families want to plant 
pollinator safe plants in their gardens.
    But when they go to the nursery, most of those plants you 
buy in a nursery carry such a heavy level of pesticide on them 
that they are not safe for the pollinators and could actually 
kill them. And it's also true for the milkweed.
    And so, one of the goals was to develop a program that 
would provide labeling so you have pollinator safe according to 
certain standards that have been raised without pesticides, 
that remain on the plants and would be deadly to bees and 
butterflies and so forth. Has there been much progress in 
actually implementing a program for pollinators safe labeling?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I love that idea, and I will 
have to get back with you as to how that is coming along.
    [The information follows:]
                        pollinator safe labeling
    Interior supports efforts to encourage the use of plants that are 
safe for wildlife, including those safe for pollinators as well as for 
invertebrate communities, many of which are necessary for healthy soil 
and water. This issue--the availability of trusted labels around 
pollinator-friendly plants--is important to many Americans and is 
frequently raised in many venues, including the Monarch Butterfly 
Conservation Summit last summer.
    Interior does not exercise broad labeling authority to regulate the 
sale of plants as ``pollinator friendly.'' While we do have some 
authorities to regulate impacts on protected species, we do not have 
regulations to manage an overall plant labeling program more generally 
for wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is using its newly 
established Center for Pollinator Conservation to engage other 
influential partners or agencies with authorities to determine 
potential avenues to implement credible pollinator friendly labeling 
practices. This topic will be the subject of a virtual workshop series 
the Center is currently planning and will be hosting this summer.

    Senator Merkley. Thank you. There are two routes to doing 
this. One is kind of a voluntary effort through the Xerces 
Society, but the other is for us to have a regulation that says 
you can label these plants pollinators safe if they have been 
raised in this manner. And people are just, families they want 
to plant pollinator gardens. And it is not just, you know, I am 
using the monarch, but we are really talking about honeybees, 
all kinds of pollinators that are important. So, I will follow 
up with you on that. Thank you. Turning to staffing in the 
National Park Service.

                     NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STAFFING

    Of the 10,000 employees of the Department lost between the 
decades 2010 to 2020, 23,000 of those were in the National Park 
Service. And last year we were able to restore about 500 of 
those positions. How is progress going on hiring for those 
positions?
    Secretary Haaland. We are so appreciative of your support 
for this and we are with you. We know it's important. So, the 
2023 funding increases will support permanent long-term 
staffing for ongoing park operations.
    Funding is helping NPS to staff new and critical 
responsibilities of parks. Birmingham Civil Rights and Freedom 
Riders National monuments, a major national historic site.
    I mean, we are moving forward with it and appreciate if you 
would like, we are happy to give you a readout on where, you 
know, where these staff are and how we have been able to build 
them.

                         PARK EMPLOYEE HOUSING

    Senator Merkley. Thank you. It is an incredible national 
parks system, but it only works if we have people staffing it. 
And one of the things I am hearing is about the housing crisis, 
that so many accommodations that might have been available for 
people to work for the National Park Service and live in are 
now Airbnbs.
    And so essentially, folks are turning down jobs even at 
Yosemite, the crown jewel of the park system, people are 
turning down the opportunity to work there because there is no 
place to live.
    Your fiscal year 2024 request includes an increase of $7 
million to improve housing construction, nearly doubling the 
program, and to upgrade housing at a number of sites, Mesa 
Verde, Chaco Culture National Historic Park, Great Sand Dunes--
but it is housing across the system that is a challenge. Will 
this funding make a difference?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, absolutely. It will make a big 
difference. The $7 million increase, as you mentioned, will 
address housing needs in Mammoth Cave, Sequoia, Kings Canyon 
and Rocky Mountains National Parks. And we are using $32.7 
million in construction and Legacy Restoration Funding to 
rehabilitate the housing at Mesa Verde, Chaco Culture, Great 
Sand Dunes, etcetera.
    We are also leveraging private sector leasing for seasonal 
housing. The National Park Service will use $2 million provided 
in 2023. As of February, parks hope to add more than 100 beds 
with this particular funding. We are working with partners to 
find solutions. At Acadia National Park, for example, we are 
leveraging $5 million in partner donations with Centennial 
Challenge funds to construct new seasonal employee housing for 
the park.
    Senator Merkley. It is essential. People can't take jobs if 
they can't afford a place to live. Turning to the Great 
American Outdoors Act, it provided $1.9 billion for the legacy 
restoration funding, for deferred maintenance on our public 
lands, and at the Bureau of Indian Education Schools.

                     GAOA: LEGACY RESTORATION FUND

    And we are finding that the costs have gone way up and a 
number of projects are over budget. We know that there is a lot 
of upheaval in the markets, an upheaval in our supply chains. 
This is happening in every area where construction is involved.
    And our teams worked together to provide a contingency fund 
to help cover that challenge. But digging a little deeper on 
this, can you share a little bit about the factors that are 
causing the cost estimates to go up beyond the original 
estimates?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question. And so, what 
our bureaus are seeing is a more competitive bidding climate, 
and sometimes we don't receive any bids for the work that we 
need done, so we have to re-compete those bids. It costs more. 
There is problem in remote areas.
    Sometimes there are not the folks you need to do the work. 
We have a lot of specialized needs with a lot of really unique 
assets, and sometimes we don't find the specialized people to, 
or materials, for example, to work on those projects.
    There has also been an increased cost of construction 
materials that is actually outpacing inflation. There are a lot 
of price swings. And so, we are working through a lot to try to 
keep these projects on track. And so, we will just keep working 
at it.
    Senator Merkley. You know, it is clear that the purchasing 
power of the strategy has diminished significantly. And it is 
frustrating, which is just a reality of the market. Do you 
support extending the Legacy Restoration Fund for at least 
another 5 years given the backlog of projects that need to be 
accomplished?
    Secretary Haaland. We love the Legacy Restoration Fund. So, 
yes, we would love to see it continue to do the work that it 
does for so many areas in our country.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. Senator Capito.

                        SECTION 7 CONSULTATIONS

    Senator Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome to the 
committee. I have a question on Fish and Wildlife. Our Fish and 
Wildlife office in West Virginia has brought on just recently a 
number of new biologists mostly through reimbursable 
agreements, to help with the backlog of the Endangered Species 
Act Section 7 consultations.
    It has been helpful, but what I am really looking for is 
some substantive feedback on how we can improve the Section 7 
process, minimize project delays. We are just getting a lot of 
complaints consistently in our State.
    So, in a reaction to this, I was able to put into the 
appropriations bill, a fiscal year 2023 bill that would direct 
the Fish and Wildlife Service to report to Congressional 
committees within 90 days on the Section 7 consultation and 
provide recommendations on ways to improve and expedite the 
process.
    Trying to get rid of the backlog because there is a big 
backlog there. And so, we are right at the time of this around 
the deadline. So, I wondered when we could expect to see this 
report, and can you shed some light on some of those 
recommendations made to improve those consultations?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you so much, Senator. I mean, we 
will get back with your office about when to expect that. But 
please know that the Fish and Wildlife Service is making the 
most of limited staffing, funding, and other resources for the 
Section 7 and other reviews.
    Our budget request includes a proposal to authorize 
agencies to transfer Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) 
funding to support this Fish and Wildlife staffing needs. So, 
we are working on this issue and happy to report back to you as 
soon as we have some--well, they might have specific details. 
Unfortunately, I don't have those specific details in front of 
me right now.
    Senator Capito. Okay. We will follow up. We will follow up 
with them. I am curious to know, I know I mentioned that we 
have a lot of frustrations in our State. Is this a nationwide 
problem with the backlog? I am assuming that it is, but and the 
process taking so long and project delays.
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, with all due respect, they 
reminded me that the goal for the report is today.
    Senator Capito. Right. So, it will come out today.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, that is our goal. It is today, so 
hopefully we can make sure that is in your hands before the end 
of the day.
    Senator Capito. Okay. Perfect.
    Secretary Haaland. Okay. Thank you. I apologize.
    Senator Capito. So, in response to is it a nationwide 
issue, you are hearing this from other States with the backlog?
    Secretary Haaland. I am not certain. Of course, I will get 
back with Fish and Wildlife Service and make sure that they can 
provide you with that specific----
    Senator Capito. I would like to say the Director of Fish 
and Wildlife, in response to my concern, did come to the State 
with me to try to establish better communications, and I am 
very appreciative of that. It has resulted in slightly better 
communications, not so much with my office, but with whatever 
the stakeholder is, is who is interested in trying to move 
together project.

               ABANDONED MINE LAND ECONOMIC REVITALIZAION

    So please pass that along to her. Let me ask you about 
another program, the Abandoned Mine Land Economic 
Revitalization, is called AMLER Program. It administers grants 
to, this is reading from your statement to six States, three 
tribal nations to return legacy coal mining sites to productive 
uses and foster economic and community development.
    You have made through the AMLER program $750 million 
available to coal communities, obviously critical in my State, 
and we have taken advantage of the AMLER program.
    There has been here, and this goes to the bureaucracy as 
well, kind of a moving of the football of what the parameters 
of this program are, so that there been delays in getting 
monies that have been approved by the Governor, because I do 
believe it has to go through the Governor for the Governor's 
approval for certain projects.
    And because of that, I guess I would just ask that the 
takeaway from my comments are, that the consistency on what is 
required, what qualifies as a Coal community--you know, we had 
a trail in one of our State forests, the back side of it was 
where the abandoned coal mine lay in what seemed like a lay-up 
to me.
    I mean, you know, the conservation project. It is great 
wild use of recreation. It is also an economic generator 
because a lot of people will go and come and visit. So, you 
know, there was a lot of communication issues.
    So, I would just ask, in particular on the AMLER program 
that maybe leaving here, you might take a look to make sure 
that the guidance is consistent from year to year so that 
people can know what they are applying for and how to make 
their applications successful.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. We want the program to work. 
And you are right, your State is perfect for these projects.
    Senator Capito. All right. Thank you.

                     WESTERN OREGON OPERATING PLAN

    Senator Merkley. Senator, you bring up a topic and you get 
the report the same day. I need some of that. Thank you for 
demonstrating how that is done. Madam Secretary, I want to turn 
to the Western Oregon operating plan (WOOP), as it is referred 
to, and this is a plan that coordinates the approach to 
wildfire response, coordinated between the State, the tribes, 
the communities, the Bureau of Land Management.
    And we have this incredibly complex checkerboard that was 
established when every other square mile was essentially 
designated to the railroads and etcetera, etcetera. And it is 
no way to design a landscape for management and so requires 
this sort of cooperation.
    And after you have been to Oregon, I know you have heard 
and seen what we face in Western Oregon and the concerns of the 
constituents. The key is that we maintain this agreement, when 
it comes up for renewal in 2024 and we have heard some concerns 
that BLM may not be that excited about this agreement.
    But given the checkerboard lands and the need for 
collaboration on the wildfire front, to me it is essential and 
you may have gotten a better sense of it from your trip. Are 
you familiar with the WOOP? And can we count on your support to 
reauthorize it in 2024?
    Secretary Haaland. Mr. Chairman from meetings we had in 
Oregon, we absolutely know that these fire partnerships are a 
key success to Western Oregon and to the entire State, quite 
frankly. BLM is confident that they will find an agreement with 
the State. I trust that they will, and so we will absolutely 
keep working at it.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. I will continue to be in dialog 
with you all about it. And speaking of fire, one of our highest 
risk fire sheds, actually, the highest risk is the Rogue Valley 
in Oregon, and it is affected by this checkerboard. And most of 
the forest land is not Department of Forestry, but it is BLM 
land.
    And so, we need to really reduce the risk of fire and that 
means directing resources to do forest management, reducing the 
fuels on the forest floor. The combination of thinning and 
prescribed burns and mowing.
    And we had a significant amount of hazardous fuels funding 
in the annual appropriations, but also in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Act for high-risk fire sheds. I want to make 
sure that a significant share of these funds goes as intended 
to help out the Rogue Valley. Can we count on that happening?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, Senator. And so, if I may, they are 
providing close to $1 million in BIL funding this year for 
Jackson, Josephine, and Curry Counties.
    Senator Merkley. I will follow up with you in that regard, 
because I don't have the specific numbers with me for the need.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes.
    Senator Merkley. But it is a big deal. And, after having 
seen the Labor Day fires of 2020 and town after town burned to 
the ground, this is in everyone's mind about the risk and the 
need for intense collaboration. That is where the WOOP comes 
in, and that is where this funding comes in to be directed to 
these efforts. Okay, fish passage. Very important to fish 
passage in the Pacific Northwest is the Fisheries Restoration 
and Irrigation Mitigation Act (FRIMA).
    It is a cooperative partnership between, again, like WOOP, 
between the Federal Government, local, State, and tribal 
entities, and they work to design and implement, construct fish 
screens and fish passage strategies, solving the problem, the 
culverts put on many of our streams.
    And for the first time, we provided $5 million specifically 
for FRIMA activities. And I want to make sure it does not get 
lost in a larger funding pot. Can you give me an update on the 
FRIMA funding?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Chairman. The Fish 
and Wildlife Service will publish a notice of funding 
opportunity to award the funds through grants. The notice will 
detail eligibility, project criteria, and so forth, and 
requirements for the selection process.
    And the Fish and Wildlife Service will also work directly 
with the five eligible States and tribal representatives and 
encourage partner outreach to develop project submissions. The 
awards will be determined by a panel of subject matter experts. 
That is moving forward, and we care about it.

                            FISH HATCHERIES

    Senator Merkley. That is great. Thank you. And my last 
question is related to the opportunity we had to visit the Gone 
Fishin' Hatchery, known formally as the Klamath Falls National 
Fish Hatchery, and we were able to hold in our hands both the 
c'waam and koptu fish.
    And those two species were like the core of the diet that 
supported the tribes from time immemorial, but they have not 
been able to harvest any since before the turn of the last 
century because they are so endangered.
    And a few years ago, I held a sucker summit. These are, in 
the English vernacular, they are suckers, sucker fish. And we 
held a conference to talk about these two species and how are 
we going to save them, because what we heard was that the 
youngest fish left in the lake were 25 to 30 years old and that 
the life span is only 30 years.
    And I had no idea their lifespan was that long and had no 
idea that the youngest were that near extinction. And so, we 
launched this hatchery as well as a Klamath Tribe hatchery, two 
separate projects. And you and I were able to visit the one.
    And I must say I was so excited about that stop, because 
initially when the hatchery produced year old fish and we put 
them back in the lake, they all died, and they were dying 
because the algae is growing in the warmer, phosphorous 
polluted water and when it dies it strips the oxygen out of the 
lake, and then a second species of algae takes the nitrogen 
from the first species, and then that is a toxic algae.
    So older fish could survive, younger fish could not. And 
then we tried two-year-olds and basically almost all of them 
died. But what we just saw was that some of the three-year-
olds, two and three year olds are starting to survive in the 
lake, which is great.

                           KLAMATH ECOSYSTEM

    While we go under many decades of trying to clean up the 
lake and the phosphorus in it and address the algae problem, 
but also that they had three-year-old fish now at the hatchery, 
and technically it is not yet a hatchery, they are catching the 
minnows or the newly formed farmed fish and taking them to the 
fishing basins. But they said by the time they reach 5 years, 
they will have a reserve population that will be able to 
harvest the eggs and actually turn it into a hatchery.
    And it is like we may save these two fish because of this 
collaborative effort launched over the last couple of years. So 
that is going to be an extraordinary story if this succeeds. 
And it was the first time I heard, like we may have acted in 
time, barely in time. Could you comment on the importance of 
these investments and saving these fish?
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. Chairman, thank you. I was 
equally as moved by that stop that we made, and, gosh, no 
amount of money could ever bring those fish back.
    Senator Merkley. Yes. Once we lose them there, they are 
gone. And we know how hard it is to get the phosphorus out of 
the lake.
    We have had local engineering students who have developed 
basically sunlight powered, photovoltaic powered rafts that put 
oxygen back into the lake. That didn't actually seem to work.
    And we explored and are continuing to explore ways to try 
to remove the algae and with removing the algae, remove the 
phosphorus in the algae to try to reduce the phosphorus load in 
the lake.
    That proves to be extraordinarily difficult. We don't have 
a strategy there yet. But if we can raise older fish and get 
those older fish that can survive in the lake in while we 
continue to work on the phosphorus loading over the decades to 
come, we have a shot at reversing a near extinction event.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes. And we have many dedicated career 
staff to move those issues along. I mean, for some of these 
things, it is every tool in the toolbox, right. And we are not 
going to turn down any good ideas.
    So, we have to continually explore ways that we can protect 
these ecosystems, because that is the way we protect these 
species.
    Senator Merkley. Madam Secretary, thank you. The diversity 
of topics that have been raised today demonstrate what an 
enormous range of issues are inherent in the management of the 
Interior Department that you are living and breathing every 
day. So, thank you for addressing them. So many offers to 
follow up on details. I believe my colleague is not returning. 
We are wrapping up. Okay. It is a pleasure to work with Senator 
Murkowski.
    Two States in the West that have different perspectives on 
some key issues as reflected by our opening statements, but we 
are just engaged in a lot of collaboration on our public lands 
and the work of the Interior Department.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    So, thank you. And the hearing record will remain open to 
the close of business on April 19th. If there are no further 
comments, this hearing is adjourned.
            Questions Submitted by Senator Dianne Feinstein
    Question. Secretary Haaland, I understand that the Forest Service 
was able to achieve 97 percent of its staffing target for firefighters 
(GS-09 and below), perhaps due in part to salary increases in the 
bipartisan infrastructure law.
    Secretary Haaland, was the Department of the Interior able to 
achieve full firefighter staffing last year, both nationwide and in 
California specifically? What are the current wildland firefighter 
staffing levels nationwide and in California specifically?
    Answer. The Department of the Interior achieved 98 percent of our 
2022 wildland fire hiring target nationwide. The Department employed 
more than 5,460 personnel, including firefighters and support 
personnel. In California, the Department employed more than 580 
wildland fire personnel during 2022, compared to a target of 639.
    As of the end of May 2023, the Department had 4,145 total Federal 
wildland fire personnel nationwide. Considering the number of temporary 
and permanent seasonal employees within the wildland fire management 
program, who are typically hired in early summer, we expect to reach 
peak employment in July. Our target is to reach a total of 5,800 
personnel over the course of the year.
    In California, as of the end of May, the Department employed more 
than 400 wildland fire personnel. The target for California this year 
is about 670 personnel.
    Question. Recent Department of Interior appropriations have 
provided significant increases for efforts to manage wild horses and 
burros across the West, doubling the funding in the past five years. 
Nevertheless, humane management of these wild horse herds remains a 
problem, with the size of these herds impacting the native landscape 
and the health of the horses themselves. Based on a model developed by 
the Bureau of Land Management, PopEquus, fertility control measures are 
the most cost-effective ways to keep herd sizes at an appropriate level 
once the herd has been condensed to the Appropriate Management Level. 
However, the vast majority of the budget for the Wild Horse and Burro 
Program still goes toward removal of horses from public lands and 
upkeep of those horses.
    Secretary Haaland, how much of the funding allocated for the Wild 
Horse and Burro program has gone toward cost-effective fertility 
control measures?
    Answer. Over the last five years, the BLM has spent approximately 
$2.8 million directly on fertility control treatments. Additionally, 
the BLM spent approximately $4.2 million on capture and handling costs 
needed to conduct those treatments, and over $3.5 million on new 
research related to advancing humane and longer-lasting fertility 
control methods for wild horses and burros.
    Population growth suppression methods, including fertility control 
treatments, are most effective once a herd management area is at its 
appropriate management level (AML), though the Bureau considers 
fertility control efforts as vital to helping curb the previously 
compunding growth rate. In FY 2022, only 37 out of 177 Herd Management 
Areas were at AML. The removal of excess animals from overpopulated 
herds is a valuable tool to minimize threats to the health of our 
public rangelands from overgrazing, as well as for preventing risks of 
starvation and thirst for wild horses, burros, and other wildlife. The 
program continues to maximize humane care and opportunities for private 
care placement of these excess animals through adoptions, sales, and 
transfers as a way to manage off-range costs over time.

                                 ______
                                 

            Questions Submitted by Senator Chris Van Hollen
    Question. The Great American Outdoors Act permanently authorized 
funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund to support our efforts 
to conserve lands and improve outdoor recreation opportunities across 
the Nation. Unfortunately, I understand that the appraisal process 
remains lengthy, with delays and complexities that can risk the loss of 
critical conservation opportunities. 
    Can you provide details on the agency's efforts to address this 
problem?
    Answer. The Department is committed to the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF) programs and has taken strong action to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Interior's land acquisition 
functions which are fundamental to implementing the LWCF.
    Interior has established a Department-wide Land Acquisition Working 
Group (working group) of realty specialists, appraisers, attorneys, and 
program officers, focused on making improvements in key areas impacting 
Interior's Federal land acquisition and appraisal processes. The 
working group is actively addressing issues identified in the FY 2023 
Consolidated Appropriations Bill, P.L. 117-328, to improve uniform 
Departmental appraisal policies, utilizing third-party contracting, 
clarifying the roles and responsibilities of Federal and non-Federal 
parties' as well as evaluating options for returning some appraisal or 
valuation functions to the bureaus.
    A two-day session is planned this Spring (May 23-24) to expressly 
discuss options for returning appraisal functions currently managed by 
Interior's Appraisal and Valuation Services Office (AVSO), to 
interested bureaus. On this subject, the working groups' initial 
efforts focused on identifying issues most likely to result in 
operational efficiencies; and tackling those with the potential for 
nearer-term benefits first. This included evaluating options to raise 
the current $25,000 threshold ceiling to waive the need for an 
appraisal allowed in the Uniform Act regulations, up to $400,000 with 
the landowner's approval. Increasing the waiver valuation threshold 
will allow bureaus greater flexibility to conduct waiver valuations for 
more of their land acquisition needs without requiring appraisals for 
uncomplicated cases.
    The working group initiated a discussion with the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) which has jurisdiction over this requirement. 
FWHA has proposed a new rule to raise the threshold to $50,000 which 
could make 14% of Interior land acquisitions eligible for an 
acquisition waiver. A change in the waiver threshold should help to 
reduce processing times since more than 50% of the overall valuation 
time is taken up by the appraisal itself and another 17% is consumed by 
contracting. For simple, low risk acquisitions under the threshold, it 
could cut valuation processing time by approximately 67%. AVSO supports 
an increased use of waiver valuations as allowed by regulation and 
currently provides training to bureau realty staff in conducting waiver 
valuations.
    The working group has also identified policies and procedures that 
need to be modified, clarified, or rescinded including a 1995 policy 
memo issued by the Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management, and Budget 
that addresses the roles of non-Federal parties in Department of the 
Interior land acquisition. As part of this work, Interior's land 
acquisition working group reached an initial agreement that when 
appraisals are paid for by non-Federal parties, bureaus can request the 
non-Federal party be named as an intended user of the appraisal report 
and AVSO will execute such requests. Interior will memorialize its 
final decision and other related operational changes in the form of a 
new policy memo that defines guidelines for real estate transactions 
involving non-Federal parties.
    The Department is also taking action to strengthen Interior's 
appraisal capacity including realigning appraisal operations on a 
regional basis to improve efficiency and service. With the help of 
Special Pay Rate authority for appraisers provided in the FY 2022 and 
FY 2023 Interior Appropriations bills, as of May 2023, AVSO increased 
the number of appraisers on-board 22 percent from 2021. AVSO has also 
secured dedicated legal support and is standing up an appraiser 
apprentice program to build internal capacity. AVSO is collaborating 
with the working group to improve its automated systems and processes 
to simplify how appraisals are requested by the bureaus and to provide 
bureaus with status tracking reports of pending appraisal actions.  
    These are examples of the work underway to reevaluate and improve 
Interior's Federal land acquisition activities. The Department will 
continue this comprehensive review and will keep the House and Senate 
Interior Appropriations Subcommittees informed as more progress is 
made.

                                 ______
                                 

               Questions Submitted by Senator Deb Fischer
    Question. To date, how much funding has DOI spent implementing the 
America the Beautiful Initiative?
  --Please include what staffing resources have been used to plan, 
        coordinate, implement and track the initiative.
  --Please also cite the congressional authorization used to justify 
        any expenditures.
    Answer. America the Beautiful is an interagency initiative to 
support voluntary, locally led, partnership-driven conservation and 
restoration nationwide. Interior is an active Federal partner in 
supporting the broader initiative driven by our mission and 
responsibilities for land and resource management. A variety of DOI 
programs--authorized by Congress--support the goals of the initiative. 
As such, the Department does not track funding for it as it would a 
formal program.
    During the hearing, Secretary Haaland gave examples of funding 
requested for several DOI programs which help to support the objectives 
of America the Beautiful including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. The budget proposes $79.7 
million in FY 2024 for the Partners program, an increase of $19.5 
million above FY 2023 enacted. The program is authorized by the 
Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act (16 U.S.C. 3771-3774) to establish a 
program that works with private landowners to conduct cost-effective 
habitat projects for the benefit of fish and wildlife resources in the 
United States. The projects provide other benefits to the local 
communities, such as enhancing drought resilience through water 
conservation projects, strengthening resilience to wildfire, and 
supporting habitat and migration corridors for game and other plants 
and animals of cultural significance.
    The Partners Program works in all 50 States and territories, to 
consult with landowners to help them conserve and improve wildlife 
habitat. Landowner conservation is important because nearly 70 percent 
of land in the United States is privately owned. Public and private 
landowners are critical partners in ensuring the health and 
sustainability of America's fish, wildlife and plant species. Projects 
are voluntary and customized to meet landowners' needs. Participating 
landowners continue to own and manage their land while they improve 
conditions for wildlife.
    Many Partners for Fish and Wildlife projects take place on working 
landscapes such as forests, farms and ranches.  FWS efforts focus on 
areas of conservation concern, such as upland forests, wetlands, native 
prairies, marshes, rivers and streams and designing projects to benefit 
Federal trust species including migratory birds, endangered, threatened 
and at-risk species.
    All private landowners interested in restoring wildlife habitat on 
their land are eligible to participate. Current partners include 
farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, recreational landowners, 
corporations, local governments and universities. In addition to 
private landowners, the program partners with other Federal agencies, 
State agencies and non-governmental organizations to complete projects 
on private lands. Participating landowners do not forfeit any property 
rights and are not required to allow public access.
    Another example mentioned at the hearing is the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund State Grants program managed by the National Park 
Service, which was permanently reauthorized in the Great American 
Outdoors Act. The program receives mandatory funding which is allocated 
annually by Congress through Appropriations. The budget proposes $305.5 
million in FY 2024 for these competitive and formula matching grants to 
States.
    The State grants support the acquisition and development of land 
and facilities that will provide the public with access to new 
opportunities to engage in outdoor recreation through a variety of 
projects such as parks, sports and playfields, swimming and boating 
areas, trails, and campgrounds. Grants to States also provide for 
continuing State planning efforts to address outdoor recreation needs. 
Since 1965, more than $5.2 billion has been apportioned to the States, 
resulting in the award of over 45,000 grants. States, Tribes, and 
localities have matched this amount at least dollar-for-dollar, 
doubling the Federal investment.
    This program has successfully allowed States to take greater 
responsibility for the protection and development of open space and 
outdoor recreation resources. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act 
of 1965 (54 U.S.C. 2003), provides funds and authorization for funding 
to the States in planning, acquisition, and development of public 
outdoor recreation areas and facilities.
    Question. How does DOI define conservation in relation to the 
America the Beautiful Initiative?
  --For private landowners, does the Department only consider land 
        conserved if a landowner is participating in a Federal program?
  --What is the baseline percentage of land that the Department 
        considers to already be conserved?
    Answer. Interior is working with our other Federal partners to 
engage the public in this question of how do we define conservation. 
Many uses of lands and waters can be consistent with the long-term 
health of natural systems and help address climate change, and the 
Department appreciates the continuum of conservation activities 
occurring across the Nation.  
    The America the Beautiful initiative relies on broad engagement 
across the country, including agricultural and forest landowners, 
fishers, outdoor enthusiasts, Tribal Nations, States, territories, 
local officials, and other important partners and stakeholders working 
to identify strategies that reflect the priorities of all communities. 
Integral to this approach is the voluntary conservation work of 
fishers, ranchers, farmers, and forest owners which takes place as part 
or independent of participation in a Federal program. Voluntary 
conservation work that occurs independently of Federal programs is an 
important part of America the Beautiful, and recognizing such efforts 
is best accomplished by building partnerships with individuals or 
organizations that would like their efforts to be included in the 
initiative.
    With regard to a baseline of land considered to be conserved, the 
interagency team collected public comments in 2022 and continues to 
work on next steps.

                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL S. REGAN, ADMINISTRATOR
ACCOMPANIED BY: FAISAL AMIN, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY

    Senator Merkley. Administrator Regan, and colleagues, 
constituents, welcome to this Appropriations Hearing on the 
fiscal year 2024 President's Budget Request for the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
    I want to welcome, also, Faisal Amin, EPA's Chief Financial 
Officer, who is joining the Administrator.
    Administrator Regan, climate chaos is here. We are seeing 
the impacts everywhere: The longer fire seasons, the more 
intensity of those fires, the decreased snowpacks, now the 
impact of that on our rivers, and on our irrigation waters, the 
more severe weather events, from the atmospheric rivers we have 
heard so much about on the West Coast this year, to warmer 
algae-infested lakes across the country, to droughts, and 
record-shattering heat waves.
    Every part of the world is experiencing these impacts, and 
the damage is staggering. And it is going to increase 
exponentially unless we act decisively. I believe that to meet 
this moment we have to accelerate our transition from fossil 
fuel energy to renewable energy; that we have to tackle that 
crisis both from the supply side of fossil fuels as well as 
from the demand side.
    This is why I adamantly oppose the Biden administration's 
approval of fossil fuel projects, one project after another. 
Not only does such approval slow the transition here in 
America, but it undermines our moral authority in the world. It 
is very hard to ask the rest of the world to transition off of 
coal, or other fossil fuels, to renewables, when we are 
continuing to approve one fossil fuel project after another. 
The world needs American leadership and to lead we have to have 
the power of our example.
    While I believe that we are headed in the wrong direction 
in that regard, I do commend your Agency for taking meaningful 
actions over the last several months. First, the cars and 
trucks emission rules are critical to decreasing our carbon 
footprint. The transportation sector is the largest source of 
carbon emissions in the United States, and that means we can't 
make meaningful progress without addressing those emissions.
    I am a strong supporter of building and deploying more 
electric vehicles to reduce our greenhouse gases from 
transportation, and those proposed rules go a long way toward 
aggressively pushing our production in that direction.
    Recent press reports about EPA's plans for reducing power 
plant emissions also indicate a step in the right direction, 
power plants another major source of carbon pollution. And this 
latest rulemaking prioritizes the reduction of carbon emissions 
while promoting clean energy.
    In March, the Energy Information Administration forecasted 
that by the year 2050 wind and solar will account for 56 
percent of electricity generation. Newly built gas plants will 
become stranded assets unless they have the most feasible new 
technology.
    The Inflation Reduction Act provides important incentives 
to clean up our power sector, and these rules leverage those 
new authorities and investments. These actions are commendable, 
common sense, and should be finalized as quickly as possible, 
which I am sure you are thinking about every day.
    Today, we are here to discuss the fiscal year 2024 Budget 
Request for EPA, which is $12.1 billion, a 19 percent increase 
from fiscal year 2023. This funding level would make up much 
needed grounded EPA after the past decade of budget caps, and 
the 4 years that the Trump administration spent gutting the 
Agency.
    The budget includes $5 billion to support the work of 
reducing emissions, increasing resilience, and engaging other 
nations in this shared challenge. It builds upon the work we 
made to remedy environmental injustice, the work we have done 
together over the years, including a huge step up from just $11 
million to $105 million in fiscal year 2022, was an important 
effort to tackle historic disparities in the burden of 
pollution.
    And I am impressed that the EPA budget request again 
prioritizes environmental justice by including an additional 
$267 million increase to tackle this challenge. And I will look 
forward to understanding the ways that you would see these 
funds spent to achieve that goal.
    You have also highlighted in this request that the EPA is 
working with the Forest Service on prescribed burns and a 
particulate matter standard for exceptional events. And this is 
critical back home in my State of Oregon, where wildfires are 
growing hotter and more devastating year after year, on the 
wildfire front and on that particulate matter piece, and the 
key is that we have to be able to do the prescribed burns which 
sometimes will violate standards. And I know fitting that into 
the overall framework is important.
    On the wildfire front, I was especially pleased to see the 
Agency release its Notice of Funding Opportunity for Wildfire 
Smoke Grants, which will close in less than a week, after 
communities across my state and much of the West were blanketed 
in smoke for weeks that was caused by historic wildfires a few 
years ago, I created this program to support local efforts 
prepare for, and protect against wildfire smoke hazards.
    I am looking forward to seeing some real results to provide 
relief from pervasive smoke that threatens businesses and 
public health.
    Even with the increases proposed in this budget, the EPA 
budget is still less than it needs to be because there is even 
more that needs to be done, as I am sure, you know, you are 
pondering.
    We are behind in rebuilding the Agency's workforce. The 
fiscal year 2024 staffing levels are still short of fiscal year 
2009; we must make progress in hiring EPA's ecologists, 
hydrologists, toxicologists, and water infrastructure 
specialists, who can meet the challenges we face with a 
changing climate, a chemical based economy, and crumbling 
infrastructure.
    Finally, I look forward to talking more in depth about 
plastics. Just this year in East Palestine, Ohio, and in 
Richmond, Indiana, we had two horrific disasters that resulted 
in no small part from our addiction to plastics, and we are 
learning more and more about the problems plastics present both 
to human health, and to damage to our ecosystems. And the 
fossil gas industry is seeking to use plastics as a way to 
expand their production, even as they are contributing 
enormously to climate chaos.
    So much more to be done about plastic pollution, from 
wellhead, to combustion, to where it piles up; and I do 
appreciate your response to my April 5th letter about reports 
that the EPA has expedited the approval of chemicals that are 
produced through the pyrolysis of plastics.
    The articles written about that were very concerning. I 
appreciate your response and without--if there is no objection 
I will enter to the record, both my letter to you, and your 
response.
    So entered, without objection.
    [The Information follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Merkley. I am still concerned that the EPA is 
failing to protect frontline communities already overburdened 
with toxic chemicals and other forms of pollution when it comes 
to that process.
    The report by ProPublica and The Guardian shed light on a 
troubling approval process that EPA used for products from that 
so-called chemical recycling, while the April 21st strategy 
contains a testing requirement for new pyrolysis oils, a small 
step forward, the air pollution that may result from the new 
facilities may, in fact, increase the damage in already 
burdened communities.
    Similarly, approval expanding a fossil fuel pipeline in my 
state is contrary to the steps that Oregon has taken to build a 
clean energy future. I hope and expect the EPA to work with the 
Federal family, and FERC in particular, to respect the wishes 
of Oregonians, as well as Californians, and Washingtonians, to 
stop that process from moving forward.
    According to FERC's analysis, the GTN XPress Project would 
emit 2.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent 
emissions each year until at least 2052. Over the next 28 years 
it will cause $9 billion in climate-related damage. And that is 
using a methodology that systematically minimizes the 
pipeline's climate impacts.
    Adding new emissions through pipeline expansions, like the 
GTN Xpress, is incompatible with President Biden's pledge, and 
it would undermine Oregon's efforts for a clean energy future.
    Now, I am delighted that our Ranking Member is here, Lisa 
Murkowski. And we will turn the microphone over to her; 
welcome.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, good morning.
    And Administrator Regan, welcome back to the committee, 
good morning to you; glad that we are able to discuss EPA's 
fiscal year '24 budget request with you this morning.
    I am going to start off by just acknowledging and thanking 
you for the working relationship that you and I have built 
within your time in office, and your team working with mine.
    Before I turn to more Alaska-specific issues this morning, 
I must note my concern over the direction that I believe the 
Agency is taking with regards to recent and planned national 
regulatory actions. In particular, I believe the Agency is 
engaging in regulatory overreach with WOTUS, which the Senate 
has expressed its disapproval on, as well as the newly proposed 
Auto Emission Rule.
    If press reports are true, EPA's soon-to-be-released Power 
Plant Rule will follow the same unfortunate pattern, and these 
broad national regulations often have a disproportionate impact 
on the State of Alaska as we have had an opportunity to 
discuss. With WOTUS, a very significant percentage of Alaska is 
considered a wetland; the finalized WOTUS Rule fails to 
consider special characteristics in Alaska, such as permafrost, 
and will harm much needed economic development within my state.
    And while I have serious concerns about how these national 
policies will negatively impact Alaska, I would like to focus 
on some more positive matters.
    And Administrator, I want to, I want to thank you, 
sincerely, for your and your Agency's leadership on the issue 
of ANGSA contaminated lands. This is an environmental injustice 
that we have discussed, it is an environmental injustice caused 
by the Federal Government. It has been left without action for 
far too long.
    But thanks to you, and the supportive colleagues here on 
the committee, we now have a new grant program within EPA to 
finally begin making a difference, and remediate these 
contaminated lands.
    For colleagues' information, under the promise and the 
commitment to Alaska Native peoples with the Native Claim 
Settlement they were entitled to certain lands. We have worked 
to make good on that commitment but, unfortunately, what 
happened over the course of years, where contaminated lands, 
lands that had been contaminated by our own Federal Government, 
are conveyed to the Native people in settlement for their 
lands. So what they receive is not only of questionable value, 
but in many times, the lands that they have received are making 
them ill, are making them sick.
    And so this was an injustice that must be corrected, and we 
are making a difference here. The Agency's fiscal year 2024 
request continues the new ANGSA Contaminated Lands Grant at 20 
million, and I truly appreciate that.
    What happened with the EPA was considerable, because the 
EPA stepped forward into the leadership role on this ANGSA 
contaminated lands. I don't mean to put one department against 
the other, but the fact of the matter is the Department of 
Interior has failed, failed to be helpful on that issue.
    And so there were some key members on your team, Mr. 
Sixkiller, there were some others that, again, have just put 
their shoulder into this, and really advanced this in a way 
that has been positive and remarkable.
    And I want to make sure that others know that you deserve 
this public commendation now. These efforts are going to 
directly improve the health and well-being of so many 
communities, and this work cannot be understated in its 
importance.
    So I hope, and I know, Administrator Regan, that there is 
more that you and I can do together to right this injustice in 
our Alaska Native community, so I am looking forward to finding 
further creative funding solutions with you. I certainly invite 
you to come to Alaska at any time to meet in some of these 
communities with me, and I know that we are looking forward to 
doing that at a point in time.
    I now want to turn to an issue that we have had opportunity 
to discuss before, and this is the Agency's Wood Heater 
Certification Program. I get that this is a problem that you 
have inherited, but unfortunately, it is really coming to a 
head for communities of Fairbanks, and North Pole, and the 
interior part of my state.
    Earlier this year, the EPA partially accepted and partially 
rejected the State of Alaska's State Implementation Plan for PM 
2.5. I believe that the Agency, fundamentally, misunderstands 
the role that its flawed Wood Heater Certification played in 
higher PM 2.5 emissions within the region.
    In fact, in February of this year, the EPA Inspector 
General released a report heavily criticizing the Agency's 
handling of its Wood Heater Program. The IG's report states 
that: EPA's mismanagement has led to elevated PM 2.5 emissions 
even though Congress has provided almost $100 million for wood 
stove changeouts over the last 8 years through the Targeted 
Airshed Grant.
    I have worked hard on that, I think you know. I secured 
tens of millions of dollars for wood stove changeouts in the 
Fairbanks area through this grant, which should be good, it 
should be a positive, so I am really very frustrated by the IG 
Report's findings.
    By failing to properly certify and test wood heater 
emissions the EPA has frustrated Congress' investments and 
intended goals.
    So Administrator, I am calling on your Agency to fix its 
handling of the Wood Heater Certification and Testing Program, 
and to internally provide whatever resources are needed to 
achieve that.
    To show my commitment, last year we provided a $1 million 
increase for staffing, and other efforts to help right the 
program, but it really is just not fair, that my constituents 
in Fairbanks and in North Pole are going to face increased 
energy prices, or perhaps even worse than that, actual energy 
insecurity due to potential enforcement actions that the Agency 
may take against them for the Agency's own mismanagement.
    I am going to be up in Fairbanks this weekend, and I can 
tell you this is going to be a hot, hot, hot topic there.
    Lastly, I want to discuss with you the Agency's handling of 
congressionally directed spending projects. I do appreciate 
that the Congress rather rapidly revived a significant workload 
for the agencies when we brought back CDS projects in fiscal 
year 2022. But I don't think that that excuses the Agency's 
performance, so far, in executing these important and needed 
investments. The Congress has provided additional resources for 
the Agency to implement a revived program, but I don't think 
that more staffing alone is going to fix the problem. I think 
that the Agency has not made this a significant enough 
priority.
    In fiscal year 2022 and 2023 the Congress funded over 1,000 
CDS projects for the EPA to manage, and to my knowledge, so far 
only a small percentage of the projects have been awarded. So I 
am concerned about the pace, particularly since Congress looks 
poised to continue CDS projects for EPA into the future, as I 
think that they should, but the Agency has got to do better 
here.
    And to show you that I am going to be your partner in this, 
I am certainly willing to work with you on any initiatives that 
you may have, any suggestions that you think can improve the 
speed of processing. This delay impacts projects nationally, 
but also significantly in my State of Alaska.
    I want to thank you for your help with several of those CDS 
projects, like the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANGSA) 
contaminated lands, but also the Polaris Building in Fairbanks. 
But just generally, I am somewhat bewildered that critical 
water and wastewater infrastructure projects are lagging 
severely behind. So I hope that you and your team will be able 
to explore ways in which CDS projects can be awarded faster, 
including any creative solutions which we can help secure in 
our Bill.
    I know that implementing these CDSs isn't easy, so I thank 
you for your work, and all the Agency personnel that are 
working on this, hopefully, we can make these the success 
stories that we know they should and could be.
    I have given you a lot here in my opening statement, Mr. 
Administrator, but know that these are issues that are so 
important across the State of Alaska. We have got a good 
working relationship, I think a strong working relationship, 
and that is why I am very comfortable raising these issues with 
you, personally, because I think that we can make a real 
difference for the State of Alaska, and we can make a real 
difference across the country.
    So it doesn't mean that I am going to stop knocking on your 
door anytime soon. We are going to work together. And again, 
look forward to the opportunity to be able to show you, 
personally, some of the challenges that we are facing and what 
more we can be doing to address them.
    With that, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Murkowski.
    On behalf of Chairman Merkley, let me recognize Director 
Regan for his open statement. Mr. Director.

                SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL REGAN

    Mr. Regan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Murkowski, and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the necessary 
vision laid out in the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency's fiscal year 2024 Budget Request.
    In this request we lay out an ambitious but transformative 
plan for the EPA with the goal of building a healthier, more 
prosperous nation while ensuring global competitiveness, energy 
independence, and energy security.
    President Biden's proposed fiscal year 2024 Budget Requests 
for EPA provides $12.1 billion to advance key priorities 
including protecting air quality, upgrading our nation's aging 
water infrastructure, tackling the climate crisis, and 
rebuilding core functions at EPA.
    Over the last year EPA has made significant progress 
towards many of these goals. We have taken action to cut smog 
and hazardous air pollution, which will reduce the risk of 
cancer in nearby communities by almost 96 percent--in some 
communities about 96 percent. We have taken strides to ensure 
that all people have clean water by proposing the first ever 
legal limits for PFAS, and investing billions of dollars to 
remove 100 percent of lead pipes across this country.
    And we have accelerated our transition to a clean 
transportation future by proposing the strongest ever standards 
for cars and trucks, while awarding 2,400 Clean School Buses to 
school districts all across the country. I am proud of the 
foundation that we have laid and the partnerships that we have 
underpinning our successes.
    But there is still so much more work to do so that all of 
our children have safe, healthy places to live, learn, and 
play, to build a stronger more sustainable economy, and to 
advance American innovation and ingenuity. Simply put, 
investing in EPA is investing in America.
    Across the country poor air quality still affects millions 
of people perpetuating harmful health and economic impacts. In 
fiscal year 2024, the Agency will protect air quality by 
cutting emissions of ozone-forming pollutants, particulate 
matter, and air toxics.
    The President's budget includes $1.4 billion to improve air 
quality and set standards that reduce pollution from mobile and 
stationary sources. EPA's work to set these standards provides 
certainty to industry, builds on advances in technology, and 
reinforces the market movement towards a cleaner energy system 
that provides reliable and affordable energy.
    A thriving economy also requires clean and safe water for 
everyone in this country, although progress has been made many 
still lack access to healthy water, face inadequate wastewater 
infrastructure, and suffer from the effects of lead pipes. 
America's water systems are also facing new challenges, 
including cyber security threat, climate change, and emerging 
contaminants such as PFAS.
    The budget proposes more than $4 billion to upgrade 
drinking water and wastewater infrastructure nationwide with a 
focus on underserved communities.
    Over the last year, I have had the privilege of traveling 
across the country, from Jackson, Mississippi, to East 
Palestine, Ohio. I have visited communities and seen first-hand 
environmental and public health challenges many of your 
constituents continue to experience.
    I have spoken to families who have been sickened by the air 
they breathe. I have met with people who live with toxic waste 
in their backyard. And I have seen conditions that are simply 
unacceptable in the United States of America. From investing in 
our Nation's climate resilience, to cleaning up contaminated 
land and water, there is absolutely no shortage of important 
work to be done.
    Senators of the committee, EPA is up for the task. We are 
eager to work with all of you to deliver for our fellow 
Americans, and to secure our Nation's global competitiveness, 
but we need your support. Both the urgency and economic 
opportunity presented by climate change require that we leave 
no stone unturned.
    I would also like to take a moment to remind folks that we 
must keep moving forward, 2024 will undoubtedly present a 
unique set of challenges, and moving backwards, certainly, is 
not an option.
    Reverting back to the fiscal year 2022 budget would force 
the Agency to make very difficult decisions. EPA would have to 
cut hundreds of millions of dollars from programs that protect 
communities all across America, impacting our ability to hire 
critical staff, including toxicologists, engineers, scientists, 
and others who play a crucial role in protecting the people of 
this country and our planet.
    With a reduced budget EPA may be forced to delay fixing 
America's aging water infrastructure, it might endanger our 
efforts to address climate change, and it might roll back our 
progress that we have made on environmental justice.
    President Biden's budget positions EPA to create durable 
environmental policy, invest in America, and set our Nation on 
a path to win the 21st century. It will also allow us to 
address the environmental concerns of millions of Americans, 
and fundamentally improve people's lives for the better.
    Thank you for the opportunity to be here today, and to 
submit this testimony for the record. And I look forward to our 
continued partnerships to achieve these ambitious, yet 
necessary goals. And welcome all questions.
    Thank you all.
    [The statement follows:]
              Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael S. Regan
    Thank you, Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members 
of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you 
today to discuss the bold vision laid out in the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget 
request. Before turning to FY 2024, I also want to express my 
appreciation for the targeted increases included in the FY 2023 enacted 
appropriation and all of the work that went into accomplishing this 
year's budget. Building off that foundation, in our FY 2024 Budget 
request, we lay out an ambitious plan for EPA that provides the 
resources needed to advance a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable 
Nation where all people have equal access to safe and clean water, air, 
and communities.
                 the fy 2024 president's budget request
    The President's FY 2024 Budget for EPA provides $12.1 billion to 
advance the key priorities outlined in the FY 2022-FY 2026 EPA 
Strategic Plan, including tackling the climate crisis, delivering 
environmental justice, protecting air quality, upgrading the Nation's 
aging water infrastructure, and rebuilding core functions at EPA. EPA 
is committed to providing robust support to our tribal, state, and 
local partners through grants that directly reach these communities. 
Nearly half of our Budget, over $5.8 billion, is to support state, 
tribal and local partners to advance the critical mission we can only 
accomplish by working together. The Budget requests approximately $1.2 
billion to support implementation of grant programs authorized in the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA). The Budget 
also includes more than 1,900 additional Full Time Equivalents (FTE) 
across program and regional offices, bringing EPA back to 17,000 FTE, 
to ensure EPA has the capacity to protect human health and the 
environment across the Nation.
                      tackling the climate crisis
    In FY 2024 EPA will continue to prioritize climate mitigation and 
adaptation, which are both essential components of the strategy to 
reduce the impacts of climate change. EPA's budget will support Federal 
partners, tribal governments, states, territories, local governments, 
environmental justice organizations, community groups, and businesses 
to address climate change. EPA will provide an additional $45 million 
and 26 FTE for climate adaptation efforts to strengthen the adaptive 
capacity of tribes, states, territories, local governments, 
communities, and businesses. In addition, EPA also will provide $400 
million in grants, an increase of $151 million, to help expand the 
efforts of state and local air pollution control agencies to implement 
the Clean Air Act. We will leverage an additional $65 million to 
implement the American Innovation in Manufacturing Act to continue 
phasing out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). EPA will direct an additional 
$37 million to improve knowledge of the impacts of climate change on 
human health and the environment through our research programs.
                      enforcing environmental laws
    Enforcing and ensuring compliance of our Nation's environmental 
laws is central to achieving EPA's mission. EPA holds, and will 
continue to hold, bad actors accountable for their violations, with a 
particular focus on communities with multiple pollution sources. This 
Budget invests $246 million for civil enforcement efforts, such as 
increasing enforcement efforts in communities with high pollution 
exposure and preventing the illegal importation and use of 
hydrofluorocarbons in the United States. The request also includes $165 
million for compliance monitoring and additional resources to implement 
a coal combustion residuals compliance program. The Budget also directs 
$75 million for criminal enforcement efforts to pursue investigations 
of the most egregious environmental cases and to support a specialized 
Criminal Enforcement Initiative focused on addressing environmental 
justice issues in partnership with the Department of Justice (DOJ).
           ensuring clean and healthy air for all communities
    Poor air quality still affects millions of people across the 
country, perpetuating harmful short- and long-term health and quality 
of life impacts. In FY 2024, EPA will improve air quality for 
communities by reducing emissions of ozone-forming pollutants, 
particulate matter, and air toxics. The President's Budget includes 
$1.4 billion to improve air quality and reducing localized pollution, 
reducing exposure to radiation, and improving indoor air for 
communities across the country. The Budget dedicates $180 million to 
the development and implementation of national emission standards to 
reduce air pollution from vehicles, engines, and fuels. EPA's work to 
set these standards provides certainty to industry, builds on advances 
in technology, and reinforces market movement towards a cleaner energy 
system that provides reliable and affordable energy. The Budget 
provides $150 million, a $50 million increase above the 2023 level, to 
expand the availability of Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) grants 
and rebates.
    The Budget includes $367 million to assist tribal, state, and local 
air pollution control agencies in the development, implementation, and 
evaluation of programs for the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS) and to establish standards for reducing air toxics. EPA will 
continue to build on its historic progress in protecting human health 
and the environment from the harmful effects of air pollution and work 
to assure clean air for all Americans, with a particular focus on those 
in underserved and overburdened communities.
           achieving clean and safe water for all communities
    Clean and safe water is a foundation for healthy communities and a 
thriving economy, and EPA is committed to ensuring clean and safe water 
for all. Although immense progress has been made across our Nation, 
many still lack access to safe and clean water and suffer the effects 
of aging infrastructure and legacy lead pipes. America's water systems 
also are facing new challenges, including cybersecurity threats, 
climate change, and emerging contaminants of concern, such as PFAS.
    In FY 2024, EPA will continue our work with Federal, tribal, state, 
and nongovernmental partners to advance water quality science, provide 
clean and safe water for all communities, and protect our Nation's 
waterbodies from degradation. The Budget provides more than $4 billion 
for water infrastructure, an increase of $1 billion over the 2023 
enacted level. The Budget funds all of the authorizations in the 
original Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021 and 
maintains funding for EPA's State Revolving Funds (SRF) at the total 
2023 enacted level, which complements funds provided for water 
infrastructure programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To 
further the President's goal of replacing all lead pipes within the 
next decade, the Budget proposes $219 million for two grants dedicated 
to remediating lead contamination in water-- Reducing Lead in Drinking 
Water and Lead Testing in Schools.
    Also included is $80 million to support the Water Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan program. As of February 2023, 
EPA has issued 100 WIFIA loans to communities across the country 
totaling over $17 billion in credit assistance to help finance more 
than $36 billion for water infrastructure projects. WIFIA loans for 
these projects have saved communities nearly $5 billion, which can be 
used for additional infrastructure investment and to keep rates 
affordable for water system users. These WIFIA-financed projects have 
created over 123,000 jobs and benefited more than 50 million people, 
demonstrating that WIFIA credit assistance is an effective tool to help 
address a variety of water infrastructure needs to support communities 
nationwide.
    In FY 2024, EPA will continue to work across environmental programs 
to advance agency efforts to tackle Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
(PFAS) pollution. As part of the President's commitment to tackling 
PFAS pollution and EPA's PFAS Strategic Roadmap, the FY 2024 Budget 
provides EPA with the resources to increase its understanding of PFAS 
and their human health and ecological effects; restrict PFAS use to 
prevent new PFAS pollution from entering the air, land, water; and 
remediate PFAS that have been released into the environment. The FY 
2024 Budget provides $279 million for the Section 106 Grants Program, 
which funds state, interstate, and tribal water pollution control 
programs, and is a critical funding source to establish, expand, and 
implement water quality programs to protect and restore water 
resources. More than $60 million in additional funding is provided 
across the budget to accelerate progress on EPA's PFAS Strategic 
Roadmap, and enable EPA to move more quickly on policy, regulatory, and 
enforcement actions across multiple statutory authorities. EPA will 
continue its efforts in FY 2024 to develop analytical methods, drinking 
water health advisories, toxicity values, effluent limitation 
guidelines, as well as risk communication and other tools to support 
states, tribes, and localities in managing PFAS risks in their 
communities.
    From the Great Lakes to the Chesapeake Bay, from Lake Pontchartrain 
to the Puget Sound, the United States is home to water bodies of 
ecological, cultural, and economic significance. The Budget invests 
$682 million to continue strong support for EPA's Geographic Water 
Programs to protect and restore these water bodies of special 
ecological and economic importance to the Nation. EPA's Geographic 
Programs deliver technical and financial assistance to solve problems 
and support healthy resilient ecosystems and to maintain, restore, and 
improve water quality, which yields environmental, economic, and 
recreational benefits to their communities.
               safeguarding and revitalizing communities
    Preventing and cleaning up environmental pollution that harms 
communities and poses a risk to public health and safety continue to be 
a top priority for the Administration. The FY 2024 Budget enables EPA 
to collaborate with Tribal, state, and local partners to improve the 
livelihood of all residents of the United States by addressing 
contaminated sites, including Superfund, brownfields, leaking 
underground storage tanks, and other waste sites and restoring them to 
productive use.
    An estimated $2.5 billion in Superfund tax receipts that will be 
available to EPA in FY 2024, combined with IIJA funding and 
appropriated resources, will enable the Superfund program to continue 
with a renewed urgency cleaning up some of the Nation's most 
contaminated land and respond to environmental emergencies and natural 
disasters. This historic level of funding will allow EPA to advance 
critical Superfund pre-construction work such as site characterization, 
construction design, and community outreach/engagement. Additionally, 
this funding will allow the Superfund Emergency Response and Removal 
Program to effectively and efficiently address situations that require 
emergency response and removal actions such as chemical releases, fires 
or explosions, natural disasters, and other threats to people from 
exposure to hazardous substances, including from abandoned and 
uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. The Budget also includes $217 
million for EPA's Brownfields programs to provide grants and technical 
assistance to communities so they can safely clean up and reuse 
contaminated properties, as well as $20 million for the new Alaska 
Contaminated Lands program. Taken together, these investments will 
ensure EPA is cleaning up sites and fully engaging the communities we 
serve in the process.
    ensuring the safety of chemicals for people and the environment
    Chemicals and toxic substances are ubiquitous in our everyday lives 
and are often released into the environment from their manufacture, 
processing use, or disposal. EPA has significant responsibilities under 
amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to ensure the 
safety of chemicals in or entering commerce and addressing unreasonable 
risks to human health or the environment. The FY 2024 Budget includes 
$131 million and 534 FTE to support the TSCA Program, an increase of 
$48 million and 174 FTE over the 2023 level. EPA will continue to 
emphasize quality of work, adherence to statutory intent and timelines 
applicable to pre-market review of new chemicals, chemical risk 
evaluation and management, data development and information collection, 
and review of Confidential Business Information (CBI) claims. These 
resources will support EPA-initiated chemical risk evaluations, issue 
protective regulations in accordance with statutory timelines, and 
establish a pipeline of priority chemicals for risk evaluation.
    The agency also has significant responsibility under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to screen new 
pesticides before they reach the market and ensure pesticides already 
in commerce are safe. In addition, EPA is responsible for complying 
with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensuring that federally 
endangered and threatened species are not harmed when the agency 
registers pesticides. To continue making progress toward meeting ESA 
mandates in FY 2024, the Budget includes an additional $27 million in 
our environmental pesticides program, including an additional $10 
million to support Endangered Species Act Pesticides Review to improve 
EPA compliance in pesticide regulatory activities and develop improved 
methodologies for ESA review.
                    elevating environmental justice
    The development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental 
laws, regulations, and policies has not always ensured the fair 
treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, 
color, national origin, or income. To help address these inequities, 
EPA created a new national program in September, the Office of 
Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, to lead our efforts in 
this area and embed environmental justice practices into EPA programs.
    In FY 2024, EPA requests more than $375 million and 265 FTE for the 
Environmental Justice Program to expand support for community-based 
organizations, indigenous organizations, tribes, states, local 
governments, and territorial governments to identify and develop 
solutions to environmental justice issues through multi-partner 
collaborations. This includes $130 million in four environmental 
justice grant programs and $91 million and 50 FTE to build out 
community- centered technical assistance hubs. The Budget provides a 
total of $31 million, an $18 million increase, to build civil rights 
capacity across EPA and to reduce the backlog of civil rights cases. In 
the long term, the vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws will 
address historical and systemic barriers that contribute to the 
environmental injustice affecting vulnerable communities. The Budget 
proposes additional funds and FTE to increase protection of fenceline 
communities with disproportionately high pollution exposure through 
improving inspections, compliance assistance, and monitoring capacity 
in those communities.
  continuing to restore epa's core capacity and following the science
    The Budget adds more than 1,960 FTE relative to the 2023 enacted 
level, for a total of more than 17,000 FTE, to help rebuild EPA's 
capacity. The Budget also will dedicate resources to continue 
strengthening the agency's ability to recruit, hire, develop, promote, 
and retain top talent and remove barriers to equal opportunity at 
management and staff levels to strengthen and advance diversity, 
equity, inclusion, and accessibility.
    Ensuring EPA has the work force it needs to carry out its mission 
to protect clean air and water, tackle the climate crisis, and promote 
environmental justice is essential. A commitment to follow the science 
underpins EPA's work, and this budget includes $968 million for the 
Science and Technology account, an increase of more than $165 million 
above current levels that will ensure programs have the best available 
data to inform decisions.
                               conclusion
    All people in this country deserve clean air, clean water, and safe 
land on which to live. This is the core of EPA's mission and is a 
worthy investment of Federal resources. The FY 2024 President's Budget 
positions the EPA to advance our vital mission of protecting human 
health and the environment, championing environmental justice, and 
tackling the climate crisis. With these investments we lay the 
groundwork to ensure the benefits of a cleaner environment for future 
generations.
    Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I look forward to 
our continued partnership to achieve our goals and welcome any 
questions you may have.

    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much. Now, we are going to 
have seven-minute rounds, and I will ask everyone to wrap up 
their questions as their time run out, so we can make sure 
everyone gets a chance to ask their insights, and we will have 
probably an opportunity for several rounds.
    I will just begin, Administrator Regan, by asking you about 
the House Majority proposal to freeze funding to fiscal year 
2022 levels, and consequence as it would translate to EPA State 
Tribal and Local Grant and Infrastructure accounts by nearly--
it would cut it by nearly a billion dollars, including a $600 
million cut on the program that would replace lead pipes, and 
upgrade drinking water systems, and support other water 
infrastructure.
    It seems like that is at odds with bipartisan support for 
water infrastructure. But I wanted to see--or give you an 
opportunity to clarify what that House proposal would do?
    Mr. Regan. Well, thank you, for the question. And our job 
is fundamentally about keeping people safe, to safeguard the 
very things that we all as Americans hold dear, like the 
insurance that when our children turn on their tap water the 
water they drink will be clean, or when they play outside the 
air that they breathe will be safe. Undoubtedly, if we were to 
roll back the budget to 2022 levels, it would force us to make 
some very difficult, difficult decisions in terms of protecting 
the health and safety of all Americans.
    It would also cut hundreds of millions of dollars from 
programs that impact the market. We understand that there are 
pesticides and herbicides that need to make it to the markets, 
to give all of our farmers the tools that they need to be 
successful to feed this country.
    And so there will be significant impacts on the EPA's 
ability to put significant products on the market, to continue 
to help this country be competitive from a global economic 
standpoint, but more importantly sacrifice, potentially, the 
health and safety of some of our fellow citizens.
    Senator Merkley. So if I can simplify, just to the lead 
pipes issue, since that is a condition affects the developing 
brains of our babies and our children has been a big concern. 
Would that proposal significantly cut the removal of lead 
pipes, resulting in more damage to more children?
    Mr. Regan. It absolutely will.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. In April 21st, President Biden 
signed an Executive Order for a whole-of-government approach to 
environmental justice, and you have significant 
responsibilities under that order. It directs the Agency to use 
science and data to make determinations about project 
permitting. Can you share what the most important tools are 
that EPA gained in that Executive Order, and how you plan to 
use them to directly impact environmental justice communities?
    Mr. Regan. Well, you know, thanks to the President's 
leadership he made environmental justice a pillar of this 
administration from day one. And so we moved very quickly, 
thanks to your partnership, and others, to create a new 
national program. And by what I mean by ``new'' is we 
reorganized with the resources that we had. We put three 
offices together to focus on environmental justice and external 
civil rights.
    There are a number of tools in that Executive Order that 
have been adopted by the White House that will be used across 
the Federal family, so that we can ensure that our regulations 
match with the direction that the White House and other 
agencies are pursuing, so that we can protect every single 
person in this country, equally, under the law.
    We have made a lot of strides in environmental justice, I 
am proud of our environmental justice record, I am proud of the 
tools that we have at our disposal, but now we have an entire 
Federal family that is rowing in the same direction to ensure 
that all people in this country are protected.
    Senator Merkley. And you have proposed a very significant 
increase in the Environmental Justice Funding, can you 
translate just in common language, what that will mean for 
communities that have been burdened by high levels of toxic 
chemicals?
    Mr. Regan. It will be tremendous. You know, I believe as a 
former state regulator, that states know their communities 
quite well, and communities know them even better. And many of 
the solutions that communities have had for decades, on helping 
to reduce pollution, and remove themselves from the frontlines, 
need to be matched with funding. With the request that we have 
asked, it gives us more personnel to be out in the fields, 
engaging with the communities, looking at those solutions and 
matching those with the significant grants, and resources that 
the Agency can bring to bear.
    In some cases because of income, and because of race, 
because of ZIP code, we are seeing an undue and unfair burden 
on our constituents, whether it is Lowndes County, Alabama, or 
whether it is McDowell County, West Virginia, this is an issue 
that plagues this country, and it is our job to be sure that 
every single person in this country has access to clean air 
clean water.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. I am very pleased to see the 
proposal for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, or the Green 
Bank that EPA is starting to implement as part of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. Oregon certainly has ambitious 
renewable energy goals, and there is an opportunity for that 
kind of funding. Oregon does not have its own Green Bank in 
place, however.
    Will you commit to making sure that Oregon and other states 
that don't have their own Green Banks can still have access to 
the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund?
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And what is your plan for 
ensuring that funding actually makes it to environmental 
justice communities?
    Mr. Regan. Well, at EPA we have built environmental justice 
into our very DNA, and so number one, we have some very 
concrete metrics that are attached to this $27 billion to be 
sure that disadvantaged communities and those who are 
disproportionately impacted have access to this capital. We 
have planned to make two to three awards under the National 
Clean Investment Fund, an additional to seven awards under the 
Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which will definitely 
partner with more grassroots organizations, community 
development banks, and the like.
    And then we have about $6 billion to focus on--or $7 
billion to focus on a Solar for All Competition. And so we are 
going to build in the metrics to be sure that those who need 
these resources the most have a seat at the table and have an 
opportunity to invest in this new clean energy economy.
    Senator Merkley. In 25 seconds, do you want to explain the 
Solar for All?
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Regan. You know, this is an opportunity to provide up 
to 60 grants to states, tribal governments, municipalities, and 
non-profits, to expand, specifically, the number of low-income, 
and disadvantaged communities that are prime for investments in 
residential and community scale solar.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. Perfect.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Regan, I mentioned at length in my comments 
my concern with regards to the Wood Heater Program and the 
certification, and have suggested that it is--it is 
unacceptable that the communities of Fairbanks and North Pole 
are effectively going to bear this burden for actions where the 
Agency has failed, and that the program has to be fixed. I 
think we recognize that it has to be fixed, and I think it has 
to be done at whatever expense necessary.
    So I appreciate the engagement that you and your staff have 
led on this, to right this, I am certainly following this very 
carefully. But I do understand that you have recently responded 
to the Inspector General Report. Can you tell me what steps the 
EPA is taking, internally, to improve the wood testing and 
certification standards, and the enforcement of those 
standards?
    Mr. Regan. Well, thank you for the question. And we are 
absolutely taking the OIG's report very seriously, and in 
implementing some of those recommendations we are strengthening 
our commitment to work with the Alaska DEC, Fairbanks North 
Star Borough, and other key people in the community. We are 
also designing a program using $15 million in funding from IRA 
for testing and other activities to address these emissions 
from the wood stoves.
    I want to let you know, Senator, that this issue has my 
attention. We will continue to prioritize it with these IRA 
dollars, with the OIG Report, and with enforcement discretion, 
I believe that we can resolve this issue.
    Senator Murkowski. I appreciate that. I appreciate the 
commitment that you have made to reform this program and making 
that a priority. You have also heard my thanks for EPA's 
leadership in the ANGSA contaminated lands effort. I think you 
would agree with me that this is one of those situations when 
we talk about environmental injustice, you can you can park 
this program here, right there under that category.
    So I am going to continue to be a very zealous advocate for 
our Alaska Native communities, and in righting this. We have 
made some good progress, but I think we recognize that there is 
so much, so much that has to be done in this area.
    So I would like your commitment that the Agency will 
maintain its leadership role on the issue, and to continue to 
work with me on all avenues so that we can move the needle on 
ANGSA contaminated lands.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely. And we are really excited, in the 
Inflation Reduction Act there is a couple of programs there 
that we can access through that environmental justice lens to 
help expedite some of the work that we have partnered on. So I 
am really excited about that. And thank you for the inclusion 
of the 20 million in the fiscal year 2023 annual appropriation. 
I think we are going to leverage all these resources to finally 
bring some justice to this situation.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Well, that is excellent, excellent 
to hear, and to think--to know that you are looking at the 
opportunities within IRA, so I would love to have further 
conversation with you. I know we had hoped to have a call 
before this hearing, perhaps we can do it as a follow on. But I 
thank you for.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely.
    Senator Murkowski. I also mentioned my concern with how the 
rollout, or how the implementation of CDS projects is coming 
through the Agency, and I have suggested, and would strongly 
encourage EPA to explore some creative solutions to expedite 
these project awards; whether it is co-management with states, 
programmatic, NEPA, or categorical exclusions, any of these 
other ideas. I am not convinced that funding for hiring more 
personnel is the sole solution, and may not even be the most 
efficient.
    But know that I am ready, willing, and able to help secure 
new authorities in appropriations bills if it is needed. So I 
guess what I would like to hear from you this morning, is 
whether you also are concerned about the execution and the 
process, going forward. And whether or not we need to speed up 
project awards, and make it a top-tier priority like I do.
    Mr. Regan. Yes. It is a top-tier priority. I am concerned 
with the speed of getting these resources to these communities. 
So we are looking at innovative ways to do so, while 
maintaining, or staying within those lines that would be 
sufficient for oversight. We are also--many of these 
communities have never received this level of funding before.
    Senator Murkowski. Right.
    Mr. Regan. And so we are having to deploy a lot of 
technical assistance in new programs to be sure that they are 
prepared to receive these dollars, and stay within the bounds 
of the law. I believe with the $15 million received last year, 
a fresh approach to looking at how to streamline this, and 
pushing out more technical resources, we can begin to get this 
program on the right track.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, I would ask that we have an 
opportunity to have a follow-on meeting with your team and in 
our committee staff, to discuss some of the ideas on how we can 
really improve this, especially ones outside of asks for more 
funding for staff. So if you can commit to working with us on 
that?
    Mr. Regan. I do.
    Senator Murkowski. Good, very good. PFAS, everybody is 
talking about PFAS, rightfully, and certainly in Alaska we 
remain very, very concerned. We had included 10 billion in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to begin tackling PFAS, I think 
that is a good investment. When I talk to communities in my 
state, they very much want to take on PFAS, but they are 
concerned about national regulations, and how they could, 
potentially, amount to new unfunded mandates.
    They also expressed that the State of Remediation 
Technology is not as advanced as it should be. And we have got 
some groups in Alaska that I think are being innovative, and 
working on some cutting-edge PFAS remediation technology, that 
is encouraging there.
    But how do you view the concerns of communities that are 
going to have to meet these stringent drinking water and CERCLA 
Standards, with no further financial help from the government? 
And I mean, are we are we in a good place with testing and 
remediation technologies? Are they affordable for the water 
systems; ready to be applied at a national scale? Everybody is 
talking about this.
    Mr. Regan. Yes. I can say, coming from North Carolina and 
facing this firsthand, a lot of small communities, that is 
first and foremost on my mind, of the $10 billion for PFAS, and 
BIL, we know that 5 billion is dedicated specifically for 
small, disadvantaged rural water systems. We want to continue 
to match those dollars with our traditional budget, and dollars 
from USDA, and other places, to be sure that our small, 
disadvantaged and rural communities aren't left behind.
    We do believe, and we are investing in new testing methods 
to detect this. We also know that there are existing 
technologies we are hoping that those costs will come down. But 
we want to engage with communities, like the ones you have 
mentioned, that have some innovative ideas for mitigation, and 
detecting, because we are in that research and development 
mode, and all options should be considered.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, hopefully we will have an 
opportunity for you to meet some of the folks that are moving 
out on some of these good ideas. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Regan. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Reed.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, Director, for joining us today. And like 
many of my colleagues, I am still reeling from the proposed 
House Republican budget which would substantially cut EPA. In 
fact, I think from your letter, you indicated it would be the 
lowest funding level since 2013.
    In 2013, I was Chairman of the committee, and Senator 
Murkowski was the Ranking Member. A lot has changed since 2013.
    Mr. Regan. Yes.
    Senator Reed. And a lot of new problems have emerged, and 
would be requiring resources to deal with those problems. One 
of the issues we have all spoken about, is the lead pipe 
challenge, and making sure everyone has clean, drinking water. 
The proposed Republican budget would slash $626 million from 
that program, would set it back tremendously.
    But there are so many other areas, and one area that I 
think would be also hit would be appropriate staffing levels 
for EPA, so it could do its job. Is that a concern you have?
    Mr. Regan. It is a concern. It is a concern, whether it be 
thinking through our enforcement capabilities, to help 
disadvantaged communities that are impacted by lead, or by 
PFAS, or by, you know, chemical facilities. Or again, whether 
it is, in my engagements with our agriculture community, the 
courts have taken away so many tools from our farmers. They 
have taken so many pesticides and herbicides off the shelves. 
We need the staff and the resources to get new products on the 
market so that farmers can have all the tools that they need.
    Senator Reed. Well, I think also from your experience as a 
state regulator, you know that one of the most frustrating 
things is to go to a regulatory agency, and because they are 
understaffed, underfunded, they are not able to respond to a 
request for permit, or anything else.
    And what that does is undercut, frankly, the faith in the 
institution. And I am beginning to think more and more that 
this approach of budget cutting, is not just about saving money 
it is about devaluing the institutions that are necessary to 
compete, and succeed in this world. That might be more 
commentary than question, but any thoughts you have?
    Mr. Regan. I think that is absolutely correct. Listen, I 
have spent more time than any administrator with our 
agriculture community. I just did a session with a bunch of 
CEOs and executives from the auto industry, you know, I have 
met with all of our CEOs in the power industry, we have staff 
that are working with their staffs to be sure that we are 
taking advantage of the latest technologies. And we have forged 
a relationship so that we can keep this country globally 
competitive. Reduction in staff really does reduce our ability 
to help our economy grow, and help us to be sustainable.
    And with respect to the lead pipe issue which we talked 
about, I can't emphasize enough how critical, as you know, 
because exposure to lead in a child has extreme consequences, 
neurological development, cognitive development, and there are 
a lot of young people, because they have been not fortunate 
enough to live in wealthy communities, have been exposed to 
lead-infected, perhaps water, and their ability to function is 
impaired for a lifetime.
    So this is a--I think not just an issue of cost-benefit 
analysis, it is also a moral imperative, and I think we have to 
do much more. And cutting these monies seems to me to be, not 
just inefficient, but rejecting a commitment we should have.
    Mr. Regan. I absolutely agree. We received, fortunately, 
$15 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but over 
the past year we have worked with every state in the country, 
we have developed a more robust inventory, we know that we have 
9 million lead service lines in this country, we know that is 
close to $40 billion in needs, we have to close this gap. There 
is absolutely no acceptable or safe level of lead exposure, for 
our children, or for anyone.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Director. Director, one 
of the programs we were able to pull together was the 
geographic programs of EPA, and we were fortunate enough to 
create one that dealt with the Southern New England, that is 
the Southern New England Program, or SNEP, and one of the 
critical reasons it is a problem that Senator Murkowski doesn't 
have, because Alaska is pretty big, but Narragansett Bay 
occupies a large portion of our state, but its waters come from 
two adjacent states, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
    So unless we have a regional approach to issues of 
pollution, et cetera, we can't, literally, effectively control 
the quality of water in Narragansett Bay, the quality of water 
throughout Rhode Island. So we have this program, which is 
extremely effective, and it is one of several programs 
throughout the United States, and again that they are in severe 
jeopardy of being eliminated, underfunded, or understaffed. Can 
you speak to the importance of these programs, and also the 
efficiency?
    Mr. Regan. I can. Very important program; and listen, in 
the President's budget there is an increase of $78,000 above 
2023 that we would like to help ensure--in both this program. 
The SNEP Program, as you said, serves as a hub to enable 
protection and restoration of coastal watersheds of the 
Southeast New England. Protecting these watersheds and 
ecosystems, ecosystem services provide and help sustain the 
region's communities' and environmental assets well into the 
future.
    And I will say that we recognize this program draws on a 
network of stakeholders, and experts that seek out, and support 
innovative practices, that complement the work that all of us 
are doing to protect this watershed; so extremely, extremely 
important. And also a great organization and a great program 
that does a lot of good work, not just for the ecosystem, as 
you know, but for the economy in our New England states.
    Senator Reed. Yeah. Well, thank you, very much Mr. 
Director. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Britt.
    Senator Britt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Administrator, thank you for being in front of our 
committee today. I appreciate your work and your interest in 
Alabama. Your reference to Uniontown is something that I 
appreciate. It is something that I have been working on for 
years. Actually, as a staffer in this very building, got to 
work under Senator Shelby's leadership to help secure a $23.4 
million grant from USDA Rural Development, to get to work on 
this very issue.
    Additionally, we added that to Congresswoman Terri Sewell's 
work on the outside, with a $1.8 million revenue stream moving 
to help fix this problem. We certainly know and believe that we 
have to upgrade, and repair these systems, and so certainly 
look forward to working with you moving forward.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely.
    Senator Britt. As you know, Congress disapproved, a few 
weeks ago, of EPA's new WOTUS Rule, and I am grateful that 
Alabama is currently protected from its impacts by a Federal 
Court ruling.
    When Farmers wake up early in the morning to take on their 
day, from feeding their cows, to mending fences, to planting, 
to harvesting, they have enough on their plate. They should not 
have to worry that ponds, ditches, or mud holes on their 
private land are federally regulated.
    The uncertainty of Biden's WOTUS Rule has created, and 
continues to create unsustainable state of shifting permitting 
in this country. The cost is hundreds of thousands of dollars 
for Americans to comply with ever-changing regulations. 
Alabamians shouldn't need to pay a lawyer to find out if a 
ditch on their land is now federally regulated.
    Mr. Administrator, when the EPA calculated the economic 
cost benefits of the new Biden WOTUS Rule, did the EPA consider 
the impact of that uncertainty that was created by the 
ambiguity?
    Mr. Regan. You know, thank you for the question and, you 
know, I think that I would like to say that I have tried my 
best. I have met with more of our AG constituency than any 
administrator prior to me.
    Senator Britt. Appreciate that.
    Mr. Regan. And I also know though, that the ambiguity isn't 
just solely on EPA. I think multiple Supreme Courts have 
weighed in on this, at least three to four administrations have 
tried to get this right. What we have done is we have taken a 
look at what the courts have ruled prior, what the Supreme 
Court has said prior, and we attempted to put a rule in place 
that was much more durable, legally, than we have seen in the 
past.
    Senator Britt. Do you think it had an economic impact?
    Mr. Regan. Well, I think that everything that we do can 
have a plus or minus economic impact, which is why we work so 
hard to provide the certainty that other administrations have 
failed to provide so far.
    Senator Britt. So on the primary economic analysis on this 
WOTUS Rule that said it would have no economic impact, and you 
signed off on that. Do you agree with that assessment?
    Mr. Regan. I think that your question in terms of 
uncertainty of the economic impact is one that we--I would not 
say reject the premise of the question, but the economic 
assessment that we do is based on our legal assessment of what 
the law requires, and what we put in place so that farmers do 
have the certainty to comply with the rule. And I will say 
that, worked very closely with Secretary Vilsack at USDA, to be 
sure that as we implemented the rule, we will be able to 
leverage resources across the Federal family.
    So we believe that the economic impact would be positive 
because we thought that the farmers and the farmer community 
would have some certainty.
    Senator Britt. Well, I can assure you that there are 
economic impacts, and unfortunately many of those have been 
negative. In Alabama alone, SBC says over 64,000 small 
businesses have been impacted by this, and that is 165,000 
employees. So I am of the belief that our cattlemen, our 
foresters, and our farmers, have tended their land for 
generation upon generation, and they actually depend on the 
fruitfulness of that land to continue to do the job that they 
love.
    And I believe that food security is national security, and 
if we can't feed or clothe ourselves, nothing else matters. So 
I appreciate your attention to the negative economic impacts 
that have come as a result of this.
    I have noticed a pattern of concern from people coming to 
my office discussing the EPA. Many have feared that the EPA is 
regulating past what science will support, or technology that 
is available. Just to put it bluntly, Alabamians fear that EPA 
regulations are more predicted based on the Green New Deal 
ideology, than that of the Science and Technology before us.
    With PFAS, the current EPA proposal stretches the limits of 
what can be consistently tested. Complying with the levels 
proposed, even if possible, would divert millions of dollars 
from needed infrastructure upgrades, and worse, the term that I 
continue to hear from people is ``bankruptcy''.
    For power plants there are fears that the EPA will impose 
technologies that are not readily available, or that can 
actually not be implemented at this time. And of course there 
is pesticides; in 2021 your Agency eliminated the use of 
chlorpyrifos for soybeans, cotton, and for other crops.
    In the past, you have said you agreed with USDA on the 
science of this pesticide, and actually the Secretary of USDA 
has personally written that there are safe uses to this 
product. Since then there has been--blame that has been shifted 
to the Band on the Ninth Circuit Court, for quote, ``Setting 
the bar too high.''
    I understand that the Band was consistent with obviously 
the platform, with the Democratic Party in 2020, but I get the 
political dynamics, but I am asking you, what I don't 
understand is: Do you think that there are good uses for this? 
And if so, how can we get back to utilizing them?
    Mr. Regan. Well, I think that Secretary Vilsack and I are, 
number one, working very closely together.
    Senator Britt. That is great to hear.
    Mr. Regan. Number two, we both believe in shared science. I 
think what Secretary Vilsack has said a number of times, 
publicly, and I will repeat it, is that, you know: USDA has its 
perspective, EPA has its. But I am the one that has to show up 
in front of the judge. And when the Ninth Circuit set the bar 
so high, that EPA had a burden of proof that, historically, has 
never been placed before, we had to make a decision to follow 
the law. So I think there is a way that you can follow the law 
and the science. And they may not agree----
    Senator Britt. What about the 11 safe uses? Do you feel 
like we can allow growers--can EPA find a way to allow growers 
to use those?
    Mr. Regan. I think that what the EPA has done, and will 
continue to do, is try to meet the bar that the Ninth Circuit 
has set. I think we can talk science for days, and I think we 
can get to some agreements on sort of impact science. But I 
think when the courts give you a mandate----
    Senator Britt. Has EPA appealed that mandate?
    Mr. Regan. I think EPA presented the best case it could.
    Senator Britt. But you have not appealed?
    Mr. Regan. So let me just be clear. That the courts, in its 
writing expressed serious frustrations with the Agency's 
decisions in the past, and expressed serious frustrations with 
where we were on chlorpyrifos, on endangered species, and the 
like. So, you know, you can only tempt fate for so many times, 
and what I pledge to do, as Administrator, is respect the 
letter of the law.
    Senator Britt. I would hope that you would consider 
repealing that, and helping farmers find a way to use the 
eleven safe uses of this.
    Thank you so much for your time. I have run out. Thank you.
    Mr. Regan. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Murray.
    Senator Murray. Sell, thank you very much, Chair Merkley, 
and your Ranking Member, Senator Murkowski.
    It probably feels like everybody has heard me say this a 
million times, but it matters, so I am going to say it again. 
As we continue our progress to return to regular order, this 
hearing provides another critical opportunity to look at why it 
is so important to families, that we all work in a timely 
bipartisan way, to pass our funding bills and make sure we are 
actually providing the resources necessary to keep people safe, 
because safety is about more than just how strong our military 
is, families want to know if they have clean air and clean 
water, and that their kids aren't being sickened by pollution.
    Fishers and our farmers want to know the ecosystem that 
they rely on, that our economy relies on, is not being harmed 
by dangerous chemicals, and communities want to know we are 
making meaningful progress to cut emissions, and fight the 
expansive existential threat, that is the climate crisis.
    The bottom line is that if we want to make sure people in 
this country are safe, we need to make sure they aren't 
breathing smog, or drinking contaminated water, or being 
exposed to chemicals, like PFAS, and by the way, we are 
learning more and more about just how serious a threat PFAS is 
to public health.
    So I hope and expect this committee will work in a 
bipartisan way to deliver solutions. PFAS or ``forever 
chemicals'' aren't just toxic, they are everywhere, to the 
point where they can even be found in our blood. We need to 
make sure we are cutting down on pollution, not cutting the 
funding EPA needs to protect our kids. So I am glad we have 
this opportunity today to talk about the critical issues that 
are threatening our environment, our economy, and our families. 
And how we can get EPA the resources it needs to keep our 
country safe, healthy, and competitive.
    With that, Mr. Administrator, thank you for being here. I 
am going to talk about Pacific Puget Sound recovery, and 
salmon, and steelhead recovery, remains, as you know, an urgent 
undertaking in my home state. And EPA's geographic programs, 
and National Estuary Program plays an important role in habitat 
restoration for those foundational species.
    The fiscal year 2023 Omnibus included robust funding for 
those programs, and that Congress authorized the new Puget 
Sound Recovery National Program Office in EPA, and a Puget 
Sound Federal leadership Task Force.
    I am really glad to hear that the first task force meeting 
is actually taking place tomorrow. But can you give us an 
update on the work that EPA is doing to stand up both those 
entities, and what resources may be necessary to better 
coordinate restoration and protection in Puget Sound?
    Mr. Regan. Well, first of all I want to thank you for your 
leadership on the Puget Sound. And we have been a partner for a 
long period of time. I believe Deputy Assistant McCabe recently 
visited. Of the fiscal year 2023 increase of $20 million, 17 
million of that is immediately going towards the Strategic 
Initiative Lead Cooperative Agreements we have for safe 
shellfish habitat and stormwater projects in Washington.
    For our tribal partners, the Northwest Indian Fisheries 
Commission is working to finalize the work plans for each of 
the tribes in the next couple of months for ongoing tribal-led 
projects. And so we plan to announce a second round of funding 
in the coming months.
    We also have an RFA of up to $30 million out to support 
riparian habitat and climate resilient projects. And so there 
is a number of resources; a number of strategies put in place 
to be sure that our partnership is strong on the Puget Sound.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. 
Administrator Regan, as you know, House Republicans last week 
voted for very deep across-the-board cuts to discretionary 
spending over the next 10 years. Can you talk about how those 
steep cuts would undermine EPA's ability to respond to an 
address PFAS contamination already in our environment?
    Mr. Regan. Well, thank you for that. And we know that PFAS 
is such a visceral issue that we are all having to address, and 
we can't ignore the science. We have put in place a PFAS 
strategic roadmap, we have about $10 billion from BIL to 
address PFAS, but we all know that that is not enough. Many of 
our small, rural communities are struggling with this issue. 
And so, we are working very strategically with the resources we 
have on R&D, partnering with our Federal family, to determine 
the safe levels, and how to regulate this ``forever chemical''.
    And as we do such, we are also leveraging billions of 
dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to ensure that 
disadvantaged communities and rural water systems have access 
to those resources, so that they can keep pace with these 
regulations.
    Listen, it is our job to keep people safe, and we recognize 
that there are technologies on the market, and they are 
expensive, and so we are trying to work on a path where we can 
bridge that gap between safety, and technology, and detection. 
And that is what we are doing on behalf of the American people.
    Senator Murray. And how would the House budget that they 
passed affect that?
    Mr. Regan. It would significantly set us back. The House 
budget cuts on PFAS, on lead, on chemical detection in this 
country would significantly set us back. And as I said in my 
opening statement, we are moving forward, we need to continue 
to move forward, because there is so much more work that needs 
to be done, we shouldn't be moving backwards, especially on 
TSCA, PFAS, lead, and getting tools out there as herbicides and 
pesticides for our farming community.
    Senator Murray. Okay. And I was really pleased to see the 
recent $400 million notice of funding opportunity for the Clean 
School Bus Grant Program that we established in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, and I was glad that you were actually out 
in Washington State last October to highlight this, and the 
difference it is going to make.
    This is a program that is so great, it is really going to 
improve the health of kids and communities across the country, 
and cut costs for our schools, and reduce emissions, and 
support good-paying jobs. So I was pleased to see that.
    I want to ask you, during the application phase, and in the 
review process, how is EPA going to work to make sure that our 
underserved communities, including those on the prioritized 
school district list, are competitive in this program?
    Mr. Regan. We have been doing that from day one. Of the 
billions of dollars that have hit the streets so far, 99 
percent of the grants have gone to rural, disadvantaged, or 
low-income communities. And I have to say some of my best 
visits around Electric Yellow School Buses have been in some of 
our rural communities. Rural places like Alma, Kansas, where 
they are using these school buses, not only to transport 
children to and from school, but those batteries are serving as 
backup capacity for the rural electric cooperatives. So these 
communities are being very strategic in how we use this 
technology beyond the yellow school buses. And it is really 
exciting to see our rural communities do that.
    Senator Murray. That is great. Thank you so much.
    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Well, thank you. Senator Fischer.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Regan, I was glad to see that the EPA issued 
an Emergency Fuel Waiver last week to allow E15 to be sold this 
summer. Providing access to E15 helps families save money at 
the gas pump, it is better for our environment, and it boosts 
our nation's energy security.
    While the Emergency Fuel Waiver is a good thing, I believe 
we need a permanent fix, and I have a bipartisan bill for that, 
to be the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, it ensures a 
nationwide permanent access to E15.
    Mr. Administrator, will you commit to working with me to 
get this bill out there and, hopefully, enacted so that we can 
ensure that we have that E15 for our consumers in future years?
    Mr. Regan. The President has pledged that biofuels, 
especially advanced biofuels, would play a part in this economy 
as we move forward. So I look forward to partnering with you 
and your staff, with technical assistance to be sure that we 
can make E15 more accessible.
    Senator Fischer. Great. We look forward to working with you 
on that. Thank you, sir. I would like to also discuss a 
proposed rule on reporting requirements for emissions from 
animal waste under Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-
Know Act (EPCRA).
    In 2019, when EPA proposed to the current exemption for 
animal waste, air emissions, the national association that 
represents State Emergency Response Commissions, the Tribal 
Emergency Response Commissions, and local emergency planning 
committees was supportive of this narrow exemption.
    In a letter to EPA in 2017, they stated about EPCRA 
Emergency Release Reports for animal waste emissions, quote, 
``These reports are of no particular value to LEPCs, and first 
responders. And they are generally ignored because they do not 
relate to any particular event.''
    EPA has requested an additional $8.4 million for state and 
local prevention and preparedness under your EPCRA authorities. 
Do you believe that that is a good use for EPA resources to 
require reporting of animal air waste emissions, or to put it 
more frankly, manure smells, that local emergency planning 
commissions have stated are of quote, ``No particular value''?
    Mr. Regan. I would say that we are responding to a couple 
of things. The first is we have had some of our states, request 
that we take another look because technology has evolved, 
access to data has evolved, a number of communities on the 
ground have requested this, so this isn't a rulemaking, this is 
our desire to reevaluate, sort of how this plays into the 
broader decisionmaking at the state and Federal level.
    Senator Fischer. Have you reached out to all states to the 
Department of Environmental Quality, for example, have you 
reached out to all states on that? Or are you, basically, 
hearing just from the states that want to have a new look at 
it?
    Mr. Regan. Let me circle back and see----
    Senator Fischer. Okay.
    Mr. Regan [continuing].--if we have heard from all 50 
states on this, and how we have been communicating with all of 
our states on this, revisiting this. I can follow up with you 
on that.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. That would be great. Because I know 
there are probably just as many states that would take an 
opposite view, on it, and as you said earlier, to one of the 
questions that my colleagues ask: It is important to follow the 
science on it, and make sure that we are promoting fact-based 
policies that have a tremendous impact on each individual 
state, depending on their situations.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which I supported, it 
made historic investments in water infrastructure, and in many 
cases targeted those resources towards disadvantaged 
communities. The law continue to defer to states on how to 
define a disadvantaged community for many programs, including 
those state revolving funds.
    This flexibility to tailor resources towards an individual 
state needs, I believe is definitely a benefit and it is not a 
flaw of the state revolving funds. I have heard both concerns 
and also a lot of confusion on how EPA is overseeing these 
programs, or how you might oversee them in the future.
    I think some of the confusion has grown because of various 
memos that have been put out, and guidance from the EPA, and 
from administrative executive orders. For example, Justice40 
Initiative, created by the administration states, ``A goal of 
providing 40 percent of the benefits of Federal investment 
towards the disadvantaged communities.''
    Can you tell me just how the Justice40 Initiative squares 
with explicit statutory considerations, such as in distributing 
the State Revolving Funds? For example, does EPA have their own 
disadvantaged community definition? Do you require 40 percent 
of the state's project to meet that definition, if you do have 
that?
    Mr. Regan. So I can answer it, in terms of the way you have 
framed it with the State Revolving Loan Fund, you know, by law, 
49 percent of those resources go to disadvantaged communities. 
And I think we were quick out of the gates to partner with our 
states. I am a former state regulator so I understand the 
importance of that.
    And listen, there were people that had doubts, but I can 
say that working with Senator Capito in West Virginia and some 
of our southern states were the first to revamp their 
definition of disadvantaged communities, so that we could get 
this money out the door much quicker than needed.
    And so I believe that Justice40 is perfectly aligned with 
the traditional construct of this program. And I was very 
pleased, in the first year of the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, that many of our states brought their definitions up to 
speed. These definitions look different in different states 
because of different makeup, and lots of other issues, but I 
believe that our states have a critical role to play.
    And the last thing I will say is, that is true with this 
budget request, 85 percent of the increase in our budget goes 
to states and tribes. Our states are very strong partners with 
this Agency. And I am very proud of that.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to thank you for being here, Administrator. I want 
to talk to you, broadly, about the Superfund Program. There are 
17 active sites in Montana, 1,300 nationally that are in the 
process of being cleaned up. Your budget says nationally, 22 
percent of our population lives within three miles of a 
Superfund site. And you also talk about how successful, 
impactful the work of the program is on the health of families, 
and children, who live and grow up in these areas.
    In the last Congress, we worked together, members of this 
committee, in a bipartisan way, to provide EPA one of the 
largest funding increases for any Federal Agency, largely, to 
accelerate and expand the work of the Superfund Program.
    In your opening statement, you talked about moving forward, 
not moving backward. However, your budget request for the 
coming fiscal year is only 25 percent of the fiscal year '23 
allocation.
    Now look, I have sat on this committee for a while, I have 
chaired a few committees, and I have been in Democrat and 
Republican administrations, and they both tend to play games. 
The truth is we don't play games with Superfund sites. There 
was a lot of funding made available through a process called 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan, and the regular 
appropriations. We did that to address Superfund problems 
quicker, not to reduce annual appropriations.
    Can you explain to me how the hell you can justify a 75 
percent decrease from last year, because we haven't had a 75 
decrease in Superfund demand?
    Mr. Regan. Well, Senator, thank you for the question; and 
absolutely, I agree with you that we don't need to move 
backwards, and don't need to play any games. The budget for 
this year is based on the transition of the traditional program 
to the Superfund Tax Receipt Program.
    And so this was based on Treasury's forecast that a 
collection of 2.5 billion in Superfund tax receipts would be 
achieved in 2023 which will be available for use in our 2024 
Superfund Program. So we shifted from a traditional program 
that would ask for these allocations to the----
    Senator Tester. So let me ask it to you this way. So you 
are going to get it from self-funding methods, this is what you 
are saying, the tax that you guys apply to Superfund sites?
    Mr. Regan. Yes.
    Senator Tester. So your overall top dollar figure that you 
are going to spend on Superfund cleanup, this next year it is 
going to be as high or higher than what you spent last year?
    Mr. Regan. Predictions would say that it is going to be 
higher than what we did last year, which is why in this budget, 
we are asking for a few more staff so that we can keep going.
    Senator Tester. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Regan. Yeah.
    Senator Tester. And we are going to hold you accountable to 
it, okay?
    Mr. Regan. Okay.
    Senator Tester. Administrator Regan, I want to talk 
specifically about Waste In Place remedies for Superfund sites. 
We have got a lot of these sites in Montana, Butte and 
Riverstown, there are others; I can tell you that a lot of 
folks in these communities and across the state are really 
concerned about Waste In Place remedies.
    Last year, when you testified before this committee, I 
discussed this issue with you. I sent you a detailed letter 
outlining my concerns about this remedy. Guess what? I didn't 
get a response. So we are going to start again, okay?
    Can you tell me how community members concerned about Waste 
In Place remedies can raise concerns with your agencies and 
receive honest answers, and answers that don't come from the 
corporation that is responsible for the Waste In Place in the 
first place?
    Mr. Regan. Well, number one, we should definitely get you 
that response in a much quicker time, and we will do that. I 
will circle with staff.
    Senator Tester. Even a response, period. Not only in 
quicker time. I didn't even get one, okay?
    Mr. Regan. All right; point taken.
    Senator Tester. All right.
    Mr. Regan. Community engagement, we have beefed up our 
community engagement. We, at EPA, need to be on the ground in 
these communities walking through.
    Senator Tester. Gotcha. And we are going to get to that 
point in a second on the community engagement. Tell me how, 
short of community engagement, that if I am a concerned citizen 
about Waste In Place, and I could actually get an answer from 
the EPA, when the senior U.S. Senator couldn't get an answer 
from the EPA.
    Mr. Regan. Well, number one, I will check with my staff. 
But I believe we have been on the ground. And I and I believe 
we have beefed up our community engagement opportunities. 
Because we want to be able to explain the science, the specific 
science, these are specific remedies on a case-by-case basis. 
And listen, I agree with you 100 percent, people need to feel 
confident----
    Senator Tester. If they are not bought in, you can't do 
your job.
    Mr. Regan. I agree with that.
    Senator Tester. Okay.
    Mr. Regan. I agree with that.
    Senator Tester. So tell me how the EPA verifies Waste In 
Place remedies are actually going to be viable over the long 
haul?
    Mr. Regan. Well, number one we believe and stand by the 
science in the Waste In Place, right? Number two, we have to 
explain the science.
    Senator Tester. So where is the science coming from?
    Mr. Regan. Well, number one it is from the programs, the 
Superfund Program.
    Senator Tester. Okay----
    Mr. Regan. We have some of the best scientists, and the 
best remedial experts in the world.
    Senator Tester. Does it include feedback from universities?
    Mr. Regan. It absolutely does, it includes feedback from 
universities.
    Senator Tester. Neutral parties to verify the science?
    Mr. Regan. Neutral parties, stakeholders, I am not saying 
that--we take all this information in, and no, we don't take 
everybody's advice 100 percent because we are the experts.
    Senator Tester. Does the verification include things like 
test wells that are being drilled, and sampling that is being 
done, and how flood mitigation is being planned for?
    Mr. Regan. Let me let me get back to you. Because the 
answer from my vantage point, is it should be, and I believe it 
is, because we have to do all of these things to ensure that 
when you store waste in a place for hundreds of years that it 
is safe for every community.
    Senator Tester. Yes. And by the way, this is in the middle 
of a prairie with no water around them, most of these Superfund 
sites are on water.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely.
    Senator Tester. Okay. Now, I want to talk about community 
engagement, specifically as Butte comes about, the Butte 
Superfund Site. Two nights ago, there was a community meeting, 
where residents of Butte had the opportunity to express 
concerns about a lack of progress, and effectively, cleaning up 
the community.
    The readout from that meeting it couldn't be clearer. Folks 
in Butte are frustrated with the process, and that is being 
kind when I say just ``frustrated''.
    I will be blunt, Mr. Administrator, you need to fix it, you 
need to make sure this Agency is listening to folks on the 
ground. If it is happening in Butte it is happening everywhere. 
I am going to tell you, I could read you the news report from 
that meeting in Butte, there was nobody that stepped up and 
patted the EPA on the back, and said you guys are doing a good 
job. If they did, it was never reported.
    And quite frankly, this has been going on a long time, man. 
I mean Butte wired this country in copper, and it created one 
of the largest, if not the largest Superfund Site in this 
country. And you have got Butte who is an incredibly resilient 
community that are really sick and tired of being jacked 
around.
    And so I need your commitment that we will do, you will do, 
your people under you will do, the people in the communities, 
the people in the region are going to do their best, not only 
to listen, but to react to what they are hearing. Could I get 
that?
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely. Absolutely. And our people came back 
from that meeting on the 1st of May with that feedback taken to 
heart. So we are prepared to engage, and we are engaged 
Senator.
    Senator Tester. So I just want to tell you, this has been 
going on for a while. I mean, like a long time, like before I 
got here, and even longer. And I don't think the EPA has done a 
good job of listening to people for any time in that period. 
And now, you know, because there are two ways to listen: You 
can listen and ignore, or you can listen and take that feedback 
and try to do something positive for the community. That is 
what I want you to do.
    Mr. Regan. Well, and let me just, in defense of the staff, 
right. I am proud of this staff. And let me say, before the $5 
billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure allowed, which we 
really appreciated from you all, this program was underfunded 
just like every other program. And so our ability to do 
outreach, and attend to all of these Superfund sites, all 
across the country.
    Senator Tester. We are way over. But I am just going to 
tell you something. The Forest Service came in and talked about 
underfunding, we fixed that. We are moving forward, we are not 
moving backward.
    Mr. Regan. I agree with you.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Capito.
    Senator Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, Administrator Regan. It is nice to see you over 
here on in a different venue. We usually see each other over on 
EPW. I know you have been asked this question, but I wanted to 
reemphasize the issue, that on the CDS Funding delay; we have 
heard a lot of complaints at home. You know, you inform folks 
that they are going to be able to get a certain amount, 
particularly in the water projects area, you know, they can't 
move forward with their financing without the assurances and 
timeliness of the funding.
    And so we heard our office was notified that the fiscal 
year '23 community recipients of CDS, did receive instructions 
to assist them in planning and preparing for their application 
process. I am glad to see that this is moving much faster than 
the fiscal year 2022. What is the status? I mean it has a 
single fiscal year '22 CDS funding possibility, has any of any 
of those dollars gone out yet?
    Mr. Regan. Well, Senator, the percentage is much smaller 
than I would like, and any of us would like.
    Senator Capito. So has any gone out? Is the percentage 
bigger than zero?
    Mr. Regan. Yes. We have a number that is bigger than zero 
that has gone out?
    Senator Capito. And what is that number?
    Mr. Regan. The number is 25.
    Senator Capito. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Regan. 25 awards, 117 applications, only 30 of those 
applications were complete; and 25 of that 30 have gone out the 
door. What we saw, number one, in the beginning was that EPA 
was significantly under-resourced and unprepared for this. But 
number two, many of these recipients we have had to go above 
and beyond and provide technical assistance to, because they 
have never received this level of Federal dollars before. So to 
keep everyone in compliance, we have doubled down on our 
technical assistance.
    So again, 30 completed applications, 25 of those went out 
the door, but we recognize we need to do better.
    Senator Capito. Okay. Good. And I assume by putting out the 
guidance, or the instructions a little bit earlier this year, 
you are moving in that direction. You just mentioned under-
resource. But I would point out that the EPA received more than 
$10 billion in fiscal year 2023, and more than 40 billion in 
additional funding through the Inflation Reduction Act.
    Certainly, that has got to have impacts on your ability to 
move through all these--what we are just talking about, and 
other projects, like Senator Tester was talking about.
    Mr. Regan. Well, you know, we have been hiring up since we 
got some of those BIL dollars, and in some cases we are looking 
at cross-pollination opportunities for those staff members. But 
again, we received significant resources under BIL and IRA, 
focused on specific projects. And so we have put people forward 
to complete those tasks, and where we can leverage staff, we 
are.
    Senator Capito. I want to talk to you about the EPA 
modeling that shows a direct and very dramatic decline in coal-
fired power over the next 17 years, based on the Inflation 
Reduction Act. It is 43 percent more coal retirements than EPA 
projected originally, without the law.
    This recent modeling does not account for the EPA's 
upcoming Clean Power 2.0 Rule, which I would like to find out 
where that is. Or the rules that you have issued in the last 
few months, whether it is new standards on wastewater from coal 
plants, or mercury emissions. You and I have talked numerous 
times about this issue of how--what the impacts of some of this 
is to our state, my State of West Virginia.
    So are you going to update your modeling once you put out 
your new Clean Power Plan, and other rules? Will you continue 
to update this so we can see what the real impacts are going to 
be? Have you looked at what those would be in terms of the 
economic impacts, and the job impacts in certain areas?
    Obviously that is going to impact my state a lot. So where 
are you on updating, in terms of, as you are rolling out new 
and more stringent requirements through your regulations?
    Mr. Regan. Well, as we look at our power plant regulation, 
which should be coming in the coming weeks, it will have the 
corresponding modeling and cost-benefit analysis with that 
rule. I would love to have my team come and sit down with yours 
to walk through all of the modeling, and all of the cost-
benefit analyses for those rules that are currently out, and 
after we finish with interagency review on the power plant 
rule, do the same thing with that regulation as well.
    Senator Capito. Does the cost-benefit analysis include the 
number of jobs that would be lost, and what the impacts that 
would be to the community?
    Mr. Regan. Let me get back to you on the cost-benefit 
analysis in all of our rules are very complex, and I am sure 
you can tease out a number of things in that analysis. So what 
I would like to do is have my team spend some time with you on 
all of the impacts, positive and potential adverse impacts, for 
any of these categories, on any of the rules that we put out.
    Senator Capito. Let me ask you about the Class VI well 
applications for individual projects, that is the state primacy 
applications for the CCUS technology. I know my colleague here 
to my left, Senator Hoeven, and I are very, very interested in 
making sure that we are moving forward on, not just the 
technology.
    And I know your state regulator has done--because you have 
primacy, don't you?
    Senator Hoeven. Yes.
    Senator Capito. Yeah. Has done a lot, so you have, at the 
EPA you have 70 individual permit applications for Class VI 
injection wells, but I don't know that any have actually been 
permitted. Louisiana just got their Class VI state primacy 
application. I think West Virginia is very much in the queue 
here. What measures has the EPA taken to ensure that Class VI 
Sequestration Permits are prioritized and are done in a timely 
manner?
    And how do you account for--I know in North Dakota because 
we had their state regulator before our Committee over on EPW, 
said that the time that--they can move their applications 
through much quicker, and have actually had successful 
applications, you know, meet success.
    Whereas, the ones that are still at EPA are still 
languishing. How do you account for that? And what is your plan 
to make sure that those move quicker?
    Mr. Regan. Well, so our Class VI Well Application Program 
is absolutely a priority. I think the President has indicated 
that CCS is something that this administration supports. We 
have learned a lot of lessons from states like North Dakota. We 
have just approved Louisiana's. And Louisiana's actually will 
serve as a model for all of the states that we plan to move 
forward with.
    We have got a very productive relationship with the 
Governor of West Virginia, in the State of West Virginia, on 
their Class VI well application. And that application is going 
through the process. So I think we have got some uniformity 
across all of our regions, to be sure that all of our states 
are submitting similar applications so that we can put them on 
an expedited time line.
    Senator Capito. Well, I would hope that--yes, thank you, 
Mr. Chair, I know I am out. I hope they would move quicker, I 
think that state primacy issue is absolutely critical to move 
forward, to cleaner environment, to capturing, and 
sequestering, and utilizing the carbon. Thank you.
    Mr. Regan. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator Capito.
    Senator Peters.
    Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Regan, it is good to see you here today. 
Thank you for your testimony.
    Administrator, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was 
established, as you know, in 2009, to accelerate efforts to 
protect and restore the largest system of freshwater in the in 
the world, the Great Lakes. As Michiganders, the Great Lakes 
are not only in our DNA, but are a critical resource for 
drinking water, in fact, 40 million people drink water out of 
the Great Lakes, but also in terms of economic growth and job 
creation, they are incredibly important.
    Since 2010, the GLRI has provided over $2.9 billion to fund 
over 6,000 projects throughout the Great Lakes region, 
including $762 million for 880 projects in my State of 
Michigan. The GLRI has been a catalyst, without question, for 
unprecedented Federal Agency coordination through the 
Interagency Task Force, and the Regional Working Group, which 
is led by the EPA.
    GLRI resources have been used to fund thousands of 
projects, to restore and improve water quality, to protect 
native habitat, and prevent and control invasive species, and 
as well as other environmental problems we face.
    So my question for you, sir, as Chair of the Great Lakes 
Interagency Task Force, can you speak to how the Task Force, 
through its Regional Working Group, selects the best 
combination of programs and projects to help improve water 
quality as well as accelerate the protection and restoration of 
the Great Lakes?
    Mr. Regan. Well, thank you, Senator, for that. And thank 
you for your leadership, and Senator Stabenow's leadership on 
this issue. You know, this initiative was allocated a billion 
dollars under Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in fiscal year 
2022, and in our budget for 2024 we are requesting the same 
level that we requested in 2023, because we want to keep up the 
critical work, keep the momentum.
    You know, on the Task Force, our Great Lakes National 
Program Office chairs one of the regional working groups, which 
consists of representatives from 16 Federal partners, so we are 
seeing a lot of partnership, and we are seeing a lot of 
excitement, especially with this infusion of capital.
    We take the lead on the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
(GLRI) planning and budgeting, which is done 2 years in 
advance, to help plan for the President's budget. So we believe 
that we have a lot of momentum, we have a lot of participation 
across the Federal family, and we have the resources to tackle 
this issue.
    Senator Peters. Great. Wonderful. PFAS contamination 
exposure has devastated many communities in Michigan, as well 
as across the country, and for far too long. PFAS 
contamination, as you are well aware, is not just an 
environmental threat but it is a danger to public health, and 
devastates local economies, and we have to do everything we can 
to address the impact of these toxic chemicals.
    And that is why I want to, first off, say I was pleased to 
see the EPA designate two of the most notorious PFAS compounds, 
PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Superfund 
Program last year. I was also pleased to see last month's 
announcement that EPA is considering expanding the list of PFAS 
that are designated as hazardous under the Superfund.
    So my question for you, sir, is: Can you speak to the 
importance of classifying PFAS under Superfund? As well as what 
the EPA's plans are to ensure that state agencies and affected 
communities are actually part of these cleanup decisions that 
are being made?
    Mr. Regan. Well, absolutely. And I can say as former state 
regulator in North Carolina, the relationship that the states 
and the Federal Government have is so important. Many of our 
state agencies have the delegated authority to implement on 
clean air and clean water statutes. And so having that state 
and local and Federal cooperation is extremely important, not 
just on the implementation side, but definitely on the planning 
side.
    We have taken important steps in proposing to designate to 
PFAS under CERCLA, and we believe that it is not only our jobs 
to prevent this ``forever chemical'' from entering and 
polluting, but also if it does, we have to clean it up. And so 
we are excited about where we are in that interagency process. 
We have worked hand-in-hand with USDA, and the Department of 
Defense as well.
    And we believe we are making a significant progress. Not 
just setting drinking water standards, but to the point you are 
making, setting up the cleanup standards as well.
    Senator Peters. Well, I appreciate that. And again I 
appreciate that two of those substances were part of your 
action. But as you know, PFAS encompasses hundreds of different 
variations of that chemical, and we would assume that they also 
present significant hazards as being part of that family.
    So my question for you is: Can you commit to establishing 
national primary drinking water regulations for additional 
types of PFAS, as soon as possible? Or give us some idea of how 
you plan to progress on dealing with the broader issue of a 
very large family of dangerous chemicals?
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely. I can commit to saying this, which 
is, we have designated six, we have got twenty-nine additional 
on our radar. As we get the science, and as we get the data in, 
and we will continue to work across our Federal family 
especially with CDC, and others, to determine the health 
impacts, we will continue to move forward designating these 
dangerous chemical compounds, and regulating them accordingly.
    Senator Peters. Good, good. So I appreciate that effort. It 
is a big job. And appreciate your focus on it.
    Mr. Regan. Thank you.
    Senator Peters. The next question is that Federal research 
efforts have often been fragmented at various Federal agencies, 
and have struggled to address, really, the full scope of the 
problems of PFAS. That is why I introduced the Federal PFAS 
Research Evaluation Act. It is cosponsored by a bipartisan 
group of Senators Moran, Shaheen, and Durbin, to direct a study 
by the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine 
to help inform decisions by the Federal governments, state 
governments, industry, and other stakeholders as to how we deal 
with these complex substances.
    So my question for you is: Would you please, or can you 
speak to the importance of having a more comprehensive Federal 
research approach to better inform PFAS mitigation efforts? And 
ultimately, to help families, and first responders, and our 
environment, that are all impacted by these substances?
    Mr. Regan. It is absolutely imperative that we have 
additional research into this chemical compound, and into the 
technologies, that will deter this from entering our bodies. 
That is why we have asked for about $170 million in the budget 
for 2024, so that we can keep pace with the research and 
development being done with our Federal family counterparts. As 
well as what is happening in academia and at the state level.
    We need to get a handle on this science and the health 
impacts. We are going to work across the Federal family, state 
and local agencies as well, and academia, to be sure that we 
are competitive. And the $170 million that we are requesting 
for the budget will go a long way.
    Senator Peters. Great. Thank you, Administrator. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Recently the 
Congress--good to see you Mr. Administrator, thanks for being 
here.
    Mr. Regan. Thank you.
    Senator Hoeven. Recently the Congress voted on a bipartisan 
basis to overturn the WOTUS Rule put forward by the Biden 
administration. Also, then shortly thereafter a judge issued a 
preliminary injunction that affects 24 states, including my 
state of North Dakota, staying the new rule.
    So given that Sackett v. EPA is in front of the Supreme 
Court, and it is likely to provide clarity as to what EPA's 
authority is over states and landowners, in regard to 
regulating the waters of the U.S., doesn't it make sense to put 
a nationwide pause on your WOTUS Rule until the Supreme Court 
has ruled in the Sackett case?
    Mr. Regan. Where we see in those 26, or so, states that the 
courts have----
    Senator Hoeven. 24.
    Mr. Regan [continuing].--weighed in, there is an active 
stay, and we will be implementing WOTUS under the 2015 regime, 
where the states that don't have a stay in place, we will 
continue to move forward. We do believe that--number one, I 
engage significantly with our agricultural industry, and I 
appreciate you.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, you have been out to our state, and 
you have seen our concerns about the WOTUS Rule?
    Mr. Regan. Yes, I have. And what we attempted to do was 
take those concerns, match them with the laws that we are 
required to follow, and we codified a number of exclusions and 
exemptions that we were really proud of, that many of the AG 
community asked us to do.
    Unfortunately, in the states where that stay is in place, 
and we go back to 2015, those exemptions and exclusions are not 
as clear and available to our farming community. But we will 
work, continue to work around that.
    I think the Sackett case will provide some clarity on all 
the questions that we have. The good news is we won't be 
starting from scratch. We will be starting with a rule that we 
put in place that some states have stayed, we will take the 
Sackett case, we will adjust the rule and we will be able to 
move forward, and we won't be starting from 2 years behind.
    I want to just say that the previous administration's WOTUS 
Rule was vacated, and so we felt compelled to move forward and 
engage with our agricultural community, to try to put a durable 
rule in place that will provide some certainty, and codify many 
of these exclusions and exemptions that we attempted to move 
forward with.
    Senator Hoeven. The current rule doesn't do that, and you 
recognize and acknowledge that the Congress, on a bipartisan 
basis, voted against the rule. You do acknowledge that?
    Mr. Regan. I acknowledge that for three or four 
administrations multiple courts have weighed in, the Supreme 
Court has weighed in, no one has ever been pleased with WOTUS, 
and I recognize that. I will say that we did our level best to 
learn from all of what we have seen in the past to put forward 
a doable rule, and we find ourselves where we are.
    Senator Hoeven. Sackett should provide some clarity, but we 
are very concerned about protecting private property rights. I 
also want to ask you about the MATS Rule, actually the EPA, 
existing EPA Regulatory Rule has--and then your own study 
indicates that the rule you have in place, prior to issuing 
this new MATS Rule, has the mercury emissions below levels of 
concern, has reduced it to below levels of concern, from a 
public health standpoint.
    That is that is your own study, determination. So why are 
you proposing new rules that put additional burdens and costs 
on electric plants when we very much need that electricity?
    Mr. Regan. I think when we took a look at the necessary 
aspect of that rule, we came to the conclusion that there 
needed to be further reductions of mercury to protect human 
health. And we also took a look at, and I believe that many of 
the power sector industry would agree that that the control 
technologies that exist to control mercury to the levels that 
we would like to see to protect public health, exist in a very 
cost effective way.
    Many of them already have various aspects of those 
technologies on their plants. And so we believe that in 
following the law and following the science, in a cost-
effective way, we could continue to drive mercury emissions 
down to protect public health.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, the whole point is, your own study 
shows that we are already doing that, and now you are adding 
additional regulation, and cost, to a coal-fired electric 
industry that is working widely to capture and store CO2, which 
you know we are doing in our state. That new technology, so 
whether it is been SOx, NOx, mercury, and now CO2, the industry 
is undertaking investment to capture those emissions, and 
address them, and now with CO2, which is very, very expensive.
    So you are adding regulatory burden out at a time when they 
are investing and working mightily to provide base load 
electricity to the grid which is very much needed, and capture 
CO2 as well. And you need to keep that in mind.
    And I am going to give you another example, and ask you to 
respond to it. You now are looking at lignite coal, and 
subbituminous coal, and trying to apply the exact same 
standards to both, when they are very different. And so we need 
you to work with our industry to make these investments to 
capture the very emissions that that you want to see--like CO2, 
that you want to see captured and stored. You have got to work 
with the industry if you want that to happen.
    Mr. Regan. You are absolutely right in terms of having to 
work with the industry which, you know, I think we are doing a 
fairly good job of that. And I think many of the examples that 
you cited, North Dakota is doing a good job, in pursuing some 
of those advanced technologies, like CCS, and other 
technologies. And so I think you and I are saying--singing from 
a similar sheet of music, which is, these technologies that are 
already being deployed in many of our states, do have a lot of 
co-benefits, which prove we can drive some of this pollution 
down.
    We have got some in the industry that are lagging behind, 
and not performing as well as some of the utilities in your 
state. We would like for them to pursue some of these cost-
effective technologies, like CCS, like you know, advanced 
mercury scrubbing technologies to ensure that the industry is 
keeping pace at a unified level.
    Senator Hoeven. We are already capturing millions of tons 
of CO2, but we need help and regulatory certainty in order to 
keep doing that, and do more of it.
    Mr. Regan. And that is why we have worked really hard, and 
this is something that I have spoken with the industry about at 
length, for the last year-and-a-half, 2 years, this is why we 
are putting all of our rules out together. The industry has 
asked for these to be bundled so that they can look at all of 
the impacts, the potential co-benefits, from investing in 
technologies, and make those longer term investments.
    And what this EPA has done and pledged, is that we would 
put these rules out together; and that is what we have done.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Administrator.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Murkowski.
    Mr. Administrator, great to see you and your team here 
today; and let me start with a thank you, I want to thank you 
and your team for keeping me and my team regularly apprised of 
the progress on the implementation of the Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction Fund.
    As you know, this has been something I have worked on for 
well over a decade, starting during my time in the House of 
Representatives, with what was then called The Green Bank. 
Senator Markey and I then introduced the National Climate Bank 
Legislation. It has been called the Clean Energy Accelerator. 
We are pleased to see the President embrace it. And now, 
obviously, we are in the work of implementation, which is 
absolutely critical that it be successful.
    So thank you for those consultations. I just want to affirm 
that we are on the same page with respect to the goals. Number 
one, to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions that were 
allocated and targeted for this particular fund; number two, to 
ensure it as a multiplier effect. I mean the idea is that this 
will be matched by private sector and other funds, so that we 
have up to a five-time multiplier effect, that would ensure 
sustainability, which is another key factor; this is not a pot 
of money for grant funding that we turn around one day and it 
is all gone.
    And fourth, and very importantly, that we make sure that 
the funds are invested to help underserved communities as part 
of this transition to a clean energy economy. I just want your 
assurance today that those remain principles that you are 
committed to.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I want to take this 
time to thank you and your team I think but for you, and 
Senator Markey, and others we wouldn't have this significant 
opportunity, $27 billion is a lot of money, but in the full 
scheme of things, it is not a lot of money, and we need to have 
that multiplier effect. And we need to be sure that we are 
putting programs in place that can be leveraged by those who 
invest, you know, as their day jobs right.
    And we also want to be sure that every single person in 
this country benefits from it. So we share those goals, and we 
have enjoyed the conversations with your team. Our product is 
better because of those conversations.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that Mr. Administrator. 
And as you know, my view is that this can be most effective by 
creating, you know, at most, a few national networks that have 
to be national in scope, that include, you know, existing Green 
Banks, but also include CDFI and other lenders.
    We want to make sure that it has that ability to 
coordinate, because we do want to be able to, you know, come to 
you a couple years from now and say: Hey, how are we doing in 
terms of our greenhouse gas emission reductions' goal? How are 
we doing in terms of meeting our goal of ensuring low-income 
communities or participating in the transition? And I think 
that is much better achieved by having at least a national 
network that is coordinating all of this.
    Let me, just another thank you, because for years Maryland 
worked to try to get the EPA to adopt the Air Pollution Good 
Neighbor Rule, because we receive lots of air pollution 
transiting from other states into our air, into the Bay, so 
just a thank you, for having moved forward on that.
    Let me talk briefly about the Back River Wastewater 
Infrastructure. As you know, the Maryland Senators and our 
Congressional Delegation from Baltimore objected to the 
proposal to transfer some of the wastewater from the East 
Palestine derailment, through the Back River Plant in 
Baltimore. And I am glad that that plan did not go forward.
    The reason we objected, as you know, and your team knows, 
is that because Back River Plant has had a history of problems, 
chronic problems itself, and we didn't want to take any 
additional risk that more pollution would enter our waterways 
as a result of that contaminated water from Palestine.
    That said, we are continuing to work on Back River, and 
obviously the funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill for 
the Revolving Fund are important. But just ask for your 
commitment today, Mr. Administrator, that you will work with us 
on Back River, because that has had a series of problems and we 
want to make sure we work in partnership with you and your team 
to correct them.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely, you have my commitment. And our team 
has been paying close attention to that. I have actually talked 
with Assistant Administrator Radhika Fox about that particular 
facility. So you have our commitment.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, because it is an ongoing 
project, as you know. Let me now turn to the Chesapeake Bay and 
the EPA Program. Very gratified to see that the administration 
requested the full authorization of $92 million, this has been 
an ongoing and urgent priority for our region. And I would 
argue very important for the country as well as the nation's 
largest estuary.
    I am also pleased with the current proposed settlement to 
the lawsuit that was brought to ensure enforcement of the goals 
to clean up the Bay. As you know, unfortunately we are falling 
short of the targets. We had a plan to try to achieve the 
reductions in what we call the total maximum daily load into 
the Bay by 2025.
    We are not hitting that target, everyone sees that. It is 
vital that we re-establish aggressive pollution reduction 
targets, and dates. And I do think that this proposed 
settlement, which I expect will be finalized shortly, will help 
accomplish that.
    But if you could just comment on why this is important; 
this is a multi-state--you know, the Chesapeake Bay obviously, 
its watershed encompasses multiple states including 
Pennsylvania. There is no secret that we have been very 
concerned about pollution coming down the Susquehanna River. 
Part of this settlement is designed to address that through 
greater enforcement. Can you talk about EPA's commitment to 
making sure that this settlement is enforced, assuming it goes 
forward?
    Mr. Regan. Well, absolutely I will say that, I proudly 
serve as the current Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Executive 
Council, and have been enjoying the engagements, and look 
forward to engaging this multi-state body. You know, once the 
settlement is achieved, and hopefully, we will get the 
resources we are requesting in this budget, I believe that we 
can effectively execute on the settlement, but also enhance our 
engagement with our agriculture community, and others, who are 
contributing in a negative way to the Chesapeake Bay.
    I think we also had a meeting where we needed to 
recalibrate those 2025 goals. So I am committed. I am chairing 
this Executive Council. I am committed to recalibrating the 
2025 goals. And I am committed to bringing us all together to 
ensure that we restore the health and vibrancy of the 
Chesapeake Bay.
    Senator Van Hollen. Mr. Administrator, thank you, music to 
my ears. It requires resources, yes, but it also requires a 
political commitment from the Federal Government and EPA. So 
thank you.
    Mr. Regan. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    And we are going to try to do a speed round here in which I 
have several questions that you can feel free to give very 
short answers to. And Senator Murkowski has a couple as well. 
And then we are dashing to the vote that is currently underway.
    So here we go: Can I have your assurance that any 
permitting reform that you support will not allow higher levels 
of toxins to be released in frontline communities?
    Mr. Regan. Yes.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And does that include the 
permitting of any new so-called chemical recycling facilities 
that vent off significant toxins that might increase pollution 
in frontline communities?
    Mr. Regan. And the way you will see both of those is, our 
technical advice to the legislation. Obviously, we will weigh 
in as mightily as we can, we know that we need to see 
permitting reform, but in that technical advice that we provide 
to Congress, we will be sure to flag those things because they 
are important to us.
    Senator Merkley. These will be issues I will be paying 
close attention to. And do I have your support in figuring out 
how we allow prescribed fires, while also being very strong in 
regarding generalized PM 2.5 pollution?
    Mr. Regan. Yes. We can do both.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. I will have more questions for 
the record.
    But let me turn this over to my colleague from Alaska.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Regan, I know that Senator Capito had 
discussed with you, or raised the issue about EPA's Class VI 
Wells Program for carbon sequestration, it is something that 
Alaska is obviously very interested in. We have got a strong 
commitment to responsible stewardship, and we have got 
geological storage potential. So we look at this with real 
opportunity.
    I have expressed some concern, again, about the pace of 
processing the individual permits. I just want to know that you 
also view the Agency, Class VI Wells Program as an 
Administration priority?
    Mr. Regan. I do. Yes.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. We look forward to working with 
you on that. Very quickly, we know that EPA is moving forward 
with the new standards on both light- and medium-duty vehicles, 
and heavy-duty truck emissions. It is a pretty aggressive time 
line there. In fact, it is even more aggressive than President 
Biden's stated goal that EVs are going to make up 50 percent of 
the new cars sold by 2030. We all recognize that these goals 
are going to require a significant increase in minerals needed 
to supply the EVs.
    Did the EPA conduct a needs assessment on the amount of 
minerals that would be required if these rules move forward and 
go into effect?
    Mr. Regan. We are very cognizant of the need, and we are 
very cognizant of the broader Federal family approach to 
minerals, to domestic manufacturing, and the tax incentives, 
and the like, so our rules are, technology standards, we have a 
limited scope that we are allowed to look at. But you can rest 
assured that the broader Federal family goals resulting from 
IRA and BIL were taken into consideration as we move forward.
    Senator Murkowski. I think we recognize we not only--we not 
only need the minerals but we are going to have to do more to 
promote some efficiencies, and deal with the permitting issues; 
something that we are all talking about here on a bipartisan 
basis.
    And then lastly, and this should be the real easy one, is I 
appreciate the progress that we have made on our Alaska-
specific issues. I would like to, again, encourage that we have 
set quarterly calls with senior staff from the Agency. We call 
it ``The All Things Alaska Call''. We have had these agreements 
with previous administrations. And I even just like your 
commitment to have your team meet with mine on a quarterly 
basis.
    Mr. Regan. Absolutely.
    Senator Murkowski. Very good. Thank you.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, thank you so much.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    Senator Merkley. Well, thank you. And if there are no other 
statements, the hearing record will be open until close of 
business on May 17th, 2023.
    Administrator Regan, you have covered a huge range of 
topics in this hearing. And I am sure there will be a few more 
in some follow-up questions. So thank you, for your service to 
our country.

                          SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS

    Senator Merkley. And with that, this hearing is adjourned.

                         INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES

STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN NEWLAND, ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
            FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS
ACCOMPANIED BY ROSELYN TSO, DIRECTOR

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY

    Senator Merkley. This subcommittee will come to order.
    Welcome, Assistant Secretary Newland, and Director Tso, 
terrific to have you. Welcome to this hearing on fiscal year 
2024 President's Budget for Indian Country.
    And a special welcome to Jillian Curtis, good to have you, 
from IHS, Indian Health Services; and Jason Freihage from the 
Department of Interior, who are accompanying today's witnesses. 
Thank you for being here to contribute your expertise.
    Today is unique because we are holding a single budget 
hearing covering nearly all of the Tribal programs within the 
Interior Appropriations Bill, the budgets of the Indian Health 
Service and the Department of Interiors Indian Affairs Programs 
totaled $10.9 billion in fiscal year 2023, a full one-quarter 
of the spending in the bill.
    Appearing together, for the first time in many years, will 
help us cover a wide range of topics that are vitally important 
upholding our trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes. It 
is imperative to look at a wide range of topics, because those 
topics are so interwoven.
    The social determinants of health, for example, are often 
reflections of the conditions in which people are born and 
live, they are heavily influenced by factors such as education, 
employment, housing, community, culture, clean air, clean 
water, safety, access to transportation. This is where we see 
the critical interplay of Indian Health Services and the 
Department of Interior's funding support for Tribal 
communities.
    Starting with Indian Health Services, IHS, the request is 
$9.7 billion for fiscal year 2024, and $2.5 billion, or 36 
percent increase, a staggering amount reflecting the reality 
that the health care gap is serious and needs to be eliminated. 
A major driver is a $742 million increase to expand access to 
health care across all IHS Direct Service lines, to reduce 
health disparities, and improve health care.
    The IHS budget also includes $13 million increase to offer 
additional IHS scholarship and loan repayment awards to bolster 
recruitment and retention.
    I want to take a moment to highlight the significant 
achievement we made in fiscal year 2023, providing advance 
appropriations for IHS. I am quite pleased that we had that 
legislative achievement, and I hope the advance helps with the 
predictable and stable funding for years to come, and I look 
forward to working with you to ensure implementation functions 
as intended.
    Turning to DOI's Tribal programs, the request includes $3 
billion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a $483 million 
increase, and $1.6 billion for the Bureau of Indian Education, 
a $209 million increase. These investments are building blocks 
for continued economic devel0opment for the well-being of 
Tribal communities.
    For example, the budget request includes $2.3 billion, $350 
million above the enacted level for the BIA operation of Indian 
programs. This funding will support the stewardship of natural 
resources and energy resources facilitating the delivery of 
community services, and spurring economic development.
    For the Bureau of Indian Education, I am happy to see a 
proposed increase of $61 million for the operation of Indian 
Education programs, this funding will help improve student 
academic outcomes, address maintenance needs, expand Native 
language revitalization efforts.
    Teachers across the country dedicate each day to kids to 
provide them with the tools to succeed. I can think of teachers 
in my own experience who have helped shaped my education, and 
my life, as I am sure all of us can. And I am pleased to see an 
effort to address teacher pay parity within your proposal, as 
well as targeted investments to improve teacher recruitment and 
retention.0
    I want to briefly turn to the in-lieu-of-treaty fishing 
sites along the Columbia River. Thank you, Assistant Secretary 
Newland, for taking the time to visit these sites, and for your 
cooperation in providing maintenance, law enforcement, and 
repairs.
    The construction of dams on the Columbia River flooded 
these traditional sites, displacing people who have relied on 
the river for thousands of years, and we need to help put the 
pieces back together, including making continued investments to 
establish these sites that are safe and accessible to Tribal 
members.
    Finally, both budgets include a mandatory reclassification 
proposal for contract support costs, and Section 105 leases, 
which I will refer to as Tribal Sovereignty Payments. These are 
payments necessary to fully exercise Tribal self-governance, 
and are reasonable overhead costs to administer essential 
government services.
    I endorse the proposal to reclassify these funds to the 
mandatory side of the budget, where they legally belong, and 
look forward to working with you on this issue. Much of the 
work we do in Indian Country Policy is trying to put back the 
pieces of decades of failed policies by the Federal Government, 
and as we know, that is difficult.
    But what we can do is support Tribal communities by making 
continuous investments in key areas, like health care, 
governance, economic development, infrastructure, natural 
resource management, and public safety. It is not only the 
right thing to do; it is also our trust and treaty 
responsibility.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, and Director Tso, you are both 
on the front line of that effort. And I am happy to learn more 
from all of you today.
    And with that, I would like to turn the microphone over to 
my Ranking Member, Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do note that 
the Chairman of our Full Committee is here, and I don't know. I 
would certainly defer to you Senator Murray.
    Senator Murray. I will go after.
    Senator Murkowski. Great. Thank you.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI

    Senator Murkowski. Well, good morning. I appreciate the 
opportunity this morning to, as you note Mr. Chairman, to have 
this subcommittee examine the proposed budgets for both IHS and 
the Department of Interior, the two agencies responsible for 
Tribal programs under this subcommittee's jurisdiction, but we 
are doing it for the first time here in one hearing. So I think 
it is going to be jam-packed, we have got a lot of ground to 
cover.
    I also want to point out that it has been several years now 
that we have had the opportunity to invite a confirmed IHS 
Director to a budget hearing. So I am particularly glad to have 
you here, Director Tso. I welcome both of you, Director Tso, 
and Assistant Secretary Newland.
    This subcommittee has always worked together to fund 
essential programs that serve our Tribes and Native 
communities, and whether it is health programs, economic 
development initiatives, education and workforce development, 
or critical water and sanitation infrastructure, I think we 
have made upholding the Federal Government's trust 
responsibility a bipartisan priority, and it needs to continue 
to be so.
    In the last Congress we secured advance appropriations for 
the IHS, this was a long-held priority for Native communities, 
and we can't forget the great progress that we have made on 
these issues related to contract support costs as well as 
105(l) Tribal Lease payments. I think this demonstrates that we 
can work together, and when we do we are successful.
    As we look to write the fiscal year 2024 bills, it is my 
hope that we can continue our bipartisan tradition to 
prioritize the needs of Native communities. The President's 
proposal for the IHS includes an increase of $2.5 billion above 
the fiscal year 2023 level, while the request for BIA and BIE 
outlines approximately $692 million in new spending.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request increases almost every 
budget line, with the only exceptions being Congressional 
priority.
    So I hope that after today we all have a better 
understanding of our respective funding priorities, because 
reconciling the President's requests, Congressional priorities 
and, quite frankly, the budget realities, is going to take some 
compromise and a lot of dialogue.
    Many of the issues I intend to raise today will come as no 
surprise to you all. Within the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), 
ensuring adequate funding for PL280 states to address the 
inequities among Tribal courts remains a top concern of mine, 
as is continuing funding for Native language grant programs for 
non-BIE States, and funding for missing, murdered indigenous 
people.
    In addition to safeguarding funds for the above issues, it 
is also important to ensure that the small and needy Tribes, 
that supplement receives sufficient funding and is properly 
managed. The current Tiwahe pilot sites and recipients be made 
whole, and that Tribal management programs are effectively 
contributing towards economic development while meeting natural 
resource goals.
    In the fiscal year 2024 budget proposal, there is also an 
Alaska-specific proposal on subsistence, and that is to shift 
the Office of Subsistence Management from Fish and Wildlife to 
Indian Affairs.
    Secretary Newland, we have had an opportunity to discuss 
this in the Indian Affairs Committee. I have heard from a lot 
of Tribal leaders and Native communities over the years about 
Fish and Wildlife Service not giving this important office the 
attention that it needs. So I am going to be interested in 
hearing more, just about the practical implementation of this 
proposal, how it addresses the concerns of all stakeholders, 
and the steps that you are taking to demonstrate that Indian 
Affairs can handle management of the rural subsistence 
priority, for both Native and non-Native subsistence users 
alike.
    Similar to the Department of Interior's Tribal programs, 
over the years, my IHS priorities remained pretty much 
unchanged. Ensuring funding for VBCs, village-built clinics, 
facilities construction accounts, along with programs that 
support the Alaska Dental Health Therapy, the AHABs, our 
Community Health Aid Programs, these are all vital for Native 
communities across my state.
    And of course, at both BIA and IHS, contract support costs, 
and 105(l) lease payments, absolutely utmost importance. 
Ongoing questions surrounding these costs continue to spur 
court cases, and trigger additional budget uncertainty. You 
know that, as well as anyone. And it is for this reason, I 
would urge some caution in attempting to rename these terms, 
just for the sake of simplicity.
    I think they are complex. They are legally defined budget 
issues that are rooted in statute, in regulation, in court 
cases. Our job here on the subcommittee is to appreciate and 
address the budget complexities, without creating further 
confusion for the sake of political expedience.
    Another nuanced issue we need to discuss, are the 
unobligated balances at IHS. And Director, we have talked about 
this. IHS has received more than $45 billion in regular 
discretionary and emergency funding over the preceding 5 years. 
They are carrying billions of dollars in unobligated balances. 
We have to have an open and a transparent conversation about 
these balances to0 ensure that IHS is providing the best 
services possible.
    And then lastly, the Chairman has mentioned advance 
appropriation; this is something that I have personally been 
supportive of over the years. As an original co-sponsor of a 
bill with Senator Udall, that jump started that path, to the 
inclusion of advance appropriations in the fiscal year 2023 
Omnibus Bill, I am somewhat disappointed that the budget 
proposal does not focus on a successful implementation of 
advance appropriations, but instead, again, proposes mandatory 
funding for IHS, beginning in 2025, without any accompanying 
legislative text. We need to have that there.
    We all want the IHS to be successful and responsibly 
managed, so Director Tso, I am glad that you are in place to 
provide that leadership. It is a tough job. And we have talked 
about that. I am looking forward to your testimony, as well as 
that from you, Assistant Secretary Newland.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you. And look forward 
to the discussion this morning.
    Senator Merkley. Senator Murray, and the Chair of 
Appropriations.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Chair Merkley, and 
Ranking Member Murkowski.
    We have a really important responsibility to get our 
funding bills passed in a timely and bipartisan way, and the 
clock is ticking if we want to keep things on track, and truly 
return to regular order for the first time in years,
    I know members on both sides of the aisle are serious about 
making that happen, because if we are going to keep our Nation 
strong and safe we cannot let the investments that keep our 
Nation competitive, and keep our communities secure, including 
our Tribal communities, fall into chaos or uncertainty due to 
political games.
    These programs are too important to shortchange, and this 
moment is too critical to let partisan infighting hold our 
communities and our country back. So it is important that we 
are holding this hearing today to make sure our Nation meets 
its obligations to our Tribes, honoring their sovereignty and 
providing the Federal investments that we have promised.
    Because how we are seen in the world, isn't just a matter 
of how much we spend on weapons, it is how we live up to our 
word. If we expect other nations to trust us, to live up to our 
global commitments, we have to keep our promises right here at 
home too. And when it comes to our Nation's commitments to 
Tribes, we have a long way to go.
    Further, the reality is that for many of our Nation's 
toughest challenges, the opioid crisis, the climate crisis, the 
maternal mortality crisis, and more, our Tribes are getting hit 
the hardest.
    And yet House Republicans just voted to slash vital support 
for our Tribes. Their default on America Act would gut funding 
for Tribal law enforcement, education, and health care 
programs. It would cut nearly a billion dollars from the Indian 
Health Service, forcing more than 1,000 doctors, nurses, and 
staff off the job, and cutting care for two-and-a-half-million 
people. It would rip away essential services in Tribal 
communities, and seriously weaken BIA's ability to live up to 
its mission.
    Now, I am constantly meeting with Tribal leaders in every 
part of my home State of Washington, Lummi, Muckleshoot, 
Puyallup, the Yakama, Jamestown S'Klallam, Quinault, there are 
so many. And I can tell you, they certainly are not asking us 
to break our promises or cut off key resources, our Tribal 
leaders want us to invest in climate resilience.
    They want to make sure their communities are prepared for 
and protected from rising sea levels, and raging wildfires 
which are becoming much too common. They want to be able to 
work together to manage the forests and lands they rely on, and 
help recover the salmon populations that are foundational to 
Tribal cultures and economies.
    They want to provide the support people need to overcome 
depression, opioid use disorder, and other mental health 
challenges. They want to provide the health care people need to 
have a safe pregnancy, and not die in childbirth. They want to 
end the epidemic of missing and murdered Native women, and 
secure justice for survivors and their families. They want 
their rights protected, and their sovereignty respected.
    And I do want to recognize Chair Merkley's leadership on 
Tribal Sovereignty Payments, and reiterate my support for his 
efforts. Now, I don't think any of this is too much to ask for.
    And here is what I hope all of my colleagues will 
recognize. Many of us will talk about listening to, and 
prioritizing Tribal voices here in Congress. Well, here is our 
opportunity to demonstrate that commitment. More than just 
words; if you support Tribes, then support them with the 
funding that they deserve, because I know our Nation is 
stronger when our Tribes are stronger. And that keeping people 
safe, keeping our communities safe, has to include our Tribal 
communities.
    So this subcommittee is extremely important, and I want to 
work with both of you to make sure we do that well. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Well, thank you very much.
    And we are going to jump right into the testimony, 
beginning with Assistant Secretary Newland.

                SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN NEWLAND

    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, and Ranking 
Member Murkowski, it is great to see you. I appreciate the 
opportunity today to testify in the Department of the 
Interior's fiscal year 2024 Budget Request for Indian Affairs.
    The President's fiscal year 2024 Budget for Indian Affairs 
is $4.7 billion. This funding represents funding for the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education, the Bureau 
of Trust Funds Administration, and additional programs within 
our office in the Assistant Secretary's hallway.
    As well as proposed mandatory reclassifications for 
contract support costs and 105(l) leases. Out request for the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs is $3 billion, and within that total 
it includes $431 million for contract support costs, and more 
than $82 million for payments for Tribal leases which are 
requested as current mandatory funding to ensure we can 
continue to make these critical payments and meet our other 
trust obligations.
    The budget for the operation of Indian Programs Account is 
$2.3 billion. The BIA continues to focus on the priorities of 
increasing sovereignty over Tribal lands, advancing economic 
opportunity, ensuring public safety, and responding to climate 
change.
    The request includes $641 million for Public Safety and 
Justice Operations, an increase of $62 million in one quarter 
of our Bureau of Indian Affairs Budget Request. Operational 
funding supports the expanding Tribal needs, and policing, 
detention, and Tribal courts. The budget includes a $33.5 
million increase to the Criminal Investigations and Police 
Services line, which has specifically targeted to increase the 
number of officers and investigators on the ground in Tribal 
communities.
    The request also includes $16.5 million to address the 
crisis of missing and murdered indigenous peoples. As part of a 
proposed expansion to the Tiwahe Initiative, our budget 
includes $1.9 million for the Office of Tribal Justice Support, 
to provide technical assistance to Tribes looking to develop 
and operate healing to wellness courts.
    These courts serve as alternatives to incarceration, and 
provide a culturally appropriate form to support those within 
the criminal justice system. As part of our government-wide 
efforts to strengthen Tribal communities, our budget proposal 
includes $205 million in the Human Services funding line, an 
increase of $38.4 million. This amount includes $79 million for 
social services which will support expanded implementation of 
the Indian Child and Family Violence Prevention Act.
    And in addition, it includes an increase of $26.7 million 
to expand the Tiwahe Initiative through several Human Services 
programs, including the Housing Improvement Program.
    Our budget also includes a total of more than $201 million 
for Trust Real Estate Services activities an increase of $42 
million, included within that is a proposal to protect Tribal 
homelands through the ``Carcieri Fix'' which will ensure that 
all federally recognized Tribes have the ability to place land 
in the trust.
    We are requesting for the BIA, $30.5 million for the Indian 
Land Consolidation Program. This program funding recognizes our 
ongoing need to continue to address fractionation of Indian 
lands. Without continued investment in Indian land 
consolidation, the rate of fractionation in Indian Country will 
exceed pre-Cobell rates by the year 2038.
    Our budget includes $12 million for the creation of a new 
Tribal Land and Water Conservation Fund Land Acquisition 
Program. During our LWCF listening sessions last year one of 
the top priorities that Tribes identified was direct access to 
LWCF funding for conservation and recreation projects without 
the existing requirement to either partner with, or apply 
through states.
    Our budget also funds the community and economic 
development activity at more than $77 million, which is a $46 
million increase to advance economic opportunities in Indian 
Country. This includes an additional $27.5 million investment 
in Native language revitalization, which as you noted, Ranking 
Member, is crucial to preserving Tribal languages, promoting 
self-determination, and strengthening Tribal communities.
    A request for the Indian Loan Guaranteed Program is $15.5 
million, which will guarantee or ensure more than $202 million 
in loan principal, which will support economic development in 
Tribal communities. And our budget proposes $2.8 billion in new 
mandatory funding over 10 years for Tribal Water Rights 
Settlement requirements, including $2.5 billion to cover the 
cost of enacted and future settlements, and $340 million for 
the ongoing costs associated with enacted settlements, managed 
by the Bureau of Reclamation.
    With respect to infrastructure, BIA is responsible for more 
than 29,000 miles of paved, gravel, and earth surface roads 
across Indian Country, as well as 1,000 bridges. Our budget 
includes $51.3 million for road maintenance, which is an 
increase of $12 million to support maintenance activities, and 
snow and ice removal. The request includes nearly $200 million 
for BIA construction activities, a $46 million increase from 
fiscal year 2023 enacted.
    That includes an increase of nearly $24 million for 
replacement and deferred maintenance projects, to address needs 
at our Public Safety and Justice facilities, in particular, our 
detention facilities at BIA.
    We are also proposing funding to support our staffing needs 
to deliver on our trust obligations, and make sure these 
services are implemented properly in Tribal communities, 
including supporting the White House Council on Native American 
Affairs, providing adequate Staffing for the 105(l) Leasing 
Program, and making sure that we are staffed up, across the BIA 
and BIE, to deliver our services.
    For the Bureau of Indian Education, our fiscal year '24 
request is $1.6 billion. And that includes key investments to 
strengthen BIE's autonomy as a Federal agency. Within that 
budget proposal $1.2 billion is for the operation of Indian 
Education programs; that includes $925 million for operating 
the entire BIE elementary and secondary school system, which 
supports 45,000 students across 23 states.
    With respect to BIE's facilities, operations, and 
maintenance, we are requesting $160 million, which includes 
investments to keep pace with operational cost increases, and 
support timely maintenance and replacement of equipment at BIE 
schools. This proposal also includes nearly $34 million for 
Education IT to support ongoing costs of distance learning, and 
enhanced classroom technology.
    Our fiscal year 2024 budget request for BIE also includes 
$416 million, an increase of nearly $148 million, for Education 
construction, to replace and repair school facilities and 
address deferred maintenance, at needs, across the BIE system. 
And we also propose a critical, $136 million dollar increase, 
for replacement school construction, and $24 million for 
replacement facility construction, to ensure that all Native 
students can get their education in appropriate facilities.
    Housing is a key element for our education staffing needs, 
especially at schools in remote locations across Tribal 
communities. We are asking for $139 million for housing and 
other facilities repair programs including a $9.7 million 
increase for facilities Improvement in repair, and a $2.5 
million increase for new employee housing.
    Lastly, the fiscal year 2024 budget request includes $109 
million for the Bureau of Trust Funds Administration's budget. 
This request is actually $2.2 million below the fiscal year 
2023 enacted which reflects a proposed transfer of funding for 
probate work within the Office of Hearings and Appeals from 
BTFA to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    I also want to encourage the Committee, and Congress, to 
accept our proposed organizational structure for the Bureau of 
Trust Funds Administration. Bureau of Trust Funds 
Administration (BTFA) provides a unique Federal Trust function 
that is, appropriately, separate from the duties and 
responsibilities of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Approving 
this structure will strengthen the organization's ability to 
focus on its core missions, and on additional high visibility 
and complex projects.
    I am very proud of the budget requests that we have put 
forward for Indian Affairs, we believe it reflects the 
administration's commitment to meeting our trust and treaty 
obligations.
    And I appreciate the opportunity to testify today, Mr. 
Chairman, and Members of the Committee. And I look forward to 
answering any questions you have. Thank you.
    [The statement follows:]
                Prepared Statement of Hon. Bryan Newland
    Good morning, Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and members 
of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding 
the Fiscal Year 2024 President's Budget Request for Indian Affairs.
    The President's 2024 budget for Indian Affairs is $4.7 billion--
this total includes funding for all of Indian Affairs which includes 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), 
the Bureau of Trust Funds Administration (BTFA) and the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs (AS-IA), as well as proposed 
mandatory reclassifications for contract support costs and 105(l) 
Tribal leases. As the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, I oversee 
the program offices within the BIA, the BIE, the BTFA and additional 
programmatic functions within the immediate AS- IA Office.
                         recent accomplishments
    Indian Affairs is leading improvements in education, supporting 
economic development, improving law enforcement programs, and helping 
Tribes manage climate change through resiliency and adaptation, among 
many other policy initiatives. I want to pause and reflect on our 
remarkable and collective work accomplished over the past year.
    Indian Affairs has expanded the use of the Buy Indian Act to bring 
support to Indian Economic Enterprises. In Fiscal Year 2022, nearly 
$420 million in spending went to Native-owned businesses, which 
represents 72% of all of Indian Affairs' purchasing power.
    We are focusing on retention and recruitment. Hiring continues to 
be a challenge in technical fields, and we are looking at all levers we 
have available to improve retention and recruitment. In the area of law 
enforcement, the BIA Office of Justice Services team is working closely 
with the Indian Affairs Office of Human Capital on several strategies 
to support recruitment and retention. The foremost strategy is a pay 
parity initiative which will bring BIA law enforcement pay levels in 
line with other Federal law enforcement, this change would result in up 
to an additional $30,000 annually for BIA law enforcement officers. We 
are currently in the process of converting current staff to the new pay 
levels and openings for new vacancies are being advertised at this 
higher pay rate. Our team is also meeting on weekly basis to ensure the 
hiring process and background checks move as quickly as possible. BIE 
also continues its focus on teacher and counselor pay parity to attract 
and retain key staff at all BIE-funded schools.
    The Missing and Murdered Unit continues to collect and review 
unsolved cases involving Missing and Murdered American Indian/Alaska 
Native People; prioritize and assign cases for investigation; 
coordinate investigation and search & recovery resources within Indian 
Country; and liaison with Tribal, State, and Federal law enforcement 
agencies on Missing and Murdered Indigenous People related issues. 
Since its creation in 2021, the MMU has investigated 735 missing and 
murdered persons cases, solved, or closed 264 missing persons cases, 
and solved 8 murder cases.
    The Tiwahe Initiative is working on expanding to new sites. Indian 
Affairs worked with existing Tiwahe sites to develop a framework for 
selecting new Tiwahe sites, and then conducted consultation with Tribes 
on the framework. Thirty-five (35) Tribes applied for inclusion in the 
Tiwahe Demonstration Project. We recently announced the selection of 
two new Tiwahe sites from this process, the Confederated Salish and 
Kootenai Tribes in Montana and the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah. 
Additionally, we provided $100,000 in one time funding to 10 other 
Tribes that applied so they can implement programs that were included 
in their Tiwahe proposal or to participate in the Tiwahe incubator to 
perform a needs assessment and develop a Tiwahe plan.
    Indian Affairs is leading the investigation into the Federal Indian 
Boarding School system. Spotlighting this part of American history is 
needed for Indian Country and the United States to heal and move 
forward together. BTFA is the lead organization for research on this 
initiative. Our initial investigation identified marked or unmarked 
burial sites at approximately 53 different schools across the system. 
As the investigation continues, we expect the number of identified 
burial sites to increase.
    Interior continues to be a government-wide leader in shaping Tribal 
consultation policy and facilitating Tribal input into policy 
development and program implementation. At the forefront of this effort 
is the White House Council on Native American Affairs. The Council has 
played a critical role in coordinating across agencies and holding 
government-wide consultation to facilitate implementation of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and other 
critical policies.
    To support teachers and administrators, the Bureau of Indian 
Education (BIE) is investing in BIE's Strategic Transformation of 
Education Program (STEP) providing professional development, upgraded 
technology, and enhancing our ability to provide culturally relevant 
education across BIE. BIE is also developing a BIE Principal's 
Leadership Academy to deliver professional development to school 
leaders, focus on educational outcome improvements, support retention 
of key administrators and develop our future leaders. Furthermore, BIE 
is implementing Behavioral Health and Wellness Programs serving BIE 
students, staff, and communities with mental health and wellness 
support. BIE school safety and security improvements continue to be a 
priority with targeted funding and hiring plans that support school 
leaders. BIE is also moving forward on clean energy goals--including 
Clean School Bus and School Replacement Construction initiatives that 
not only reduce our carbon footprint but support economic development 
and cleaner energy future for the students and communities we serve.
  bureau of indian affairs and office of the assistant secretary for 
                             indian affairs
    The mission of the BIA is to enhance the quality of life, promote 
economic opportunity, and carry out the Federal responsibility to 
protect and improve the trust assets of American Indians, Indian 
Tribes, and Alaska Natives. The request for BIA and the AS-IA Office is 
$3.0 billion in current appropriations. Within this total, the budget 
includes $431.4 million for Contract Support Costs and $82.5 million 
for Payments for Tribal Leases, which are requested as current 
mandatory funding to ensure we can continue to make these critical 
payments and meet other trust obligations. The 2024 budget supports an 
all-of government approach to addressing Federal responsibilities and 
Tribal needs in Indian Country. The White House Council on Native 
American Affairs, in coordination with Indian Affairs bureaus, supports 
collaboration on this work across Federal agencies. We are also looking 
to leverage external resources. The budget includes additional funding 
to build out an Office of Strategic Partnerships which can leverage 
philanthropic funding to build on Federal resources for program 
delivery for Indian Country.
                      operation of indian programs
    The 2024 budget for the Operation of Indian Programs account is 
$2.3 billion. The 2024 budget continues to focus on the priorities put 
forward in our 2023 budget of increasing sovereignty over Tribal lands, 
advancing economic opportunities, ensuring public safety, and 
responding to climate change.
              protect and support safe tribal communities
    BIA's Office of Justice Services (OJS) funds law enforcement, 
corrections, and court services to support safe Tribal communities. The 
2024 budget includes $641.8 million for Public Safety and Justice 
(PS&J) operations, an increase of $62.1 million above the 2023 enacted 
level. Operational funding supports the expanding Tribal needs in 
policing, detention, and Tribal courts, including those resulting from 
the McGirt v. Oklahoma Supreme Court decision.
    The budget includes a $33.5 million program increase to Criminal 
Investigations and Police Services, specifically targeted to increase 
the number of officers and investigators on the ground in Indian 
Country. A program increase of $2.0 million is also requested to 
enhance functions within the OJS Professional Standards Directorate, 
including recruitment and retention initiatives, development and 
evaluation of law enforcement policies, program reviews, and training. 
The 2024 budget includes $16.5 million to address the crisis of Missing 
and Murdered Indigenous People. The Missing and Murdered Unit engages 
in cross-departmental and interagency collaboration to identify gaps in 
information sharing and data collection to investigate these cases more 
effectively.
    As part of a proposed expansion to the Tiwahe Initiative, the 
budget includes $1.9 million for the Office of Tribal Justice Support 
to provide technical assistance to Tribes looking to develop and 
operate Healing to Wellness courts. These courts serve as alternatives 
to incarceration and provide a culturally appropriate forum to support 
those within the criminal justice system by assisting in addressing 
underlying behavioral health and substance abuse issues.
                   promote tribal self-determination
    The 2024 budget provides $444.4 million for programs that support 
Tribal government activities. The budget includes $240.8 million for 
compact activities for self-governance Tribes, enabling Tribes to plan, 
conduct, consolidate, and administer programs, services, functions, and 
activities for Tribal citizens, according to priorities established by 
their Tribal governments. The budget includes $86.2 million to support 
Consolidated Tribal Government Programs for Tribes operating under 
Public Law 93-638 contracts, giving approximately 275 Tribes the 
flexibility to combine and manage contracted programs and grants that 
are similar or compatible to simplify contracting.
    The Small Tribes Supplement program helps eligible Tribes expand 
and sustain their Tribal governance. The 2024 budget funds the program 
at $23.0 million-$16 million above 2023 enacted. This level of funding 
is estimated to reach a funding threshold of $300,000 for the Tribes in 
this category. The budget requests an additional $2.0 million to hire 
additional Awarding Officials (AOs) and support staff at regional BIA 
field sites in the regions to address the growing number of complex 
contracts that involve multiple and diverse programs. The BIA has more 
than 9,500 open Title I, ISDEAA contracts being administered throughout 
the Nation. Increased personnel will also help ensure timely Tribal 
payments, which is an area that has been and continues to be reviewed 
by the Government Accountability Office.
                     strengthen tribal communities
    As part of the government-wide efforts to strengthen Tribal 
communities, the budget includes $205.4 million, an increase of $38.4 
million above 2023 enacted, in Human Services funding to support Indian 
families. This amount includes $79.5 million for Social Services, which 
will support expanded implementation of the Indian Child Protection and 
Family Violence Prevention Act. The act seeks to bolster child 
protection and ensure better coordination between child welfare and 
domestic violence programs in Indian Country. In addition, the budget 
includes increases of $26.7 million to expand the Tiwahe Initiative 
through several Human Services programs.
    Indian Affairs is uniquely positioned to assist in the effort to 
recover the histories of Federal Indian boarding schools. The 2024 
budget includes $7.0 million for the Secretary's Federal Indian 
Boarding School Initiative (BSI) and its comprehensive review of 
Federal boarding school policies. This funding will continue to 
implement recommendations laid out in the May 2022 Federal Boarding 
School Initiative Investigative Report, including continued historical 
research and documentation, and work to identify and protect the 
remains of those identified.
    advance indian trust ownership and improve indian trust-related 
                              information
    The 2024 budget includes a total of $201.2 million for the Trust 
Real Estate Services activity, an increase of $42.2 million. Also 
included is an appropriations language proposal to strengthen Tribal 
homelands through the ``Carcieri Fix,'' which will ensure all 
Federally-recognized Tribes may place land into trust status.
    The Trust Real Estate Services activity implements strategies to 
advance Indian trust ownership and improve Indian trust-related 
information. The 2024 budget proposes $201.2 million for real estate 
services programs and supports the processing of Indian trust-related 
documents, such as land title and records and geospatial data, to 
support land and water resources use, energy development, and 
protection and restoration of ecosystems and important lands. An 
additional $1.9 million supports the new Office of Indigenous 
Communication and Technology to support Tribal efforts to increase 
broadband access and licensing for broadband spectrum frequencies, and 
to advance other critical infrastructure investments. The BIA requested 
increase of $2 million supports additional Realty staff at Trust field 
locations to manage increased infrastructure development document 
processing to ensure leasing, rights-of-way, and other approval 
processes are completed timely.
    The budget also proposes to shift funding for the DOI Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (OHA) Probate Hearings Division to BIA from the 
Bureau of Trust Funds Administration. This transfer will align OHA's 
Probate Hearings Division function with BIA's Probate Real Estate 
function, allowing the Department to more efficiently process probate 
cases to completion by improving coordination between BIA and OHA.
    BIA requests $30.5 million, a $22.5 million increase above 2023 
enacted, for the Indian Land Consolidation Program (ILCP), which 
purchases fractional interests from willing individual Indian 
landowners and conveys those interests to the Tribe with jurisdiction. 
ILCP funding recognizes the ongoing need to continue to address 
fractionation on Indian lands while also focusing support on Tribes' 
plans for and adaptation to climate change. This program is especially 
important since the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations (LBBP), 
established as part of the Cobell Settlement, ended in November 2022. 
The ICLP has incorporated lessons learned from the LBBP and the 
previous ILCP in BIA to ensure effective program implementation.
    The budget includes $12.0 million for the creation of a new Tribal 
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) land acquisition program. 
During LWCF listening sessions held in 2022, one of the top priorities 
Tribes identified was direct access to LWCF funding for conservation 
and recreation LWCF projects without the existing program requirements 
to partner with or apply through States. BIA will primarily provide 
funding to Tribes to acquire lands or easements for the purposes of 
protecting and conserving natural resource areas that may also be of 
cultural importance to the Tribe or have significant recreational 
benefits for Tribal communities, consistent with the purposes of LWCF 
funding. BIA plans to hold formal Tribal consultation on the 
establishment and eligibility criteria of the program. This new program 
will further enhance the ability of Tribes to address the climate 
crisis, support Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, and provide 
another important tool to support Tribal co-stewardship.
   invest in climate resilience, natural resource management and co-
                              stewardship
    The budget includes $385.9 million, a $52.7 million increase over 
2023 enacted, for critical trust natural resources activities and 
investing in climate resilience and environmental justice. BIA requests 
$48.0 million for the Tribal Climate Resilience program. This program 
includes the Tribal Climate Adaptation Grant program, which is funded 
at $24.8 million to better assess and meet Tribal climate adaptation 
needs, and the Climate Relocation Grant program, which is funded at 
$15.5 million, $6 million more than the 2023 enacted amount. The Tribal 
Climate Resilience program also includes $7.8 million for Tribal youth 
corps programs, an important jobs initiative to tackle climate change 
on the ground, ensure a living wage, and provide skills and a pathway 
to employment.
    With a focused investment in the deployment of clean energy in 
Tribal communities, the budget includes $47.7 million for Energy and 
Minerals activities. Indian Affairs views renewable energy as one of 
many tools available to American Indians and Alaska Natives to create 
sustainable economies on Indian land.
    The 2024 budget proposes to shift the Office of Subsistence 
Management (OSM) to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian 
Affairs from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. OSM provides 
administrative support to the Federal Subsistence Board and the Federal 
Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils, in addition to supporting the 
subsistence regulatory process and the Fisheries Resource Monitoring 
program. Shifting OSM will maintain important expertise while 
facilitating expanded Tribal co-management partnerships and the 
incorporation of indigenous knowledge into subsistence management.
    The BIA budget further invests in the health and safety of Tribal 
communities. BIA requests $38.8 million for the Environmental Quality 
Projects program, an increase of $10.9 million over 2023 enacted, which 
includes funding to continue remediation of the former Tuba City Dump 
Superfund site, which continues to threaten the drinking water of the 
Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe.
                     advance economic opportunities
    The 2024 budget funds the Community and Economic Development 
activity at $77.6 million, a $46.4 million increase above 2023 enacted 
levels, to advance economic opportunities in Indian Country. Within the 
total funding provided, Job Placement and Training is funded at $15.8 
million and includes an additional $2.0 million for job training 
programs focusing on clean energy development that is a complementary 
investment to the Tribal Electrification funding provided in the 
Inflation Reduction Act. Economic Development projects are funded at 
$50.7 million and include a request for an additional $27.5 million 
investment in Native language revitalization, which is crucial to 
preserve endangered languages, promote self-determination, and 
strengthen Tribal communities. BIA also requests a $5.0 million 
increase to establish an economic development component of the Tiwahe 
Initiative, which will provide funding directly to Tribal governments 
to design and operate comprehensive and integrated economic and 
community development programs.
    The 2024 budget request for the Indian Guaranteed Loan Program is 
$15.5 million, which will guarantee or insure $202.3 million in loan 
principal to support Indian economic development across Indian Country. 
This includes an additional $1 million for loan subsidies and $0.5 
million for staffing to increase technical assistance. By strengthening 
the economic base of Tribal communities, the Tribal governments near 
those businesses progress toward greater self-determination.
                   land and water claims settlements
    Tribal land and water rights settlements ensure that Tribes have 
access to land and water to meet domestic, economic, and cultural 
needs. The 2024 budget proposes $976,000 for the Settlements account. 
The 2024 funding request covers the continuing implementation of the 
White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act (Public Law 99-264) and 
Truckee River Operating Agreement (Public Law 101-618). The Budget also 
proposes $2.8 billion in new mandatory funding over 10 years for Tribal 
water rights settlements requirements, including $2.5 billion to cover 
the costs of enacted and future settlements and $340 million for 
ongoing costs associated with enacted settlements managed by the Bureau 
of Reclamation.
                       infrastructure investment
    BIA is responsible for more than 29,000 miles of paved, gravel and 
earth-surface roads and more than 1,000 bridges. Maintaining these 
roads is critical to public safety, education and economic development 
purposes. The FY 2024 budget includes $51.3 million for road 
maintenance, an increase of $12.1 million to support pavement and 
gravel maintenance, remedial work on improved earthen roads, bridge 
maintenance, and snow and ice control.
    The 2024 budget includes $199.8 million for Construction 
activities, a $46.5 million increase from the 2023 enacted level. The 
funding includes an increase of $23.8 million for replacement and 
deferred maintenance projects to address needs at PS&J facilities, 
particularly detention centers. It also includes a $4.6 million 
increase for the irrigation rehabilitation program, and additional land 
an additional $10.3 million for Dam maintenance. BIA is responsible for 
141 high- or significant-hazard dams on 42 Indian reservations. The 
Construction program also includes a $6.8 million increase to support 
the Administration's governmentwide goal to accelerate the use of zero- 
emission vehicles to enable a clean transportation future.
                           capacity building
    The budget includes critical staff capacity building across our 
programs. The needs range from an increase for human capital 
capabilities to supporting the White House Council on Native American 
Affairs in its critical role coordinating the Federal Government's 
engagement with Tribal communities, to providing adequate staffing for 
the 105(l) Tribal lease program which is on a path to have over 200 
leases in place in FY 2023. Adequate staffing is critical to ensuring 
timely and effective delivery to the Tribal nations we serve.
                       bureau of indian education
    The FY 2024 budget request for BIE programs within the Department 
totals $1.6 billion. The Budget includes key investments to strengthen 
BIE's autonomy as a Federal agency and improve local services for 
Tribally controlled and bureau-operated schools while also advancing 
equity for historically underserved Tribal communities.
                 operation of indian education programs
    The 2024 budget provides $1.2 billion for Operation of Indian 
Education Programs. The core mission of BIE is to support Bureau 
Operated and Tribally Controlled schools and administer grants to 
Tribal institutions of higher education.
    The request includes $925.5 million for operating the entire BIE 
elementary and secondary school system-169 elementary and secondary 
schools, and 14 dormitories-by providing educational services to 
approximately 45,000 students in 23 States. Funds support the basic and 
supplemental education programs at BIE-funded schools, student 
transportation, facility operations, and maintenance. The budget 
advances sovereignty in education by proposing a provision allowing for 
the expansion of more than one grade at BIE-funded schools with a K-2 
or K-4 structure. Currently, K-4 schools are only allowed to expand by 
one grade. This proposal will allow BIE to expand educational services 
to communities already being served.
    The 2024 request includes targeted funding to improve Indian 
student academic outcomes, address maintenance needs, support expanded 
preschool and Native language programs, and provide pay parity for 
Tribal teachers while fully funding projected Tribal Grant Support 
Costs. The Budget provides $508.7 million, a $27.0 million increase 
over 2023 enacted, for Indian School Equalization Program funds to 
enhance opportunities and outcomes in the classroom, provide improved 
instructional services, and support increased teacher quality, 
recruitment, and retention. The request level of $22.1 million, 
including a $500,000 program increase, for Education Program
    Enhancements supports professional development for teachers, 
advances the quality of in- classroom instruction, and incorporates 
improved Native language and culture programs in classrooms. Early 
Child and Family Development funding of $26.1 million enables BIE to 
provide preschool opportunities at BIE-funded schools.
    For Facilities Operations and Maintenance, BIE requests $160 
million, a $5.6 million increase over the 2023 enacted amount, and 
includes investments to keep pace with operational cost increases and 
support the timely maintenance and replacement of equipment at BIE 
schools. The Budget also includes $22.6 million, including a $2.0 
million program increase, for the Johnson-O'Malley program, which is 
authorized to support the individualized educational needs of eligible 
Indian students enrolled in public schools and nonsectarian private 
schools.
    The Budget continues to invest in activities that promote 
educational self-determination for Tribal communities and includes 
$98.7 million for Tribal Grant Support Costs for Tribes that choose to 
operate BIE-funded schools. This level of funding supports 100 percent 
of the estimated requirement. The request includes $189.6 million for 
Postsecondary Programs, a $6.0 million increase over 2023 enacted. The 
2024 budget continues recognition of the critical role Tribal 
postsecondary institutions have in empowering Indian students and 
promoting equity for Tribal communities. These institutions are on or 
near reservations; they directly serve Tribal communities with 
culturally relevant education and career pathways in a supportive 
environment. Postsecondary education of Tribal members remains an 
essential component in the economic development of many Tribes.
    The proposed budget will provide $34.9 million, including a $2.0 
million program increase, for BIE operated Haskell Indian Nations 
University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute; $87.9 million 
for grants to 29 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs); and $10.7 
million for grants for two Tribal Technical Colleges, as well as $43.4 
million for the Scholarships and Adult Education program to improve 
educational opportunities and serve a larger population of qualified 
Native American students.
                          education management
    The Budget includes $79.3 million, an increase of $12.1 million 
over 2023 enacted, for education management and information technology 
(IT) to optimize learning opportunities for students of all ages. 
Education Program Management (EPM) funding supports ongoing 
improvements in high- priority functional areas, including acquisition, 
school safety and security, behavioral and mental health support, 
performance tracking, and technical support to schools in the field. 
Other management activities include data collection, analysis, and 
reporting; financial and budget functions; oversight and coordination 
of major facility repairs; and management of grant applications. BIE IT 
includes the Native American Student Information System, wide area 
network infrastructure, and general support systems used by BIE-funded 
schools.
    The budget proposes $33.7 million, an increase of $5.8 million over 
the 2023 enacted level, for Education IT to support the ongoing costs 
of distance learning and enhanced classroom technology. BIE continues 
to collaborate with Tribes and communities to alleviate ongoing strains 
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on BIE students and their families, 
teachers, administrators, and other staff members in K-12 schools and 
at TCUs. The 2024 Budget will enable BIE to leverage ongoing 
infrastructure investments in new technology and operational 
capabilities at BIE-funded schools, including the new Education 
Learning Management System, by supporting comprehensive online delivery 
of educational courses to students and professional development 
opportunities for teachers.
    EPM initiatives in 2024 include the continued implementation of a 
School Operations Office of Self-Determination to develop Tribal 
capacity and promote maximum Indian participation in educational 
programs and services; and BIE's Social Emotional Learning project to 
develop a national curriculum to support behavioral health and wellness 
programs at BIE-funded schools. The funding in 2024 will also allow EPM 
to calculate and report on methodologies for maximizing the benefits to 
underserved communities.
                         education construction
    The 2024 Budget includes $416.2 million, an increase of $148.3 
million over 2023 enacted, in annual funding for Education Construction 
to replace and repair school facilities and address deferred 
maintenance needs at campuses across the BIE school system. This 
funding includes substantial investments to address the climate crisis 
with more sustainable BIE infrastructure. Whenever feasible, BIE 
facilities projects incorporate techniques to reduce energy and water 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and to prepare the facilities 
for the predicted effects of climate change.
    The proposed $252.5 million for Replacement School Construction, a 
$136.0 million increase over the 2023 enacted amount, and $23.9 million 
for Replacement Facility Construction are critical to ensuring that all 
Native students can develop in an environment conducive to quality 
educational achievement. With the Replacement School Construction, 
Replacement Facility Construction, and Great American Outdoors Act 
(Public Law 116-152) funding anticipated through 2024, BIE expects to 
support planning, design, and construction work at nine BIE schools; 
final allocations are pending completion of the design phase and 
refined cost estimates for each school. Appropriate housing is a key 
element for educational staffing, especially at schools in remote 
locations. An additional $139.8 million is included for other housing 
and facilities repair programs, including a $9.7 million program 
increase for facilities improvement and repair and a $2.5 million 
increase for new/replacement employee housing.
                  bureau of trust funds administration
    The FY 2024 budget includes $109.1 million to support BTFA's 
execution of Federal trust responsibilities to American Indian and 
Alaska Native Tribes, individuals, and communities. The request is $2.2 
million below the FY 2023 enacted reflecting the proposed transfer of 
funding supporting probate related work in the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals from BTFA to BIA. The budget promotes investments in programs 
to ensure the Department is meeting its financial management trust 
obligations. It also includes a targeted increase for staffing needs to 
improve customer service and advance the Department's Diversity, 
Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility Initiative.
    I strongly encourage the Congress to accept the BTFA organizational 
structure in the FY 2024 appropriations bill. BTFA provides a unique 
Federal trust function that is appropriately separate from the 
responsibilities of the BIA. Approving this structure will strengthen 
the organization's ability to focus on its core mission 
responsibilities and on additional complex and high-visibility 
projects. Specifically, BTFA is leading the research effort on the 
Secretary's Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative and has the lead 
on implementing an Electronic Records Management Program for all of 
Indian Affairs. In addition, improving government customer service is 
one pillar of the President's Management Agenda. In that arena, BTFA is 
one of four High Impact Service Providers at DOI, and works 
extensively, along with other agencies, to improve services to our 
beneficiaries.
                          concluding statement
    This FY 2024 budget continues to support the Administration's 
commitment to honor trust responsibilities to Tribes and self-
determination. The 2024 budget continues investments to empower Tribal 
communities, strengthen climate resilience, improve quality of life, 
create economic opportunities, increase focus on environmental quality 
and justice needs in Tribal communities, and preserve and foster 
cultural heritage. Interior's programs maintain strong and productive 
government-to-government relationships with Tribes, helping to promote 
Tribal nation building and self-determination.

    Senator Merkley. Thank you, very much Secretary Newland.
    And I will turn to Director Tso, Director of Indian Health 
Services. Welcome.
STATEMENT OF HON. ROSELYN TSO, DIRECTOR, INDIAN HEALTH 
            SERVICE
    Ms. Tso. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Merkley, and 
Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the Committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify on the President's fiscal 
year 2024 Budget Request for the Indian Health Service.
    Before I begin, though, I want to thank and acknowledge the 
members of this committee for the work that you have done to 
grow the IHS budget and prioritize health throughout Indian 
Country. We are especially grateful for your work in providing 
IHS Advance appropriations in fiscal year 2023 Bill, this is 
truly in a historic achievement, and that will greatly improve 
the lives of Native American families throughout Indian 
Country.
    I also appreciate the opportunity to share with you the 
steps that I have taken as the IHS Director to improve 
transparency, accountability, and oversight at the Indian 
Health Service. As we seek additional resources and new funding 
authorities it is critical that the Indian Health Service 
improve its internal operations to ensure safe, high quality 
health care services, and protect and support its relationships 
with Tribes and urban Indian organizations.
    To that end, I have published the first-ever agency work 
plan to manage high priority topics, including Enterprise Risk 
Management, on January 15th. The agency work plan addresses a 
wide range of issues, including patient safety, human capital, 
operations, finance, compliance, and strategies. This work 
builds on our efforts to meet the GAO criteria for removal from 
the--IHS from the high risk lists.
    The Indian Health Service has already completed two major 
accomplishments on the work plan. First, I initiated a full 
evaluation of the agency's quality program in December of 2022, 
with primary focus of improving oversight and accountability, 
and ensuring quality and safe care for our patients.
    Also, in December we were able to meet a major milestone 
which was to standardize governance throughout the Indian 
Health Service structure and all of our IHS operated 
facilities. What this does for the Indian Health Service for 
the first time, is align the resources that we have to the 
responsibilities that we have through the Indian Health 
Service, by standardizing Governing Board practices at our 
Direct Care Facility, supports a uniform approach, and also 
supports oversight and accountability while increasing 
efficiencies.
    Basically what this means, is that all of our IHS 
facilities now operate under one set of governance. And so for 
me as the IHS Director, I want to be able to scan the Indian 
Health Service at any given time, to be able to evaluate what 
is going on out there in Indian Country, and particularly at 
those sites that we are--continue to be responsible for.
    And with that, with your support, the IHS budget has grown 
68 percent in the last decade. We know that this type of growth 
is challenging to accomplish in a constrained, discretionary 
funding environment. Over the years the work with our Tribal 
and urban partners underscore our shared goals to improve 
health outcomes for All American Indians and Alaska Natives.
    It is with this shared goal in mind that the administration 
approached the fiscal year 2024 budget request for the IHS. We 
know that despite our shared efforts IHS is still underfunded. 
This underfunding of the Indian Health System directly 
contributes to the stark health disparities in our Indian 
communities.
    American Indians and Alaska Natives born today have an 
average life expectancy that is 10.9 years fewer than U.S. all-
race population. Long-standing health disparities were 
compounded by the pandemic, with the American Indians and 
Alaska Natives experiencing disproportionate rates of COVID-19 
infections, hospitalizations, and death. Addressing these 
inequities is a moral imperative for our Nation, and will 
require bold actions from all of us to ensure that we are 
upholding our commitments to Indian Country.
    This is why the budget proposes to build on the enactment 
of the advance appropriations for funding for the Indian Health 
Service and Facilities Accounts as discretionary.
    Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the budget would make all 
funding for IHS mandatory. The administration continues to 
stand behind mandatory funding as it is the most appropriate 
long-term funding solution for Indian Health Service. We know 
that is significant change that will take time and 
collaboration with Congress and Tribes to accomplish. We 
believe that the change of this magnitude is overdue, and we 
must deliver for Indian Country and in line with long-standing 
recommendations from Tribal leaders across the Nation.
    As noted in the GAO report, annual discretionary 
appropriations leaves IHS Tribal and Urban Indian Health 
Programs open to negative impacts from budgetary uncertainties. 
The President's budget would address these three core issues 
identified by GAO: funding, stability, predictability, and 
adequacy.
    As we work towards securing stable, predictable, and 
adequate funding to meet the needs of Indian Country, we are 
committed to working closely with all of our stakeholders.
    Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. And I am 
happy to answer any questions.
    [The statement follows:]
            Prepared Statement of Hon. Roselyn Tso Director
    Good afternoon Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and 
Members of the Committee. Thank you for your support and for inviting 
me to speak with you about the President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget 
Request for the Indian Health Service (IHS).
    IHS is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) and our mission is to raise the physical, mental, social, and 
spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) to the 
highest level. This mission is carried out in partnership with AI/AN 
Tribal communities through a network of over 600 Federal and Tribal 
health facilities and 41 Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) that are 
located across 37 States and provide health care services to 
approximately 2.8 million AI/AN people annually.
    On March 9, 2023, the White House released the President's FY 2024 
Budget, which takes a two pronged approach to build on the historic 
enactment of advance appropriations for the IHS in the FY 2023 Omnibus. 
In FY 2024, the Budget proposes to fund IHS Services and Facilities 
accounts as discretionary, building on the enacted 2024 advance 
appropriations. It also proposes to reclassify Contract Support Costs 
and Section 105(l) Leases to mandatory funding in FY 2024, which is the 
most appropriate funding source for these legally required payments to 
Tribal health programs. Beginning in FY 2025, the Budget would make all 
funding for IHS mandatory. The bold action proposed in the FY 2024 
President's Budget demonstrates the Administration's continued 
commitment to strengthening the Nation-to-nation relationship. This 
historic proposal addresses long-standing challenges that have impacted 
communities across Indian Country for decades.
                         leadership priorities
    I have been traveling across Indian Country to visit the places 
where we are serving our people since my appointment last fall. These 
visits have provided me a better perspective on national and regional 
issues affecting the Tribal members we serve and have informed my 
priorities for the agency. I have two key priorities as IHS Director: 
providing safe, high quality patient care; and improving our 
relationships with Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian 
Organizations. To those ends, I have taken significant steps to 
increase transparency, accountability, and oversight at the IHS. The 
IHS published its first ever Agency Work Plan \1\ to manage high 
priority, enterprise-wide risks on January 15. I hold quarterly 
strategic planning sessions with leadership from across the Agency to 
ensure progress on the Work Plan, and I have assigned a lead to each 
action on the Work Plan. These actions address a wide range of Agency-
wide issues including patient safety, human capital, operations, 
finances, compliance, and strategy. This work builds on the IHS' 
efforts to meet the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) criteria 
for removal from its high risk list.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Indian Health Service-2023 Agency Work Plan: https://
www.ihs.gov/quality/work-plan-summary/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The IHS has achieved two major accomplishments on the Work Plan 
thus far. I initiated an evaluation of the Agency's quality program in 
December 2022, with a primary focus on improving oversight of quality 
and safe care for patients. In general, this evaluation included a 
continued focus on oversight and accountability through developing 
policies, standardizing the IHS governance structure and strengthening 
IHS' enterprise risk management program.
    Standardizing governing board practices at direct service 
facilities improves oversight and accountability while increasing 
efficiency and effectiveness of governing board meetings. These actions 
allow the Agency to be proactive on governance issues by being able to 
review information in an efficient manner. These efforts were led by a 
team of subject matter experts from across the Agency, with oversight 
and technical direction by the IHS Chief Medical Officer.
    Funding issues directly contribute to challenges in providing safe, 
high-quality care for patients, and supporting productive relationships 
between the IHS and Tribes and Urban Indian Organizations. The Indian 
Health system is chronically underfunded compared to other healthcare 
systems in the U.S.\2,3\ Despite substantial growth in the IHS 
discretionary budget over the last decade, 68 percent from FY 2013 to 
the current FY 2023 enacted level, the growth has not been sufficient 
to address the well-documented funding gaps in Indian Country. These 
funding deficiencies directly contribute to stark health disparities 
faced by Tribal communities.

    AI/ANs born today have an average life expectancy that is 10.9 
years fewer than the U.S. all- races population. AI/AN life expectancy 
dropped from an estimated 71.8 years in 2019 to 65.2 years in 2021--the 
same life expectancy as the general United States population in 1944 
\4\. They also experience disproportionate rates of mortality from most 
major health issues, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
diabetes, unintentional injuries, assault and homicide, and suicide. 
AI/AN people also have higher rates of colorectal, kidney, liver, lung, 
and stomach cancers than non-Hispanic White people.\5\ The pandemic 
compounded the impact of these disparities in Tribal communities, with 
AI/ANs experiencing disproportionate rates of COVID-19 infection, 
hospitalization, and death.

     building on the historic achievement of advance appropriations
    The FY 2024 President's Budget builds on the historic enactment of 
advance appropriations for IHS in the FY 2023 Omnibus. For the first 
year of the proposal, the Budget includes $9.7 billion in total funding 
for the IHS, which includes $8.1 billion in discretionary funding, and 
$1.6 billion in proposed mandatory funding for Contract Support Costs, 
Section 105(l) Leases, and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. 
This is an increase of $2.5 billion above the FY 2023 Enacted level. 
Advance appropriations represent an important step towards securing 
stable and predictable funding to improve the overall health status of 
AI/ANs, and ensuring that the disproportionate impacts experienced by 
Tribal communities during government shutdowns and continuing 
resolutions are never repeated.
    While the progress achieved through the enactment of advance 
appropriations will have a lasting impact on Indian Country, funding 
growth beyond what can be accomplished through discretionary spending 
is needed to fulfill the Federal Government's commitments to AI/AN 
communities. Funding for IHS has grown substantially in the last 
decade, but this growth is not sufficient to address the historic under 
investment and persistent health disparities in AI/AN communities.
    The Administration continues to support mandatory funding for IHS 
as the most appropriate long-term funding solution for the agency and 
will continue to work collaboratively with Tribes and Congress to move 
toward sustainable, mandatory funding. Until this solution is enacted, 
it is critical that Congress continue to provide advance appropriations 
for IHS through the discretionary appropriations process for FY 2025 
and beyond.
                      long-term funding solutions
    The Budget proposes to fully shift the IHS budget to mandatory 
funding in FY 2025. This mandatory formula culminates in a total 
funding level of approximately $44.0 billion in FY 2033. In total, the 
mandatory budget would provide nearly $288 billion for the IHS over 10 
years. When accounting for the discretionary baseline, the net-total 
for the proposal is $192 billion over 10 years.
    Under the proposed mandatory structure, IHS funding would grow 
automatically to address inflation factors to address the growing cost 
of providing direct health care services, including pay costs, medical 
and non- medical inflation, and population growth, as well as key 
operational needs, and existing backlogs in both healthcare services 
and facilities infrastructure.
    Mandatory funding for the IHS provides the opportunity for 
significant funding increases that could not be achieved within 
discretionary spending levels. Further, this mandatory funding proposal 
ensuring predictability that would allow IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian 
health programs the opportunity for long-term and strategic planning. 
This increased stability and ability to conduct longer-term planning 
will improve the quality of healthcare, promote recruitment and 
retention of health professionals, and enhance management efficiencies 
for individual health programs and the Indian Health system at large.
    The Budget also exempts all IHS funding from sequestration, which 
is the legislatively mandated process of budget control consisting of 
automatic, across-the-board spending reductions to enforce budget 
targets to limit Federal spending. Exempting the IHS budget from 
sequestration ensures funding for direct health care services for AI/
ANs is not reduced and is consistent with the treatment of other 
critical programs such as veterans' health care and nutrition 
assistance programs.
    Lastly, the Budget proposes to reauthorize the Special Diabetes 
Program for Indians and provide $250 million in FY 2024, $260 million 
in FY 2025, and $270 million in FY 2026 in new mandatory funding. This 
program has proven to be effective at reducing the prevalence of 
diabetes among AI/AN adults \6\, and is associated with an estimated 
net-savings to Medicare of up to $520 million over 10 years due to 
averted cases of end-stage renal disease \7\. The budget's proposed 
increases will enable the program to expand to additional grantees, and 
allow the grantees to plan for larger and longer-term community-driven 
interventions more effectively. Without the reauthorization of this 
program in FY 2024 services would end for this successful program.

    This request responds to the long-standing recommendations of 
Tribal leaders shared in consultation with HHS and IHS to make IHS 
funding mandatory. The IHS recognizes that we must continue to work in 
consultation with Tribes and confer with urban Indian organizations, 
and with our partners in Congress. To this end, a joint OMB and HHS 
Tribal consultation and urban confer will be conducted in June to 
review this proposal and receive feedback to inform further refinements 
to the mandatory formula structure.
                 prioritizing high quality health care
    The Budget prioritizes investments that advance high quality health 
care and tackle the stark health care inequities AI/ANs face every day.
    In FY 2024 the Budget provides +$742 million increase to expand 
access to direct health care services by increasing funding across IHS' 
direct health care service program lines. These resources will support 
efforts to reduce health disparities and improve the overall health 
status for AI/ANs by increasing the availability of health care 
services in Indian Country. Specifically, this funding level will 
support an estimated additional 45,670 inpatient admissions and 
16,976,299 outpatient visits at IHS and Tribal facilities in FY 2024. 
This funding also expands access to the Purchased/Referred Care program 
for contract health care services that are not available in IHS or 
Tribal health facilities by providing an estimated 3,138 additional 
inpatient admissions, 92,248 additional outpatient visits, and 3,262 
additional patient travel trips. The Budget also expands Dental health 
services, supporting an estimated 167,119 additional dentalvisits and 
529,462 additional dental services in FY 2024. Within this total, the 
Budget includes an additional $21 million for the Urban Indian Health 
Program to expand access to culturally competent direct health care 
services through a network of 41 Urban Indian Organizations located in 
urban areas across the country. Expansion of these programs is 
essential to ensure that IHS can provide high quality medical services 
and support critical health care services that meet the unique needs of 
AI/AN communities.
    In addition, Current Services, which offset the rising costs of 
providing direct health care services, are fully funded at +$346 
million in FY 2024. These resources will help the IHS to maintain 
services at the FY 2023 levels by shoring up base operating budgets of 
IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs in the face of increasing 
costs. Similarly, in FY 2024, the Budget includes +$82 million to fully 
fund staffing and operating costs for eight newly-constructed or 
expanded health care facilities. These funds support the staffing 
packages for new or expanded facilities, which will expand the 
availability of direct health care services in areas where existing 
health care capacity is overextended. The mandatory funding formula 
fully funds Current Services and staffing and operating costs for newly 
opening facilities in the out-years.
    The Budget also makes targeted investments to address our Nation's 
most pressing public health challenges, which disproportionately impact 
AI/AN communities. For the first time ever, the Budget proposes 
dedicated funding to address disparities in cancer rates and mortality 
among AI/AN, providing $108 million for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. 
Through this initiative, the IHS would develop a coordinated public 
health and clinical cancer prevention initiative to implement best 
practices and prevention strategies to address incidence of cancer and 
mortality among AI/AN. Similarly, the Budget requests funding to 
address HIV, Hepatitis C, and Sexually Transmitted Infections (+$47 
million), improve maternal health (+$3 million), and address opioid use 
(+$9 million) in Indian Country.
    The Budget also makes numerous investments in high priority areas, 
such as recruitment and retention of high quality health professionals, 
expansion of the successful Community Health Aide Program, and other 
activities that support high quality health care.
    Likewise, from FY 2025 to FY 2029, the Budget requests an 
additional +$11.2 billion in mandatory funding for the Indian Health 
Care Improvement Fund to address the funding gap for direct healthcare 
services documented in the FY 2018 level of need funded analysis.\8\ 
The Budget would continue growth for direct services once the 2018 gap 
is addressed. This funding would be distributed using the Indian Health 
Care Improvement Fund formula. The formula is used to target the Indian 
Health Care Improvement Fund appropriations to the sites with the 
greatest need, as compared to the benchmark of National Health 
Expenditure Data, which is maintained by the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services. The formula is the product of longstanding 
consultation with Tribes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The outyear mandatory formula also prevents a sharp reduction in 
services by providing an additional +$220 million in FY 2025 to 
partially sustain the one-time American Rescue Plan Act investments 
that were appropriated to expand access to mental health and substance 
abuse prevention and treatment services, and to expand the public 
health workforce in Indian Country.
                  modernizing critical infrastructure
    In addition to funding for direct health care services, additional 
investments are needed to address substantial deficiencies in physical 
and information technology infrastructure across the IHS system. 
Outdated infrastructure poses challenges in safely providing patient 
care, recruiting and retaining staff, and meeting accreditation 
standards. From FY 2024 through FY 2029, the Budget includes critical 
funding increases to reduce or eliminate existing facilities backlogs 
and modernize the IHS Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.
    Specifically, in FY 2024, the Budget provides $913 million in 
discretionary funding for EHR modernization. The Budget then builds 
funding for EHR by +$1.1 billion each year from FY 2025 through FY 2029 
under the proposed mandatory formula. Once the EHR modernization effort 
is fully funded, the Budget provides sufficient resources for ongoing 
operations and maintenance of the new system. The current IHS EHR is 
over 50 years old, and the GAO identifies it as one of the 10 most 
critical Federal legacy systems in need of modernization. The IHS 
relies on its EHR for all aspects of patient care, including the 
patient record, prescriptions, care referrals, and billing public and 
private insurance for over $1 billion reimbursable health care services 
annually. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized 
system include, but are not limited to, improved patient safety, 
improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced 
population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, 
patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, and agency 
performance reporting. Additionally, the new system will be 
interoperable with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of 
Defense, Tribal and urban Indian health programs, academic affiliates, 
and community partners, many of whom are on different health 
information technology platforms.
    The IHS system also faces substantial physical infrastructure 
challenges--IHS hospitals are approximately 42 years old on average, 
which is almost four times the age of the average hospital in the 
United States. Infrastructure deficiencies directly contribute to 
poorer health outcomes for AI/ANs. The Budget addresses these needs by 
fully funding the 1993 Health Care Facilities Construction Priority 
list over 5 years. The remaining projects on the list include the 
Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ; Whiteriver Hospital, 
Whiteriver, AZ; Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, NM; Albuquerque 
West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM; Albuquerque Central Health Center, 
Albuquerque, NM; Sells Health Center, Sells, AZ; Alamo Heath Center, 
Alamo, NM; Bodaway Gap Health Center, The Gap AZ; and Pueblo Pintado 
Health Center, Pueblo Pintado, NM. After the 1993 Health Care 
Facilities Construction Priority List is completed, funding will 
continue to increase to begin addressing the full scope of Facilities 
needs as identified in the most recent IHS Facilities Needs Assessment 
Report to Congress.
    Furthermore, the Budget includes +$10 million in discretionary 
funding in FY 2024 and +$454 million in mandatory funding over 2 years, 
from FY 2025 to FY 2026, to fully fund the medical equipment backlog. 
Many IHS hospital administrators reported that old or inadequate 
physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care 
and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of 
Participation. The administrators also reported that aging buildings 
and equipment is a major challenge impacting recruitment and retention 
of clinicians.
    Maintaining reliable and efficient buildings is also a challenge as 
existing health care facilities age and the costs to operate and 
properly maintain health care facilities increases. Many IHS and Tribal 
health care facilities are operating at or beyond capacity, and their 
designs are not efficient in the context of modern health care 
delivery. The Budget tackles this challenge by providing a +$10 million 
discretionary increase for maintenance and improvement in FY 2024 and 
fully funding the 2022 Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration, 
and Repair for IHS and Tribal facilities of $1.02 billion over 2 years, 
from FY 2025 to FY 2026 under the mandatory formula.
    The Budget ensures that these facilities investments can be rapidly 
addressed by providing sufficient administrative support increases. 
Specifically, the mandatory formula increases the Facilities and 
Environmental Health Support funding line at 13 percent of the rate of 
growth in Sanitation Facilities Construction (SFC) and 5 percent of the 
rate of growth in Health Care Facilities Construction, consistent with 
historical funding needs and IHS' current estimation methodology. This 
funding supports staff to oversee and implement facilities projects, as 
well as a comprehensive environmental health program within IHS. Within 
this increase, the Budget dedicates $10 million in FY 2025 to support a 
nation-wide analysis to understand the cost implications of 
implementing section 302 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 
US.C. 1632), which authorizes funding for operations and maintenance 
costs for Tribes who choose to directly compete their own SFC projects. 
The results of this analysis will be used and implemented as part of 
the updated mandatory formula structure. These funds would be used by 
IHS and Tribes to ensure that existing SFC projects are reaching their 
maximum life-cycle and operations of these projects are sustainable for 
as long as possible. In FY 2027, the Budget provides an additional $250 
million in mandatory funding to address operation and maintenance costs 
for complete sanitation facilities projects, addressing longstanding 
recommendations from Tribes.
    Lastly, the IHS is grateful for the additional $3.5 billion in 
Sanitation Facilities Construction funding provided by the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). These funds will make a 
transformational impact on essential sanitation needs across Indian 
Country. To maintain existing project completion deadlines and support 
IHS and Tribes in successfully implementing IIJA resources, the Budget 
includes +$49 million in FY 2024 to support implementation of the $3.5 
billion provided by the IIJA for Sanitation Facilities Construction 
(SFC). This funding is within the Facility and Environmental Health 
Support funding line and will support additional salary, expenses, and 
administrative costs beyond the 3 percent allowed in the IIJA. These 
funds would also be available to Tribal Health Programs, which is not 
currently permissible under the 3 percent set-aside for administrative 
costs in the IIJA.
                     supporting self-determination
    IHS continues to support the self-determination of Tribes to 
operate their own health programs. Tribal leaders and members are best 
positioned to understand the priorities and needs of their local 
communities. The amount of the IHS budget that is administered directly 
by Tribes through Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act contracts and compacts has grown over time, with over 60 percent of 
IHS funding currently administered directly by Tribes. Tribes design 
and manage the delivery of individual and community health services 
through 22 hospitals, 330 health centers, 559 ambulatory clinics, 76 
health stations, 146 Alaska village clinics, and 7 school health 
centers across Indian Country. In recognition of this, the Budget 
proposes to reclassify these costs to a mandatory indefinite 
appropriation with estimated funding levels of $1.2 billion for 
Contract Support Costs and $153 million for Section 105(l) Lease 
Agreements in FY 2024. The Budget maintains indefinite mandatory 
funding for these accounts across the 10-year budget window to ensure 
these payments to ISDEAA contractors and compactors are fully funded.
          covid-19 response and future emergency preparedness
    Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the IHS has made incredible 
achievements to save lives and improve the health of AI/ANs across the 
Nation. The IHS has worked closely with our Tribal and Urban Indian 
Organization partners, State and local public health officials, and our 
fellow Federal agencies to coordinate a comprehensive public health 
response to the pandemic. Our number one priority has been the safety 
of our IHS patients and staff, as well as Tribal community members.
    COVID-19 has disproportionally impacted AI/ANs. Deficiencies in 
public health infrastructure exacerbated the impact of COVID-19 on AI/
ANs. To address the long-term impacts of COVID-19, in FY 2025 the 
Budget provides a +$130 million mandatory funding increase to support 
IHS patients in recovery from the long-lasting effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic, including treatment for long haul COVID-19. Based on data 
from 14 States, age-adjusted COVID-19 associated mortality among AI/AN 
was 1.8 times that of non-Hispanic Whites. In 23 States with adequate 
race and ethnicity data, the cumulative incidence of laboratory-
confirmed COVID-19 among AI/AN was 3.5 times that of non-Hispanic 
Whites. COVID-19 hospitalizations and mortality rates among AI/AN were 
2.7 and 1.4 times those among White persons, respectively.
    The Budget also establishes a new dedicated funding stream within 
the mandatory formula to address public health capacity and 
infrastructure needs in Indian Country. This funding will support an 
innovative hub-and-spoke model to address local public health needs in 
partnership with Tribes and urban Indian organizations. Establishing a 
new program to build public health capacity is a key lesson learned 
from the COVID-19 pandemic, and a top recommendation shared by Tribal 
leaders in consultation with HHS. This includes $150 million in FY 
2025, and would grow in the out-years under the formula, for a total of 
$500 million over the ten-year window. Additional resources are 
necessary to develop appropriate public health and emergency 
preparedness capacity in AI/AN communities to prevent these 
disproportionate impacts in the future. As of 2021, only four Tribal 
public health agencies are accredited through the Public Health 
Accreditation Board. Comparatively, 40 State and 305 local public 
health agencies were accredited as of 2021.\9\

                                closing
    The FY 2024 Budget makes bold strides toward the goal of ensuring 
stable and predictable funding to improve the overall health status of 
AI/AN communities. The Budget is a historic step and the start of an 
ongoing conversation with Tribes to ensure the IHS system is meeting 
the healthcare needs in Indian Country. HHS looks forward to working in 
consultation with Tribes, urban Indian organizations, and Congress to 
refine this proposal through the legislative process to strengthen the 
Nation-to-Nation relationship.

    Senator Merkley. Well, thank you very much. And we will 
submit your full testimony for the record, if that is fine for 
both of you. Great. Without objection.

                   FUNDING FLAT WITH FISCAL YEAR 2022

    So the House Republican budget, as mentioned by Chair 
Murray, essentially freezes funding to the fiscal year 2022 
level which seems entirely at odds with the bipartisan support 
for Tribal programs.
    Director Tso, can you give us a sense of what would be the 
biggest impact on Tribal health if that was to occur?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, for that question Chairman. So any 
reduction in health care resources to Indian Country would be 
devastating. We know that already today there is a severe 
impact on our Tribal communities as we have already noted 
earlier, the impacts of not only the ongoing COVID-19, and the 
subsequent services that will be required for long-term--Long 
COVID, and moreover the opioid issues, the mental health issues 
that are huge within Indian Country.
    At this time, right now, we are already at close to 40 
percent vacancy rates from mental health support throughout the 
Indian Health Service. That is just trying to meet the mental 
health care needs of Indian Country is desperately needed, and 
that any resources or any cuts to the Indian Health Service 
would just further devastate our situation in Indian Country.
    Senator Merkley. I was really struck, in your written 
testimony, where you mentioned in your oral testimony the 10.9 
years life expectancy lower than the general average in 
America. But then you go on to list many of those areas, 
including much higher rates of many forms of cancer. Anyway 
there is a lot of work to be done there. And I do not want to 
see us moving backwards.

                     CSC AND 105L LEASES--MANDATORY

    One of the initiatives is to reclassify contract support 
costs, and 105(l) building leases as mandatory funding. Now, 
that is kind of hard to remember, what are these contract 
support costs, and building leases, and why are they mandatory, 
and what are the core issues behind them? In fact, two cases 
have affirmed the Federal Government is required to reimburse 
Tribes for these costs.
    So I have been referring to them as Tribal Sovereignty 
Payments because that is easy to understand, to encapsulate 
those terms, and it is a much clearer description of what these 
costs are, that the cost the Federal Government must pay the 
Tribes when they exercise their sovereignty to run their own 
programs.
    So can you tell us how important these payments are to 
Tribes who choose the self-government options? And the 
importance of making these Tribal sovereignty payments 
mandatory?
    Ms. Tso. Yes. Thank you for that. In 2016, when we first 
dealt with the Supreme Court's decision to reimburse Tribes, 
this was an area that I led for the Indian Health Service, and 
very important. We know that about 60 to 70 percent of the 
Indian Health Service has been contracted, or compacted. by 
Tribes throughout the country.
    That being said, they absolutely rely on contract support 
costs to continue to operate, and cover the administrative 
costs that were not transferred to them by the Federal 
Government, and for them to continue to comply with rules and 
regulations that we all do in the health care arena. So we know 
how important that is for every contractor to make sure that 
they have those resources as immediately as possible.
    It is complicated to get to the number that we can all 
agree on, but certainly every effort has been made to make sure 
that we do that. It is the same for 105(l) lease, these are 
lease authorities that are provided to the Indian Health 
Service, that we can, again, reimburse Tribes for their costs 
when they construct and own their own facilities there is a 
cost to running and operating those facilities, and that is the 
105(l) lease reimbursement that Indian Health Service has.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. I am going to be pretty strict 
about us sticking to our time limits. And I now have 45 seconds 
left. So Assistant Secretary Newland, can you describe how your 
budget supports the ongoing efforts to reform Tribal jails; in 
37 seconds?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, we are 
requesting not only increased operation and maintenance costs 
for our BIA detention centers, but also replacement 
construction dollars increase as well. As I think it has been 
well documented, our jails across the BIA system are in poor 
condition, and we have also come up with an ability to rank 
them to prioritize which ones should be replaced, but we need 
the dollars to do that to make sure the people in our care and 
custody get the treatment they are entitled to.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And I know there has been a 
fair much amount of attention to the deaths, and the 
conditions, and it needs attention. And feel free to follow up 
later.

                          CSC AND 105L LEASES

    And let me turn this over to Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to 
focus my first round of questions on contract support costs, 
and the 105[l]s. You know, when you are trying to look at this 
through the appropriators' eyes and see the ever escalating 
costs that we are dealing with, I think it is important that we 
try, as best we can, to get a handle on this.
    This is a question to both of you perhaps, but do the 
contract support costs and the 105(l) lease payments have 
statutory, regulatory, and court citations which define and 
quantify exactly what these costs are; does that exist out 
there; Assistant Secretary?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Ranking Member Murkowski. I can't 
give you a specific citation in this hearing, would be happy to 
follow up. We do know that those costs are mandated by law. And 
I can add that over the last five fiscal years at Indian 
Affairs, we have gone from zero 105(l) leases, to this year 
where we expect to hit nearly 300.
    Senator Murkowski. Right.
    Mr. Newland. And we see continued growth in that. And so 
when we have got these obligations by law to provide this level 
of funding, and an exponential growth in the number of 
requests, we are going to see--without a mandatory 
reclassification, we are going to see these funds crowd out the 
rest of the program dollars in the----
    Senator Murkowski. No. I understand, and I am equally 
concerned, know that. What I am trying to drill down though, is 
whether or not there is legally defined reference definitions. 
If you can provide the committee that information, I think it 
would be helpful.
    And Mr. Chairman, I am asking for this because we are 
acknowledging, these are complicated things here, and I don't 
think that we can ignore the terms that are rooted in the 
statute, in the regulations, and what the court refers to. So 
as we are looking to reclassify these, I would simply urge the 
subcommittee here to utilize the terminology that is founded in 
the law, and the regs. I understand the desire to try to 
identify something for simplicity, but this is something I 
don't want to spend a lot of time on it, but I do want to try 
to get that that certainty there definitionally.
    We recognize that in the Maniilaq decision back in 2016, 
which established the 105(l) leasing mandates that we have seen 
agencies take a widely differing approach on how to structure 
the payments. And so because of this general provision has been 
included directing both IHS and Interior to begin this process 
to establish these guidelines regarding the parameters here.

                              105L LEASES

    Can you give me a status update on what is being done at 
Interior, at IHS, to accomplish this legal requirement? And are 
there any regulatory changes that we may see coming from this? 
How do you see this shaping up?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. Our teams, at both Indian 
Affairs and Indian Health Service, have had a lot of 
conversations with one another to make sure that we are synced 
up between our agencies on the 105(l) Leasing Program, and that 
there is consistency, more consistency between our agencies, on 
how we meet these obligations.
    And we have also, through our budgeting process, been 
hearing from Tribes about how to make sure we are meeting our 
obligations, and we are looking at a number of ways to make 
sure that we are speaking with clarity about how we meet these 
obligations.

                          OMB VS. CBO SCORCES

    Senator Murkowski. So let me ask then, because it is my 
understanding that we have seen a difference in how OMB and CBO 
interpret and score the contract support costs on the 105[l]s. 
Do we know why we are seeing this, why the costs vary between 
the two scoring agencies, and what do we do about it? It is one 
thing to have alignment within the agencies, but if you have 
got different entities that are scoring things differently, are 
we trying to grapple with that one as well; Director Tso?
    Ms. Tso. Yes, thank you. For the Indian Health Service we 
have done two things. One, we are moving the 105(l) lease to be 
a more centralized program, to make sure again, that we have 
that oversight. With regard to the scoring though, we recognize 
that difference as well, and we are looking to schedule to 
coordinate, and make sure that what the scoring that is coming 
out of the CBO, and what we are doing is more aligned as we 
move forward.
    Senator Murkowski. I hope we are able to reconcile that. 
Let us know if we can be helpful. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Well, thank you.
    Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary 
Newland, thanks to the STOP Act that was signed by President 
Biden into law in December, it is finally illegal to export 
objects of patrimony, sacred Tribal items for sale in foreign 
markets. And these are items that have been, obviously, illegal 
to sell here in the United States for decades. But until 
December, sellers could take them out of the country, and sell 
them overseas in auction houses, with very little recourse.
    Senator Murkowski and I worked together for years to pass 
this legislation. Now, we need to make sure it is implemented 
well. What are the plans to implement the STOP Act and ensure 
that these illegal exports are finally prevented, in a systemic 
way?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. We have begun the 
consultation process required by the Act, and we have been 
thinking through the budgetary impacts as well, because of some 
of the parallels with the Department's Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation (NAGPRA) Programs and in the 
similar type of work. You know, we estimate that that would 
probably be the same budget impact on the Department's budget, 
around $3 million, to get implemented, that estimate came after 
the budget was released, but that is our best estimate right 
now based on the work. And I believe we will know more after 
Tribal consultation. And we are going to continue to refine 
that.

                GALLUP INDIAN MEDICAL CENTER REPLACEMENT

    Senator Heinrich. Thank you. Director Tso, as you know from 
our visit last June, and your previous role as the Navajo area 
IHS Director, the Gallup Indian Medical Center is in utter 
disrepair, needs to be replaced. Everyone agrees on that. I 
know that IHS has been working with the Navajo Nation for the 
past several decades now, to settle on a site to replace GIMC. 
I understand there have recently been productive conversations 
with Navajo Nation President, Buu Nygren, about finalizing that 
site selection. Can you just update us on when you expect a 
final site to be selected?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you for that question. Yes. I have already 
met with President Nygren on this particular issue and asked to 
make sure that we continue to have updates. We are scheduling 
another update with him, just to make sure, again, that they 
fully understand, we all fully understand how important it is 
to make that final selection. The IHS will still go with the 
Rehoboth site at this point, but looking at also what we can 
finalize regarding the Gamerco site, of course those two are 
the sites that we will continue to work with Navajo Nation on.
    It is my hope that within the next 60 to 90 days, that we 
will have a final site selection determined for this, because 
we need to have that completed.
    Senator Heinrich. So you are looking at both sites, and you 
think that 90 days from now you will have settled on one?
    Ms. Tso. IHS has already concluded that the Rehoboth site 
is the site. The conversation that we were having with then 
President Nez, and now President Nygren, is their preference in 
where that is at, and so I am hoping that we can tighten that 
up here pretty quickly. And that will help us take the next 
step of the planning efforts for Gallup.
    Senator Heinrich. And you need to settle on that site 
before any planning and design can start?
    Ms. Tso. It is certainly going to be more helpful, because 
we know we might have some site--or some limited space in 
Rehoboth, and Gamerco might give us a little bit more options, 
if that is the way we go.

                           CASEWORK RESPONSE

    Senator Heinrich. Okay. One of the most important jobs I 
have is just helping constituents when they are having trouble 
with a Federal agency. And my casework team has experienced 
just really extended delays when it comes to casework with IHS. 
There have been some cases that have taken nearly 15 months to 
resolve. What is the cause behind these kinds of delays? And 
what can we do to better resolve constituent cases? What can 
Congress do to make sure we are supporting you so that we can 
iterate on these constituent cases much more quickly?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Senator. I cannot, unfortunately, speak 
to the 15 months, but I can speak to what we have done in the 
last 6 months. And just, as of this morning, I asked again if 
we have responded to all of the questions that are in front of 
us from any congressional or constituent questions. This is 
very important to me that IHS continue to do a better job in 
responding to any correspondence, or any questions that come 
for Indian Health.
    And so in that, as part of building out efficiencies at the 
IHS, we can now quantify and qualify everywhere every 
document--all of our documents are at in the process.
    Senator Heinrich. Okay. Thank you.

                   WATER INFRASTRUCTURE/WARM SPRINGS

    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much.
    Director Tso, significant funds were allocated to improve 
water structure, water infrastructure at Tribal communities 
across the country, and certainly the Confederated Tribes of 
the Warm Springs in Oregon is one of those sites where the 
water system has to be completely replaced. And I wanted to--
well, one, I am very appreciative that the funds have been 
allocated both through the EPA and IHS. But any updates on how 
that is proceeding forward.
    Ms. Tso. Yes. Thank you. For all of the $3.5 billion that 
Indian Health Service received, we have posted earlier in April 
on our IHS website, an interactive map that allows you to 
evaluate where every project is at in the Indian Health Service 
allocation of those $3.5 billion that we have.
    It is important again that we be accountable. It is 
important again that we be transparent. And that Tribal 
leaders, and even homeowners for that matter, can see where 
their project is in the pipeline. That is the same for the Warm 
Springs Water Infrastructure issue.
    I was out there shortly after I was confirmed, and it was a 
very difficult situation to see. But we have now secured those 
resources, and I expect that, I believe as early as today that 
the next agreement will be signed and we will move to the next 
phase.
    Senator Merkley. Great. I am glad to hear that, because the 
great fear is that if the gears don't turn fast enough, the 
construction crossing increase, and then it turns out that we 
don't have the money for it, enough to complete the vision, and 
other things slow it down. It is just like, please, any extra 
attention you can give to that Warm Springs project will be 
much, much appreciated.

                      COMMUNITY HEALTH AID PROGRAM

    I also want to turn to the Community Health Aid Program, a 
program that we are looking at in your proposal to expand to 
the Lower 48 states. My colleague from Alaska, undoubtedly, has 
a sense of how that has been working in Alaska, but I do know 
that in Oregon in many states of the Lower 48, a huge shortage 
of health care workers.
    So could you elaborate on how this proposed expansion would 
work? And how this money will really, like, make that happen?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Chairman. So just coming off of a visit 
to Alaska, I was out there for the last seven days, and I will 
tell you that there is nothing more that can put the CHAP 
Program into perspective other than being on the ground. To 
totally appreciate and understand the absolute remote locations 
that you can only get to by air in many instances, to get to 
the services that people need, is just crucial. And that is 
where the Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) is just 
impressive.
    And I was able to meet with many of the Tribal leaders, and 
actually see for myself, and visit with the actual CHAP 
coordinators, and CHAP professionals out there, to really see 
how important that is.
    Within the last month, I have proceeded to move forward on 
the Portland area, which is of course, Washington, Oregon, 
Idaho, with them, and providing them the ability to proceed on 
them. They were already--as I visited in Oregon as well--saw 
what they were doing on the DHAT site, which is the dental 
Program site, and how important that is.
    As I mentioned earlier, with regards to the challenges that 
we are having in mental health, that they are not, just like 
nurses and doctors, they are not out there, and we are going to 
have to really lean on the CHAP Program that was built out of 
Alaska to make sure that we are going to meet the needs of 
Indian Country.
    There is no other option for us at this point. So as we 
continue to move forward, CHAP Program is a priority at the 
Indian Health Service, in getting that program stood up at the 
national level so we can continue to do what we do.
    What I am doing right now, though, is working with the 
Alaska Tribal organizations up there, to help us stand up our 
program nationally, so we don't have to reinvent right now, 
that we don't delay anything as we move forward. I further 
anticipate that we will be moving out in, not just the Portland 
area, but also in the Billings area, because I believe that 
they are next ready to go with that. So we are proceeding, and 
wanting to spread this across Indian Country.
    Senator Merkley. Great. Thank you.
    Secretary Newland, many of our Tribes that were eligible 
for support for the Criminal Justice systems are not included, 
and we had $7 million in fiscal year 2023 to identify and bring 
some Tribes in Indian Country into startup funding for 
participation; I have received outreach from the Cow Creek, the 
Confederate Tribes of the Grand Ronde, the Klamath Tribes, the 
Confederate Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw in 
Oregon, and sent you a letter asking that these Tribes be 
included in the Tribal consultation process.
    Any update? And will you meet with these Tribes and 
identify where they stand on their effort to be included in the 
program?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy to 
meet with them. I received those letters as well, and we 
generally keep an open door for Tribal leaders, and look 
forward to setting those meetings up.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And I hope the results of those 
meetings will be that these Tribes that haven't been able to 
participate in the program, will be able to get their feet on 
the ground, and get started. Thank you.
    Senator Murkowski. Mr. Chairman, it is good to hear the 
Director speak so highly of the CHAP Program and the benefit 
that it can provide, not only within the state, but what we 
have developed and shared, I would encourage members of the 
subcommittee to take a look at that program. And perhaps if we 
do a trip up North we will definitely have an opportunity to 
look further, not only to the CHAPS Program, but the DHAT 
Program, where Alaska has really led as a model there.

                         CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS

    Director Tso, I want to go back again to contract support 
costs. And this is something that we discussed last year in the 
subcommittee with the Acting Director at the time, Director 
Fowler, and we were told then that IHS would maintain current 
methods for calculating contract support costs, there was no 
plan to change any of those. But we have seen some recent court 
cases, and some agency actions since that time. And I just want 
to know whether or not that statement still holds true, or 
whether IHS has changed any of the calculations on what is 
considered eligible?
    As you know, the Fort Defiance case in the Cook Inlet 
Tribal Council scared a lot of folks out there, in terms of 
being able to rely. So can you tell me, are we still in a good 
place as was stated before the committee last year?
    Ms. Tso. Yes. Thank you. So with respect to contract 
support costs, what we have done is, again, used the--it is 
really and truly, a negotiation between the Tribe and the 
Indian Health Service. And we have moved that whole program 
again, out of where it was at in IHS, and moved it on--and 
actually into Jillian's program here.
    I want to have close direct oversight over that program. So 
two things, while we have not changed our calculations, I have 
directed our team to make sure that we get to the table with 
Tribes, and being able to use the maximum flexibility of how we 
can get to ``yes'' with Tribes. And so that is what I am 
seeing, and I am hoping that, as we move forward, we will 
continue to do that for our Tribes.
    During the COVID pandemic, and as I was out in my previous 
role, I absolutely appreciate how important those monies are to 
make sure that they support Indian Country, and particularly 
Tribes that contract and compact. With the increase in costs 
across everything, whether it was nurses and doctor contracts, 
or supplies, there is a cost to doing business, and that is 
what that has to cover.
    And so maximizing and bringing flexibility to how we 
interpret the rules and the regulations is what is critical 
right now, and particularly we are moving.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, I really appreciate you saying 
that, because that is what folks are relying on. It is that 
stability and that clarity. We had heard that there were some 
pending court cases regarding contract support costs, and 
third-party billing that could have impact on CSC funding. Can 
you elaborate for the committee, what you are hearing, and what 
the potential impact might be? I don't want you to be too 
speculative, because we don't have a lot of time, and I want to 
move to a couple other issues here. But are you hearing the 
same thing?
    Ms. Tso. Yes. We are hearing the same thing, and I have 
already set up a team internally to start looking at how we 
might address that, when and if that decision comes down.

                         MANDATORY FUNDING IHS

    Senator Murkowski. Good. Appreciate that. In my opening I 
mentioned my support of advance approps, where we are right 
now, though, again we are talking about a proposal to move the 
entire agency to mandatory funding, yet there is no legislative 
proposal to shift this mandatory appropriations in the budget 
proposal. So are you anticipating transmitting authorization 
language for the proposed shift? Have you identified how you 
intend to pay for this shift to the mandatory side?
    Ms. Curtis. Thank you, Senator Murkowski, for that, that 
important question. We are working as a Department with OMB on 
Tribal consultation that will take place in early June, on the 
mandatory proposal. And we are hoping that through that 
process, and the dialogue with Tribes, it will better inform a 
potential legislative package. And of course we want to keep 
the dialogue open with the authorizers in Congress, as well as 
our Appropriations partners, to inform what that package might 
also look like, so we are looking to take a collaborative 
approach on developing that language.
    Senator Murkowski. But at this point in time you are not 
prepared to transmit any authorizing language, it doesn't sound 
like?
    Ms. Curtis. Not at this time. No.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. All right. I am three seconds from 
my time, so I will defer to the Chairman, here.
    Senator Merkley. Both of us have a great interest in these 
programs. We have a lot of Tribes in both of our states, and a 
lot of work to be done on many fronts. We talked previously 
about the CHAPS Program, certainly nurses is another challenge.

                      NURSE PRECEPTORSHIP PROGRAM

    And Director Tso, in your budget you propose $1 million to 
create a new nurse preceptorship program, to provide training, 
development, on-the-job support, and the term in the 
description, is to improve replacement rates, but I kind of 
from the context I think maybe ``replacement'', but also 
``retention'' of nurses. And do you have a high loss of nurses 
in their initial years, year two of work? And of course I know 
you have a big deficit of many openings so how would this Nurse 
Preceptorship Program change, either attracting nurses or 
retaining nurses?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Chairman. So two things that that I 
would point to; number one, we were already at a deficit of 
nurses before the pandemic, and then we are now where we are 
with loss of additional staff. Not only that, as we talked 
about yesterday, we have the Baby Boomers that are now going to 
opt out of the workforce, and they are really trying to 
replenish that.
    So we want to be able to use these resources that we have 
asked for, to make sure that we build a solid retention 
program, as well as training that is needed. In many instances, 
there is times when we have staff that come to us, with not a 
whole--maybe coming right out of school, and that 
preceptorship, that training is absolutely important to get 
them integrated into the health care facility, understanding 
how the system works, and those things, and so. And that is 
part of retention, because if we just throw people into a job, 
we are likely not going to keep them if we treat them that way.
    So really looking at that front end: What can we do; how 
can we do this; to make sure that we meet the--our needs as 
well as applicants' needs.
    Senator Merkley. You know, my wife is a nurse, and I recall 
how different it is to go from the school setting to actually 
being full-time on the job. And I think this is particularly 
challenging in Tribal settings where people may be more remote, 
have fewer folks nearby to assist. And so I look forward to 
learning more about that.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, I want to turn to the issue of 
land acquisition for landless and land-limited Tribes. You have 
a proposal for $12 million for a Tribal Land, Water 
Conservation Fund, and Indian Land Consolidation Fund. And 
assuming this would come from the general Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF), but you can expand on that.
    And your budget states factors other than conservation need 
to be considered for Tribes to grow their land base. So can you 
expand on what it means for a tribe to be land limited? Who 
exactly would be eligible for this funding? And, for example, 
would terminated Tribes who are ultimately restored with less 
land than they began, be at the top of the list, and so forth? 
What is the broader vision for this?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Chairman. So with respect to the 
General Land Acquisition Authority, when Congress enacted the 
Indian Reorganization Act, nearly a century ago now, it 
authorized the Secretary of the Interior to directly acquire 
land for Tribes, and included an appropriation for that. And 
that appropriation has--authorization, excuse me, has remained 
the same ever since.
    I think it is $2 million? It is $2 million in 1934. And so 
we have requested an increase in that, and the ability to make 
good on that commitment from the United States, in the Indian 
Reorganization Act, to assist Tribes in reestablishing a 
homeland, particularly for Tribes that don't have any land. 
Often the first Trust acquisition is the most difficult and the 
most expensive, and then assisting other Tribes that have very 
limited land base.
    So our vision for that is to assist those Tribes that are 
federally recognized but don't yet have any land base for 
simple things, like government administration, public safety, 
basic housing for their Tribal members, and establish that 
initial land base.
    Senator Merkley. So do you envision then setting out a set 
of priorities would help you sort through the applications to 
determine kind of who is at the top of the list?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are actually 
engaged in consultation with Tribes right now on the best way 
to implement that program, but we want to make sure that there 
are some guidelines or standards in how we go about 
implementing that.

                         LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM

    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And Director Tso, you propose 
to expand loan repayment programs to help retain personnel. And 
last year the IHS Acting Director Fowler testified that loan 
repayment was the most effective tool IHS has in recruiting. Do 
you have any stats now that kind of show how much impact that 
the loan repayment program has had, and really help us 
understand if, indeed, this is the most effective instrument?
    Ms. Tso. Senator we will circle back to you with respect to 
that. But I will add one other part to that. We have also 
advocated that, or shared that while we do have this loan 
program, there is a tax to this loan program. And so therefore, 
potential applicants that come to Indian Health Service that 
could benefit from this are also taxed on these dollars that 
they have.
    This is, unlike what Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) provides, the same kind of loan program, 
but their resources are not taxed, so we are looking for some 
equity there. Thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Amen to that. And I have a bill to change 
that, so Thank you, for drawing attention and spotlighting that 
issue.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. I am going to turn to you, 
Assistant Secretary. I have been talking to the Director here 
most of the morning. As you well know we have a public safety 
issue in the State of Alaska, some have described it as a 
crisis. Certainly, former Attorney General Barr recognized a 
state of public emergency, with our public safety.
    We have more than 100 Tribes that have no law enforcement 
presence whatsoever, and because of their remoteness oftentimes 
you can have a situation where it takes more than just hours, 
but days for law enforcement to be able to get to the Village 
to address sometimes very violent felonies. I know you are 
aware of these law enforcement challenges, but can you share 
with the subcommittee how much funding is being devoted to the 
PL280 States for law enforcement, where that funding is coming 
from?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. I was actually in 
Anchorage a week before last at the Not Invisible Act 
Commission hearings. And I spent two days hearing from 
community members across Alaska, just about the most heart-
wrenching stories that really flow out of this crisis, and it 
impressed upon all of us the urgency to act, and how dire this 
is in many communities.
    And I was glad to be able to hear those stories directly. 
In our budget we are requesting; it is $21 million for Tribal 
courts in Public Law 280 states. And, you know, the Tribal 
courts play an important role in public safety, not only on the 
backend, but on the frontend, when we were talking about some 
of the family law cases, the wellness courts were also working 
to fund three wellness courts this year, in Alaska.
    I was a wellness court--I was a Tribal court judge before 
serving in this role, and we established a wellness court, and 
I have seen, firsthand, the difference that that can make in 
keeping folks from coming back into Tribal court over and over, 
and really intervening before, you know, somebody's substance 
abuse or mental health issues grow into more serious crimes, 
and violent crimes. And so we are trying to fund that on the 
front end.
    With respect to the number of dollars that we are 
requesting for police in Public Law 280 states, I am actually 
going to ask my Deputy Assistant Secretary, Jason Freihage to--
--
    Senator Murkowski. Well, maybe what we can do, is we can we 
can get that from you after the hearing. You mentioned being 
there in Alaska for some of the hearings and discussions on 
murdered and missing. I am glad that you were there. I am glad 
you heard it directly. I am glad that you were impacted by it.
    But I am somewhat confused then, as we look at the 
President's budget for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women 
(MMIW) activities, I am rarely seeing enacted levels here. And 
you have certainly seen it from the Alaska perspective, it is 
not just Alaska. The Chairman comes from the State of 
Washington that has also identified significant levels, of 
Murdered, Missing, and Indigenous Women, what is the rationale 
between--with just enacted levels when it comes to MMIW across 
the country?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. So the Missing and 
Murdered Unit, which I believe is what you are referencing.
    Senator Murkowski. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Newland. Is even with last year, we are still in the 
process of building out that unit, we are funded right now for, 
I believe, up to 63 positions, and we have been able to fill, 
now, more than half of those, and continue to build that out, 
and when we do we will have staffing.
    But overall, across the BIA law enforcement funding, just 
on the policing side, we are asking for an increase in funding. 
And then outside of the budget, on the management side, we are 
doing more to coordinate with other agencies through the 
Missing and Murdered Unit. So I just want to make sure I am not 
a misleading folks that this isn't a priority, because it is 
for us, we want to make sure we build out the unit that we have 
established under the Secretary's leadership, staff it up.
    That unit then coordinates amongst our BIA law enforcement, 
Tribal law enforcement, as well as state and local agencies, 
and other Federal agencies, like the FBI. And so the funding 
level is not a reflection that it is not a growing priority. We 
believe we have got the funding at $16.5 million to staff up 
that unit. And it has already been productive. It has 
investigated, it just in the last 2 years, more than 700 cases, 
resolved, I believe, more than 200 missing persons cases, and 
solved eight murders.
    And so we believe that that Missing and Murdered Unit is 
effective, the funding reflects that. And we are going to 
continue on the management side to build it up.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, we have got a hearing this 
afternoon before the CJS Subcommittee, so we will have the FBI, 
DEA, in front of us so this will be a follow-on question to 
them as well, in terms of what more we need to be doing to 
address these issues. I know that the Senator from Montana 
feels strongly about it as well. There are many of us. So thank 
you for that.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, and now we will turn to Senator 
Peters from Michigan.
    Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was pleased that 
President Biden's budget request would provide funds for 
existing Indian land and water claim settlements, including via 
the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund.
    The Biden-Harris administration has certainly maintained a 
solid commitment to reaching settlements to resolve Tribal land 
and water claims, and to ensure the Tribes, as well as 
individual Indians have rightful ownership of land, and rights 
to water to meet domestic, economic, cultural, and ecological 
needs.
    So my question is for you, Secretary Newland. As you know, 
I have introduced a bill, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community 
Land Claim Settlement Act, and this bipartisan, bicameral, and 
long overdue legislation will address the long-standing land 
claims of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, while also 
clearing the title of current land holders in the community.
    So Assistant Secretary Newland, what land claim settlements 
does your fiscal year 2024 budget propose to fund, and beyond 
what does--this year budget funds, does the Department have a 
backlog of outstanding land claims settlements owed to Tribes?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. Right now, our budget is 
proposing to fund one settlement administrative costs under the 
White Earth Land Claims Settlement. I am not aware of a backlog 
of land claims that are due, Department funding, I would be 
happy to follow up, but that is my understanding of our budget; 
so just the White Earth Land Claim Settlement is included in 
our budget requests.
    Senator Peters. Well, good. It sounds like the Bureau may 
be very well positioned to carry out my bill once it is passed, 
and I certainly look forward to working with you in the coming 
weeks to enact this legislation, and to do what is right there.
    Another question for you, sir; is I am proud that Michigan 
is the home to over 50,000 Native people and 12 federally 
recognized Tribal Nations. In our state and across the country, 
Native communities and Tribes have preserved vibrant and 
diverse culture, safeguarding land, language, spirit, 
knowledge, and tradition across many generations. 
Unfortunately, Tribal communities have not been immune to the 
opioid epidemic impacting individuals, families, and 
communities, nationwide. And in many cases Tribal communities 
have been hit, particularly, hard by this crisis.
    The Tribes of Michigan are working hard to address the 
opioid and substance abuse crisis; however, I have heard from 
Tribal leaders in my home State of Michigan that they need more 
resources, and specifically more flexibility in funding for 
treatment facilities.
    So my question for you is: How specifically does your 
fiscal year 2024 budget help communities in Indian Country 
battle of the opioid crisis?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. I would imagine it is fair 
to say there are a few people in this room who haven't been 
touched, personally, by the opioid epidemic and addiction. And 
I am very well aware of how serious this is in all Tribal 
communities, particularly my own back in Michigan. Our budget 
request includes $15 million for drug enforcement activities 
within the BIA's law enforcement system. It also includes an 
additional a little more than $3 million for the establishment 
of Tribal wellness courts which, again, I just mentioned I have 
seen firsthand how valuable those are in coordinating 
wraparound services at the Tribal level.
    And it also includes a significant increase in our budget 
request for the Tiwahe Initiative which started out as a pilot 
project across Indian Country. And under that initiative Tribes 
are able to use culturally based, rather than simply evidence-
based models to address things like family crises, drug 
addiction, mental health issues. And design those programs the 
way that are the most effective to solve their unique issues on 
the ground.
    And this budget request would allow us to expand that 
initiative to ten new sites across Indian Country. And so we 
believe that, on the whole, when you combine the law 
enforcement funding, the social services funding, with the 
Tiwahe Initiative and the Tribal Courts Funding, that what we 
are aiming to do, is try to address things like this epidemic, 
and substance abuse, generally, at all levels.
    Senator Peters. Assistant Secretary Newland, thank you for 
your continued leadership on this issue, and so many.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Merkley. I anticipate that Senator Tester will be 
joining us in just a moment. But I will seize the opportunity 
to fill in the space.
    The Secretary of Interior has really emphasized an 
initiative to develop full history of our boarding schools, I 
have been very struck this past year about work that is being 
done by the Congressional Executive Commission on China, on the 
very abusive practices that are being used at boarding schools 
in Tibet, where the Chinese Government is trying to separate 
children from their natural cultural history, and take them 
away from their families.
    We have our own very problematic history regarding boarding 
schools. How is that work on this set of histories, or 
histories of various schools, and various efforts, coming 
along?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is some of the 
most emotionally challenging, but yet rewarding work that I 
have engaged on in my life, under the Secretary's leadership.
    A year ago, I think a year ago tomorrow actually, we 
published the first report, comprehensive Federal Report on the 
Federal Government's operation of Indian boarding schools, and 
outlined the history of the policies that underlie that, and 
identified the names and locations of more than 400 schools.
    We have also, Secretary Haaland and I have gone to a number 
of Tribal communities over the last year, and heard from dozens 
and dozens of boarding school survivors, often in large venues 
where hundreds of people are present, and hearing their 
personal stories, of attending these schools, or their families 
attending these schools, and continued our research.
    We anticipate publishing a second volume of our Boarding 
School Initiative Report, that will outline, I think with more 
specificity, how many burial sites exist across these boarding 
school systems, where they are located, generally, trying to 
identify the total amount of funding and support that the 
Federal Government provided to the system, over its century-
and-a-half of use.
    And trying to fill in the picture of what the boarding 
school system was, and what its impact was; and also making 
sure that we are relaying the personal stories of the people 
who attended, as well as their families, in trying to better 
articulate the Legacy impacts that extend beyond generations 
across Indian Country. And so that work is continuing and, you 
know, we are trying to make sure that we are we are painting 
the full picture.
    Senator Merkley. I think it is an incredibly important 
investigation and report. We need to shine a light on the past 
in order to understand issues that may help us direct into the 
future. And thank you, for your work on that. And thank you, to 
the Secretary's initiative.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Assistant Secretary, we have had a conversation in other 
committees as well, about the budget proposal to shift the 
Office of Subsistence Management, OSM, from Fish and Wildlife 
to BIA. I have asked for a response in writing.
    But I am wondering whether or not the Department in Indian 
Affairs can achieve the goals that they are seeking, as 
outlined in the budget proposal, without moving the office from 
Fish and Wildlife to Indian Affairs; whether or not the goals 
that are sought here, and certainly the goals that I am hearing 
from Tribes in Alaskan Native leaders, whether or not we can do 
all this within the Federal Subsistence Management Program.
    So can you just share quickly with the committee here, why 
you feel it has to be moved to the Office of the Secretary? Why 
not the Solicitor's Office? Why not try to make it work within 
the existing structure?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. You know, just initially I 
think, as you are aware, no doubt, but we have heard 
consistently from Tribes across Alaska about -- whether they 
are on the North Slope or any--Southeast, and every everywhere 
in between, about the desire to move the Office of Subsistence 
Management out of the Fish and Wildlife Service. And that, of 
course, begged the question about: What is the appropriate 
home?
    And in those consultations, and in conversations that we 
have had with Tribal leaders and folks from across Alaska, you 
know, the driving concern behind that was a desire to better 
align the office of subsistence management with our Federal 
Trust responsibility to protect the way of life for Native 
people.
    And we have considered a number of options. Within our 
office the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, we operate a 
number of programs directly, which is unique within the 
Department, because not all of our programs are housed within 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the Bureau of Indian 
Education. So we have the Office of Self-Governance, for 
example, that reports directly to the Assistant Secretary, the 
Office of Indian Economic Development, and many other programs.
    And so we felt that, operationally, it made sense to house, 
if we were going to move the Office of Subsistence Management; 
operationally, it made sense to house it within the Office of 
the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, because of our 
experience running programs directly.
    That is not necessarily true of many other places at the 
Department of the Interior, and so we, of course, are well 
experienced at making sure that our programs are in sync with 
the Federal Government's Trust responsibility.
    Senator Murkowski. How do you respond, though, to just the 
reality that that the Alaska National Interest Lands 
Conservation Act (ANILCA) creates a rural priority for 
subsistence based on where one lives. And so I am sure you have 
heard concerns on the other side that this is not just about 
Alaska Native peoples, but it is rural subsistence users.
    So a follow-on question is, whether or not the Department 
has consulted with the ten RACs, the Regional Advisory 
Councils, on the proposed move? And on top of Tribal 
consultations, whether or not you have engaged other 
subsistence users, both Native and non-Native, regarding the 
proposal? What is the extent of outreach at this point?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. You know, our Tribal 
consultation obligation and mandate flows out of the unique 
trust obligation and I know you understand that.
    Senator Murkowski. Right.
    Mr. Newland. So it is different in nature the way we engage 
the public in other ways. I have participated in a number of 
RAC meetings since the announcement.
    Senator Murkowski. Yes.
    Mr. Newland. And expect that I will continue to do so, and 
we want to make sure that we are not hiding the ball from 
folks. And that we are hearing directly from folks. And I have 
heard some of those concerns. And if I can just add on, 
Senator, you know, I am aware that there are folks saying, why 
Indian Affairs, because Anoka is for all rural users.
    There isn't a neat or perfect home for a program like the 
Office of Subsistence Management. We are aware that Anoka also 
speaks directly to the rights of Alaska Natives to maintain 
their subsistence way of life, and with our general trust 
obligation. And we feel that with all things considered, 
particularly with what we have heard at the Department over the 
last decade, the call to move the Office of Subsistence 
Management, that this is the best structure to align all of the 
goals under Anoka.
    And we also feel that we can meet those legal commitments 
to non-Native rural users. We operate through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs a number of programs that directly benefit non-
Natives, across Indian Country, I think most notably, our 
irrigation program, most of our irrigation facilities, or many 
of our irrigation facilities serve mostly non-Native users. And 
so, you know, it is not a strange obligation for us. In Anoka, 
the statute says what it says, and we believe that we can 
fulfill those obligations.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, I appreciate that. Again, we 
certainly, I am certainly hearing from the Native leaders about 
the need to prioritize Tribal participation within the 
conservation of the Cooperative Management. We are hearing the 
same things, but we are also hearing the concerns from others. 
So it is good to hear you express this.
    I would hope that you would agree that this proposed move 
is a reorganization that is defined by the Committee's 
reprogramming guidelines, and so therefore would be subject to 
Appropriations' Committee approval. Concur?
    Mr. Newland. Yes.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member, I want to 
thank you for your patience. I appreciate the ability to ask a 
few questions, because this is important stuff.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, I want to thank you for coming 
out to Montana to meet with the Tribes and see the conditions 
that we are having with law enforcement there. And so I 
appreciate it. It is clear that we need more resources going on 
the ground, we need more police officers, we need more people, 
so can you tell me what the BIA has done since you are meeting 
with a Northern Cheyenne to improve officer recruitment; not 
only for that reservation, but for all of them?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. And I have enjoyed my 
trips out to Montana.
    Senator Tester. Yeah.
    Mr. Newland. In fact, I spoke with some of the Fort Peck 
Tribal leaders here, and expressed my desire to get up there, 
because I haven't been there. But related to law enforcement, 
we have made a selection for Chief of Police at Northern 
Cheyenne, and that person is expected to start next month.
    Senator Tester. Right.
    Mr. Newland. And we continue to work through some of the 
difficult issues directly with Northern Cheyenne. I know one of 
the related issues of staffing at the Rocky Mountain Regional 
Detention Facility.
    Senator Tester. Yeah.
    Mr. Newland. We have got offers out to ten people to come 
on board with us there, which would increase our staffing there 
by 50 percent.
    Senator Tester. Okay.
    Mr. Newland. And we have also set a hiring goal across BIA 
law enforcement for this fiscal year of 138 positions.
    Senator Tester. And the question becomes, how do you reach 
that goal?
    Mr. Newland. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Tester. And this is really important. You know, 
Northern Cheyenne may be the tip of the spear, but there are 
problems in every one. In fact, we got folks from Fort Peck 
here today, we appreciate them coming in. They will tell you it 
is the same stories you heard in Northern Cheyenne. Okay. So we 
just need more people.
    And so anything you can do, and if you need our help on how 
you get aggressive with hiring, don't be afraid to ask because 
I think this is really important.
    638 programs are pretty successful. Those are the ones, and 
correct if I am wrong, that are run by the tribe, correct?
    Mr. Newland. Yes.
    Senator Tester. Yes. The Federal Government, how do you--if 
a tribe decides to do their program on their own, how do they 
get their money? Is it based on per capita? Or how is it based?
    Mr. Newland. It is based on the level of services and 
funding that we would expend for providing those services.
    Senator Tester. Okay. So that is what I wanted to hear. So 
let me flesh that out a little bit. So let us say you spend 
$100,000 with a BIA providing law enforcement, if the Tribe 
takes over do they automatically get $100,000? Or do they get 
something less than that?
    Mr. Newland. The way the law is written, as I understand 
it, is we are supposed to negotiate with them for that amount, 
plus contract support costs.
    Senator Tester. Okay. So let us talk about on the ground. 
How does that translate--because you know where I am going with 
this?
    Mr. Newland. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Tester. I hear from Tribes that say: Hey, the BIA 
is spending a million bucks, and they think: We can run this 
same program for half that money. Are they lying to me, or are 
they telling me the truth?
    Mr. Newland. Senator it is a--somewhere--I am not saying 
anybody is lying to you.
    Senator Tester. That is good.
    Mr. Newland. But the reality of the way this works is that, 
with 638 contracts, it is our existing obligations across 
Indian Country, in determining secretarial amounts for Tribes 
that came in early affects our calculation.
    Senator Tester. So I would just say this. And I think this 
is on you, you are a good man in this job and I appreciate the 
work you do.
    Mr. Newland. Thank you.
    Senator Tester. But if you have got a tribe that is 
complaining about not have enough resources, at a bare minimum 
you should look and see what the BIA is spending before they 
took that contract over, add some inflation to it, because that 
has impacts, and get them the money.
    Mr. Newland. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Tester. Because you can't run a police department 
on air. It takes dollars, and it takes people, and people cost 
money. Thank you, for the work you do.
    Mr. Newland. Thank you.
    Senator Tester. Continue to stay on this. It is a huge 
issue.

                  VACANCIES/RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

    Director Tso, I have heard from Blackfeet Tribe in Montana 
their current vacancy rate at their local IHS facility, listen 
to this, 50 percent. They have got as many people gone as they 
have got working. And it could take--it could take a long time. 
I am not going to give you a time; it would take a long time to 
get folks on board.
    Is there anything that you are doing to expedite the hiring 
process? You know, Blackfeet is a challenge, but everywhere in 
the in the country, once again, Fort Peck is back there, they 
can tell you the same story there. What are we doing to 
expedite the hiring?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Senator; and good to see you again.
    Senator Tester. Good to see you.
    Ms. Tso. So a couple things that we are doing at the Indian 
Health Service; one I referenced earlier, the work plan that we 
have posted on the IHS website, and one of those areas that we 
are focusing in is on workforce, and trying to make sure that 
we are maximizing all of our resources to get the people that 
we need at the table.
    However, as you said, overall IHS has a 28 percent vacancy 
rate throughout every category of staff. 40 percent for mental 
health providers is also what we are looking at within that.
    Senator Tester. It is in a crisis. What I need to know from 
you, though, is we prioritize it, but what the hell does that 
mean? What are we doing to get people on board? And once again, 
not unlike law enforcement, if we need to be a help on this 
committee, tell us what we need to do so you can bring more 
people on to Indian Health?
    Ms. Tso. So we continue to strategize in terms of how we 
improve this, and that really is streamlining the onboarding 
process and the front line. At this point we are looking at 
every resource that we can, using social media, using the 
technology that we have to get information out there regarding 
the jobs that are open.
    We are also looking at housing subsidies to make sure, 
particularly in the Billings area, we have the housing 
subsidies that we need to try to attract people and be more 
comparable with the rates out there. We are also utilizing, for 
example, the $3.5 billion Infrastructure Bill monies. We are 
looking for 500 engineers.
    Senator Tester. Okay.
    Ms. Tso. So what we have done is centralize that hiring so 
we don't have 12 different regions trying to hire.
    Senator Tester. So if the holdup is you, we can help. If 
the holdup is some other agency, let us know. We have been down 
this road before. I don't need to give you the statistics on 
lifespan of Native Americans. It has more to do than just 
health care, but health care is pretty fundamental to that. 
Okay. So this is important.
    The last thing, and then I have just got to go--I mean, I 
have got to let you guys go.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, there is a Fort Belknap water 
settlement, the last one in Montana, that we dropped in--
hopefully it is dropped in by today, that we dropped in this 
week if it isn't. I need you to really pay some attention to 
that so we can get this thing done. Like I said, it is the last 
one in Montana, and we worked on a Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Bill to get some resources to get these projects done, we can 
get it done, but it is going to require you to be a tough 
negotiator, on your side, but a fair negotiator. Okay? Thank 
you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just one last; 
and I will give you the readout on the things that I would like 
you to take home for homework.

                          UNOBLIGATED BALANCES

    But I mentioned the unobligated balance. And Director, you 
and I have had a chance to talk about this. I thank you, for 
working to have the service meet the statutory requirement to 
provide the committee with these quarterly updates. I 
appreciate that. But our situation here is, at the end of 2022, 
the unobligated balance for IHS was $6 billion, $2 billion 
supplemental funds, with $4 billion in balances from 
discretionary.
    The recent report from March of this year shows $9.1 
billion in unobligated balance, and this amount seems to 
include both discretionary and supplemental funds from the last 
few years.
    So what I am what I am hoping to get from you, Director 
Tso, is to confirm the total IHS unobligated balances. What 
amount is from previous supplementals? What amount is from 
discretionary? And I will take that for the record here, 
because I think we need to look at these numbers? But one thing 
that I would ask you to provide is: Why IHS is reporting such 
large balances?
    This again, is something that you are working on, I know, I 
appreciate that, but we have got to look at it from our 
oversight perspective here, and try to understand what is going 
on. How this money is distributed and tracked, and really why 
the financial system is showing such large balances?
    So if you can get the specifics to the committee, I would 
appreciate that. I have a number of questions that I am going 
to be submitting as questions for the record. One relates to 
purchased and referred care. I was able to meet with Valerie 
Davidson, the Head of ANTHC, I am sure when you were up in the 
state she raised the issue about when payments are--when 
patients are receiving care authorized under the PRC Program, 
you have got these authorizations for travel, this is a real 
problem. I would like you to address that.
    I also have several questions related to facilities 
constructions for annual sanitation funding, certified 
operators, housing, what types of housing IHS is able to 
provide for, whether it is patient housing? Do you need greater 
authorization, more money? I am going to have one on electronic 
health records, ARPA funding for BIE schools and whether or not 
Alaska is eligible for anything there.
    And Assistant Secretary, the Director doesn't get all the 
homework. You mentioned in your opening comments the Tiwahe 
Initiative. And we are in year eight of a five-year pilot, I 
would like some additional information on the Tiwahe, and where 
we are. Also on Small and Needy Tribes, it is a--that is an 
account that I pay very close attention to. So you will be 
seeing those as QFRs, as I am sure you will be seeing questions 
from other members of the committee. But thank you, for the 
time that you have given us.
    And Mr. Chairman, thank you for the latitude in asking so 
many questions today, but there is a lot out there. Thank you.

                    ADDITIONAL COMMITTTEE QUESTIONS

    Senator Merkley. There are indeed. And speaking of 
questions for the record; the hearing record will be open until 
the close of business on May 24th, this year. Thank you.
            Questions Submitted by Senator Dianne Feinstein
    Question. Assistant Secretary Newland, my California tribal 
constituents remain concerned about the impact of a proposed off-
reservation casino in Medford, Oregon. As you know, I share these 
concerns as do the other Senators and Members representing the area.
    In testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee on March 
24th, when asked about the Department's willingness to meet with 
California Tribal Leaders on the Coquille project, you said that you 
``generally have an open door when it comes to matters of importance,'' 
and that you are ``happy to meet with them.'' I understand that despite 
multiple attempts to set up this meeting in the last month and a half, 
no date has been set for this discussion.
    Will you meet with California tribal representatives about the 
Coquille project and if so, when?
    Answer. In April of 2023, the Indian Affairs Office of Indian 
Gaming reached out to the following California Tribes/Tribal 
organizations that have expressed interest in meeting with the 
Assistant Secretary regarding the proposed Medford casino: Tolowa Dee-
ni Nation, Elk Valley, Karuk, Northern California Chairperson's 
Association, and the State of California (through Nathan Voegeli). The 
BIA also asked the State to pass the invite to any other interested 
Tribes in response to their letter requesting consultation on behalf of 
California Tribes. The two Tribes that responded were the Karuk Tribe 
and the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation. The Assistant Secretary for Indian 
Affairs met with these Tribes on June 30, 2023. The AS-IA Office has 
not received any subsequent requests from other California Tribes to 
meet on this matter.
    Question.  The Coquille Tribe's Medford application relies upon the 
assertion that the Coquille Restoration Act's discretionary fee to 
trust provisions are not subject to the Indian Reorganization Act, 
despite a plain reading of the act and correspondence from the Act's 
sponsors that doing so was not their legislative intent.
    Has the Department previously interpreted a Tribal restoration 
act's discretionary fee to trust provisions to override the Indian 
Reorganization Act? If so, please provide examples.
    Answer. We have reviewed the Coquille Tribe's application and 
nowhere does the Tribe make the assertion that its application is not 
subject to the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). In fact, the 
application acknowledges that the Coquille Restoration Act expressly 
makes all provisions of the IRA applicable to the Tribe and its 
members. Additionally, the Restoration Act provides specific authority 
in Sections 3(e) and 5(a) for the Secretary to accept land into trust 
for the Tribe pursuant to the provisions of the IRA.
    We are not aware of any instances where the Department has 
interpreted the Tribal Restoration Act's discretionary fee to trust 
provisions to override the IRA. We are, however, aware of instances 
where Congress has provided separate authority for the Department to 
acquire land into trust for a Tribe. We consider those instances to be 
mandatory rather than discretionary acquisitions.

                Question Submitted by Senator Jon Tester
    Question. Over the past several years, this Committee has 
previously directed BIE to develop a methodology regarding operating 
and facility needs of Tribal Colleges and Universities. We have yet to 
see any report on methodology from the Bureau on the operating and 
facility needs of tribal colleges. When will we see that report?
    Answer. The BIE and Indian Affairs conducted Tribal Consultations 
with Tribal leaders and other stakeholders in May of 2021 to request 
input on developing a methodology for determining Tribal Colleges and 
Universities (TCUs) operating and maintenance needs. As a result of the 
Tribal Consultations, Tribal Colleges Facilities Improvement & Repair 
annual appropriations funding have been equally divided and distributed 
among the TCUs, beginning with the FY 2021 Budget.

                                 ______
                                 

             Questions Submitted by Senator Martin Heinrich
    Question. One of the primary issues BIE schools face is school 
construction and replacement. The recent shift of the Division of 
Facilities Management and Construction from BIA to BIE has hindered 
progress for schools currently in line for replacement. How can 
Congress support BIE in expeditiously addressing school replacements?
    Answer. The Division of Facilities Management and Construction 
(DFMC) has not shifted from BIA to BIE. DFMC remains within the Office 
of Facilities, Property and Safety Management, which is an office 
within the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management.
    New school replacement projects continue to be managed by DFMC. 
Facilities improvement and repair projects under $5.0 million in cost 
will transition from the BIA to the BIE. The cost of construction has 
grown significantly, and school projects are getting more complex as 
Indian Affairs works to increase the integration of technology and 
cultural aspects into BIE schools. For example, the average cost of 
replacing a school is now over $100 million. The growing cost is the 
most significant factor slowing down implementation, as it is necessary 
to wait for multiple years of appropriations to have enough funding to 
move forward with construction. To address the cost challenge and other 
factors, the FY 2024 budget proposes to increase school replacement 
construction by $136.0 million and requests an additional $750,000 for 
DFMC to expand construction staff for BIE school projects, as well as 
Public Safety and Justice Construction.
    Question. The National Advisory Council on Indian Education was 
created by Congress to advise the Department of Education and 
Department of the Interior on issues facing the Indian Education 
system. One of their recent recommendations has been to fully fund the 
Indian Student Equalization Program, known as ISEP. Why doesn't BIE's 
budget request include full funding for ISEP?
    Answer. The FY 2024 President's Budget requests $508.7 million for 
ISEP formula funds, a $27.0 million increase over the FY 23 enacted 
budget, and a $67.9 million increase over the FY 22 enacted level. This 
significant increase reflects the importance of ISEP formula funds and 
moves BIE closer to full funding.
    Question. Can you share information about how increased public 
safety funding in the budget translates to more officers on the ground, 
better corrections programs, and better court services? How is Interior 
expanding its work to fight the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons 
Crisis?
    Answer. Given the need in Indian Country, BIA is prioritizing the 
use of public safety and justice funding to provide more `boots on the 
ground' to police communities, take better care of inmates in custody, 
and appropriately process cases through court services. The 2024 
request includes a program increase of $33.5 million to enable 
additional Tribal and direct service `boots on the ground' law 
enforcement positions performing crucial public safety services on a 
24/7 basis. The requested increase would fund additional Uniform 
Police, Criminal Investigator, and Dispatch personnel, which represent 
the backbone of law enforcement operations in Indian Country. Since 
roughly two-thirds of the BIA law enforcement programs are operated by 
Tribes, the request estimates an additional 74 Federal FTE and 148 
Tribal positions can be funded. This will help alleviate existing 
challenges and safety risks associated with existing staff limitations. 
These investments are a critical means to addressing the Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Persons crisis, opioids and related drug 
challenges, and to reduce recidivism. More law enforcement officials in 
communities can improve response times so that fewer people go missing, 
and better evidence can be collected sooner.

             Questions Submitted by Senator Lisa Murkowski
          contract support costs/105 (l) tribal lease payments
    Question. Do contract support costs and 105 (l) lease payments have 
statutory, regulatory, and court citations which define and quantify 
exactly what these costs are? If yes, could you please provide the 
Committee with those legally defined and referenced definitions in 
writing within the next week?
    Answer. Contract Support Costs and 105(l) language regarding what 
types of costs can be included for both authorities have statutory and 
regulatory citations. Provided below is general background and 
citations of relevant documents on these costs.
    For 105(l) Tribal Leases, the statutory citation is codified as 25 
U.S.C. Sec. 5324(l), and the regulatory citation is 25 CFR 900, Subpart 
H (Lease of Tribally-Owned Buildings by the Secretary), 
Sec. Sec. 900.69--900.74. Regarding court decisions, Maniilaq Ass'n v. 
Burwell, 170 F. Supp. 3d 243, determined that lease compensation is not 
capped at the level the Secretary would have otherwise provided (also 
known as the ``106(a)'' or ``Secretarial Amount''); and Maniilaq Ass'n 
v. Burwell, 170 F. Supp. 3d 243 (D.D.C. 2016) held that lease 
compensation was not capped at level agency historically paid to secure 
space. Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe v. Azar, 486 F. Supp. 3d 83, allowed a 
Federal agency to reduce 105(l) compensation on a pro rata amount based 
on comparing the total square footage of the facility with the square 
footage necessary to provide services to Indian beneficiaries.
    Indian Affairs (IA) reviews each of the submitted Tribal 105(l) 
proposals based on the above noted statutory, regulatory, and judicial 
direction. For example, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5324(l), notes that 
``compensation may include rent, depreciation based on the useful life 
of the facility, principal and interest paid or accrued, operation and 
maintenance expenses, and such other reasonable expenses that the 
Secretary determines, by regulation, to be allowable.'' In addition, 25 
CFR 900, Subpart H, Sec. Sec. 900.69--900.74 provides detailed 
direction on what operation and maintenance and monitoring and 
preventive maintenance can be included. IA considers all these factors 
to reasonably assess each proposal.
    For Contract Support Costs, the statutory citations that are 
relevant are 25 USC Ch. 46: sections 5325, 5326 and 5327; as well as 
some provisions from Title IV and V applicable to Self Governance. The 
primary regulatory citation is 25 CFR Part 900 Subpart Section C. 
Relevant court citations regarding the types of costs for contract 
support costs are the following:

  --Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182, held the Government 
        must pay the full amount of each Tribe's contract support costs 
        when Congress appropriates sufficient funds to pay in full any 
        individual contractor's costs, but not enough funds to cover 
        the aggregate amount.

  --Cook Inlet Tribal Council, Inc. v. Dotomain, 10 F.4th 893, 
        determined contract support costs cover expenses not 
        contemplated by the Secretarial amount.

  --Fort Defiance Indian Hosp. Bd., Inc. v. Becerra, 604 F. Supp. 3d 
        1187, discusses where a Tribe incurs higher costs than a 
        government agency ``normally'' would have to administer a 
        service, those costs are not considered normal, and thus may be 
        reimbursed as contract support costs, even if those costs 
        represent categories already included in the secretarial 
        amount, provided that the specific, individuated expense is not 
        already included.

    BIA commonly refers to the following three categories of contract 
support costs: (1) indirect costs, which are the costs incurred for a 
common or joint purpose benefitting more than one contract objective, 
or which are not readily assignable to the contract objectives 
specifically benefitted without effort disproportionate to the results 
achieved; (2) direct Contract Support Costs, which are the costs of the 
activities Tribes incur but are not provided in program funding or 
indirect funding, such as the cost of program-specific training; and 
(3) startup costs, which are the one-time costs incurred during the 
initial year an agreement is in effect. Individual Tribes work with 
extensively with the BIA to determine which direct costs and startup 
costs are allowable and with the Interior Business Center to determine 
which indirect costs are allowable.
    Question. A general provision has been included directing both the 
IHS and the Department of the Interior to begin a process to establish 
guidelines regarding the parameters for which a lease agreement should 
be structured and paid for. Please provide a status update on what is 
being done at your respective agencies to accomplish this legal 
requirement? Do you anticipate any regulatory changes stemming from 
this legal requirement? And, what do you envision taking shape at this 
point?
    Answer. Consistent with the general provision, Indian Affairs and 
the Indian Health Service (IHS) held a joint consultation August 2021 
to get input from Tribes on aligning the programs. Since then, we have 
met regularly with IHS to align procedures and processes regarding the 
105(l) program. These efforts have helped to ensure agency practices 
are as similar as possible given the nature of the different types of 
facilities the agencies operate. In addition to regulatory and 
statutory guidance (as described in Question 1 above), Indian Affairs 
also developed a 105(l) Tribal lease technical assistance guidebook to 
help Tribes as they work through the 105(l) process. At this point, we 
do not anticipate any regulatory changes stemming from these efforts. 
We also envision ongoing collaboration with IHS and with Tribes on 
implementation of the 105(l) program.
    Question. Over time, the Subcommittee has noticed a difference in 
how OMB and CBO interpret and score CSC and 105 (L) payments. Do your 
agencies know or understand why the costs vary among the two scoring 
agencies? For example, the FY24 President's Budget estimate and CBO re-
estimate are vastly different, do you know why?
    Answer. The differences between OMB and CBO estimates for Tribal 
105(l) leases and CSC requirements appear to stem from differences in 
methodology. The estimates for 105(l) Tribal Leases included in the 
President's Budget are based on the projected incoming lease load based 
on known Tribal requests, including for the budget year. We understand 
the CBO estimates may be based on historical actual obligations 
incurred, which have been lower than DOI's projected future years due 
to staff processing limitations and changes in Tribes' actual vs. 
Planned utilization of the 105(l) lease program.
    For CSC, the proposed amount in the FY 2024 budget is estimated to 
fully fund CSC requirements associated with the President's Budget 
Request. The proposed CSC amount in the FY 2024 Budget is based on 
historical CSC amounts and projected contracting and compacting amounts 
for the scope of work proposed in the FY 2024 President's Budget. 
Increased estimates in FY 2024 provide Contract Support Costs to cover 
requested program increases in areas including Tribal climate, clean 
energy, public safety and justice, and strengthening Tribal 
communities. We understand the CBO estimates may assume lower program 
funding levels than those requested and may use less specific data on 
projected contract and compact agreements in FY 2024.
                           tiwahe initiative
    Question. It is the Subcommittee's understanding that Tiwahe 
funding goes to ONLY pilot sites for the social services funding and 
then the Tiwahe funding for tribal courts goes to all tribes and tribal 
organizations. Can you confirm the number of pilot sites as well as 
exactly what pot of Tiwahe funding these sites receive? And then can 
you also confirm how much and who receives the Tiwahe tribal court 
funding?
    Answer. Tiwahe Social Service and Indian Child Welfare funding 
goes, in part, to all eligible Tribes or Tribal Organizations that were 
listed in the 2014 Budget Justifications. Each year, a total of $5.0 
million of Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) Tiwahe funding is allocated 
among 385 Tribes and Tribal Organizations and a total of $3.5 million 
of Social Service Tiwahe funding is allocated among 334 Tribes and 
Tribal Organizations for the across-the-board increases. In addition, 
annually, $300,000 Tiwahe Social Services funding supports domestic 
violence and youth shelters and $4.2 million supporting child 
protection and child welfare workers for 33 Tribes and Tribal 
Organizations which includes both demonstration sites and non-
demonstration sites. Each year, over 42 Tribes receive Recidivism 
Reduction Initiative (RRI) funding and over 50 Tribal courts receive 
Tiwahe Tribal Court (TTC) and Tribal Justice Support (TJS) funding. TJS 
Tiwahe funding was new in FY 2023 and funds Healing to Wellness courts.
    In addition to the wider funding, Tiwahe funding has supported the 
six demonstration sites since 2017 in the areas of: Social Service, 
ICWA, Job Placement and Training (JPT), Housing Program (HP), RRI, and 
TTC. The six demonstration sites receive between $2.5 and $3.5 million 
total per year in Tiwahe funding. Confederated Salish and Kootenai 
Tribes (CSKT) and Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah (PITU) were invited to 
become Tiwahe demonstration sites in March 2023, and two additional 
Tribes or Tribal Organizations will be invited to the demonstration in 
January 2024.
    CSKT and PITU received one-time planning funding of $500,000 for 
the first year and $200,000 in one-time funding from TTC (Tribes can 
request funding every year). After development of a Tiwahe Plan, CSKT 
and PITU will receive $997,853 in reoccurring Social Services base 
funding, but, given current appropriations levels, no other Tiwahe 
programs will be supported at the four new demonstration sites. TTC is 
providing one-time funding to CSKT and PITU to assist with court costs, 
consistent with current appropriation levels. Therefore, the six 
original demonstration sites receive Tiwahe Initiative funding for more 
programs than is provided to the four new Tiwahe demonstration sites. 
In addition to the selection of the four new Tiwahe demonstration 
sites, in FY 2023, BIA made $100,000 one-time funding awards to 10 
Tribes or Tribal Organizations to either assist in developing a Tiwahe 
Plan or to implement Tribally-led, cultural programs that improve 
community well-being. BIA made another round of ten $100,000 awards for 
the same purpose to other Tribes or Tribal Organizations in January 
2024.
    Regarding TTC funding, the funding is allocated to Tiwahe 
demonstration sites and to other eligible Tribal Court programs based 
on need. Need is determined from tribal requests received for funding 
in this area and is often supported by BIA tribal court assessment 
reports. In FY 2023, approximately $3.3 million was distributed to 
demonstration sites and approximately $4.3 million was distributed to 
39 other eligible Tribal Court programs based on need.
    Regarding the specifics of the TTC funding, in FY 2023, of the $7.6 
million appropriated for Tiwahe TTC purposes, $3.3 million went to 
Tiwahe demonstration sites, including CSKT and PITU. The remaining $4.3 
million was distributed among 39 Tribal Justice systems seeking ICWA 
Attorneys (representation of the Tribe in State Court) Tribal 
prosecutors/presenters for child neglect cases, juvenile prosecutors, 
public defenders, Tribal judges, guardians ad litem, healing to 
wellness coordinators, court navigators, among other things. BIA's 
approach to this funding allows for success and provides measurable 
impact to the court programs funded. If there was a requirement to 
distribute Tiwahe TTC and Tribal Justice Support (TJS)-Healing to 
Wellness Courts funding at current appropriated levels to all 574 
federally recognized Tribes, the amount per Tribe would be de minimis. 
The TJS Healing to Wellness Tiwahe program first received $3 million in 
funding in FY 2023. Healing to Wellness courts serve as effective 
alternatives to incarceration and provide a culturally appropriate 
forum to assist clients in addressing underlying behavioral health and 
substance abuse issues. Approximately half of this funding is 
distributed to demonstration sites and the rest is allocated to 
training, which is made available to all Tribes, and for funding other 
Tribal Healing to Wellness proposals.
    The overall Tiwahe related funding increase in the FY 2024 request 
is $33.5 million which includes increases in funding to the Human 
Services Tiwahe subactivities of Social Services $17.2 million, ICWA 
$7.5 million, and HP $2.0 million, as well as Tribal Justice support 
$1.9 million, and Economic Development $5.0 million. These increases 
will allow IA to further fund the four new Tribes for their Social 
Services, ICWA, and HP needs, along with bringing the 10 new sites into 
the demonstration program. The expansion will incorporate a stronger 
focus on Economic Development and Tribal Justice activities in Tribal 
community planning.
    Question. Last year, BIA received an additional $1M to expand the 
Initiative. How many sites will BIA expand Tiwahe to and exactly what 
funding will they receive?
    Answer. In FY 2023, Congress appropriated $1.0 million to the 
Tiwahe ICWA program, with the express purpose of expanding the Tiwahe 
demonstration. For the ICWA funding, a solicitation for Tiwahe site 
expansion closed on August 31, 2023, and an announcement of the new 
Tiwahe Tribes and Tribal Organizations occurred in January 2024. 10 
sites that applied to participate in the demonstration expansion were 
selected for this funding opportunity. Sites that previously received a 
one-time funding award are eligible to receive an additional one-time 
funding award of $100,000 to either develop a Tiwahe plan or implement 
cultural programming.
    In FY 2023, Congress also appropriated $1.0 million to the Tiwahe 
Social Service program also with the express purpose of expanding the 
Tiwahe demonstration. The Social Services funding will be used to 
establish two new Tiwahe demonstration sites. The solicitations for 
these new demonstration sites were done in the IWCA solicitation 
described above which closed on August 31, 2023, and an announcement of 
these new Tiwahe sites occurred in January 2024. The additional $1.0 
million will be split evenly between these two new Tiwahe demonstration 
sites for those Tribes to develop a Tiwahe plan which will guide 
implementation during subsequent years of participation in the Tiwahe 
demonstration site program.
    Question. What is the funding plan for those who currently receive 
Tiwahe funding? What happens to those who are currently a pilot site 
and what happens to those who are receiving tribal courts money? Is the 
Administration proposing to move that funding into a reoccurring base 
program amount?
    Answer. There are six existing demonstration sites and Tiwahe 
funding for those sites for Social Services, ICWA, and HP became base 
funding in FY 2021. Recidivism Reduction Initiative (RRI), Tiwahe 
Tribal Courts (TTC), and Tribal Justice Support (TJS) funding includes 
some base funding components for these Tribes. The Human Services 
funding (which comprises Social Services, IWCA, and HP) for the four 
new Tiwahe Tribes (CSKT, PITU, and two new demonstration sites) would 
become base funding in FY 2025.
    The Department does not plan to reallocate or diminish the base 
funding for the demonstration sites in any of the currently funded 
program areas. The primary goal of the Tiwahe Initiative is to show how 
Tribal community well-being improves when Tribes or Tribal 
Organizations are provided sufficient reoccurring base funding to build 
sustainable programs that address the major challenges facing the 
community. The 2021 Tiwahe Congressional Report identified how the six 
demonstration sites used their funding and support from the Department 
to markedly improve community well-being--from reducing the number of 
children in foster care, to keeping children with families while in 
care, to reducing juvenile recidivism to half the national average, and 
to winning Alaska Supreme Court cases that preserve the rights of 
Tribes in ICWA cases. The demonstration sites have used the influx of 
Tiwahe funding to leverage additional funding to supplement their 
budgets. For example, Ute Mountain Ute has obtained over $100 million 
dollars in grants and private philanthropy since 2017 due to the 
investment of Tiwahe funding. Red Lake Nation (RLN) was able to use 
their Tiwahe Plan as a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMHSA) Tribal Action Plan, which allowed RLN to access 
additional grant funding from SAMHSA for programming to improve mental 
health and address addiction issues, including a multigenerational 
wellness center.
    TTC and TJS funding will continue to support Tribal courts and 
healing to wellness courts. However, beyond the base funding components 
already established, there is currently no plan to transfer additional 
funding into base so we can continue to target specific Tribal court 
needs that change from year to year. For example, a court that 
requested funding in year 1 for computers or recording systems, may not 
need the same amount or same items in year 2. As of the end of FY 2023 
no Tribal request for TTC or TJS funding has been denied. It should be 
noted that Tiwahe demonstration sites' requests for TTC funding are 
considered first, at all times.
    The plan to distribute FY 2024 TTC and TJS Tiwahe funding remains 
the same. All Tribal justice systems, whether or not they are Tiwahe 
demonstration sites, depend on the Tiwahe funding appropriated to 
address issues dealing with the health and safety of the family. On 
average, TTC and TJS funds support approximately 107-117 tribal justice 
positions per year, all dealing with child welfare and child dependency 
cases. As noted earlier, requests from Tiwahe demonstration sites are 
honored first, at all times. The remainder of those funds are 
distributed to tribal justice systems within Public Law 280 
jurisdictions and those not in Public Law 280 jurisdiction. In FY 2023, 
107 positions were funded with TTC/TJS resources, including 6 child 
welfare attorneys, 15 Guardians Ad Litem, 15 Prosecutors/Presenters, 
and 11 Public Defenders, as well as other positions such as navigators 
for families within the court system. These positions are essential for 
the safety of the community. The average funding award is approximately 
$92,500 for each tribal justice system, several requiring more than 
$150,000. Tribes depend on these one-time awards as a large part of 
their operating budget.
      public safety and justice funding for public law 280 states
    Question. In Alaska more than 100 tribes have no law enforcement 
presence whatsoever in their community and because of the remote nature 
of many Native villages, often it takes days and air and/or boat travel 
for law enforcement to address violent felonies. Mr. Newland, are you 
aware of the various law enforcement challenges tribes face in Alaska? 
Can you share with the Subcommittee how much funding is being devoted 
to the Public Law 280 states for law enforcement and where that funding 
is coming from? Do you have an estimate on what the funding levels 
would be necessary so that all of these communities would be on par 
with the others who receive law enforcement funding?
    Answer. We recognize the unique challenges faced by Tribes in 
Alaska, especially in law enforcement. Regarding the numbers, BIA 
submits an annual report to the Congress that summarizes, among other 
things, the estimated annual law enforcement program funding needs 
throughout Indian Country. The most recent Report to the Congress on 
Spending, Staffing, and Estimated Funding Costs for Public Safety and 
Justice Programs in Indian Country, 2020, (https://www.bia.gov/bia/ojs/
documents-and-reports) provides BIA's law enforcement spending and 
estimated program needs for Alaska and other Public Law 280 States 
(California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin). This report 
identifies FY 2020 law enforcement funding, not including Detention and 
Corrections or Tribal Courts funding, of $17.6 million that was 
allocated to law enforcement programs serving Tribes in Public Law 280 
States. The report also estimates the law enforcement need associated 
with those six States was $665.9 million for adequately staffed, fully 
funded programs. Jurisdictional challenges and State provided support 
notwithstanding, a funding level of $207 million (or 31% of need) would 
be necessary to align Tribes in these States with Tribes in non-Public 
Law 280 jurisdictions.
    Beyond our traditional law enforcement programs, the OJS Division 
of Drug Enforcement and Missing & Murdered Unit each have four Special 
Agent positions located in Public Law 280 States to augment the 
investigative capabilities of local law enforcement. These two 
organizations also work closely with other Federal and Tribal 
stakeholders on multiple task forces to ensure information sharing and 
advance the safety of Indian communities.

               Questions Submitted by Senator John Hoeven
    Question. The Three Affiliated Tribes of Mandan, Hidatsa and 
Arikara (MHA Nation) are leaders in oil production at the Fort Berthold 
Reservation, with about 90% of the tribes' revenue coming from oil 
production. These resources help provide critical funding for the 
Tribe's essential needs, including infrastructure and healthcare. The 
Three Affiliated Tribes have produced as many as 300,000 barrels of oil 
per day; however, production remains down at only 152,640 barrels per 
day. Does the administration support the right of Tribes to develop all 
of their energy reserves, including their oil trust reserves?
    Answer. The Department supports Tribal sovereignty and the Tribes' 
right to economic development of all Tribal energy reserves, including 
oil and gas, to make lives better for people in their communities. It 
is important that Tribes maintain the ability to implement, regulate, 
and benefit from energy development in their communities. The 
Department looks forward to our continued work with Congress to help 
Tribal Nations further empower themselves through energy development.
    The BIA has reviewed and concurs with the production status 
information reflected in this question. Oil production on the Fort 
Berthold Indian Reservation (FBIR) achieved a high peak in 2019 and has 
declined since that time. We observe that the decline in the number of 
well permit applications likely results from multiple factors, 
including various title disputes on the FBIR that are the focus of 
significant effort and dedicated resources to resolve, as well as other 
dynamics that industry and the Federal partners in the area are jointly 
coordinating to address.
    Dedicated BIA resources to support the Tribe's efforts to develop 
energy resources on the FBIR have been key to maintaining production on 
the FBIR and working toward optimizing production volumes. Since 2017, 
the BIA's Indian Energy Service Center (IESC) has supported the BIA's 
field offices and other federally processed oil and gas leases and 
communitization agreements (CAs) on the FBIR that had been previously 
delayed due to litigation and other complications resulting from the 
high work volume generated within the highly productive Williston Basin 
(Bakken Formation). As a result of the IESC's efforts, the Department 
has collected and disbursed approximately $1.895 billion in oil and gas 
royalties to Tribes and Individual owners as of January 2024.
    The IESC has also processed CAs for the Uintah & Ouray (U&O) BIA 
Agency since 2019. The total royalty amount that has been transacted 
through these IESC processed CAs goes back to calendar year 2011 as 
some of the CAs approved had an effective date starting as far back as 
that year. As a result of the IESC's support, the Department has 
collected and disbursed approximately $79,241,452 since 2019 in oil and 
gas royalties.
    The Department and BIA will continue to support mineral needs and 
priorities of Tribes and Individual mineral owners nationwide. The 
Department has taken additional steps to support Tribes by transferring 
the Division of Energy and Mineral Development (DEMD) under the BIA. 
DEMD provides grant funding and technical assistance to fulfill the 
Department's trust responsibility to assist Tribes and Indian 
beneficiaries in furthering the goal of Indian self- determination 
through developing minerals, energy, and renewable energy.
    From 2015 to 2022 the DEMD provided grant funding to Tribes 
totaling $51.3 million through the Energy and Mineral Development 
Program (EMDP) and the Tribal Energy Development Capacity (TEDC) grant 
program, available exclusively to Indian beneficiaries. These programs 
support Tribes' efforts to develop all phases of energy and minerals, 
including oil and gas, solid minerals, and renewable energy. The DEMD, 
staffed with STEM professionals reflective of the energy and mineral 
industries, accompanies these grants with meaningful technical 
assistance to Tribes to maximize Tribal success in developing energy 
and mineral resources. The DEMD has been administering these Tribal 
grant programs since 1983. In 2022, $14.1 million in grant funding and 
technical assistance valued at $9.3 million were provided to Tribes 
through these programs. On average, DEMD has been able to fund about 
30% of total grant applications received. On an annual average basis, 
DEMD grant funds and technical assistance resources are roughly 
allocated in even proportions to 1) Tribal oil and gas and solid 
mineral development efforts, 2) Tribal renewable energy development 
efforts, and 3) Tribal capacity building related to energy management 
and support for developing multiple energy and mineral commodities.
    A partial list of example Tribal energy development successes 
supported by DEMD, IESC and other BIA offices includes:

  --Eastern Shoshone Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming 
        (Eastern Shoshone) and the Northern Arapaho Tribe of the Wind 
        River Reservation, Wyoming (Northern Arapahoe)--The DEMD has 
        provided direct advisement to the Tribes to assume operations 
        of oil field assets and initiate a Tribally owned oil and gas 
        enterprise aimed at developing economic benefit to Tribal 
        members. DEMD continues to provide ongoing Tribal oil field 
        operation advisement support.

  --Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico, & Utah--The DEMD has provided 
        to the Navajo Nation EMDP grant monies and technical assistance 
        to assess Helium development. Although not a specific energy 
        development, it is a critical fluid mineral that is developed 
        with oil and gas technology.

  --The Osage Nation--Grant monies and technical assistance supports 
        Tribal efforts to assess and expedite oil and gas development, 
        modernize their oil and gas data reserve data.

  --Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, 
        Montana--The IESC and the DEMD have partnered with BIA Fort 
        Peck Agency Office in assessing and prioritizing marketable 
        lands and provided processing support to prepare and administer 
        an upcoming competitive, advertised oil and gas lease sale.

  --Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico--The DEMD provided technical 
        assistance to the Tribe in reviewing proposed agreements 
        authorized by the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA) 
        and supported the Tribe in general operational coordination 
        with industry.

  --Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, California--The DEMD's 
        ongoing support includes assessment of economic development in 
        the Salton Sea area through energy related rights-of-way (ROW) 
        via business agreements with energy operators working to bring 
        electrical service to Riverside County, and possible metals 
        extraction from geothermal process water in Imperial County.

  --Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of the Pyramid Lake Reservation, Nevada--
        The DEMD has worked with and provided technical assistance and 
        EMDP grants to the Pyramid Lake Reservation and the Bristol Bay 
        Corporation to assist in the development of geothermal 
        resources.

  --Seismic Data Support--The DEMD coordinates with Tribes via grant 
        and technical assistance to develop, acquire, and house seismic 
        reflectivity data, critical to assess and market potential 
        Tribal energy reserves. Tribal seismic data collected to date 
        is valued at approximately $160 million.

  --Tribal Energy Development via the NAPE Expo--The DEMD coordinates 
        with Tribes to facilitate Tribal travel and attendance annually 
        to the prominent North American Prospect Expo (NAPE), an 
        industry driven expo focused on nationwide energy resource 
        business development. Energy operators and other parties attend 
        the expo with the goal of pursuing the business of developing 
        conventional and renewable development. DEMD accompanies Tribal 
        representatives at NAPE and serves as technical support in both 
        conventional and renewable energy development phases.

  --Tribal Energy Training Development--The DEMD has partnered with the 
        Petroleum Engineering Department at the Colorado School of 
        Mines to provide to Tribes a 3-day course of oil and gas 
        development on Tribal lands. The IESC has developed and 
        provided training to Tribes in energy development procedural 
        practices within the Department of the Interior via the 
        Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) Tribal training series.

  --NIOGEMS--The National Indian Oil & Gas, Energy and Minerals System 
        (NIOGEMS) is a graphical software system developed in-house by 
        DEMD specifically for Tribes to manage their energy and mineral 
        trust resources. NIOGEMS houses data from multiple systems of 
        record, public datasets, and proprietary datasets into one 
        application for ease of energy asset management and analysis. 
        The NIOGEMS application is provided to Tribes and Federal 
        Agencies to aid energy resource management.
    Question. What steps--including Tribal consultation--are being 
taken to help Tribes access and navigate Federal energy programs?
    Answer. The DOI, through the BIA, established the Indian Energy 
Service Center (IESC) in 2016, in response to the surge of oil and gas 
development among several Tribes, including the Three Affiliated 
Tribes, as well as the Southern Ute Tribe, the Uintah and Ouray Tribe, 
and the Osage Nation. The IESC is a multi-agency office utilizing the 
services of the BIA, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Office of Natural 
Resource Revenue (ONRR), and the Bureau of Trust Funds Administration 
(BTFA). Each of these offices play key roles and responsibilities in 
the management of oil and gas (mineral), energy, and renewable energy 
resources for the Tribes and Individual beneficiaries. The IESC assists 
local Federal field offices with workloads to minimize backlogs in 
transactions associated with oil and gas development. The increased 
coordination and support between the key Federal agencies have 
alleviated many of the administrative burdens and backlogs that were 
affecting development of Indian trust mineral and energy resources. The 
IESC continues to facilitate coordination between these key agencies 
and as a result all agencies are more responsive to the needs of the 
Tribes. Furthermore, the IESC chairs the Indian Energy and Mineral 
Steering Committee (IEMSC). IEMSC is comprised of senior level 
management representatives from bureaus and offices within the 
Department of the Interior with direct responsibility for managing 
Indian energy, mineral and renewable energy resources, and revenue 
management. IEMSC takes an active role to engage and coordinate with 
Federal officials from agencies outside of DOI, as needed, to address 
energy and mineral issues on Indian lands. While carrying out these 
activities, IESC has entered into MOUs with the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), US Fish 
and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the Department of Energy (DOE) to 
foster and build a working relationship with Federal partners to 
enhance Indian mineral, energy and renewable energy opportunities and 
communication on trust lands for the benefit of Tribes and Individual 
beneficiaries and mineral owners.
    The IESC hosts a series of quarterly Federal Partner Meetings with 
the Three Affiliated Tribes, also known as the Mandan, Hidatsa and 
Arikara Nation, and 5 BIA Regions to discuss Indian energy and mineral 
resource development, royalty management coordination, and information 
exchange at the local office level. The departmental bureaus and 
offices represented on the partnership team operate under the Federal 
trust responsibility to federally recognized Indian Tribes, Indian 
allottees, and Alaska Natives.
    Also housed within BIA, the Division of Energy and Mineral 
Development (DEMD) provides grant funding and technical assistance to 
Tribes to further economic independence through development of Tribal 
energy and minerals. Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the 
DEMD accomplishes its mission with its staff of engineers, geologists, 
and other STEM professionals with specialized experience in 
conventional fluid minerals (oil and gas), renewable energy and 
distributed generation, solid minerals, and Tribal business and 
capacity development. Tribes benefit from the coordinated approach that 
DEMD and the IESC employ, where Tribal energy and mineral development 
efforts supported with DEMD grant funding and technical assistance can 
be expedited through the internal Federal coordination efforts of the 
IESC. The BIA will continue to use this coordinated model to support 
Tribal efforts to support all phases of energy and mineral resources.
    The Department will continue to work with Congress to help Tribal 
Nations further empower themselves through energy development. The 
Department and BIA coordinate and serve on various committees with 
Federal partners, and the White House Council on Native American 
Affairs (WHCNAA) to deliver opportunities and investments to Indian 
Country. This coordination includes discussions regarding investments 
available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) which also 
provide resources and the opportunity to improve services in every 
Tribal community and advance self-determination to Tribes.
    Timely approval of permitting and realty actions are critical to 
infrastructure investment in Indian Country. To this end, BIA recently 
announced an updated National Policy Memorandum (NPM-TRUS-44 A1) which 
streamlines the rights-of-way (ROWs) and business lease application 
process for projects funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and BIL, as 
well as Telecommunications and Renewable Energy Projects. This action 
advances the policy of the BIA to support Tribal Nations in exercising 
their sovereignty to govern their lands and pursue economic self-
sufficiency, conservation practices, and climate resiliency. 
Specifically, this NPM provides clear direction to ensure that ROWs and 
business leases are expedited so there is no unnecessary delay in 
deploying critical infrastructure to Indian country.
    The Department has also taken steps to support Tribes and Indian 
beneficiaries with the development of their trust resources and 
navigating energy program development with outreach coordination and 
communication. Lack of infrastructure and the need for increased 
capacity among several of the Tribal Nations are issues that need to be 
addressed. The IESC and DEMD and the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Indian Affairs developed the Renewable Energy Accelerated 
Deployment Initiative for Indian Country (READI) to engage with Tribes 
and inform decision makers of Tribal goals and needs regarding 
renewable energy development on Indian lands. READI is underway and is 
scheduled for implementation by December 2023. READI will support 
listening sessions with Tribes across Indian Country to receive input 
on each Tribe's vision and plan for renewable energy development and 
associated needs in the Tribal community. The product of READI will be 
a compilation report that decision makers may use for resource 
allocation and program development. READI will host five hybrid 
virtual/in- person and two virtual-only listening sessions starting on 
August 21, 2023.
    The Department also held two consultations with Tribes regarding 
funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to understand the unique 
Tribal energy and electrification needs and better assist Tribes in 
navigating the implementation and award process for the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the IRA. For example, the IESC has worked 
with Interior's Orphaned Well Program to administer grants and 
assistance to Tribes looking to remediate abandoned well sites within 
their land. This program will distribute $50 million in funds for 2023 
and anticipates distributing $100 million more in the next 2 years.
    BIA is also coordinating with the Federal Permitting Improvement 
Steering Committee (FPISC) through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to 
transfer funds for Tribes to support permitting for FAST 41 projects to 
BIA.
    Question. The U.S. Indian Police Academy's Advanced Training Center 
(ATC), located at Camp Grafton in North Dakota, provides specialized 
advanced training for law enforcement, corrections, and dispatch 
personnel of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Federal agencies, 
State law enforcement, and local law enforcement. Will you continue to 
support the work of the ATC at Camp Grafton?
    Answer. We fully intend to continue our role in this critical 
training partnership and support the public safety needs of Indian 
Country.
    Question. It is important to note that Camp Grafton is also home to 
the North Dakota National Guard (NDNG) and serves as the region's 
premier National Guard training site. The NDNG has been extremely 
supportive of this partnership and the important training being done by 
BIA at Camp Grafton. In fact, the NDNG has utilized funding to 
construct new dorms and remodel classrooms, not only to improve its own 
training activities, but to further support BIA's training activities. 
The NDNG has also been working to finalize a memorandum of agreement 
(MOA) with the BIA, with the intent to lease approximately 8 acres of 
land at Camp Grafton to BIA for the long-term. My understanding is that 
the MOA is currently being reviewed by the Department of the Interior's 
Office of the Solicitor. Will you help ensure that the MOA is reviewed 
in a timely manner and that my office is informed of any decision?
    Answer. Yes, we intend to keep you apprised of any legal concerns 
raised regarding the lease and will work with your office to address 
them as necessary.

    [Clerk's note.--The subcommittee was unable to hold 
hearings on nondepartmental witnesses. The statements and 
letters of those submitting written testimony are as follows:]
         Prepared Statement of the Alliance for the Great Lakes
    The Alliance for the Great Lakes is a nonpartisan nonprofit working 
across the Great Lakes region to protect and restore the Great Lakes. 
Founded in 1970, we have worked for 50 years on programs to ensure 
public access to clean, safe and affordable drinking water; protect 
water quality; stop the establishment and spread of harmful invasive 
aquatic species, including invasive carp; reduce plastic pollution; and 
advocate for increased drinking and wastewater infrastructure funding 
and programs to ensure that water remains affordable for all Americans. 
Our membership and supporters are located throughout the eight States 
in the Great Lakes region and each year we mobilize more than 15,000 
volunteers to take action to ensure that our shorelines and beaches are 
healthy, safe and clean.
    The Great Lakes are not only a national treasure but are a globally 
significant resource containing 20 percent of the world's available 
freshwater supply. The Lakes provide some 30 million Americans with 
drinking water and are vital to communities in Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The 
Great Lakes not only provide water, but they also support jobs, 
commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism for millions of 
Americans. Protecting the health of the Great Lakes is integral to the 
environmental and economic health of the region.
    But the Great Lakes face continued threats from the harmful legacy 
of decades of pollution that threaten our communities with cancer-
causing contaminants, drinking water restrictions, and fish consumption 
advisories. Action is needed at all levels of government to address 
these threats, as well as emerging issues associated with climate 
change. The FY 2024 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies 
Appropriations bill under this subcommittee's jurisdiction funds an 
array of programs and projects in the Environmental Protection Agency 
and the Department of the Interior that are critical to the restoration 
and protection of the Great Lakes. This written testimony highlights 
just three of the programs under your consideration: the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative and water infrastructure funding for the Clean 
Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. Although all of these 
programs received investments in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act of 2021, continued funding at increased and authorized levels is 
necessary to deal with the significant challenges each program faces 
and additional detail is provided below.
                   great lakes restoration initiative
    The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is an Environmental 
Protection Agency funded grant program that supports State, Federal, 
Tribal and local efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. GLRI 
funding is allocated by a 16-member Federal interagency task force and 
regional working group to address water quality issues associated with 
pollution and legacy contaminants; habitat loss/degradation and 
invasive species consistent with a 5-year action plan containing 
measurable goals and objectives. Since its inception in 2010, nearly $3 
billion has been provided to fund more approximately 6,000 projects 
throughout the Great Lakes region.
    For every $1 the GLRI invested, it is estimated that the investment 
will produce more than $3 in additional economic activity regionwide 
through 2036. Accordingly, the GLRI is revitalizing our waterfronts and 
leading a resurgence in water-based outdoor recreation and increasing 
tourism across the region.
    For FY 2024, we recommend that the Committee fund this program at 
$425 million. This funding level is consistent with the congressional 
project reauthorization in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act 
(Public Law 116-294, Jan. 5, 2021) which authorizes $425 million in 
funding for FY 2024. In addition to supporting States, Tribes and local 
communities, GLRI funding also supports US Treaty obligations under the 
Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between the US and Canada and its Great 
Lakes Water Quality Agreement.
                   investing in water infrastructure
    Another important area under the subcommittee's jurisdiction is 
funding for water infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency 
estimates that nationwide approximately $743 billion is needed over the 
next 20 years to repair, replace and upgrade water infrastructure. In 
the Great Lakes alone it is estimated that the eight States need $188 
billion to upgrade aging water infrastructure. Furthermore, the 
Congressional Budget Office estimates that Federal funding for water 
and wastewater utilities has decreased fourfold since 1980, leaving 
State and local governments to pick up the tab.
    Although the need for water infrastructure funding far outstrips 
available annual funding levels, we encourage you to appropriate funds 
for these programs at the authorized level for FY 2024 which means 
$4.12 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and $4.63 
billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. These funding levels 
are a significant increase over funds appropriated in FY 2023 and are 
necessary to allow for continued progress to address water 
infrastructure funding needs and to ensure that families nationwide 
have access to safe drinking water and healthy waste water services.
    We appreciate the subcommittee's consideration of our views and its 
work and funding support over many years for programs that protect and 
restore the Great Lakes. As the source of drinking water for 30 million 
Americans and as a significant driver in the regional economy of eight 
States, investments in programs that protect and restore the Great 
Lakes are critical to ensure the economic and environmental health of 
this important resource.

                                 ______
                                 
         Prepared Statement of the American Alliance of Museums
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony. 
My name is Laura L. Lott, and I am the President and CEO of the 
American Alliance of Museums (AAM). We urge your support for $211 
million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 funding for the National Endowment for 
the Arts (NEA), $211 million in funding for the National Endowment for 
the Humanities (NEH), as well as sufficient funding for the Smithsonian 
Institution. We also request your support for the Historic Preservation 
Fund, including at least $70 million for State Historic Preservation 
Offices (SHPOs) and $34 million for Tribal Historic Preservation 
Offices (THPOs). We support $28 million for African American Civil 
Rights Grants, $13 million for Historically Black Colleges/
Universities, $7 million for Equal Rights Grants, and $5 million for 
Underrepresented Community Grants. We request funding of at least $40 
million for the Save America's Treasures program and $17 million for 
Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization grants. We support at least $11 
million in funding for U.S. Semiquincentennial celebration grants for 
the country's 250th commemoration. In light of museums being banned 
from this year's Community Project Funding in the House of 
Representatives, which we strongly oppose, increasing funding for 
competitive grants for museums is all the more critical.
    Before detailing these funding priorities for the museum field, I 
want to express my appreciation for the increases enacted in FY 2023. 
The additional funds for the NEH, NEA, and historic preservation 
activities will enhance museums' work to enrich their communities and 
preserve our many heritages. The subcommittee's choice to make these 
investments in FY 2023 speaks volumes about its commitment to our 
Nation's cultural institutions. While Federal relief funding has 
provided critical lifelines, museums are still struggling to return to 
pre-pandemic levels of support.
    Representing more than 35,000 museum professionals and volunteers, 
institutions-including aquariums, art museums, botanic gardens, 
children's museums, cultural museums, historic sites, history museums, 
maritime museums, military museums, natural history museums, 
planetariums, presidential libraries, railway museums, science and 
technology centers, and zoos-and corporate partners serving the museum 
field, AAM stands for the broad range of the museum community.

    Museums are essential community infrastructure for many reasons:

  --Museums are economic engines and job creators. According to Museums 
        as Economic Engines: A National Report, U.S. museums (pre-
        pandemic) support more than 726,000 jobs and contribute $50 
        billion to the U.S. economy per year. The economic activity of 
        museums generates more than $12 billion in tax revenue, one-
        third of it going to State and local governments. For example, 
        the total financial impact that museums have on the economy in 
        the State of Oregon is $585 million, including supporting 9,740 
        jobs. For Alaska it is a $280 million impact supporting 3,240 
        jobs. This impact is not limited to cities: more than 25% of 
        museums are in rural areas. The import of these data is not the 
        numbers alone--but the larger point that museums give back 
        tremendously to their communities in numerous ways--including 
        economically. The Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and the other 
        programs does not stay in Washington, DC, it goes back to 
        communities across the Nation. And it is leveraged many times 
        over by private philanthropy, and State and local investments.

  --Museums are key education providers. Museums spend more than $2 
        billion yearly on education activities; the typical museum 
        devotes 75% of its education budget to K-12 students, and 
        museums receive approximately 55 million visits each year from 
        students in school groups. Museums also answered the call and 
        significantly ramped up online educational programs and 
        resources for students and families throughout the pandemic. 
        Museums help teach the State and local curriculum in subjects 
        ranging from art and science to history, civics, and 
        government. Museums have long served as a vital resource to 
        homeschool learners. It is not surprising that in a public 
        opinion survey, 97% of respondents agreed that museums were 
        educational assets in their communities. The results were 
        statistically identical regardless of political persuasion or 
        community size.

  --Museums are essential to rebuilding communities as we continue to 
        emerge from the pandemic. The pandemic has inflicted profound 
        damage on U.S. museums, the vast majority of which are 
        501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organizations. The museum field 
        will take years to recover to pre-pandemic levels of staffing, 
        revenue, and attendance. Thanks to several Federal relief 
        programs, far fewer museums than initially expected are in 
        danger of permanent closure and tens of thousands of museum 
        jobs were saved. While Federal relief funding has provided 
        critical lifelines, museums are still struggling to return to 
        pre-pandemic levels of support. According to a recent survey, 
        67% of museums have not recovered to 100% of their pre-pandemic 
        attendance numbers. Of those that have not fully recovered, 
        attendance is down on average 30% with many citing lower 
        visitation from K-12 in-person field trips. Despite the 
        tremendous financial and psychological stress caused by the 
        pandemic, museum professionals demonstrated the critical role 
        museums play in our country's infrastructure and deepened their 
        social impact in their communities. Museums are essential 
        community infrastructure.

    The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is an independent 
Federal agency created by Congress in 1965. Grants are awarded to 
nonprofit educational institutions, including museums, for educational 
programming, infrastructure and the care of collections. NEH supports 
museums as institutions of lifelong learning and exploration, and as 
keepers of our cultural, historical, and scientific heritages that can 
foster critical dialogues on challenging issues.
    In FY 2022, the NEH awarded 679 grants totaling more than $89.4 
million to institutions across the U.S., including museums. All of 
NEH's divisions and offices support museums, including the Office of 
Challenge Grants which offers matching grants to support much needed 
capacity building and infrastructure projects at museums. Humanities 
councils in every State and U.S. territory sponsor family literacy 
programs, speakers' bureaus, cultural heritage tourism, exhibitions, 
and live performances. Many councils also offer grants to local 
cultural organizations, including museums.
    In preparation for the U.S. Semiquincentennial in 2026, NEH's new 
``A More Perfect Union'' initiative provides funding opportunities 
across the agency's seven grantmaking divisions for humanities projects 
that promote a deeper understanding of American history and culture and 
that advance civic education and knowledge of our core principles of 
government. As part of the initiative, most of NEH's grant programs 
include special encouragements to applications related to the United 
States' 250th.
    Here are just two examples of how NEH funding was used to support 
museums' work in your communities:

  --The High Desert Museum in Bend, Oregon, received a $187,487 award 
        to conduct archival work and public programming on the history 
        and culture of Central Oregon, focusing on the Plateau Tribes 
        in the region. This project will position the High Desert 
        Museum and Museum at Warm Springs to continue core humanities 
        work that is sustaining the region's Native based cultural 
        infrastructure. Specific activities include transforming how 
        the High Desert Museum structures and interprets the collection 
        of Plateau Indian material culture in its care and cataloguing 
        and digitizing the Museum at Warm Springs's collection and 
        archives to support K-12 curriculum. By advancing this 
        collaborative work, this project will have a significant and 
        ongoing impact on the region's cultural infrastructure.

  --The Museum of the Aleutians (MOTA) in Unalaska, Alaska, was awarded 
        $6,213 for the purchase of eight new data loggers for the 
        museum's collection, including two units for traveling 
        collections, to allow for improved environmental monitoring. 
        This project will assist with the ongoing preservation of the 
        museum's collections, helping MOTA staff meet its mission to 
        collect, preserve, and share the rich cultural legacy of the 
        Aleutian Islands Region.

    The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) makes art accessible to 
all and provides leadership in arts education. Established in 1965, NEA 
supports great art in every congressional district. Its grants to 
museums help them exhibit, preserve, and interpret visual material 
through exhibitions, residencies, publications, commissions, public art 
works, conservation, documentation, services to the field, and public 
programs. Annually, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) typically 
provides more than 150 awards to museums and museum-related projects, 
totaling approximately $5 million.
    Since 2010, the NEA has collaborated with Blue Star Families and 
the U.S. Department of Defense on Blue Star Museums, which provides 
free museum admission to active duty military and their families all 
summer long. Typically, more than 2,000 museums in all 50 States 
participate, reaching approximately nearly one million military members 
and their families.
    The Federal role of the NEA is uniquely valuable; receiving a grant 
from the NEA confers prestige on supported projects, strengthening 
museums' ability to attract matching funds from other public and 
private funders. On average, each dollar awarded by the NEA leverages 
up to nine dollars from other sources. No other funder-public or 
private-funds the arts in every State and the U.S. territories. Forty 
percent of NEA's grant funds are distributed to state arts agencies for 
re-granting.

    Here are two examples of how NEA funding was used to support 
museums' work in your communities:

  --The Portland Art Museum in Portland, Oregon, was awarded $20,000 to 
        support a professional and artistic development lab for 
        cinematic storytellers working in film, audio, animation, mixed 
        reality, and new media formats. Offering professional 
        mentorship and guidance on creative, financial, and career 
        sustainability, the program will culminate in paid 
        opportunities for participating artists to hold workshops and 
        present their projects to the area community. Program 
        activities will take place virtually and in person. The program 
        will benefit filmmakers and media artists, as well as local 
        audiences at exhibitions in the Portland, Oregon, area to 
        strengthen the Nation's cultural infrastructure.

  --The Anchorage Museum in Anchorage, Alaska, was awarded $70,000 to 
        support a series of public programs, installations, and artist 
        residencies featuring sound art, sound ecology, and healing 
        sound. The museum will commission artists to create work that 
        focuses on sound, the environment and wellness. Artwork from 
        emerging and professional artists will be presented, with a 
        focus on artists from the Circumpolar North and Indigenous 
        artists who work on issues connected to climate change and 
        climate justice, as well as musicians whose work is derived 
        from sound ecology. The project will serve audiences of all 
        ages and include curriculum development for elementary, 
        secondary, and postsecondary students and educators.

    The agency also runs the Arts & Artifacts Indemnity program, which 
reduces the cost of insuring major exhibitions. Absent this program, 
such exhibitions would need to be reduced in scale or abandoned. It 
saves museums millions of dollars annually, at a cost of almost zero to 
taxpayers.
    The Smithsonian Institution comprises some of the most visited 
museums in the world. The National Museum of African American History 
and Culture has captivated audiences from around the globe, 
underscoring the power of our National museums to educate and inspire. 
We support funding increases that would allow these world-class museums 
to undertake critical collections care, make needed technology 
upgrades, conduct cutting edge research of every type, and increase 
access for all. And we applaud the establishment of the Smithsonian 
American Women's History Museum and the National Museum of the American 
Latino.
    The Historic Preservation Fund is the funding source of 
preservation awards to States, Tribes, local governments, and 
nonprofits. State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices carry out 
the historic preservation work of the Federal Government on State and 
Tribal lands. Historic preservation programs are not only essential to 
protecting our many heritages; they also serve as economic development 
engines and job creators, and provide vital funding to help museums 
serve their communities.
    I hope that my testimony helped make it clear why these priorities 
are of critical importance to the Nation and how they provide a 
worthwhile return on investment to the American taxpayer. Thank you.

           Prepared Statement of the American Circus Alliance
    Summary: This written testimony is submitted on behalf of the 
American Circus Alliance (ACA) to the Senate Appropriations Committee 
on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for the official record. 
The ACA appreciates Congress' support for the National Endowment for 
the Arts (NEA) in fiscal year (FY) 2023 and asks that the Committee 
robustly fund the agency in FY 2024. The ACA joins the arts community 
in requesting support of at least $211 million for the NEA in FY 2024 
to support the creative arts economy and circus arts across the Nation.
    Written Testimony: The American Circus Alliance is a service and 
advocacy organization dedicated to circus performance and production in 
the United States. The mission of the American Circus Alliance is to 
unite, promote, and champion the art of American circus, its 
practitioners, and those who work to support it. According to a 2022 
survey of U.S. circus workers, these workers are distributed fairly 
evenly across regions of the country, with the highest concentration in 
the Western U.S. Circus is a vital component of the American cultural 
fabric, and the ACA represents U.S. circus performance and production 
for the formation of cultural policy at the National, as well as 
regional and local levels.
    We thank the Committee for its successful work to substantially 
increase NEA funding in FY 2023 to $204 million. We request that the 
Committee increase NEA funding to no less than President Biden's FY 
2024 budget request of $211 million. Increasing NEA funding would have 
cascading positive effects in communities across the United States and 
would make the money go further leveraging public-private partnerships 
built into NEA programs. This is particularly important at this time to 
continue helping those involved in the creative economy to rebound from 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that 40 percent of NEA's budget 
is re-granted through State and regional arts agencies, the NEA expands 
opportunities for Americans to participate and engage with the arts, 
including circus arts, in every State and congressional district. NEA 
grantmaking specifically supports rural and underserved areas that 
would not otherwise have robust access to art, such as circus arts.
    A small funding increase to the NEA funding level, relative to 
other appropriated programs, would have an outsized effect to support 
the economies and well-being of our communities. Particularly during 
this time when there is pressure to make tough budgetary decisions, we 
strongly urge the Committee to protect and increase NEA funding to 
provide vital arts support. Investment in the NEA provides a 
substantial return on investment; for every dollar spent on direct 
grants, nine dollars in private and other public funds are leveraged, 
generating more than $500 million in matching support. Supporting the 
arts helps the economy as a whole. The creative economy represented 4.4 
percent of the gross domestic product in 2021, more than $1 trillion in 
total, according to a joint report from the NEA and the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis.
    The ACA also joins the arts community in encouraging the Committee 
to build a specific path to index funding for the NEA at $1 per capita. 
The Endowment is currently funded at only 62 cents per capita. Such an 
increase in arts funding would help alleviate the historic Federal 
underinvestment in the arts sector that results in circus artists 
leaving the United States to train and create transformative art in 
other countries that have more robust arts funding.
    The circus arts ecosystem benefits directly from NEA funding 
through Grants for Arts Projects. For example, the New England Center 
for Circus Arts (NECCA) received $20,000 in support in FY 2022 an has 
reached over 45,000 audience members in public, private and school 
settings in rural Southern Vermont and throughout New England. Circus 
company Parallel Exit received $15,000 from the NEA in FY 2023 and has 
reached over 50,000 audience members and 25,000 public school students 
throughout New York City. We additionally urge the NEA to add an 
additional grant submission category for circus. Currently, circus 
grant applications must apply through the multidisciplinary arts 
category, which is defined as a combination of performing, visual, 
media, design, and literary arts, which does a disservice to the 
specific needs and particularities of circus arts. Circus arts are an 
evolving art form of popular entertainment that synthesize physical 
technical mastery with artistic expression of one or more circus 
techniques recognized by professionals, including but not limited to 
balancing, clowning art, equestrian art, floor acrobatics, aerial 
acrobatics, variety arts and juggling. Increased NEA funding would help 
the Endowment to fund more meritorious arts grants across their areas 
of jurisdiction, and would increase opportunity for art forms, like 
circus arts, that lack center stage attention when it comes to funding, 
yet still stimulate local economies and connect communities.
    Conclusion: The National Endowment for the Arts plays a critical 
role in supporting development and accessibility of art to people all 
across the Nation. Arts funding is vital to inspire and connect people, 
and it has a powerful economic impact. On behalf of the American Circus 
Alliance, thank you for your consideration of Federal funding for the 
NEA at no less than $211 million for FY 2024, as well as a specific 
path to index funding for this agency at $1 per capita.

             Prepared Statement of American Hiking Society
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, on behalf of American Hiking Society and the millions of 
trail users our 201 collective organizations represent who spend their 
time, money and energy to get out on trails for recreation, health and 
wellness, and to volunteer, we thank the Committee for the opportunity 
to provide testimony on the importance of adequately funding our 
Nation's trails and public lands to ensure access for all. We ask the 
Committee to adopt the following funding requests so the Federal 
Government can continue to leverage private contributions and benefit 
from volunteer labor as well as provide inexpensive, healthy outdoor 
recreation options for your constituents and all Americans. 
Appropriations for Federal land management agencies requested herein, 
coupled with the significant resources provided by non-profit partners, 
serve to accelerate collective stewardship of our Nation's public lands 
and waters and enhance climate adaptability.

     (across agencies) restore staffing for federal land managers 
                            recommendation:
    Federal land managers, including those overseeing recreation and 
trails programs across NPS, USFS, BLM, and FWS sites, continue to face 
staffing shortages impacting the ability to adequately manage, 
maintain, and conserve the Nation's trails. Across the board land 
management agency staffing needs to be increased in order to support 
all aspects of trail management and maintenance, including volunteer 
engagement and partnerships, land acquisition, on the ground 
maintenance of trails systems that are desperately in need of attention 
to reduce maintenance backlogs, ensure that trails are safe and 
accessible, and address current and anticipated high levels of public 
use.

  Prepared Statement of the American Institute of Biological Sciences
    The American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) appreciates 
the opportunity to provide testimony in support of appropriations for 
the Smithsonian Institution, United States Geological Survey (USGS), 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) for fiscal year (FY) 2024. We encourage 
Congress to provide additional funding to the Smithsonian Institution 
in FY 2024, including at least $60 million to the National Museum of 
Natural History with new funding to support scientific and curatorial 
work. We urge Congress to provide the USGS with $1.85 billion in FY 
2024, with at least $395 million for its Ecosystems Mission Area. We 
further request that Science Applications (previously named Science 
Support) within USFWS be provided at least $55.5 million in FY 2024. 
Lastly, we request that Congress provide EPA Science and Technology 
with at least $967.8 million in FY 2024.
    The unprecedented loss of biological diversity and the associated 
negative impacts on human health and well-being are of significant 
concern. As human population grows and people increasingly come into 
contact with new environments and species migrating into new habitats, 
the risk of new diseases, such as zoonotic pandemics, is of growing 
concern. Biological diversity, however, offers a buffer against the 
spread of pathogens and contributes to environmental sustainability and 
increases our resilience to natural disasters. Robust Federal 
investments in scientific research and monitoring that improves our 
understanding of biological diversity and ecosystem function must be a 
priority as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. The agencies funded 
by this appropriations bill are centrally involved in conducting, 
supporting, and using this scientific research for public benefit.
    AIBS is a scientific association dedicated to promoting the use of 
science to inform decision-making that advances the biological sciences 
for the benefit of science and society. AIBS works to ensure that the 
public, legislators, funders, and the community of biologists have 
access to information to guide informed decision-making.
                        smithsonian institution
    Scientific collections and the professionals and scientists who 
collect, care for, and study these resources are a vital component of 
our Nation's research infrastructure and bioeconomy. Collections are a 
critical resource for advancing the knowledge needed to address current 
global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and 
pandemics.
    The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History 
(NMNH) is a valuable Federal partner in the curation of and research on 
scientific specimens. Scientists at the NMNH care for 146 million 
scientific specimens and ensure the strategic growth of this 
internationally recognized scientific research institution. To increase 
the availability of these scientific resources to researchers, 
educators, other Federal agencies, and the public, NMNH is working on a 
multi-year effort to digitize its collections and make the data 
available online. That effort will substantially increase the use of 
these collections by researchers, educators and students, and 
policymakers. NMNH is also working to strengthen curatorial and 
research staffing and to backfill positions left open by retirements 
and budget constraints. The current staffing level is insufficient to 
provide optimal care for the collections. Future curatorial and 
collections management staffing levels may be further jeopardized given 
prior funding cuts at science agencies, such as the USGS that, until 
recently, supported staff positions at NMNH.
    The budget for NMNH has not seen adequate increases in recent 
years. We urge Congress to provide NMNH with at least $60 million in FY 
2024 to allow the museum to undertake critical collections care, make 
needed technology upgrades, and conduct cutting edge research.
                         u.s. geological survey
    The USGS provides unbiased, independent research, data, and 
assessments that are needed by public and private sector decision-
makers. Data generated by the USGS save taxpayers money by enabling 
more effective management of water and biological resources and 
providing essential geospatial information that is needed for 
commercial activity and natural resource management. The data collected 
by the USGS are simply not available from other sources.
    The Ecosystems Mission Area is the biological research arm of USGS 
and is integral to the agency's other science mission areas. It 
provides the science needed to achieve sustainable management and 
conservation of natural resources and inform land and water 
stewardship. The USGS conducts research on and monitors fish, wildlife, 
and vegetation-data that informs management decisions by other Interior 
bureaus. Biological science programs collect and analyze long-term data 
not available from other agencies, universities, or the private sector. 
The knowledge generated by the USGS are used by Federal and State 
natural resource managers to maintain healthy and diverse ecosystems 
while balancing the needs of public use.

    Examples of successful USGS Ecosystem initiatives include:

  --Development of comprehensive geospatial data products that 
        characterize the risk of wildfires on all lands in the United 
        States. These products are used to allocate firefighting 
        resources and to plan wildfire fuel reduction projects.

  --Development and evaluation of control measures and other management 
        interventions for invasive species, such as Asian carp and sea 
        lamprey, that cause billions of dollars in economic losses to 
        fisheries, hydropower, recreation, and many other industries.

  --Development of the scientific understanding needed to combat the 
        spread of avian flu, white-nose syndrome, and other diseases 
        spread by wildlife in North America, including diseases that 
        can jump from wild populations to livestock, agricultural 
        systems, and humans.

    The USGS also supports critical science needed to respond to a 
number of national and global challenges. Examples of the important 
work conducted by the USGS include:

  --The National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers. This 
        program is responsible for developing the science and tools to 
        address the effects of climate change on land, water, wildlife, 
        fish, ecosystems, and communities. These centers play a vital 
        role in addressing the impacts of unique weather patterns on 
        ecosystem health across the country.

  --The National Wildlife Health Center. This USGS-wide program 
        investigates national and international wildlife health issues, 
        including the spread of zoonotic pathogens, such as the virus 
        that causes COVID-19. Zoonoses-diseases that spread from 
        wildlife to humans-can pose serious threats to human health and 
        cause significant disruptions to the economy.

  --Cooperative Research Units (CRUs). CRUs are located on 40 
        university campuses in 38 States. These research centers are a 
        cost-effective way for USGS to leverage research and technical 
        expertise affiliated with these universities to conduct 
        actionable research, provide technical assistance, and develop 
        scientific workforces through graduate education and mentoring 
        programs.

  --Environmental Health Research. The Toxic Substances Hydrology and 
        Contaminant Biology programs work collaboratively with other 
        USGS Mission Areas, and with many external collaborators to 
        study environmental contaminants and pathogens in the 
        environment and provide the critical science needed to help 
        Federal, State, and local government agencies, the private 
        sector, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholder 
        groups protect fish and wildlife health.

  --Research on ecosystems of concern. This research is a critical 
        component of efforts to restore and manage important national 
        resources, such as the Everglades and the Chesapeake Bay. The 
        Changing Arctic Ecosystems initiative conducts research on 
        wildlife and habitat responses to ecosystem change in the 
        Arctic to inform land and species management decisions and 
        address the needs of Arctic residents, including Native 
        communities.

    In summary, the USGS is uniquely positioned to provide a scientific 
context for many of the Nation's biological and environmental 
challenges, including pandemics, water quality and use, energy 
independence, and conservation of biodiversity. This array of research 
expertise not only serves the core missions of the Department of the 
Interior, but also contributes to management decisions made by other 
agencies and private sector organizations. USGS science also enables 
cost-effective decisions, as the agency's activities help to identify 
the most efficient management actions. Increased investments in these 
important research activities will yield dividends.
    We urge Congress to provide significant funding increases to the 
Ecosystems Mission Area. In recent years, the budget for USGS has 
stagnated. Failure to make critical investments in the research 
conducted by the agency will hamper long-term data collection 
initiatives, lead to critical data loss, and undermine the Nation's 
ability to address national challenges.
    We request that Congress fund USGS at $1.85 billion in FY 2024, 
with at least $395 million for the Ecosystems mission area.
                     u.s. fish and wildlife service
    The Science Support program within USFWS provides scientific 
information needed by the agency, such as research on conservation of 
priority species prior to Endangered Species Act listing, the impacts 
of energy production on wildlife, and best management practices for 
combating invasive species, and needs to be robustly funded. In FY 
2023, Science Support was merged with the Cooperative Landscape 
Conservation activity and renamed Science Applications to support 
science partnerships with States, Tribes, industry, local communities, 
and other stakeholders. The enacted funding for Science Applications in 
FY 2023, however, was lower than the combined FY 2022 funding for its 
two activities.
    We request that Science Applications be provided at least $55.5 
million in FY 2024, as requested by the Administration, with robust 
funding for activities previously under Science Support.
                    environmental protection agency
    Funding for EPA Science and Technology supports valuable research 
that identifies and mitigates environmental problems. EPA research 
informs decisions made by public health and safety managers, natural 
resource managers, businesses, and other stakeholders concerned about 
air and water pollution, human health, and land management and 
restoration. This program provides the scientific basis upon which EPA 
monitoring and enforcement programs are built.
    Despite the important role of EPA Science and Technology in the 
Federal Government's ability to ensure that people have clean air and 
water, funding for its programs in recent years has remained 
significantly lower than the level enacted in FY 2010. Although 
President Biden proposed to increase EPA's Science and Technology 
budget by 15 percent in FY 2023, Congress provided only a 7 percent 
increase. Strong increases in funding are needed for programs such as 
the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Research Grants Program, which 
supports extramural research that advances EPA's mission to protect 
human health and the environment, and the Global Change Research 
program, which develops scientific information that allows policy 
makers, stakeholders, and society to respond to climate change.
    Please provide at least $967.8 million in FY 2024 to support 
scientific research at the EPA. This much needed increase will allow 
the agency to provide resources for efforts to protect and restore our 
Nation's natural resources.
                               conclusion
    We urge Congress to sustain its bipartisan support for science by 
investing in our Nation's scientific capacity. Thank you for your 
thoughtful consideration of this request.

    Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony to 
highlight the funding priorities of the American Lung Association 
within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for fiscal year 2024 
(FY24). The American Lung Association is the leading organization 
working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung 
disease through education, advocacy and research. Between the toll of 
lung cancer, the prevalence of asthma and the harms of unhealthy air, 
investments in the Nation's lung health are critical. We urge the 
Committee to support $12 billion in funding for the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    EPA programs play an important role in efforts to improve lung 
health and save lives. The Agency is responsible for setting and 
enforcing national air pollution standards, supporting air quality 
monitoring and pollution reduction efforts and educating the public 
about air toxics and air pollution. With the passage of clean air and 
climate investments in 2022, EPA is also responsible for administering 
millions of dollars in grant programs to States, localities, Tribes and 
other entities to reduce pollution and improve health. Air pollution 
poses a threat to the health of all Americans, but some individuals are 
at heightened risk of health harms from breathing polluted air. There 
are nearly 34.1 million Americans living with a chronic lung disease 
like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Children, 
seniors, individuals who are pregnant and people who work and play 
outside are also more likely to suffer health harms. Additionally, 
people of color and with low incomes often face a greater risk of 
exposure to air pollution. The Lung Association's 2023 ``State of the 
Air'' report found that 64 million people of color and 14.6 million 
people with incomes meeting the Federal poverty definition live in 
counties that received a failing grade for ozone and/or particle 
pollution.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Provide $915.5 million for EPA's Clean Air Program. We strongly 
support robust funding for EPA in FY24 to ensure continued pollution 
cleanup. Funds under EPA's Clean Air Program are used in part to assist 
States, Tribes and local air pollution control agencies with 
implementing comprehensive air quality management programs to meet the 
National air quality standards. This program also includes testing and 
oversight to ensure vehicles are emitting lawful amounts of pollution 
into the air as well as efforts to reduce carbon pollution, methane, 
and other climate pollutants to protect public health from the impacts 
of climate change. Please provide $694.6 million for Environmental 
Programs and Management and $220.9 million for Science and Technology. 
Within this program area, the Lung Association specifically requests 
$181.2 million for the Climate Protection Program across Environmental 
Programs and Management and Science and Technology.
    Provide $500 million for State and Local Air Quality Monitoring 
Grants and $57.4 million for Tribal Air Quality Monitoring Grants. 
Accurately monitoring the air we breathe is the first step to 
addressing air pollution. Unfortunately, State, local and Tribal air 
agencies--who run most of the Nation's air quality monitoring system--
continue to face budget shortfalls and many areas are operating with 
out-of-date monitors. Grant dollars provided under Section 103 and 105 
of the Clean Air Act help fund air quality monitoring work, which 
informs the public of risks to their health and identifies areas in 
need of cleanup. Funds included under the American Rescue Plan and the 
Inflation Reduction Act were necessary to make some progress after 
years of underfunding, but are not a replacement for regular and 
dependable funding through the regular appropriations process so that 
air agencies can plan for multi-year, sustained investments in air 
monitoring. Both the National Association of Clean Air Agencies and the 
National Tribal Air Association conducted baseline needs assessments of 
their members to determine what would be needed to successfully 
implement programs under current and anticipated Federal requirements. 
The results showed that air agencies need increases if they are to 
adequately protect health by monitoring air pollution levels.\2\ \3\

    Provide $162.1 million for Compliance Monitoring, $391.4 million 
for enforcement and $369.1 million for environmental justice efforts. 
Compliance with EPA's air quality rules must be enforced to truly 
achieve the rules' intended health benefits. Investment in EPA's 
enforcement work is critical to ensure the public is protected from 
dangerous air pollution as the law requires. EPA must have the ability 
and funding needed to reduce non-compliance, as well as enforce 
penalties for violations. EPA must also be prepared to respond to civil 
enforcement actions authorized by the Clean Air Act. Additionally, air 
pollution does not impact everyone equally. The Administration has 
tasked EPA with prioritizing righting environmental injustices. To do 
so effectively, EPA needs dedicated funding for environmental justice. 
Please provide $162.1 million for compliance monitoring, $391.4 million 
for enforcement and $369.1 million dedicated for achieving 
environmental justice commitments.
    Provide $150 million for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act and 
Support the Clean School Bus Program. The Diesel Emissions Reduction 
Act (DERA) Program continues to receive bipartisan support. While 
progress has been made, millions of old, dirty diesel engines are still 
polluting communities and causing lung cancer. According to a 2022 EPA 
report, the Committee's continued investments in this program prove 
cost-effective, with monetized health benefits estimated to exceed 
Federal funding by a factor of 10. We urge the Committee to appropriate 
$150 million in FY24. Additionally, we urge the Committee to continue 
supporting the rapid transition to zero emission school buses through 
the Clean School Bus Program. The program has proven very popular, with 
around 2,000 applications for the first round of rebate funding. 
Millions of children ride a bus to school, exposing them to pollution 
from these dirty diesel engines. Investing in the transition to zero-
emission electric school buses will provide a safer, healthier 
environment for children, who are among those most at risk of health 
harm from breathing in pollution.
    Provide $5 million for EPA's Radon Program and $18 million for 
State Indoor Radon Grants. Radon is an odorless, colorless gas that 
seeps through the ground as it shifts and is the second leading cause 
of lung cancer in the United States. EPA's radon program and its State 
Indoor Radon Grants are the only nationwide tools that help prevent 
exposure to radon. States and Tribes depend on these programs to 
educate the public and fight this deadly carcinogen. We recommend $5 
million for EPA's Radon Program and $18 million for the State Indoor 
Radon Grants. Additionally, we recommend that the Agency prioritize 
SIRG funding to States are seeking to adopt or strengthen certification 
requirements for radon measurement and mitigation workers.
    Oppose all policy riders. Lastly, the American Lung Association 
also asks for your leadership in opposing all policy riders that would 
weaken key lung health protections, including those in the Clean Air 
Act. Policy riders have no place in appropriations bills, and the Lung 
Association strongly opposes attempts to include them, especially 
riders that would make it harder to protect Americans from air 
pollution.
    Investments in EPA programs are critical to protecting public 
health. On behalf of the Lung Association, I thank you for your 
consideration of these requests.
Sincerely,

             Prepared Statement of American Nuclear Society
    On behalf of the 10,000 men and women of the American Nuclear 
Society\1\ (ANS), I am pleased to provide a recommendation for 
consideration in the subcommittee's FY2024 appropriations bill. The 
American nuclear community is grateful to the subcommittee for its 
continued support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 
programs related to nuclear safety issues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The American Nuclear Society is the premier organization for 
those who embrace nuclear science and technology for their vital 
contributions to improving people's lives and preserving the planet. 
ANS membership is open to all and consists of individuals from all 
walks of life; including engineers, doctors, students, educators, 
scientists, soldiers, advocates, government employees, and others. ANS 
is committed to advancing, fostering, and promoting the development and 
application of nuclear sciences and technologies to benefit society.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For thirty years, the EPA's generic regulation for geologic 
disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) 
has not undergone a significant revision. The regulation is 
inconsistent with international approaches for repository public health 
and safety standards. Modern regulations in other countries focus on 
limiting radiation dose to individuals near a repository rather than 
attempting to protect the entire world's population through a set of 
radionuclide release limits. The nexus between the release limits in 
the current regulation and public health and safety is not readily 
apparent; as a result, the current regulation is ill-suited for 
instilling public confidence in effective regulatory oversight of a 
potential geologic repository.
    As a practical matter, if EPA began work tomorrow it would be years 
before an updated generic repository regulation would be available. The 
nuclear power industry has stored spent nuclear fuel safety and 
securely at reactor sites for more than half of a century, and Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission analyses demonstrate that storage can continue 
indefinitely, but that is not a responsible approach for HLW 
management. The Federal Government has a statutory and contractual 
responsibility to manage and dispose of HLW, but its program has been 
at a standstill for more than a decade. Whatever approach Congress 
ultimately decides to pursue for HLW disposal, an updated generic 
repository regulation will be needed, and one can be developed without 
prejudicing any particular course of action. Moreover, it's also worth 
mentioning that any proposed geological repository site will need an 
appropriate regulatory standard early in the process to support 
interactions with nearby communities on the topic of long-term safety.
    The bipartisan recognition of the need for advanced nuclear in 
Congress and the Administration in recent years should amplify the 
importance of starting work on an updated generic repository regulation 
as soon as possible. With several federally backed advanced nuclear 
power projects set to come online in the 2030 timeframe, the time is 
now to begin tackling the question, ``what about the waste?'' Sending a 
small signal to the American people that Washington is moving in a 
positive direction on HLW management to coincide with our countries 
advanced nuclear aspirations would be extremely beneficial.
    Therefore, we recommend the subcommittee include $2 million in FY24 
for the EPA to begin work on an updated generic repository standard for 
HLW.

      Prepared Statement of the American Psychological Association
    The American Psychological Association (APA) is the Nation's 
largest scientific and professional nonprofit organization representing 
the discipline and profession of psychology. APA has more than 146,000 
members and affiliates who are clinicians, researchers, educators, 
consultants, and students. Through the application of psychological 
science and practice, our association's mission is to make a positive 
impact on critical societal issues across the States.
    Many programs funded in the Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies bill provide essential support for our Nation's public health 
programs by helping to provide critical access to essential mental and 
behavioral health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.
    APA urges Congress to provide the following funding levels.
                       the indian health service
    APA Services urges Congress to provide at least $9.7 billion for 
the Indian Health Service (IHS). The IHS is currently funded at $7.1 
billion. The IHS provides Federal health services to American Indians 
and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). As the main Federal health care provider 
for AI/AN people, its main goal is to improve their health care to the 
highest extent possible. The agency provides a health service delivery 
system for approximately 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska 
Natives who belong to the 574 federally recognized Tribes.\1\

Disparities. Retrieved from: https://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/factsheets/
disparities/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Increased funding is essential for the IHS since this population 
has a lower life expectancy of approximately 5.5 years less than the 
U.S. all races population and often has a disproportionate disease 
burden compared to other populations.\2\ For example, American Indians 
and Alaska Natives die at higher rates than other Americans due to 
intentional self-harm/suicide, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
diabetes, unintentional injuries, and assault/homicide.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Ibid.
    \3\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    COVID-19 also highlighted how AI/AN communities were especially 
vulnerable to COVID-19, partly due to the long-term inequalities, high 
rates of poverty, and high rates of underlying medical conditions 
within these communities. Now more than ever, it is essential that 
Congress continue to address the needs of the most vulnerable. If more 
resources are not provided, the substantial number of existing health 
needs for AI/AN will become even greater.
    To effectively provide essential health care services, the APA 
requests that Congress fund the IHS at $9.7 billion for FY 2024.
                             mental health
    Within the Indian Health Services, APA Services recommends $164 
million be allocated to mental health services. This program is 
currently funded at $127.2 million. AI/AN communities often lack access 
to adequate health care, including behavioral health. Particularly 
striking are the suicide rates among adolescents and young adults in 
these communities. Suicide rates for AI/AN individuals between the age 
of 15 to 24 years old were 39.7 per 100,000, compared with the overall 
U.S. rate of 9.9 per 100,000. This rate is more than three and half 
times the suicide rates for males of all races in the age group. The 
suicide rate for AI/AN females in the same age group was lower than 
males at 20.2. per 100,000. However, this rate was still nearly six 
times the rate for females of all races.\4\ Furthermore, during 2015-
2020, 3,397 suicides among AI/AN individuals and 179,850 suicides among 
non AI/AN were reported. About three quarters (74.6%) of AI/AN suicide 
decedents were under the age of 44, compared to less than half (46.5%) 
of non AI/AN decedents.\5\

    Given the prevalent mental health concerns following COVID-19, 
mental health resources are even more critical now for all communities, 
especially those that have extensive histories of high rates of mental 
health concerns, such as American Indians and Alaska Natives.
    Therefore, APA requests that Congress provide $164 million for 
mental health services for the IHS to address the mental health needs 
of this community adequately.
                      alcohol and substance abuse
    Within the IHS, APA Services requests at least $309 million be 
allocated to alcohol and substance abuse programs. This program is 
currently funded at $266.4 million. High rates of alcohol and substance 
abuse in AI/AN communities are well documented.\6\ This serious 
behavioral health issue has a strong impact on the health of 
individuals and families. AI/AN communities are much more likely to 
report past-year alcohol and substance use disorders than any other 
race.\7\

    This population is also more likely to require alcohol use 
treatment than persons of any other ethnic group, with 1 in 10 in need 
of such treatment.\8\ These programs can be extremely helpful for 
individuals struggling with alcohol addiction. However, there is often 
a lack of availability of culturally sensitive treatment programs.\9\ 
The IHS is especially positioned to ensure such programs contain these 
culturally sensitive components in the treatment plans.

    For these reasons, APA requests at least $309 million for alcohol 
and substance abuse programs within the IHS.
                       indian health professions
    Within the IHS, APA Services requests $94 million for the Indian 
Health Professions account. This program is currently funded at $80.6 
million. We emphasize the importance of having psychologists who are 
aware of the cultural sensitivities of this community and can best 
address this community's needs. The Indian Health Professions account 
includes the American Indians Into Psychology Program (INPSYC). The 
program's primary goals are to increase the number of AI/AN with 
doctoral degrees in psychology and enhance the cross-cultural 
understanding and competence of non-AI/AN about AI/AN psychology. 
Together, these aims will help ensure the development and maintenance 
of AI/AN psychology career recruitment programs to encourage AI/AN to 
enter the field of psychology.
    More specifically, the program recruits and trains individuals to 
be psychologists. It also provides scholarships to individuals enrolled 
in schools of clinical psychology to pay tuition, books, fees, and 
stipends for living expenses. Additionally, the program seeks to engage 
directly with Tribal communities to provide greater exposure to the 
field of psychology. Finally, the program provides stipends to 
undergraduate and graduate students pursuing careers in psychology and 
training opportunities for psychology graduate students in Tribal 
communities.\10\

    With the higher rates of suicide and other mental health concerns 
for this community, APA values the importance of increasing the number 
of AI/AN psychologists.
    For these reasons, APA recommends $94 million for the Indian Health 
Professions Account.

                 Prepared Statement of American Rivers
    My name is Tom Kiernan, I am the President and CEO of American 
Rivers. Since 1973, American Rivers has protected wild rivers, restored 
damaged rivers, and conserved clean water for people and nature. With 
headquarters in Washington, D.C. and 355,000 supporters, members, and 
volunteers across the country, we are the most trusted and influential 
river conservation organization in the United States, delivering 
solutions for a better future. On behalf of AR, I would like to thank 
Chairman Jeff Merkley, Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski, and Members of 
the subcommittee for your leadership to reduce pollution in rivers, 
improve clean water access, safeguard public drinking water supplies.
    American Rivers is pleased to submit our full requests (see the 
full River Budget here and below) as part of the written testimony for 
the record. We address Department of Interior and Environmental 
Protection Agency programs among others. Today, rivers across the 
country face daunting challenges on the road to recovery. From algal 
bloom in the Great Lakes to water scarcity in the Southwest, we must 
use every tool at our disposal to ensure heathy rivers have a fighting 
chance to bounce back. Our water supplies are at risk if we fail to 
fund these key programs that enhance our ability to improve river 
health and grow our economy. These topline figures are backed by our 
River Budget Partners, a partner network of over 150 partner 
organizations including utility and state agency associations, fishing 
groups, small businesses, rural communities, public health 
organizations, environmental justice leaders, and more. We respectfully

         impact of cuts to critical programs have consequences
    We urge Congress to support robust and comprehensive funding for 
critical river health programs. Any reductions or cuts on a significant 
scale as proposed by the House would have damaging and detrimental 
impacts to our Nation's river systems and communities. In the arid 
Southwest region, which currently is experiencing severe drought, deep 
reductions to DOI and EPA programs undermines our ability to increase 
water supply and finance resilience projects in the Colorado River 
Basin, make drought preparedness and response effective across the 
West, and limits funding for dam and reservoir operations, and 
enhancements.
    The impact will be severe to underserved communities if the House 
proposal is enacted. Shrinking and smaller budgets in FY24 would 
greatly reduce the support for Tribal Nations--these communities have 
historically been underfunded and struggle keep their communities safe 
from natural disasters or fight climate change without the resources 
and technical assistance needed on the ground. Furthermore, these cuts 
can disrupt access to our National Parks including the National Wild 
and Scenic Rivers System which protects more than 13,000 miles of 226 
rivers in 41 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    Reductions mean rolling back meaningful progress and hampering 
efforts to restore and protect water bodies of national significance. 
Key geographic programs under EPA like those focused on the Gulf of 
Mexico, San Francisco Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, and the Great 
Lakes to name a few, if cut, can delay, slow, or stop economic activity 
and growth brought by tourism, hunting, fishing, and other recreational 
opportunities each region supports. In fact, outdoor recreation 
contributed $454 billion to the Nation's gross domestic product (GDP)--
roughly two percent which three times the size of oil and gas 
development and twice the size of motor vehicle manufacturing and air 
transportation. This is not the time to jeopardize jobs in river 
restoration and the water workforce. As you write the next 
appropriations bill, we ask that you make robust investments to these 
river health programs.
  water infrastructure requires significant and sustained investments
    Millions of Americans lack access to clean water. Decades of 
inadequate or insufficient funding has deferred maintenance to key 
projects and has pushed the Nation's water infrastructure to the brink 
of collapse. In February of this year, a train loaded with toxic 
chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, igniting a fire and forcing 
the release of vinyl chloride, a known carcinogen, into the atmosphere. 
This accident caused economic disruptions and killed thousands of fish 
in nearby streams and triggered concerns over the resident's surface, 
ground, and well water.
    In September 2022, residents of Jackson, Mississippi were without 
clean drinking water after heavy rain caused a major pump at the city's 
main water treatment facility to fail. A boil water advisory issued 
then is still in effect in certain parts of Jackson today. Across the 
country we are seeing aging stormwater and wastewater systems, and 
deteriorating sewer pipes. In West Baltimore, E. coli bacteria 
contaminated the water, a crisis again that blamed aging water 
treatment infrastructure. Aging water infrastructure is a serious 
threat to water quality. Congress must do more to fund our vital water 
systems to protect public health.
    Overwhelmingly, 95% of Americans think protecting water in our 
Nation's lakes, streams, and rivers is important. But the House's 
proposed budget fails to fully or appropriately address the dire need 
to make significant and sustained investments possible in water 
infrastructure.
    support additional funding to remove barriers for fish migration
    Barrier removal projects bring life back to degraded rivers. 
Projects can provide fish passage, improve water quality, restore 
habitat, eliminate the release of the methane (a powerful greenhouse 
gas) from stagnant water, and reduce the production of cyanobacteria 
and harmful algae. But barrier removal benefits extend beyond fish and 
other aquatic species. Many projects provide a measure of Tribal 
justice as many dams were built without adequate consideration of 
Tribal culture and food sources. In addition, roughly 70% of the more 
than 91,000 dams in the country are reaching their design lives and 
dangerous dam failures are becoming more common. In addition, more than 
1,400 people have died in the dangerous flow patterns that develop 
downstream of low head dams. Funding priorities set by Congress must 
work to reduce the drowning deaths at low head dam sites.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has highlighted a 
tremendous need for assistance with barrier removal projects. Despite a 
significant investment of Federal dollars, resource agencies have 
received more proposals than can be funded. Along with a growing number 
of barrier removal projects completed over the last two decades, the 
IIJA response demonstrates the need for increased long-term sustainable 
funding for projects. It also demonstrates a need for increased U.S. 
Fish & Wildlife Service staff to administer grants, provide technical 
assistance, and provide regulatory review to make these projects 
possible.
   increase federal funding and technical assistance to protect free-
                             flowing rivers
    There is also a need for technical assistance funding to be 
distributed to the Tribes and non-profit organizations who develop 
projects, provide technical assistance, and manage projects to take 
them from inception to completion.
    As one example, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are working 
together with American Rivers and Mainspring Conservation Trust, to 
remove the Ela Dam from the Oconaluftee River in Whittier, North 
Carolina. For nearly 100 years, the dam has fragmented the river and 
prevented an important Tribal food source, the Sicklefin Redhorse, from 
moving into Tribal territory. If funded, the land around the dam will 
be transferred to the tribe. Removing the Ela dam has many benefits, 
including the advancement of environmental justice for the Cherokee 
people, biodiversity protection and restoration of declining species, 
and climate change adaptation. The project will proceed with the full 
consent of the dam owner if the project is fully funded. The project 
team submitted a $10 million request to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife 
Service National Fish Passage Program and is awaiting a response for 
the funding and the agency's technical assistance.
               enhance wild and scenic river protections
    The upcoming planning processes, especially across National Forests 
and Bureau of Land Management planning areas, offer an opportunity for 
the agencies to come into compliance with planning requirements, but 
adequate resources, staff and training rivers must be provided. The 
number of staff dedicated to Wild and Scenic Rivers at all levels 
(especially the field level) has declined dramatically over the past 25 
years leaving the agencies understaffed and often unable to meet 
statutory requirements.
    The areas of largest need to meet statutory and administrative 
requirements are:

  --Increased field presence to assure active management for designated 
        and eligible rivers;

  --Increased field presence to assure proper planning during Resource 
        Management Planning as required by the Wild and Scenic Rivers 
        Act and under planning guidelines;

  --Wild and Scenic Rivers management and planning training for field 
        staff;

  --Development of active public-private partnerships for Forest 
        Service Wild and Scenic Rivers;

  --Support for participation in the Federal Interagency Wild and 
        Scenic Rivers Coordinating Council.

    Along with adequate funding we encourage you to institute 
transparency and accountability by creating a sub-category line items 
for the Wild and Scenic Rivers programs within the Forest Service, 
Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service's budgets to 
better track performance. Currently, it is challenging to determine 
from any readily-accessible public or internal document the annual 
funding expenditures for Wild and Scenic Rivers within these agencies 
larger budget category. Without true accountability it is difficult to 
measure results and to apply limited resources appropriately to meet 
the agencies' statutory mandates.
                               conclusion
    We need continued and sustained water infrastructure investments to 
address severe drought, and dwindling clean water supplies. Congress 
can ensure that our rivers and our communities not only survive, but 
thrive. In FY24, we ask that you support these funding priorities and 
exclude any anti-river policy provisions from the appropriation process 
because our lives depend on the health of our rivers. Thank you very 
much for this opportunity to provide testimony. For additional 
information, please contact Jaime D. Sigaran

                 Prepared Statement of American Rivers
  river budget: national priorities for heathy rivers and clean water 
                                 (fy24)
    Water flowing in our streams, rivers, and creeks is a precious 
resource: It comprises two-thirds of our drinking water and is critical 
to the health of our communities. Rivers also serve as critical 
habitats for fish and wildlife. Plus, rivers sustain our economies, 
connect our communities to nature, and buffer our cities and towns 
against the worst impacts of climate change. Tragically, many rivers 
nationwide are polluted, dammed, and degraded, and most of the Nation's 
water infrastructure is in a State of disrepair. With recent 
investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation 
Reduction Act, now is the time to ensure these much-needed funds are 
directed to clean water and river restoration projects that improve the 
lives and climate resiliency of people in rural and urban areas--and 
particularly Communities of Color and Tribal Nations, who are 
disproportionately impacted by water pollution, droughts, floods, and 
environmental degradation.
    We must ensure Federal agencies have the tools, resources, 
technical assistance, and capacity they need to solve today's complex 
water challenges. Federal investment in efforts including natural 
infrastructure and river restoration can make rivers healthier and 
water cleaner for everyone.
    The Fiscal Year 2024 River Budget outlines recommended Federal 
priorities for agencies, including the Department of Interior, 
Department of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency, to promote 
climate-smart agriculture practices, improve water infrastructure, 
restore watersheds, modernize flood management, and support dam removal 
and rehabilitation. The River Budget spotlights needs in five key 
categories:

    Promote climate-smart agriculture: Innovative conservation 
practices on farms and working lands can regenerate ecosystems, improve 
irrigation, and bolster agriculture. Yet water shortages are becoming 
increasingly common due to less rainfall, resulting in historic 
droughts. In 2022, the Mississippi River dropped to record-low water 
levels. In the Southwest, farmers, ranchers, and landowners are 
experiencing the most extreme drought in more than a millennium. In the 
Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations process and upcoming Farm Bill, 
Congress and the Administration must prioritize climate-smart 
agriculture to support rural communities, and a critical sector of our 
economy.
    Restore watersheds: From the Great Lakes to the Chesapeake Bay, 
watersheds are essential to keeping ecosystems healthy and functioning 
as nature intended. These lands naturally store water, filter 
pollution, sequester carbon, control erosion and sediment, and provide 
habitats for wildlife. These natural services help strengthen 
communities in the face of climate change, and can buffer us against 
severe floods, droughts, and fires. Healthy watersheds also provide 
recreation benefits, including fishing, boating, swimming, hiking, 
biking, and wildlife watching. In 2020, hunters and anglers contributed 
$149 billion to the National economy, supported 970,000 jobs, and 
created over $45 billion in wages and incomes.
    Modernize flood management: Inland and coastal communities need 
relief as environmental pressures and natural disasters including 
hurricanes and floods, threaten people and property. Nearly 41 million 
people live in flood-prone areas. Our nation needs to continue 
investing in flood-management solutions that protect communities and 
safeguard rivers. We call on Congress and the Administration to 
implement nature-based solutions to managing watersheds, floodplains, 
wetlands, and other water sources. This includes better coordination 
and use of modern mapping technology to produce maps that inform 
communities about flood risk, improve land-use management, and help 
them better prepare for extreme weather.
    Improve water infrastructure: Our nation's water infrastructure is 
essential to providing safe, reliable, affordable clean water. It is 
vital to public health, and to ensuring clean, healthy rivers. Every 
dollar invested in water infrastructure generates $2.20 in economic 
activity. Yet decades of underfunded and deferred maintenance has 
pushed the Nation's water infrastructure to the brink of collapse. Many 
cities hold, treat, and deliver water using pumps and pipes that are 
more than 100 years old. Older water systems contain bacteria, lead, 
and other hazardous chemicals, which exposed thousands to untreated 
water in Flint, Michigan, and Jackson, Mississippi. We must avoid 
humanitarian disasters by securing significant water infrastructure 
investments that protect the health of people and rivers.
    Remove and rehabilitate dams: Removing dams and improving dam 
safety can restore natural functions of rivers, help fish and wildlife 
species recover, create jobs, and increase our communities' resilience 
to droughts and floods. Dams disrupt the natural ecosystem by impacting 
water quality, cutting off migration routes, isolating habitats, and 
destroying fish spawning grounds. Some dams pose serious public safety 
risks. Prioritizing funding to remove, rehabilitate, and/or retrofit 
dams is the best way to bring life back to damaged rivers and protect 
communities.
    These Federal spending priorities in the Fiscal Year 2024 River 
Budget are a critical defense against the impacts of climate change and 
water pollution. The annual Federal spending process charges Congress 
to work with the administration and focus on investments that are key 
to restoring rivers, from remote mountain streams to urban waterways. 
Taken together, these investments will improve public health and 
safety, boost climate resilience, deliver economic benefits, and 
improve agency programs that are responsible and responsive to meeting 
community needs.

           Prepared Statement of the Animal Welfare Institute
    The Animal Welfare Institute, a national nonprofit animal welfare 
advocacy organization, asks the subcommittee to provide adequate 
funding levels for crucial wildlife programs and to include measures to 
protect at-risk species.
                   wild horses and burros (blm & fs)
    The BLM, which oversees the vast majority of America's wild horses 
and burros, continues to mismanage herds, relying on an endless cycle 
of costly removals from public lands instead of implementing 
immunocontraceptive vaccines to control fertility rates and manage 
these federally protected animals on the range. Under its current plan 
(based on the BLM's May 2020 report to Congress), the BLM has called 
for accelerated removals at a cost of roughly $900 million in the first 
5 years alone. In FY22, the BLM removed a staggering 20,193 wild 
equines. And while the agency spent over $95 million during this same 
period on removals and holding, it has historically spent less than 1 
percent of its annual WHB program budget on fertility control. We ask 
the subcommittee to again include a directive for a minimum of $11 
million within the BLM's existing WHB program budget to go towards the 
administration of proven and safe immunocontraceptive vaccines--
specifically the widely supported porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccine, 
as per the National Academy of Sciences recommendation. Moreover, we 
strongly support the continued inclusion of provisions to ensure that 
both BLM- and U.S. Forest Service-managed wild equines cannot be 
destroyed for commercial purposes in order to protect these animals 
from slaughter, as well as language preventing the destruction of 
healthy, unadopted wild horses and burros.
    Lastly, in recent years, the BLM has pursued attempts to manage 
wild horses via a risky and invasive surgical procedure known as 
``ovariectomy via colpotomy,'' which involves blindly locating the 
ovaries and severing them using a rod-like tool while the animal 
remains conscious. In its report on wild horse management, the NAS 
explicitly warned the BLM against using this procedure due to the risks 
of serious complications. Numerous lawmakers in the House and Senate 
have criticized the BLM's plans to ovariectomize horses and national 
polling shows overwhelming opposition to this procedure. We ask the 
subcommittee to include language barring the use of Federal funds to 
conduct ovariectomies on wild horses and burros so that taxpayer 
dollars can be directed towards cost-effective, safe, and humane 
fertility control methods such as PZP.
              endangered species act implementation (fws)
    We ask the subcommittee to appropriate $841.3 million across five 
programs to the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for the purpose of 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) implementation:

  --$66.3 million for Listing

  --$467.9 million for Recovery

  --$179.3 million for Planning and Consultation

  --$10.15 million for Candidate Conservation in Conservation and 
        Restoration

  --$117.7 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation 
        Fund (CESCF)

    Implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), our Nation's 
most effective law for species conservation, has been severely 
underfunded for years. The Fish and Wildlife Service requires a budget 
of $841.3 million across five programs to begin to make up for lost 
ground and put species on the path to recovery. As we face a worsening 
biodiversity crisis, this funding package will better allow FWS to 
implement the ESA in the way Congress intended when it dedicated our 
country to protecting the most imperiled species and habitats.
    The funding levels requested above would help FWS process the 
backlog of approximately 200 species on the National Listing Workplan 
that still need to be reviewed for protections under the ESA, with more 
species petitioned for inclusion under the ESA every year. It would 
also be put toward developing recovery plans for the approximately 25% 
of species currently without plans and revising the 890 recovery plans 
that are now over two decades out of date and may no longer contain the 
best available science.
    In addition, the above funding levels would provide much-needed 
resources for maximizing the efficacy and efficiency of FWS 
consultations with other Federal agencies, States, counties, and 
private landowners, as well as implementing early conservation actions 
that keep species from ever reaching the brink of extinction. Finally, 
the CESCF serves as an essential source of funding for States and 
private landowners, making it a crucial tool for cooperative 
conservation.
                          trophy hunting (fws)
    We urge the subcommittee to include language prohibiting the use of 
funds by the FWS for the issuance of any permit authorizing the 
importation of a trophy-hunted elephant or lion trophy.
    African elephant and lion populations in many nations have 
undergone steep declines in recent years. African elephants and lions 
are both listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), demonstrating a 
scientific need for heightened protections. Between the early 20th 
century and 2016, the number of elephants in Africa plummeted from 3-5 
million to approximately 400,000. In 2021, the IUCN Red List reassessed 
the African savanna elephant as endangered, meaning it faces a very 
high risk of extinction in the wild. African lion populations declined 
by 43 percent from 1993 to 2014. The subspecies Panthera leo 
melanochaita, comprising the lions of east and southern Africa, is 
listed as threatened under the ESA, with only 17,000-19,000 remaining.
    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has responded with a 
series of vacillating trophy-import policies, calling into question the 
degree to which the agency had evaluated whether lion and elephant 
trophy imports enhanced the survival of the species, as required under 
the ESA. Presently, FWS policy is to issue permits for lion and 
elephant trophy imports based on a case-by-case review of each 
application's enhancement finding requirements, rather than the former 
approach of having rules that applied to each species within each 
country of origin. Congress in its FY20-23 appropriations packages 
directed FWS to reevaluate the current policy and analyze how targeted 
investments and technical assistance to these countries would impact 
elephant and lion survival, improve local communities, and sustain 
species populations. FWS has failed to report back to Congress.
    In light of these conservation concerns, as well as the lack of 
assurance that FWS is adhering to the ESA's legal requirements, no 
funds must be provided for the issuance of permits for import of 
elephant and lion trophies.
                             trapping (fws)
    We urge the subcommittee to allocate $300,000 to the FWS to 
institute a 3-year pilot program that replaces the use of body-gripping 
traps (Conibears, legholds, and snares) on National Wildlife Refuge 
Service land by agency personnel with non-lethal methods and equipment. 
Furthermore, we hope the subcommittee will encourage the FWS to 
continue reviewing and updating both physical trapping signage and 
trapping information posted on the website, and continue providing 
trapping information to the subcommittee on an annual basis. In 
addition, for each refuge listed online as allowing trapping, the FWS 
should specify whether the trapping is conducted by private trappers 
for recreational/commercial purposes and/or by government personnel for 
management purposes.
    Furthermore, the pilot program language builds upon FY22-23 report 
language directing the FWS to conduct an evaluation of trapping 
practices by Federal personnel on Service lands, including an analysis 
of non-lethal alternatives to trapping. Given that FWS has not briefed 
the Committee on its findings, this request includes a directive to 
begin a pilot program to replace body-gripping traps with non-lethal 
methods for wildlife management purposes.
    The use of body-gripping traps by Federal personnel violates the 
mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System and is a threat to the 
safety of wildlife, humans, and pets. The purpose of these protected 
lands is clear: to be an inviolate sanctuary for native wildlife.
    Body-gripping traps, such as snares, Conibear traps, and steel-jaw 
leghold traps, are inhumane and inherently nonselective. The nontarget 
animals caught in these traps include threatened and endangered 
species, as well as family pets. Refuges are a very popular 
destination; the National Wildlife Refuge System attracts more than 61 
million visits every year. Additionally, many wildlife refuges are 
either close to or reside in urban areas. These traps are not an 
appropriate tool for wildlife management on national wildlife refuges 
where families enjoy spending time outdoors, and where anyone who trips 
a trap can become a victim.
    Nonlethal methods are often highly effective and FWS personnel 
would be serving both wildlife and outdoor recreation interests-such as 
hiking and nature photography, which account for approximately 86% of 
total recreation-related expenditures on refuges-by prioritizing their 
use.
                    beaver conflict mitigation (fws)
    Across the country, thousands of beavers are trapped, snared, and 
shot each year in an effort to prevent damage caused to property by 
beaver activity. However, this killing is often unnecessary due to the 
availability of cost-effective, nonlethal devices that can successfully 
prevent such damage. For example, trees can be shielded by encircling 
them with wire mesh fencing or coating their trunks with a mixture of 
paint and sand that deters beavers from chewing. Roads, agricultural 
resources, and other property can be protected from flooding by 
installing water flow control devices, which allow enough water to pass 
through a beaver dam to avoid flooding while ensuring sufficient pond 
depth for beaver use, thus maintaining acceptable water levels.
    Restraining traps and snares used to capture and kill beavers can 
cause prolonged pain and unintentionally injure and kill nontarget 
animals. They are also rarely, if ever, a long term-solution; beavers 
dispersing in search of suitable habitat can quickly recolonize trapped 
areas. By contrast, flow devices can provide long-term relief and 
typically last 10 years before they need to be replaced. Nonlethal 
measures to mitigate beaver conflicts are effective, cost-efficient, 
long-lasting, and ecologically beneficial. These devices can protect 
transportation infrastructure, buildings, agricultural lands, and other 
property. Despite these benefits, no Federal programs currently exist 
to promote or facilitate the use of these techniques.
    We urge the subcommittee to recognize the ecological benefits 
beavers provide to landscapes and ecosystems across the country by 
providing $3,000,000 to the Fish and Wildlife Service to institute a 
pilot program to provide grants to eligible entities for projects that 
seek to use nonlethal measures to achieve a reduction in damage to 
roads, railroads, bridges, buildings, airports, levees, dams, 
agricultural resources, trees, or other public or private property 
caused by beavers. Eligible entities are: States, Tribes; state, 
Federal and Tribal agencies, local governments, nongovernmental 
organizations, and landowners who have sustained property damage due to 
beaver activity in conjunction with one or more of these entities. 
Nonlethal measures are those that are not designed to grip, trap, 
relocate, injure, or kill beavers. Nonlethal measures include, but are 
not limited to, fencing and paint-sand mixtures used to protect trees, 
and water flow control devices used to prevent flooding and maintain 
beaver ponds at acceptable levels. To document the progress of this 
program, FWS should be encouraged to submit a report to the 
subcommittee describing activities under the pilot program each fiscal 
year.
                      prescott grant program (fws)
    We urge the subcommittee to provide no less than $2,000,000 for the 
John H. Prescott Marine vMammal Rescue Assistance grant program. The 
Prescott Program, led by the FWS, provides funding to eligible 
stranding network participants assisting stranded sea otters, manatees, 
Pacific walruses, and polar bears. Congress began to allocate funds to 
the FWS in fiscal year 2019 to implement the program. To date, the FWS 
has awarded $3.1 million in funding to conservation organizations and 
State agencies through the Prescott Grant Program. In fiscal year 2023, 
$2,300,000 was allocated towards this program. Given the rising number 
of strandings and the importance of marine mammals to the health of 
ocean ecosystems, at least $2,000,000 in funding is requested.

        Prepared Statement of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy
    On behalf of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC or 
``Conservancy''), I submit this request to increase the annual 
Operation of the National Park Service (ONPS) appropriation for the 
Appalachian National Scenic Trail (ANST, A.T., or Trail), a unit of the 
National Park Service (NPS) within the Interior, EPA, and Related 
Agencies appropriations bill. The current level of ONPS appropriations 
for the Trail, $2.023 million, is insufficient to fulfil the NPS 
obligations under the National Trails System Act (NTSA), relevant NPS-
related statutes, and the cooperative agreement with ATC. We believe a 
budget of $3.5 million is necessary to meet the needs of the Trail. 
Particularly as our Nation responds to the ballooning interest in 
outdoor recreation and upgrading our hard infrastructure, the current 
staffing and financial support for the Trail's park staff is 
increasingly incompatible with modern needs. Furthermore, combating 
invasive species and managing our public lands for biodiversity and 
connectivity are imperative; with the A.T., continued underinvestment 
could be catastrophic. We are grateful for the incremental increases 
Presidents Trump and Biden have granted, as well as Congress' continued 
support therefore. Additional funding remains needed.
    The Conservancy is the Sec. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization 
responsible for developing the Appalachian Trail and leading the 
Trail's Cooperative Management System, which joins the Federal 
Government, the governments of 14 States, 30 Maintaining Clubs (Clubs), 
and local and non-profit partners in caring for our iconic long trail. 
Our position with the Trail, outlining the vision of a continent-
spanning footpath, began in 1925 and is currently formalized under a 
cooperative agreement with the National Park Service (NPS). We work on 
daily basis with our partners in the NPS' dedicated park office for the 
Trail (APPA), as well as our partners at the USDA Forest Service 
(USFS), who are the local Federal land manager for nearly half of the 
Trail's miles and conserved ``Corridor.'' Because of our unique role in 
the Federal public lands system-as shoulder-to-shoulder NGO co-manager-
we are particularly qualified to offer perspective on how the park 
should be funded and operate. Specifically, because the park office 
funded by ONPS exists to do the inherently governmental work ATC, as an 
NGO, cannot do.
    Currently, the NPS office that administers the Trail has 10 
fulltime-equivalent employees (FTEs), supporting approximately 40 
Conservation-related staffers at ATC, who in turn supported 4,768 
volunteers in 2022 (contributing a total of 170,904 labor hours 
equivalent to $5,118,575 in labor costs). The $2.023 million ONPS 
allocation is not tied to any discernable metrics, such as size of the 
park, projected visitation, facility asset portfolio, natural resource 
value, or overseeing the public-private partnership that is the 
Cooperative Management System. The ONPS base budget is mostly consumed 
by staff salary and benefits, preventing project work or things that 
are, under the Service-wide calls, very difficult to fund except 
through a unit's ONPS allocation, specifically: providing visitor and 
park protection (including law enforcement to uphold the boundaries 
from illegal encroachments and provide public safety); processing 
environmental compliance documents (such as required by NEPA) and; 
overseeing (if not funding) resource management work. Visitor and park 
protection, compliance, and oversight, are the inherently governmental 
and ``non-delegable'' responsibilities of the ANST's ``trail 
administrator'' in APPA.
    The current, and reasonable, needs of the unit are more than the 
current cooperative management partners can support given the legal 
division of responsibilities. Comparatively, NPS units with far smaller 
acreage to manage and far less complex obligations and programs receive 
relatively much larger base budgets, including the 16-acre Springfield 
Armory with a base budget of $1.5 million; the 968-acre Appomattox 
Court House with a base budget of $2.104 million; and the 16-acre Fort 
Stanwix with base budget of $1.6 million.
    Visitor and Park Protection (VPP)/Law Enforcement: The law 
enforcement and coordination needs of the Trail are significant 
considering the ANST spans 14 States and 88 counties. These 
responsibilities can be broken down roughly into two categories: 
individuals threatening safety (criminal) and encroachments (civil). 
Both are commonly referred to as ``incidents'' and ``incident 
response'' is the general term used to mean ``responding to potential 
harm to the legal rights of the Trail and its users.'' Criminal 
incidents on the Trail posing a significant threat to public safety 
are, thankfully, rare. Much more common are civil incidents/
encroachments. The ANST itself includes over 2,000 fee tracts, 
containing 108,000 acres of lands with over 1,200 miles of exterior 
boundary line which is maintained and monitored by ATC staff and staff-
coordinated volunteers. Roughly 50 new encroachment violations are 
discovered each year, with 10% of those being severe in nature. 
Approximately 430 known (ATC-identified) ANST boundary violations have 
occurred over the past decade, many of which still remain unresolved. 
Examples of severe and ongoing encroachment issues include large-scale 
timber and resource theft, widespread ATV use, construction of 
building, homes, pools and patios, and waste dumping. It is the legal 
responsibility of the NPS to address these encroachments, something 
unpracticable with its current ANST law enforcement (LE) staffing of 
two FTEs. More than 50% of the Trail by mile and acreage lacks a full-
time NPS presence.
    The current-and preferred-management of the Trail places the Chief 
Ranger duty stationed at the Trail's administrative headquarters in 
Harper's Ferry, WV and the one FTE split between the ANST and BLRI 
(Blue Ridge Parkway) in southern Virginia, serving that region, and one 
FTE split between the ANST and GETT (Gettysburg National Military Park) 
serving that immediate region. For the NPS-managed Trail miles north of 
Harrisburg, the ANST relies on less formal staff sharing. ATC advocates 
for replicating the staff-sharing model across the mid-Atlantic and 
northern stretches of the Trail, stationing six individuals, working 
50% time on the ANST, in Maine, New Hampshire/Vermont/Massachusetts, 
Connecticut/New York, New Jersey/Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania/Maryland, 
and West Virginia/Virginia. Additionally, ATC staff and volunteers 
routinely assist in responding to Trail incidents and manage 
relationships with local communities, requiring training and support. 
Increasing VPP staffing on the Trail will improve the NPS' ability to 
connect to rural communities and safeguard the increasingly manifest 
desire of the public to recreate on our public lands, as well as 
promote information sharing between land managers and law enforcement 
officials.
    Resources Management: The majority of the management of any 
National Park System unit is the proper administration of natural and 
cultural resources and minimizing impacts from visitors. The ANST 
currently splits coordination for both these buckets between one FTE 
when at least two, and preferably three FTE, are warranted. Regarding 
natural resources, ATC staff and volunteers are responsible for all 
Trail-related maintenance as well as the stewardship and restoration of 
the Trail corridor lands as quality habitat for flora and fauna. The 
ANST's length (spanning 12 of latitude in the temperate zone), north-
south alignment, and changes of over 6,500 feet in elevation and the 
numerous peaks and ridges along the Appalachian Mountain chain create 
its topographically diverse landscape, protecting very high habitat 
diversity and connectivity while providing for a unique recreation 
experience. It is an important landscape in the eastern U.S. that 
offers large-scale continuity and important climate refugia, 
increasingly vital attributes in the highly developed and increasingly 
taxed eastern public land network. The ANST is one of (if not the most) 
biodiverse units of the National Park System. Except for the 
aforementioned FTE at the ANST, the majority of the funding for natural 
resources management is provided by individual and charitable 
foundation giving. Remarkably, there is no biologist or ecologist 
staffed to APPA.
    The A.T. is uniquely situated to serve as a barometer for the air, 
water, climate and biological diversity of the Appalachian Mountains 
and much of the eastern United States, which is what makes it an 
attractive place to explore scientific questions. The ANST leadership 
in APPA, ATC, and the USFS, has clearly identified the need for sound 
scientific baselines and trend information on environmental and 
resource conditions to inform adaptive management and stewardship 
activities. However, current capacity does not allow APPA to even 
entertain proposals from educational institutions and research entities 
seeking permission to use the ANST as a study area. Each year, requests 
for scientific analysis, evaluation and monitoring within the A.T. 
corridor, submitted through the NPS Research Permit and Reporting 
System, go unanswered and un-permitted. Each of these unfilled research 
requests is a missed opportunity for stronger science and informed A.T. 
management.
    In terms of its ``facility assets,'' or hard infrastructure, the 
ANST has one of the largest portfolios in the National Park System, 
unsurprising given that each foot of treadway, every rockbar, 
staircase, bridge, shelter, and privy (to name some examples) are 
classified as facility assets. The park's portfolio includes not simply 
hard infrastructure designed to realize the purpose of the park as 
recognized in its Comprehensive Plan, but many incidentally acquired 
structures which have outlived their usefulness or are no longer viable 
as park assets. Additionally, ensuring proper marking for the 
approximately 4,500 miles of boundaries-particularly the 50 percent 
thereof that is not surrounded by National Forest System land-is 
essential to maintain the integrity of the unit. ATC estimates 
approximately $1.6m worth of improvements to land records are needed, 
including placing boundary markings or conducting land surveys never 
undertaken. Managing the hard infrastructure of the park is one of the 
best-funded aspects of park management, due to the structuring of 
Congressional appropriations and the structure of the Service-wide 
calls (although removing hard infrastructure that is no longer desired 
is more difficult to fund), but if the Department failed to survey land 
upon acquisition, funding a survey comes out of the unit's base ONPS 
allocation. APPA's ONPS allocation does not reflect its facility asset 
portfolio or resource management needs.
    Compliance and Oversight: APPA staff depend on ATC staff and other 
cooperative management partners to collect information required for the 
completion of National Environmental Policy Act compliance for all 
treadway and Corridor related work. ATC staff are generally responsible 
for the completion of impact assessments, field monitoring and 
coordination with state Natural Heritage and wildlife offices. The 
development of these evaluations-as well as review of research permit 
and special use permit applications-must be signed off on by APPA 
staff. They are not necessarily onerous, but given the size of the 
park, there are a lot of them. For compliance under section 106 of the 
NHPA, APPA staff cannot delegate its obligations to ATC. Additionally, 
closer coordination with State and Tribal offices of historic 
preservation will further the ability of the ANST to address extant 
compliance demands as well as build the capacity to perform government-
to-government consultations with the identified Native nations with 
ancestral and/or reservation lands along the Trail. NPS staff cannot 
delegate to ATC government-to-government consultation or compliance 
responsibilities.
    Although much of the work that occurs within the bounds of park 
management is performed by ATC and Club members, APPA is responsible 
for overseeing all of the work of the cooperators. Close supervision is 
not needed-the expert, dispersed management and maintenance corps of 
the ANST operates so successfully in part because of cooperator 
independence-but oversight of cooperators is an essential function of 
APPA. Oversight includes ensuring the Visitor-in-Parks program is 
effectively administered and that required certifications and trainings 
are up-to-date. There must be sufficient oversight capacity at APPA, 
including staffing at least one individual beyond the superintendent 
who is responsible for the breadth of responsibilities captured in our 
Comprehensive Plan and in our cooperative agreement. ATC cannot provide 
the necessary oversight of itself that the Cooperative Management 
System requires.
    The ANST is an incredible public resource. It is also incredibly 
poorly funded by the NPS. In terms of its management system (the first 
federal-NGO partnership park in the U.S.), its footprint (connecting 
eight national forests, six other park units, two national wildlife 
refuges, and 78 state-conserved units), its visitation (estimated at 
over four million annually), its accessibility (a fee-less park within 
an eight-hour drive of half of the U.S. population), and its presence 
in the (inter)national consciousness. (the most famous hiking trail in 
the world), it is because of the strength of the Cooperative Management 
System that has made the park what it is today. ATC can neither perform 
nor fund essential park functions for the ANST, specifically APPA. The 
NPS is responsible for ensuring proper staffing to meet the non-
delegable obligations of park management. In terms of size, the ANST 
has more NPS-administered acreage than Biscayne, Voyageurs, or Zion 
National Parks. In terms of boundary mileage, it is second in the 
National Park System only to Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The 
Trail's normal visitation is now estimated at 4 million or more 
annually, placing it 18th in visitation within the System-higher than 
Grand Teton or Yosemite National Parks. It is physically present in 14 
States-more than any other in the System. APPA deserves an ONPS base 
allocation more in line with these attributes, which will allow for 
this public-private partnership to operate even more productively.

    Congress provided a total of $4.48 billion for State and Tribal 
Assistance Grants (STAG) in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 
(H.R. 2617), which was signed into law on December 29, 2022.\4\ Nearly 
$128 million above the FY 2022 enacted level, Congress continued a 
steady trend of annual increases directed to state, Tribal, and local 
environmental agencies through STAG, with FY 2023 appropriations nearly 
32 percent above FY 2013. Though under the STAG program, State and 
Local Air Quality Management Grants, which provide important support to 
air agencies charged with protecting air quality and public health, 
have not seen a similar appropriations trajectory. With virtually no 
change in enacted funding levels from FY 2014 through FY 2020, 
incremental increases beginning in FY 2021 brought the FY 2023 
appropriated amount to just under 11 percent above FY 2013.

    State and local air agencies utilize funding from these grants 
judiciously by strategically deploying resources, creating efficient 
programing and best practices, and relying on leadership and staff that 
are dedicated public servants. Through technically complex and resource 
intensive activities, agencies with delegated CAA authority:

  --Develop and update state implementation plans (SIPs) to attain/
        maintain National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and 
        improve visibility under the Regional Haze Program;

  --Serve as the Nation's primary air quality monitoring entities, 
        manage emissions inventories, and perform photochemical and air 
        dispersion modeling;

  --Implement Federal rules and standards for hazardous air pollutants;

  --Review, issue, and enforce air quality permits for a range of 
        sources, from small businesses to industrial and commercial 
        facilities;

  --Ensure facility compliance through inspection and enforcement 
        oversight, including conducting more than 15,400 Full 
        Compliance Evaluations (FCE) in 2022, compared to fewer than 
        200 FCEs conducted by U.S. EPA\5\;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ U.S. EPA, Analyze Trends: State Air Dashboard. U.S. EPA defines 
an FCE as ``a comprehensive evaluation of the compliance status of the 
facility. It looks for all regulated pollutants at all regulated 
emission units, and it addresses the compliance status of each unit, as 
well as the facility's continuing ability to maintain compliance at 
each emission unit.'' Data accessed May 9, 2023.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  --Hire, train, and retain qualified staff; and,

  --Lead public outreach and information campaigns, including 
        forecasting air quality, responding to complaints, and 
        conducting stakeholder engagement.

    State and local air agencies have led these efforts and continued 
to improve the Nation's air quality \6\ while administering 
progressively complicated and demanding operations that have had to 
accommodate growing inflation in expenses related to personnel, travel, 
equipment and building costs for monitoring sites. Budgetary challenges 
have also been compounded by the achievements of air pollution control 
agencies, as fees collected on a per-ton basis from major sources 
through the CAA Title V Operating Permit program have substantially 
decreased in revenue as the program meets its primary goal: driving 
emissions down to create better air quality. Coupled with expanding CAA 
obligations, current funding conditions make meeting core CAA 
responsibilities more difficult.

    The Administration's current regulatory agenda indicates there are 
79 forthcoming regulatory actions from U.S. EPA's Office of Air and 
Radiation (OAR).\7\ Of these, more than 70 are expected to be completed 
by the end of the 2024 Federal fiscal year, including 11 major/
economically significant regulations. Once finalized by U.S. EPA, State 
and local air agencies will be (or are already) at the forefront of 
implementation and planning for many of these rules, including:

    \11\ RIN 2060-AU37, Final rule expected October 2023.

    Apart from implementing these regulations, State and local air 
agencies will be responsible for associated permitting changes as well 
as evolving policies to boost engagement with communities. Already 
well-versed in working directly with communities, regulated industries, 
and other stakeholders in their jurisdictions, State and local agencies 
understand that melding new national environmental requirements with 
local priorities, economic strategies, and social needs will further 
impact current resources.
    Funding for State and Local Air Quality Management Grants that 
accounts for new and historic CAA mandates and increased 
responsibilities will be vital for State and local air agency budgets 
as well as ensuring the cooperative federalism balance needed for 
successful environmental outcomes. Providing maximum flexibility in air 
agency grants allows for programs to determine the best use for 
addressing air pollution control needs in their jurisdiction. 
Additional considerations that may affect State and local resources 
include how U.S. EPA alters the regional and state allocation formula 
for State and Local Air Quality Management Grants as well as 
maintaining funding for PM2.5 monitoring under CAA Section 103, rather 
than Section 105.\12\

  Prepared Statement of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit recommendations for Fiscal 
Year 2024 (FY24) Congressional appropriations. The Association of Fish 
and Wildlife Agencies' (AFWA) mission, since our founding in 1902, is 
to protect and enable state fish and wildlife agencies (States) to 
exercise their statutory authority to conserve and manage the fish and 
wildlife within their borders. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands are members.
    We look forward to working with you as we enter another challenging 
budget cycle to enact funding levels consistent with current funding, 
and in some cases higher than current levels to address critical 
conservation needs. Investments in conservation programs present some 
of the highest returns on Federal dollars and are fueling our Nation's 
recovery, providing jobs and economic stimulus, environmental 
resilience, and a robust health and science network to combat emerging 
diseases. As States have authority for and are on the front lines of 
wildlife health and zoonotic diseases, they must be engaged throughout 
development of a robust health and science framework to combat wildlife 
diseases. Further, we support and endorse appropriations 
recommendations that are submitted by regional associations of fish and 
wildlife agencies.
             united states fish and wildlife service (fws)
    Aquatic Habitat, Assessments, Restoration, and Species 
Conservation--We support no less than funding at FY23 levels for Fish 
and Aquatic Conservation and support the FWS' FY24 budget request of 
$7.6 million for the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHP), which 
includes funding for the NFHP grant program and $400,000 for the FWS to 
provide scientific and technical assistance support to the program. 
Further, we respectfully request full funding for the USGS, USFS, EPA, 
and NOAA to provide scientific and technical assistance to the program, 
as well as the inclusion of report language recommending that the USGS, 
USFS, EPA, and NOAA each provide the full authorized level of $400,000 
for scientific and technical assistance for the NFHP as authorized 
under Public Law 116-188. With full funding at congressionally 
authorized levels, this would ensure the NFHP Program's continued 
ability to advance aquatic conservation projects that benefit all 
Americans. We thank Congress for the one-time funding provided for 
aquatic organism passage infrastructure through the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, yet continuous programmatic funding for Fish 
Passage is needed to ensure successful species management. We support 
funding the National Fish Passage Program at no less than FY23 levels. 
Likewise, we are grateful for the infrastructure investments in 
geographic programs and support robust funding for conservation and 
restoration activities in the Delaware River Basin, Klamath Basin, 
Chesapeake Bay, Everglades, and Great Lakes.
    National Fish Hatchery Systems (NFHS) Operations is a high 
priority, and we recommend no less than FY23 funding levels. We support 
funding for the Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership at $1.2 
million as well as robust funding for the Fish Health Centers, Fish 
Technology Centers, Wild Fish Health Survey, and Mass Marking program, 
all of which meet needs of States, Tribes, and the Federal Government. 
We request no less than FY23 funding levels for the mass marking 
initiative in the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region.
    Aquatic Invasive Species and Law Enforcement (LE)--We request 
Congress continue to fund the implementation of state Aquatic Nuisance 
Species (ANS) management plans at no less than FY23 levels without 
compromising other ANS programs. We support no less than FY21 funding 
levels to implement the National Invasive Carp Management and Control 
Plan in the Mississippi River and tributaries as well as continuation 
of the provisions in the FY21 report language. Finally, we support 
increased funding to combat wildlife trafficking activities such as 
illegal turtle trade, conduct investigations, supplement inspections, 
and to work cooperatively with state fish and wildlife agencies to help 
protect our Nation's native fish and wildlife resources from 
unsustainable exploitation.
    Habitat Conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System 
(NWRS)--We recommend no less than FY23 funding levels for Habitat 
Conservation, including no less than $79 million for the Partners of 
Fish and Wildlife Program for voluntary conservation efforts. We 
support the Administration's request of $624.9 million for NWRS 
Operations and Maintenance and continue to support sustainable trapping 
on refuges to provide much needed research on species of interest as 
well as to protect imperiled species and their habitats.
    State and Tribal Wildlife Grants and Partnership Grants--The State 
and Tribal Wildlife Grants program is the only Federal program 
available to States to leverage non-federal funds to conserve over 
12,000 state Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) identified in 
congressionally-required State Wildlife Action Plans to prevent them 
from becoming threatened or endangered. This investment in voluntary, 
proactive, and state-led conservation is needed now to accelerate 
conservation of declining species to preclude an increase in Federal 
expenditures in the future under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). AFWA 
recommends $100 million, with no less than $75 million for 
apportionments to States and territories, for the State and Tribal 
Wildlife Grants Program in FY24, and supports enactment of legislation 
consistent with the Recovering America's Wildlife Act as introduced in 
the 117th Congress which would provide States, Tribes, and their 
conservation partners with the level of funding needed to do large-
scale, proactive, and non-regulatory conservation and restoration for 
many rapidly declining fish and wildlife. AFWA also recommends no less 
than $53 million for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund to 
conserve vital wetlands and other habitats important to migratory birds 
and other wildlife, full authorized funding for the Neotropical 
Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, and $22 million for the Multinational 
Species Conservation Fund.
    Science Applications--USFWS' Science Applications (SA) program has 
evolved into an important collaborator with state fish and wildlife 
agencies. The program provides science, landscape design, and 
coordination capacity for the co-development of regional conservation 
blueprints and provides support for regional fish and wildlife 
association landscape conservation collaboratives. This work is 
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of State-based fish and 
wildlife conservation by facilitating work at landscape scales. SA also 
supports other state priorities including revision of State Wildlife 
Action Plans, at-risk species conservation, grassland and pollinator 
conservation, climate adaptation, and One Health. We support the 
Administration's $13.5 million increase for Science Partnerships within 
the SA line item for core science activities and respectfully request 
that the subcommittee provide direction to ensure there are no 
reductions to the core program budget due to Community Project Funding 
requests.
    Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a critical focus for Science 
Support, and we request robust funding for USFWS to fulfill CWD 
responsibilities, including implementation of the Interstate Action 
Plan, prioritized research, monitoring, and studies of CWD in wild, 
free-ranging deer species.
    Ecological Services (ES) & Cooperative Endangered Species 
Conservation Fund (CESCF)--We encourage the FWS to continue 
collaborating closely with state fish and wildlife agencies to identify 
and conserve at-risk species, and recommend Congress provide robust 
funding for the CESCF, which includes a larger proportion of funding 
that is not tied to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and much 
needed flexibility for ongoing habitat management and species 
restoration activities as well as continued support of the use of State 
data, particularly under Section 6 grants to States.
    Migratory Bird Management (MBM)--We support robust funding for MBM, 
including a $1 million increase for the Duck Stamp Office to better 
engage with artists and promote sales within the Duck Stamp program. 
Additionally, we support full funding of the Migratory Bird Joint 
Ventures at $19.9 million and an increase of $20 million for monitoring 
and surveys of waterfowl and other bird species populations.
                 united states geologial survey (usgs)
    Ecosystems--We respectfully request no less than $34 million for 
the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit Program (CRU) in FY24. 
The additional funds would enable USGS to address 23 vacancies across 
the units and address the safety equipment and training backlog, as 
well as fund a new position for a Midwest Regional Supervisor and 
ensure funds for the Deputy Chief. Additionally, we support a $24.7 
million increase over FY23 levels for the Land Management Research 
Program, of which we recommend $5 million be directed for Migration 
Corridor research. We support the National Cooperators' Coalition's 
testimony on CRUs, and recommend $394 million in funding for the 
Ecosystems Mission Area. We support an increase of $11 million for the 
Species Management Research Program (SMRP) to maintain foundational 
research on numerous species and provide technical assistance for State 
agencies. Long term monitoring programs supported by SMRP including the 
North American Bat Monitoring Program, the Breeding Bird Survey, Bird 
Banding Lab, and the Amphibian and Reptile Monitoring Initiative, are 
critical to State agencies and additional resources for the SMRP will 
support the long-term conservation and management of fish, wildlife and 
habitat.
    We support the USGS' request for $87.3 million for Climate 
Adaptation Science Centers (CASC). The science and tools developed by 
CASC are vital resources aimed to support resource managers in their 
efforts to manage the Nation's natural resources in a changing climate. 
The CASCs provide vital research on climate change, the impacts of 
climate change to fish, wildlife, and their habitats, and the efficacy 
of climate adaptation efforts to build resilience to climate change. 
Additionally, the regional CASCs are important collaborators with the 
States in their regions and been able to increase the effectiveness of 
climate adaptation by providing the most relevant research focused on 
state needs within their regions, filling knowledge gaps in our 
understanding of vulnerabilities and responses of fish and wildlife to 
climate change and supported state priorities, including revisions of 
State Wildlife Action Plans. Monitoring wildlife for exposure to 
environmental contaminants is a critical part of the ``One Health'' 
paradigm adopted by the USGS. This need is particularly acute when 
considering the increased attention given to per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substance contamination by both the public and State and Federal 
agencies. AFWA supports the continued robust funding of the 
Environmental Health Program.
    Water Resources--We support robust funding for the Groundwater and 
Streamflow Information Program and recommend $32 million for Federal 
Priority Streamgages to address funding shortfalls and reinstate lost 
gages, $68 million for Cooperative Matching Funds including $33 million 
for Streamgage support, and $35 million for the Next Generation Water 
Observing System to enable additional pilot basins and data 
modernization. Finally, we recommend at least FY21 funding levels for 
the National Water Quality Program with $2 million for harmful algal 
bloom research.
    Biological Threats and Invasive Species Research Program (BTR) -
AFWA recommends $49.4 million in funding for BTR, in addition to $10.62 
million in continued funding for Invasive Carp research. We discourage 
any cuts to the Invasive Carp Program, particularly given the ongoing 
work between USGS, Canada, and border States to prevent establishment 
of Prussian Carp. We support $10 million for research on CWD in wild, 
free-ranging deer species to manage environmental contamination and 
control key sources of transmission. It is imperative that Congress 
provide additional resources to USGS Ecosystems and other Federal 
agencies to coordinate with the States on research, management, 
surveillance, monitoring, testing, disposal, best management practices, 
and other CWD management challenges. We strongly recommend $1.2 million 
for USGS to contribute to completion of the CWD Transmission in 
Cervidae Study.
    BUREAU OF LAND MANAGMENT (BLM)--AFWA supports robust funding for 
management of lands and resources. Recognizing States have authority to 
manage species within their borders, we recommend not less than FY23 
levels for Wildlife and Aquatic Habitat Management, including increases 
for sage grouse conservation activities, and for Rangeland Improvement 
and Bighorn sheep disease prevention, and additional funding for 
Wildlife Habitat Management (1170) to combat invasive species. AFWA 
recommends $154.8 million for the BLM's Wild Horse and Burro (WHB) 
Program as current funding does not provide enough resources for 
control efforts to outpace population growth rates. BLM estimates there 
are over 82,000 WHB across habitats with a total appropriate management 
level of less than 27,000. The harm inflicted on public lands from 
excess wild horses and burros compounds yearly as on-range population 
growth rates and off-range holding costs outstrip the BLM's ability to 
manage herds.
    OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT -The Abandoned 
Mine Reclamation Fund is critical to the restoration of lands at the 
nexus of many SGCN and water quality issues, and we support robust 
funding, as well as level funding for Regulation and Technology.
    UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE (USFS)--AFWA supports robust funding 
for Wildland Fire Management, as well as a substantial increase for the 
Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund. We recommend $328 million 
for State and Private Forestry, including an increase of $1.5 million 
for the Forest Stewardship Program. We support an increase of $252 
million for the National Forest System, and robust funding for 
hazardous fuels management. AFWA recommends that USFS receive robust, 
dedicated funding for WHB management within a newly specified line-
item, as funds are currently reallocated internally from other budgets. 
As USFS is responsible for 20% of the Nation's WHB, we recommend that 
the 80/20 ratio is continued for WHB appropriations across BLM and 
USFS.
    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)--Finally, we recommend robust 
funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and that funding be 
eligible for use on tributaries of the Great Lakes Region, which serve 
as a major conduit of invasive species introductions. We support robust 
funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund, Nonpoint Source 
Grants, and Pollution Control Grants. AFWA recommends at least FY23 
funding levels for the National Estuaries Program, the Beach/Fish 
Safety Program, and the Geographic Programs.

                                 ______
                                 
     Prepared Statement of the Association of State Drinking Water 
                             Administrators
    Summary of Request: The Association of State Drinking Water 
Administrators (ASDWA) submits the following recommendations for Fiscal 
Year 2024 (FY24) appropriations on behalf of the drinking water 
programs in the 50 States, five territories, the District of Columbia, 
and the Navajo Nation:

  --ASDWA recommends that all Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) 
        be funded without cutting funding for the State Revolving Loan 
        Funds (SRFs) capitalization grants. SRF capitalization grant 
        reductions are negatively impacting drinking water programs.

  --ASDWA recommends an immediate increase of $85 million for the 
        Public Water Supply Supervision (PWSS) Program, over and above 
        the funding gap identified in the ASDWA's 2020 Resource Needs 
        Report. This report determined that the PWSS funding gap in 
        2020 would be $375 million, increasing to $469 million by 2029. 
        The $85 million in immediate additional funding is from the 
        2024 convergence of the deadlines for the initial lead service 
        line inventories under the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions 
        (LCRR), the final Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI), the 
        final regulation for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
        (PFAS), the final Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) Rule 
        Revisions, and the inclusion of cybersecurity in sanitary 
        surveys.

  --ASDWA recommends funding the SRFs to the full authorizations of $3 
        billion each.

    ASDWA urges sufficient funding for the drinking water programs for 
improving public health protection and increasing economic stability 
and prosperity across the country.
                   congressionally directed spending
    ASDWA requests that all Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) be 
funded without cutting funding to the SRFs. The current approach to 
fund the CDS projects at the expense of the SRF capitalization grants 
is catastrophic for state drinking water programs through reductions in 
the set-asides and in the funding that can revolve in perpetuity 
through loan repayments. The set asides fund state drinking water 
program staff that implement the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) 
requirements. Reductions in the set-asides could threaten the ability 
of some States to maintain SDWA primacy. The total House FY24 requested 
funding CDS of $1,126,088,000 for drinking water projects (noting that 
this does not include Senate FY24 requests) is greater than the FY22 
capitalization grant for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund 
(DWSRF) of $1,126,088,000. If all the House requested CDS projects are 
funded, the DSWRF would be zeroed out. This is gravely concerning. A 
sustainable and separate funding source is needed for the CDS projects, 
now and in the future. States have significant concerns about the 
sustainability of their programs with the funding reductions from the 
reductions in the set-asides. With the reductions in set-asides, States 
cannot maintain needed technical assistance programs and staff 
assistance to systems to meet their ongoing regulatory and 
infrastructure needs. These programs largely benefit small, rural 
communities as well as disadvantaged communities.
           the public water system supervision (pwss) program
    ASDWA recommends an immediate increase of PWSS funding by $85 
million due to the convergence of multiple mandates in 2024.
    How the PWSS Program Operates: To meet the requirements of the 
SDWA, States have accepted primary enforcement responsibility for 
regulatory compliance and technical assistance for more than 150,000 
public water systems to ensure health-based violations do not occur or 
are fixed expediently. This involves 91 federally regulated 
contaminants, and the complexity of regulations has increased in the 
past decade. Beyond the contaminants covered by Federal drinking water 
regulations, States are also implementing an array of proactive 
initiatives to protect public health and the environment, such as 
source water protection, technical assistance for water treatment and 
distribution, and enhancement of water system performance. State 
activities go well beyond simply ensuring compliance at the tap. Demand 
for these activities continues to increase due to new regulatory and 
non-regulatory actions such as the 2024 convergence of the deadlines 
for the initial lead service line inventories under the Lead and Copper 
Rule Revisions (LCRR), the final Lead and Copper Rule Improvements 
(LCRI), the final regulation for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
(PFAS), the final Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) Rule Revisions, and 
the inclusion of cybersecurity in sanitary surveys.
    Why Adequate Support is Needed: States will be unable to protect 
public health without adequate Federal funding. Inadequate Federal 
support for state drinking water programs has several negative 
consequences. For example, as part of ASDWA's comments on EPA's 
proposed Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR), ASDWA updated its Costs 
of States' Transaction Study (CoSTS). This study found that the LCRR 
will increase state staff hours by 835,000 hours annually over the 
current Lead and Copper Rule in its first 5 years of implementation, at 
a cost to States of approximately $50 million annually. Primacy 
agencies will face a significant increase in staff demands with the 
submissions of the initial lead service line inventories in 2024.
    In addition to the LCRR, primacy agencies will face increased 
resource demands with the final PFAS regulation, the final Consumer 
Confidence Report (CCR) Rule, and cybersecurity. ASDWA estimates that 
the PFAS rule will increase state staff hours by 469,000 hours annually 
in its first 5 years of implementation, costing the States $27 million 
annually. Additional costs of $8 million annually will result from the 
Consumer Confidence Report Revisions and the inclusion of cybersecurity 
in sanitary surveys. The total increase in the state burden is $85 
million annually.
    Without the additional PWSS funding, States will have to make tough 
decisions about how to prioritize support to existing programs to 
implement the requirements of the final LCRR, the final PFAS rule, the 
revisions to the CCR rule, and cybersecurity. States want to offer the 
flexibilities allowed under existing rules to local water systems, 
however, fewer state resources mean less opportunity to work 
individually with water systems to improve public health protection.
    State drinking water programs are already hard pressed financially. 
State-provided funding has historically compensated for inadequate 
Federal funding, but state budgets have been variable for the past few 
years, given the COVID-19 and other economic issues. Insufficient 
Federal support for the PWSS program increases the likelihood of 
scenarios that put the public's health at risk. This is an untenable 
situation, as the long-standing regulatory oversight remains constant, 
new rules require additional regulatory oversight, and proactive 
actions that should be maintained such as technical assistance and 
source water protection have increased States' workloads. States 
consistently step in to help solve problems and return systems to 
compliance and to providing safe water as quickly as possible. Any 
reduction in Federal funding for state water programs, no matter how 
small, exacerbates the existing financial difficulties.
    ASDWA recommends that the PWSS Program be funded at $207 million in 
FY24 (a $85 million increase), recognizing that this increase would not 
close the funding gap: The number of regulations requiring state 
implementation and oversight as well as performance expectations 
continue to grow while the Federal funding increases have not kept 
pace. Inflation has further eroded the static funding levels. The 
requested funding amount is based on ASDWA's 2020 Resource Needs 
Report, which found the funding gap for the PWSS program in 2020 to be 
$375 million, increasing to $469 million by 2029. The funding gap has 
increased by $197 million since the previous analysis in 2011 due to 
inflation and the increasing demands on State programs to maintain 
current regulatory oversight and to provide oversight on new rules. The 
Federal share of program funding has decreased by 8% since the previous 
analysis in 2011. Increased PWSS funds are urgently needed for 
implementing existing drinking water rules, taking on the new rules, 
and to negate the eroding effects of inflation. This is a small price 
to pay for public health protection.
          the drinking water state revolving loan fund program
    ASDWA recommends that Congress fund the DWSRF at the full 
authorization--$3 billion. In 2021, Congress recognized the need for 
increased funding for water infrastructure by reauthorizing the SRFs in 
the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act in the IIJA. 
However, Congress has not funded the SRFs to the newly authorized 
levels to meet this need.
    How the DWSRF Program Operates: Drinking water in the U.S. is among 
the safest and most reliable in the world, but it is threatened by 
aging infrastructure and emerging contaminants. Through low interest 
loans provided by the DWSRF, States help water systems overcome these 
threats. Since its inception, the DWSRF has provided funding for 
projects that enhance drinking water systems and protect public health. 
Through the DWSRF program, $21.1 billion in Federal capitalization 
grants since 1997 have been leveraged by States into over $41.1 billion 
in infrastructure loans to 14,500 communities across the country. About 
26% of the cumulative DWSRF funding, including low- and negative-
interest loans, has been provided to small, rural, and disadvantaged 
communities. Such investments pay tremendous dividends--both in 
supporting our economy and in protecting public health. For every $1 
invested in the DWSRF from the Federal Government, $2 has gone to 
communities. States have effectively and efficiently leveraged Federal 
dollars with state contributions. An important feature of the DWSRF 
program is the state ``set-aside'' fund component, a key reason to 
fully fund this critical program. Set-asides provide a process for 
States to work with water systems to maintain compliance and avoid 
violations. States may reserve up to 31% of these funds for a variety 
of critical tasks, such as increasing the technical, managerial, and 
financial capacity of water systems, providing training and 
certification for water system operators, and continuing source water 
protection efforts. Set-asides are an essential source of funding for 
States' core programs and these efforts work in tandem with 
infrastructure loans.
    Drinking Water Infrastructure Investment is Well below the 
Documented Need: EPA's 6th Drinking Water Needs Survey concluded that 
$427.6 billion of capital investment was needed for the next 20 years. 
The total translates to $21.4 billion annually. Continued investment is 
needed for aging treatment plants, storage tanks, pumps, and 
distribution lines that carry water to our Nation's homes, businesses, 
and schools. Unlike other water infrastructure funding programs, the 
DWSRF offers project subsidization for disadvantaged communities, funds 
for training and technical assistance, and is a fundamental funding 
mechanism for many medium and small utilities who would pay much higher 
interest rates if forced to use the bond market. The DWSRF plays a key 
role in keeping infrastructure projects and upgrades affordable for 
many communities.
    Conclusion: States need sustained Federal support through the PWSS 
and DWSRF programs to maintain public health protection and to support 
the needs of the water systems they oversee. These programs provide 
most of the funding for States to work with drinking water utilities to 
ensure the state-federal regulatory partnership ensures that American 
citizens have safe and adequate water supplies. Vibrant and sustainable 
communities, their citizens, workforce, and businesses all depend on a 
safe and reliable supply of drinking water. Over 90% of the population 
receives water used for bathing, cooking, and drinking comes from a 
water system that is overseen by State drinking water program 
personnel. Water systems--as well as the cities, villages, schools, and 
businesses they support--rely on state drinking water programs to 
ensure they comply with all applicable Federal requirements. In 
addition to the water we drink in our homes, water produced by water 
systems is also used to fight fires, transport wastewater, cook, wash 
clothes and dishes, as well as by businesses for manufacturing, food 
processing, and cooling. State drinking water programs must have 
adequate funding to protect public health and maintain the economic 
health of communities. Contamination events and water supply 
interruptions across the country serve as stark reminders of the 
critical nature of the work that state drinking water programs do--
every day--and the reason the funding for state drinking water programs 
must be not only sustained but increased to match the increased 
regulatory burden.
    ASDWA recommends Congress fully fund state drinking water programs 
in the FY 24 to protect public health and drinking water across the 
Nation. States are willing and committed partners, however, additional 
Federal funding is needed to meet the ongoing and growing regulatory 
and infrastructure needs. Strong state drinking water programs 
supported by the federal-state partnership will ensure the quality of 
drinking water in this country will continue to improve so the public 
knows that a glass of water is safe to drink no matter where they live.

                                 ______
                                 
      Prepared Statement of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums
    Thank you Chair Merkley and Ranking Member Murkowski for the 
opportunity to submit testimony about the priorities of the Association 
of Zoos and Aquariums for Fiscal Year 2024. My name is Dan Ashe, and I 
am the President and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums 
(AZA). Founded in 1924, the AZA is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization 
dedicated to ensuring that our more than 250 accredited zoos, 
aquariums, nature and science centers, and related facilities reflect 
the global standard of excellence in animal care and welfare, 
conservation, education, science, and guest experience. AZA's member 
facilities are examples of how economic and environmental prosperity 
can work hand-in-hand. Our members welcome nearly 200 million visitors 
annually, generating more than $22 billion in economic activity, and 
supporting more than 198,000 jobs across the country. They also 
contribute well over $200 million in direct support for field 
conservation each year. They support work in 117 countries benefiting 
more than 954 species and subspecies, of which 225 are listed under the 
ESA.
    At the heart of AZA is its mandatory accreditation requirement, 
which assures that only those zoos and aquariums that meet the highest 
standards can become members. The independent and objective AZA 
accreditation process includes self-evaluation, rigorous on-site 
inspection, and critical peer review. Our standards are publicly 
available and are continuously evolving and improving as we learn more 
about the needs of the animals in our care. Once earned, AZA 
accreditation confers best-in-class status, an important message for 
local, State, and Federal Governments and the visiting public. AZA 
accreditation is the global gold standard for modern zoological 
facilities.
    AZA and its members are leaders, partners, and participants in 
species conservation. We work in concert with Congress, the Federal 
agencies, conservation organizations, State governments, the private 
sector, and the general public to conserve our wildlife heritage. AZA's 
Wildlife Trafficking Alliance is a coalition of private companies, non-
profit organizations, and AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums working 
closely with U.S. government agencies to combat wildlife trafficking 
worldwide. AZA and its member facilities have long-standing 
partnerships with the USFWS, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
Our collaborative efforts have focused on:

  --Engaging in endangered species recovery and reintroduction, 
        including some of the most successful and heralded recovery 
        efforts, such as California condor and black-footed ferret;

  --Carrying out rescue, rehabilitation, and confiscation of tens of 
        thousands of animals in collaboration with Federal and State 
        agencies, including USFWS, to the benefit of many threatened 
        and endangered species;

  --Supporting conservation domestically and internationally through 
        multinational species conservation funds and state wildlife 
        grants; and

  --Partnering with USFWS, the National Park Service and others on 
        migratory birds, freshwater and saltwater fisheries, national 
        marine sanctuaries, illegal wildlife trade, amphibians, and 
        invasive species.

    I am submitting testimony in support of the following key programs 
funded through the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
appropriations bill.
                 u.s. fish and wildlife service budget
    The 198,000 jobs and $22 billion in economic contributions, as well 
as the vital conservation work supported by AZA-accredited facilities 
depends on adequate USFWS staff levels. Recently, Senator Murkowski 
joined Senators Sullivan, Whitehouse, and others in authoring a letter 
to the Department of the Interior. The letter articulates how, during 
the past several years, lengthy permitting delays have become the rule, 
rather than the exception. Often, these delays put the welfare of 
animals and crucial conservation projects at jeopardy. They are a 
serious hinderance to AZA's science-based conservation breeding 
programs that require animals to be moved in an efficient, humane, and 
timely manner. This is particularly acute and serious within the 
International Affairs program (Management and Scientific Authorities). 
AZA is keenly interested in expanding our critical work in support of 
rescue, rehabilitation, and reintroduction of threatened and endangered 
species, care and placement of live confiscated wildlife seized at the 
ports/borders, and on scientific and conservation research on species 
like polar bears in AZA facilities. The success of these important 
initiatives depends on the effective permitting from USFWS.
    For this reason, we request that the subcommittee include specific 
direction for the Management and Scientific Authority to enter into a 
Memorandum of Agreement, and hire and support a dedicated and qualified 
employee to facilitate zoo and aquarium permitting.
    We also request dedicated funding for the Office of Law Enforcement 
to support design and implementation of a nationwide ``confiscations 
network.'' As we battle the global epidemic of wildlife trafficking, 
and as the USFWS continues to improve detection and interruption of 
trafficking routes and syndicates, confiscated animals are the 
casualties. They are the unfortunate refugees from this crisis and need 
to be placed, and often held for lengthy periods, as evidence. Their 
care often requires very specialized and expensive expertise. USFWS 
often comes to AZA and its members for this assistance, and we need a 
comprehensive national framework that will provide the care and welfare 
of confiscated wildlife. One that will allow law enforcement agents to 
get on with the job of enforcement, and not let criminals escape as 
agents deal with placing animals.
       endangered species recovery and recovery challenge grants
    We express our gratitude for the subcommittee's continued support 
for increasing funding for endangered species through the Recovery 
account and working with our partners at USFWS to create the Endangered 
Species Recovery Challenge Grant program in fiscal year 2018. This 
program recognizes the critically important role of nonprofit partners 
to the Service's endangered species recovery efforts, and it is a 
mechanism, through merit-based matching grants, to provide funding in a 
more commensurate manner to support and enhance these efforts. Recovery 
Challenge Grants are limited to nonprofit organizations implementing 
the highest priority recovery actions identified in recovery plans, 
such as for genetically sound breeding, rearing, and reintroduction 
programs.
    We urge you to continue to provide robust funding for endangered 
species recovery and prioritize longstanding recovery efforts in which 
existing resources and partner expertise can be most effectively 
leveraged. Specifically, we are requesting an increase in funding for 
the Recovery Challenge Grant program to $15 million in FY2024. This 
funding will power recovery partnerships and inspire their work to 
better recover critically endangered species.
                multinational species conservation funds
    AZA supports the inclusion of $30 million for the Multinational 
Species Conservation Funds (MSCF) administered by USFWS. These programs 
support public-private partnerships that conserve wild tigers, Asian 
and African elephants, rhinos, great apes, freshwater turtles, 
tortoises, and marine turtles in their native habitats. Through the 
MSCF programs, the United States supplements the efforts of developing 
countries that are struggling to balance the needs of their human 
populations and endemic wildlife. These programs help to sustain 
wildlife populations, address threats such as poaching and illegal 
trade, reduce human-wildlife conflict, and protect essential habitat. 
USFWS is seen as a global conservation leader in large part due to its 
commitment to international conservation efforts. This Federal program 
supports AZA-accredited facilities in their field conservation efforts 
and partnerships with USFWS.
                         endangered species act
    AZA and its members enthusiastically support the ESA, which has 
saved hundreds of listed species from extinction. Like AZA 
accreditation, the ESA is the global ``gold standard.'' It reflects our 
National commitment to species and ecosystem conservation, and it is 
working. Since its inception in 1973, it has prevented the extinction 
of 99% of the species it protects. However, we know that the challenges 
facing our planet in the 21st century are as complex as they are 
urgent. Scientists estimate that the total number of mammals, birds, 
reptiles, amphibians, and fish has declined by more than 50% since 
1970, and many believe, including me, that we are living amidst the 
planet's sixth mass extinction. Climate change is accelerating this 
crisis. Without critical intervention today, we are facing the very 
real possibility of losing some of our planet's most magnificent 
creatures such as lions, cheetahs, elephants, gorillas, sea turtles, 
and sharks.
    AZA-accredited facilities have a unique opportunity and 
responsibility to help others understand this crisis. It is our 
obligation--to these animals and to all life on earth--to take bold 
action now to protect our planet's biodiversity. One achievement that 
has gone unnoticed by most people is that zoos and aquariums have 
played a significant role in bringing over 25 species, including 
California condor, Florida manatee, and black-footed ferret, back from 
the brink of extinction.
    Although we have made significant progress in saving endangered 
species, this work is far from done. Species protection and 
conservation requires long-term commitment by all of us. It is through 
the ongoing work related to species recovery plans that we will 
conserve these species for future generations. The AZA and its members 
support the ESA, and we encourage you to assure that the agencies 
responsible for carrying out the mandates of the act receive the 
necessary funding and human resource capacity to succeed.
                    american rescue plan act funding
    Finally, we appreciate the subcommittee's support for $30 million 
in the ``American Rescue Plan Act'' (Public Law 117-2) for the care of 
captive species listed under the ESA and rescued and confiscated 
wildlife in facilities experiencing lost revenues due to COVID-19. 
Under a cooperative agreement with USFWS to implement this provision, 
AZA is providing reimbursements to eligible facilities that cared for 
endangered and threatened species and rescued and confiscated wildlife 
and that experienced earned revenue declines as a result of the COVID-
19 pandemic. Funds have been directed toward reimbursing eligible 
facilities for the following three captive care categories: 1) U.S. 
native plant and animal species listed under the ESA); 2) U.S. native 
wildlife listed under the ESA rescued from the wild; and/or 3) wildlife 
confiscated by the U.S. government at, or destined for, U.S. ports and 
borders and held in animal care facilities. AZA is completing review of 
a small number of remaining applications in the first round of funding 
and will open up a second round of reimbursement opportunities in late 
May 2023. With the success of this effort to fund some of the critical 
conservation work of facilities like those accredited by AZA, we hope 
to work with the subcommittee and USFWS to determine and develop 
similar future funding opportunities that address these essential 
ongoing wildlife conservation efforts.
    AZA and its members look forward to continuing to work with this 
subcommittee and Congress to assure that as a nation we are devoting 
the necessary resources to conserve wildlife at home and globally.

                                 ______
                                 
          Prepared Statement of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers
    On behalf of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the voice for our 
wild public lands, waters and wildlife, I write in support of robust 
funding levels and critical funding increases for many key programs 
within the fiscal year 2024 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations bill. Programs within your subcommittee directly drive 
important economies related to our Nation's hunting, fishing and 
outdoor recreation industries with millions of Americans annually 
generating $862 billion.
    As we enter the FY2024 budget cycle, BHA encourages this 
subcommittee to invest in the natural resource programs within the U.S. 
Department of Interior, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Geological 
Service that sustain fish and wildlife habitat, drive hunting and 
fishing opportunities, enhance public access, and create economic 
stability in America. BHA is motivated to work with you and the 
authorizing committees on identifying strategic funding solutions that 
benefit future generations of hunters and anglers.
                    land and water conservation fund
    BHA strongly supported the Great American Outdoors Act which 
permanently and fully funded the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
(LWCF). The $900 million floor for LWCF doesn't burden taxpayers and in 
fact expands economic support to rural communities, enhances public 
recreational access, and conserves quality fish and wildlife habitats.
    BHA supports the allocation of an additional $450 million in 
discretionary funding to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities 
to leverage funding and prioritize projects with partners in the land 
trust community that would eliminate landlocked public lands currently 
closed to hunters and anglers. We specifically support the use of funds 
to address projects that consolidate fragmented ownership of Federal 
public lands, connect wildlife corridors, enhance recreational access 
in addition to complementing State-based investments in natural 
resource management.
                           blm land resources
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $304 million for the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Land Resources subaccount. This 
subaccount includes funding for BLM's high priority planning efforts 
across more than 247 million acres of land the agency manages, 
including the initiation of new resource management plans, address the 
need for planning updates and amendments, and implementation 
strategies. It is essential to ensure that BLM has the resources 
necessary to integrate the most recent State and Federal fish and 
wildlife science, outdoor recreation needs, and balancing energy 
development and resource extraction uses within the planning process. 
We recommend an additional increase of $5 million that would be 
directed to Resource Management Planning budgets for RMP revisions, 
amendments, and evaluation.
              blm wildlife and aquatic habitat management
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $235 million for the 
BLM Wildlife and Aquatic Habitat Management account. The work conducted 
through this account supports the maintenance, restoration, and 
enhancement of fish, wildlife, and their habitats on BLM administered 
public lands. Important BLM activities such as conducting inventories 
of fish and wildlife resources and developing cooperative management 
plans while providing for responsible recreation and commercial uses 
are critically important for BLM's ongoing work with state fish and 
wildlife agencies and local communities across the West. We further 
recommend increasing BLM's Wildlife & Aquatic Habitat Management budget 
by an additional $7 million to support wildlife migration corridor 
conservation with Congress directing BLM to convey $2 million of that 
to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Western Big Game 
Seasonal Habitat and Migration Corridors Fund.
                             blm foundation
    Announced by the Department of the Interior in 2022, The Foundation 
for America's Public Lands presents a unique opportunity to maintain 
and improve wildlife migration corridors and seasonal ranges in 
addition to establishing a sustainable future for BLM lands in general. 
BHA requests that appropriations for Fiscal Year 2024 include at least 
$1 million to the foundation to support implementation of DOI 
Secretarial Order 2018- 3362 by funding priority projects that benefit 
wildlife migration corridors and seasonal habitat.
                       blm wild horses and burros
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $155 million for the 
BLM's Wild Horse and Burro (WHB) Program as current funding does not 
provide enough resources for control efforts to outpace population 
growth rates. Additionally, we recommend that funds no longer be 
borrowed from other budget line items to fund the WHB. BLM estimates 
there are over 82,000 WHB across habitats with a total appropriate 
management level of less than 27,000. The harm inflicted on public 
lands from excess wild horses and burros compounds yearly as on-range 
population growth rates and off-range holding costs outstrip the BLM's 
ability to manage herds.
                    greater sage-grouse conservation
    BHA also supports the removal of the harmful sage-grouse rider that 
compromises the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) ability to 
utilize important conservation tools within the Endangered Species Act 
should populations continue to decline. Greater sage-grouse habitat has 
experienced concerning degrees of fragmentation and degradation across 
the West and historic collaboration efforts have created powerful 
conservation plans tailored to 11 States across nearly 70 million acres 
of sagebrush steppe. This rider ties the hands of wildlife managers 
across the country and threatens the livelihood of rural communities 
that depend on sagebrush country for economic stability. BHA encourages 
you to oppose efforts to include any limiting sage-grouse rider 
language in FY24 appropriations bills.
              abandoned hardrock mine reclamation funding
    BHA supports funding levels of at least $287 million to be provided 
for the abandoned hardrock mine reclamation program created by Sec. 
40704 of the Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act. It is critical 
that this program receive funding to address the estimated 500,000 
abandoned hardrock mines in the West. According to the Government 
Accountability Office, Federal agencies spent, on average, about $287 
million annually from 2008 through 2017 identifying, cleaning up, and 
monitoring abandoned hardrock mine sites. However, at this rate it 
would still take nearly two centuries to clean up all our Nation's 
abandoned mines which represent the largest single source of pollution 
with 40% of watersheds in the West contaminated by mine tailings and 
runoff.
             usfws north american wetlands conservation act
    BHA supports funding the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund 
at its fully authorized amount of $60 million. This one-of-a-kind 
program leverages 1:4 ratio in contributions from nonfederal partners 
to restore migratory birds and other wildlife habitat within FWS 
allocations. To date NAWCA has already conserved more than 30 million 
acres of wetland habitat to the benefit of waterfowl enthusiasts 
nationwide.
         usfws national fish habitat action plan & partnerships
    This USFWS account funds the National Fish Habitat Partnership, a 
coalition of outdoor, hunting, angling, industry, and other 
conservation organizations, that work together to address the loss and 
depletion of fish habitat in critical waterways throughout America. BHA 
supports funding this partnership at its fully authorized amount of 
$7.2 million to further water restoration efforts across our country.
                 usfws national wildlife refuge system
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $624 million for the 
FWS National Wildlife Refuge System's (NWRS) Operations and Maintenance 
account. Adjusting for inflation, this level of funding is necessary to 
maintain operations at a level established a decade ago. The NWRS 
currently allows hunting on 436 wildlife refuge units and fishing on 
378, generating more than $2.4 billion annually in economic revenue 
from hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreation activities. The 
Refuge System also supports more than 35,000 jobs across our Nation. 
Additionally, BHA supports the dedication of $10 million to complete 
Comprehensive Conservation Plans, 40% of which are outdated despite the 
requirement by law to be updated every 15 years.
              usfws partners for fish and wildlife program
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $80 million for the 
Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. This program that provides 
technical and financial assistance to private landowners and help 
implement critical projects that restore grasslands, wetlands and other 
habitats important to wildlife species such as grouse, canvasbacks and 
mule deer. Additionally, BHA strongly supports the dedication of $3 
million in direct support of DOI Secretarial Order 2018- 3362. We ask 
Congress to direct USFWS to convey $1 million of that to the National 
Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Western Big Game Seasonal Habitat and 
Migration Corridors Fund and dedicate the remaining $2 million for a 
wildlife migration grants program that is managed internally for 
supporting key partnerships.
                   usfws science applications program
    The USFWS Science Applications Program has made instrumental 
investments in researching and prioritizing wildlife corridor needs 
with western States and it will be critical to ensure that future 
funding remains robust as we face important demands for the best 
available science to inform planning and management decisions. 
Increasing energy demands--including pressure for new renewables 
development on both private and public lands--compels us to direct 
continued funding for research to understand strategic needs and 
specific threats to wildlife migration corridors as State and Tribal 
wildlife management agencies prioritize future projects including 
transportation infrastructure like overpasses and underpasses to 
facilitate wildlife migration. We recommend that $4 million be provided 
to the Science Applications Program to directly support and identify 
needs for 18 western States and Tribal partner agencies that are 
critical to addressing threats and advancing big game migration and 
movement projects.
           usfws neotropical migratory bird conservation fund
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $8 million for the 
Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. This competitive grant 
program benefits more than 3.7 million acres of habitat, promoting 
long-term conservation of neotropical migratory birds through partner-
based conservation and energizing local, on-the-ground conservation 
efforts through their migratory life cycles across North and South 
America.
                  usfws state & tribal wildlife grants
    BHA supports an increase in funding levels to $82 million for USFWS 
State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. This will provide state fish and 
wildlife management agencies the resources they need to continue 
managing and restoring critical habitats for species at risk of 
becoming endangered. In doing so the program facilitates collaboration 
between state, Tribal and Federal interests to invest in conservation 
efforts that prevent more expensive management costs in the future.
                         usfs roads and trails
    BHA supports robust funding for the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) 
Roads and Trails on National Forest System lands to help alleviate 
millions in maintenance backlogs. Many hunters, anglers and other 
outdoor recreationalists depend on roads and trails to gain access to 
our public lands and waters. Without proper funding and management, 
public access can become eliminated or reduced significantly. 
Addressing USFS's maintenance backlog account is an important priority 
BHA would like to see addressed by Congress.
                      usfs wild horses and burros
    BHA supports robust, dedicated funding for Wild Horse and Burro 
(WHB) management within a newly specified line-item, as funds are 
currently reallocated internally from other budgets. As USFS is 
responsible for 20% of the Nation's WHB, we recommend that the 80/20 
ratio is continued for WHB appropriations across BLM and USFS.
                        usfs migration corridors
    We commend USDA and the USFS for elevating the conservation of 
wildlife migration corridors and seasonal ranges, particularly 
Secretary Vilsack's issuance of Secretarial Memo 1077 and the August 
2022 USFS Habitat Connectivity and Migration Corridors in National 
Forest System Planning'' guidance to Regional Foresters. These efforts 
will complement the work of the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
through Working Lands for Wildlife and other programs and ongoing 
implementation of DOI Secretarial Order 2018- 3362, however, policy 
guidance requires the allocation of funding to have meaningful impact. 
We recommend that Congress direct USFS to allocate $10 million from the 
Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction 
Act wildfire risk and hazardous fuels reduction funds to support 
implementation of USFS wildlife migration corridors policy guidance 
including conservation efforts at the individual forest and regional 
levels.
    We also recommend a $2 million increase for the USFS Watershed, 
Fish, Wildlife, Air and Rare Plants budgets to be directed to National 
Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Western Big Game Seasonal Habitat and 
Migration Corridors Fund.
              usgs wildlife corridor mapping and research
    The U.S. Geological Survey's Corridor Mapping Team has provided 
critical mapping support and State-based technical assistance to 
wildlife management agencies through formal collaboration with the 
Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (CRU). Early 
investments made possible under the implementation of DOI Secretarial 
Order 2018- 3362, have provided essential data and spatial analysis for 
migration corridors mapping culminating three volumes of Ungulate 
Migrations of the Western United States. These migration atlases are 
the foundation for understanding wildlife migrations, prioritizing 
conservation needs in partnerships with western States, and avoiding 
and mitigating impacts from development through landscape-level 
planning on public lands--particularly as energy needs across renewable 
and fossil fuel sectors remain high. We recommend that at least $1 
million and up to $5 million be allocated to the USGS Land Management 
Research budget and directed to supporting the Corridor Mapping Team 
and future research for publishing future volumes of Ungulate 
Migrations of the Western United States and other critical wildlife 
migration corridor studies.
    While we understand the need to be fiscally responsible with 
taxpayer dollars, we believe that conservation programs are key 
economic drivers, providing large returns on investment in addition to 
ensuring that America has clean drinking water. Therefore, we ask you 
to support stable, annual funding for our Nation's public land and 
waters to support healthy communities and habitat for fish and 
wildlife. Thank you for your consideration of Backcountry Hunters &

 Prepared Statement of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District
    On behalf of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District 
(CAWCD), I encourage you to direct the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 
to again expend at least $2.0 million from its Aquatic Resources 
Program for Colorado River specific salinity control activities in 
Fiscal Year 2024. The funding will help protect the water quality of 
the Colorado River that is used by approximately 40 million people for 
municipal and industrial purposes and used to irrigate approximately 5 
million acres in the United States.
    CAWCD manages the Central Arizona Project (CAP), a multi-purpose 
water resource development and management project that delivers 
Colorado River water into central and southern Arizona. The largest 
supplier of renewable water in Arizona, CAP delivers water to almost 6 
million people each year, including to municipal and industrial users, 
agricultural irrigation districts, and Tribal communities.
    Our goal at CAP is to provide an affordable, reliable and 
sustainable supply of Colorado River water to a service area that 
includes more than 80 percent of Arizona's population.
    These renewable water supplies are critical to Arizona's economy 
and to the economies of Native American communities throughout the 
state. Nearly 90% of economic activity in the State of Arizona occurs 
within CAP's service area. The canal provides an economic benefit of 
$100 billion annually, accounting for one-third of the entire Arizona 
gross state product. CAP also helps the State of Arizona meet its water 
management and regulatory objectives of reducing groundwater use and 
ensuring availability of groundwater as a supplemental water supply 
during future droughts. Achieving and maintaining these water 
management objectives is critical to the long-term sustainability of a 
State as arid as Arizona.
                 negative impacts of concentrated salts
    Natural and man-induced salt loading to the Colorado River creates 
environmental and economic damages. EPA has identified that more than 
60 percent of the salt load of the Colorado River comes from natural 
sources. The majority of land within the Colorado River Basin is 
federally owned, much of which is administered by BLM. Human activity, 
principally irrigation, adds to the salt load of the Colorado River. 
Further, natural and human activities concentrate the dissolved salts 
in the River.
    The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has estimated the 
current quantifiable damages at about $354 million per year to U.S. 
users with projections that damages would increase to approximately 
$671 million per year by 2040 if the program were not to continue. 
These damages include:

  --A reduction in the ability to reclaim and reuse water for 
        beneficial uses, including drinking water and irrigation water 
        supplies, due to high salinities in the water delivered to 
        water treatment and reclamation facilities;

  --A reduction in the yield of salt sensitive crops and increased 
        water use to meet the leaching requirements in the agricultural 
        sector;

  --Increased use of imported water and cost of desalination and brine 
        disposal for recycling water in the municipal sector;

  --A reduction in the useful life of galvanized water pipe systems, 
        water heaters, faucets, garbage disposals, clothes washers, and 
        dishwashers, and increased use of bottled water and water 
        softeners in the household sector;

  --An increase in the cost of cooling operations and the cost of water 
        softening, and a decrease in equipment service life in the 
        commercial sector;

  --An increase in the use of water and the cost of water treatment, 
        and an increase in sewer fees in the industrial sector;

  --A decrease in the life of treatment facilities and pipelines in the 
        utility sector; and

  --Difficulty in meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply 
        with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        terms and conditions, and an increase in desalination and brine 
        disposal costs due to accumulation of salts in groundwater 
        basins.

    The threat of salinity continues to be a concern between the United 
States and Mexico. Since the agreement of Minute 242 in 1973 to the 
1944 Water Treaty, the United States has taken several actions to 
improve the quality of water delivered to Mexico, including operating 
and maintaining the Main Outlet Drain Extension (MODE). More recently, 
on November 20, 2012, a 5-year agreement, known as Minute 319, was 
signed between the U.S. and Mexico to guide future management of the 
Colorado River. Among the key issues addressed in Minute 319 included 
an agreement to maintain current salinity management and existing 
salinity standards. The United States, Mexico, and key water users, 
including CAWCD, worked since 2015 to develop a successor agreement, 
Minute 323, which was finalized on September 27, 2017. Minute 323 
continues collaboration and cooperation among the United States and 
Mexico with respect to salinity control in the Colorado River system. 
The CAWCD and other key water providers are committed to meeting these 
goals.
    Adequate funding for salinity control will prevent the water 
quality of the Colorado River from further degradation and avoid 
significant increases in economic damages to municipal, industrial and 
irrigation users.
                               conclusion
    Implementation of salinity control practices through the BLM 
Program has proven to be a very cost-effective method of controlling 
the salinity of the Colorado River and is an essential component of the 
overall Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program.
    The continuation of funding will prevent further degradation of the 
water quality of the Colorado River and further degradation and 
economic damages experienced by municipal, industrial and irrigation 
users. A modest investment in source control pays huge dividends in 
improved drinking water quality for nearly 40 million Americans. CAWCD 
requests that this committee direct that BLM again expend in Fiscal 
Year 2024 at least $2.0 million from its Aquatic Resources Program for 
Colorado River specific salinity control activities.

    Prepared Statement of the Center for Invasive Species Prevention
    We write to ask you to support funding for two programs of the USDA 
Forest Service. Each is essential for protecting the resilience of the 
Nation's forests in the face of invasive pests.
    We ask that the subcommittee adopt report language requiring that 
the USFS begin a phased increase in funding allocated to research on 
invasive species. The goal would be to allocate five percent of the 
overall Rangeland Research Program's budget request to this purpose by 
FY26. As the first step on this phased increase, we suggest that the 
subcommittee raise funding for research on invasive species-the 10 
species named on p. 62 of the budget justification and the many that 
are apparently not now included-to $8.5 million. We note that these 
invasive species imperil forest health independently of the manifold 
effects of increased fire intensity and frequency and climate change. 
The research that would be funded by the additional funding is critical 
to improving managers' understanding of invasive forest insects' and 
pathogens' invasion pathways and impacts, as well as to developing 
effective management strategies.

these programs provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Public 
Law 117- 58). Both subprograms must be funded in order to ensure 
continuity of protection efforts--such an ``all lands'' approach is the 
only way that pest management can be effective.

                             justification
    urban, rural, and wildland forests: indispensable and threatened
    About one-third of America's land area supports forests or 
woodlands. These forests provide many benefits, including wood and non-
wood forest products; jobs for rural economies; wildlife habitat; 
carbon sequestration; clean water and air; and recreation and aesthetic 
enjoyment. About 60 percent of these forests are owned by States or 
private entities.
    Urban forests also contribute important services to both society 
and the environment. They moderate temperatures and winds, thus 
reducing energy expenditures and related emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other pollutants. They curb storm water runoff and its management 
costs. Urban trees filter air and water pollutants. They improve the 
health and wellbeing of residents.
             the impact of non-native insects and diseases
    Already, growing numbers of non-native insects and pathogens in 
America's forests undermine the most basic of our forests' condition 
and ecosystem services. One-fifth of forest biomass in the ``lower 48'' 
States is threatened by just the worst 15 pests. In total, these 15 
species have caused an additional annual conversion of live biomass to 
dead wood at a rate similar in magnitude to the low end of the 
estimated rate attributed to fire (5.53 TgC per year for pests v. 5.4 
to 14.2 TgC per year for fire).\1\ Unique ecosystems are being 
destroyed: black ash swamps of the upper Midwest, riparian forests in 
California and Oregon, stream canyons of the Appalachian range, and 
high-elevation forests of western mountains. [See Invasive Species in 
Forests & Grasslands of the United States: A Comprehensive Science 
Synthesis for the United States Forest Sector, at https://

    Newly-arrived pests threatens additional ecosystems. Rapid ?ohi?a 
death is killing the most widespread tree species in the unique forests 
of Hawai`i. Beech leaf disease has spread from Ohio to Maine and south 
to Virginia in little over a decade; it threatens one of the most 
numerous tree species in the eastern forest. California's oaks face a 
growing number of pests: sudden oak death, goldspotted oak borer, 
Kuroshio shot hole borer, and now Mediterranean oak borer.
                 fulfilling the forest service' mission
    The mission of the USDA Forest Service is to ``sustain the health, 
diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to 
meet the needs of present and future generations.'' The Service cannot 
fulfill this mission without a strong and integrated strategy for 
countering the establishment, spread, and effects of non-native insects 
and diseases. Unfortunately, the Administration's proposed budget for 
Fiscal Year 2024 barely recognizes the threat posed by non-native 
insects and pathogens and does not provide the resources needed to 
address it.
       usda forest service forest and rangeland research program
    This inadequacy is most obvious in its funding allocations for the 
Research program. Often, when pests are first detected, little is known 
about them. Effective programs to prevent, suppress, and eradicate the 
risks can be developed only after scientists understand the pest-host 
relationship. This crucial knowledge can be gained only through 
research.
    Unfortunately, the Forest Service's research budget does prioritize 
improving managers' understanding of specific invasive species and of 
the processes contributing to bioinvasions. Just $4 million is 
allocated for research conducted by the Research stations on 10 non-
native pests (see page 62)--just over 1% of the total research budget. 
Since FY2010, these programs have suffered a greater than 70% decrease 
in funding while new pests have arrived to threaten our trees. USFS is 
losing the ability to develop effective tools needed by federal, state, 
and private landowners trying to managing the growing number of pests.
    The Administration says it has prioritized research intended to 
support nature-based solutions for climate risk reduction, watershed 
resiliency, forest ecology, and forest genetics. However, many of the 
tree species that such solutions would depend on are being decimated by 
non-native pests. To restore them, scientists need to research their 
genetics and possible strategies to breed trees able to thrive despite 
the introduced pests. However, USFS R&D supports only a few such 
projects. Even in these cases the project leaders must seek outside 
funding in order to continue their work. We doubt that the Service' 
goals can be achieved in the absence of adequate funding for increasing 
understanding of bioinvasion and developing effective mitigation 
strategies.
    Increased research examining the full range of strategies for 
countering invasive species will help managers to address threats 
identified by the recent expansion of the Forest Inventory and Analysis 
program. That is, research will contribute to improving forest 
conditions, not just documenting them.
   forest health management: providing the needed continuum of pest 
                               management
    Tree-killing non-native pests usually first appear in cities or 
suburbs, because they arrive on imported goods destined to population 
centers. The immediate result is enormous damage to urban forests. It 
is important that the USDA Forest Service counter this damage directly.
    Even more important, the Service needs to thwart spread of these 
pests from places of first arrival to the Nation's rural and wildland 
forests, including National forests. Some pests spread on their own. 
Others are transported long distances on firewood, plants, or storage 
pods holding household furnishings. Thus they quickly imperil forests 
across the continent, so demanding a Federal response. Examples of 
tree-killing pests that have spread from urban areas to our National 
forests include the hemlock woolly adelgid, emerald ash borer, 
polyphagous and Kuroshio shot hole borers, sudden oak death, and laurel 
wilt disease.
    In other words, protecting America's forests begins by addressing 
pests where they are first found--usually in urban or semi-rural 
forests; and following where they next appear. The USFS FHM program 
does this by providing technical and financial assistance to both 
States and other forest-management partners [Cooperative Lands] and 
Federal agencies [Federal Lands]. Both components of the FHM program 
are essential to the ``all lands'' management continuum. The program's 
efficacy has been reduced by the 50% cut in funding over the past 
decade. The Administration's proposed funding levels partially restore 
this missing capacity.
    The strategy outlined in the budget justification, e.g., early 
detection of pests' introduction or spread to new regions and the 
``all-lands'' approach, is sound. However, we note that strategies 
appropriate for managing the western and southern bark beetles, e.g., 
thinning, are not effective in countering non-native insects and 
pathogens. Therefore we also welcome increased investment in innovative 
control technologies.
    We particularly applaud two projects described in the budget 
justification. Support for control of sudden oak death in Oregon and 
California needs to continue. Managers must be ready to respond to a 
probable expansion of the disease in California in response to the wet 
winter of 2022-2023. We also praise the partnership with State and 
Tribal agencies and USDA APHIS to manage widespread mortality of black 
(or brown) ash caused by the emerald ash borer.
    A critical component of a comprehensive pest-management strategy is 
improving threatened trees' resistance to the introduced pests. The 
USFS currently allots very few resources to tree resistance breeding. 
Perhaps surprisingly, much of the existing effort is funded by Forest 
Health Management or the National Forest System. For example, the model 
project-the Dorena Genetic Resource Center, in Oregon--is under the 
NFS. The Dorena center has made heartening progress in developing 
pathogen-resistant Port-Orford cedar and white pines; seedlings are now 
being planted by Federal agencies, Tribes, and others. The Dorena 
Center is also advising partners in the Forest Service and other 
federal, state, Tribal, and academic institutions engaged in 
resistance-breeding for ashes and two tree species in Hawaii, koa and 
ohia.
    CISP supports efforts to develop improved performance metrics. 
Measuring ``acres treated'' doesn't cover the extent of activities that 
should be undertaken.
    Finally, CISP supports the USFS' Urban Forestry programs in both 
the State and Private and Research divisions. Improving management of 
the 140 million acres of urban forests--through recommendations based 
on research--will contribute to solving many environmental and social 
problems and enhance our Nation's ability to respond to introductions 
of non-native insects and pathogens.
    Thank you for addressing these matters. I would be pleased to 
provide additional information.

      Prepared Statement of the Chemical Safety and Sustainability
    On behalf of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, 
thank you for the opportunity to submit this written testimony 
regarding the appropriations request described below for an increase of 
$11.3 million for the Chemical Safety and Sustainability (CSS) Research 
Program and accompanying report language for advancing New Approach 
Methodologies (NAMs) for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The 
Physicians Committee is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with nearly 
one million members and supporters worldwide working for effective, 
efficient, and ethical medical research and product testing.
    As you craft the FY 2024 Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies Appropriations bill, the Physicians Committee asks that you 
please consider the following provision to advance the implementation 
of predictive human-specific science, facilitate faster development of 
safe products, and reduce animal testing.
    Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to 
reach out with any questions.
                 pa new approach methodologies funding
    The Physicians Committee requests that the subcommittee include 
funding and report language for the EPA to continue and expand 
activities to support NAMs, including through the publication of policy 
updates, employee trainings, and additional full-time equivalents 
(FTEs).
    The EPA's December 2021 New Approach Methods Work Plan defines NAMs 
as ``any technology, methodology, approach, or combination that can 
provide information on chemical hazard and risk assessment to avoid the 
use of animal testing.'' \1\ These modern test methods, including 
computer models and in vitro cell and tissue-based approaches, can now 
replace many animal-based tests. Traditional animal methods are 
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, delaying needed regulations 
to protect vulnerable communities from toxic chemicals in the 
environment and prevent the introduction of potential new toxicants. In 
contrast, by using cells and components of primarily human origin, NAMs 
can better account for variations within human communities, including 
in genetic backgrounds, pre-existing conditions, and stages of life, 
than animal tests. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act for the 
21st Century amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to 
prioritize reduction and replacement of animal tests and increase the 
use of NAMs by requiring industry to ``first attempt to develop the 
information by means of an alternative test method or strategy 
identified by the [EPA] ... before conducting new vertebrate animal 
testing.'' \2\ This mandate is essential to addressing the 
disproportionate exposure to toxic chemicals faced by communities of 
color, and low-income and indigenous communities. A product of the 
Lautenberg Act was the TSCA Strategic Plan on NAMs, which sets out a 
framework for reaching animal testing reduction and replacement 
objectives and includes long-term ongoing steps. The 2021 New Approach 
Methods Work Plan is another related policy document issued by the EPA, 
which provides further strategies, deliverables, and timelines.

    Congress has expressed support for the EPA to continue developing 
and evaluating NAMs via previous appropriations report language; 
however, inadequate funding for this purpose has prevented full 
implementation of the agency's plans. The EPA maintains ongoing efforts 
to advance NAMs for chemical testing, including in the Office of 
Pesticide Programs and the Office of Research and Development, but 
limited resources and competing agency priorities often delay progress 
on NAMs implementation. With this request, the Physicians Committee is 
supporting the EPA's requested funding increase of $11.3 million to the 
CSS Research Program for FY24 for activities to advance NAMs. Although 
the CSS Research Program is spearheading a lot of NAMs work, the 
development and evaluation of NAMs has cross-cutting, agency-wide 
applications. This further investment in NAMs activities would improve 
the EPA's capacity to prioritize this work among other agency 
priorities, meet strategic planning goals, and properly integrate NAMs 
into agency policies and practices.
    Additionally, this requested report language would ensure that the 
EPA uses funding to address key areas of improvement for advancing 
NAMs, including updating policies to clearly communicate to industry 
which NAMs are accepted for certain uses, and establishing regular 
staff trainings on NAMs to ensure employees involved in chemical 
assessments are up to date with the latest scientific advancements.
    To support innovation at the EPA through accelerated development 
and evaluation of NAMs, the Physicians Committee requests that the 
subcommittee provide an increase of $11.3 million for the CSS Research 
Program to advance NAMs and adopt the following report language:

    New Approach Methodologies.- The Committee notes that Public Law 
114-182 (the Lautenberg Act) requires the agency to consider nonanimal 
tests prior to requiring testing using vertebrate animals, and 
prioritize strategies to replace, reduce, and refine the use of 
vertebrate animals. The Committee also notes that New Approach 
Methodologies (NAMs), including in vitro tests, in chemico assays, and 
in silico models, represent key advances in science to improve hazard 
and risk assessments of pesticides and chemicals. The Committee 
provides $11,328,000 for the agency to continue and expand activities 
to develop, build confidence in, and implement NAMs to meet deadlines 
and goals set in the 2021 New Approach Methods Work Plan and the TSCA 
Strategic Plan on NAMs. Among these efforts, the Committee directs the 
agency to publish updated policies outlining the acceptance of 
scientifically supported NAMs for specified applications, implement 
annual trainings on NAMs for employees involved in hazard and risk 
assessments, fund additional FTEs to support NAMs implementation, and 
continue to engage in Federal and nongovernmental organization 
collaborations.

   Prepared Statement of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's 
                              Reservation
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and Members of the 
subcommittee, on behalf of the Chippewa Cree Tribe I am pleased to 
provide this testimony in support of strong funding in Fiscal Year 2024 
for Tribal programs at the Department of the Interior and the Indian 
Health Service under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. I am Harlan 
Baker, and I have the honor of serving as the Chairman of the Tribal 
Business Committee for the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's 
Indian Reservation. Our Tribe totals nearly 6,200 enrolled members and 
our reservation encompasses over 122,000 acres in north central 
Montana, in one of the most remote and rural areas in the United 
States.
    We want to express our deep appreciation to the Chair and Ranking 
Member and others on this subcommittee who have continued to stand by 
our Nation's commitment to its Indian Tribes. In enacting the FY 2023 
Appropriations bill you have demonstrated once again that Indian 
affairs is a bi-partisan area where members of both parties recognize 
that the Federal trust responsibility, one of the most important 
doctrines in Federal Indian law, derives from the treaties between 
Tribal nations and the U.S. government. It is the obligation of the 
Federal Government, including all branches and agencies, to protect 
Tribal self-governance, Tribal lands, assets, resources, and treaty 
rights, and to provide adequate funding to carry out the directions of 
Federal statutes and court cases.
    As a Self-Governance Tribe, the Chippewa Cree Tribe strengthens our 
ability to determine our own future and our ability to govern our 
people at both the local level where we are providing the direct 
services to our people and at the National level where we build and 
strengthen our government-to-government relationship with the United 
States Government. Adequate support from the Federal Government is 
crucial to ensure we have a safe and thriving community for our people.
    We express our appreciation as you have allowed for some growth in 
Federal funding for important Tribal programs in recent years and we 
urge you to resist any proposals that seem terribly disconnected to the 
reality of life in Indian Country that would cut back funding to some 
of the most impoverished people in the United States. We understand the 
need to balance the budget but first we need to get to the point where 
we have something even remotely resembling parity with the rest of the 
population outside Indian Country.
    We urge the subcommittee to build on recent progress and enact the 
initiatives called for in the President's Budget Request that present 
an historic opportunity for a transformation in the relationship 
between Tribes and the Federal Government and that seek to restore some 
of the promises made to our ancestors by providing increased resources 
in several key programs. This includes requesting mandatory funding for 
the Indian Health Service (IHS), Contract Support Costs at the 
Department of the Interior (DOI), and Section 105(l) Tribal Leases; 
along with increased investments in Indian healthcare, education, 
public safety, natural resource management, and infrastructure. These 
historic budget and policy proposals for Tribal programs, which Tribal 
leaders have long advocated for, are long overdue, and are prepaid for 
by our ancestors.
              funding for the indian health service (ihs)
    Because of the rural nature and isolated location of our Tribe we 
are challenged with a low economic base, increasing medical and 
pharmaceutical costs, large distances to travel to access specialty 
care, and problems with the recruitment and retention of medical 
providers. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating 
impact on Tribal citizens. In fact, according to data from the Montana 
Department of Public Health and Human Services released in 2021, while 
Native Americans in Montana make up only 7% of the State's population, 
we accounted for more than 20% of the COVID-19 cases, and sadly, are 
dying from the disease at a rate 11 times higher than white residents. 
The health disparities between Native Americans and other groups in the 
U.S. has been well documented for years. Yet, according to IHS data 
from April 2022, actual IHS spending per user remains less than half of 
Medicaid spending per enrollee, less than half of Veterans medical 
spending per patient, and less than one-third of Medicare spending per 
beneficiary--even after including third party revenue received by IHS. 
Congress must take action to provide the resources to the IHS and 
Tribal health programs to improve the well-being of our people. We 
support the recommendations of the IHS National Tribal Budget 
Formulation Work Group and call on Congress to provide full needs-based 
funding of the IHS in FY 2024.
    We are particularly grateful that in the FY 2023 omnibus spending 
law Congress enacted for the first time Advance Appropriations for the 
Indian Health Service (IHS) in FY 2024. This was a long-sought goal and 
is much needed to ensure that Tribes can better meet the health needs 
of our people. As you know, short Continuing Resolutions (CRs) make it 
difficult to hire and retain staff, and enter into long term 
(financially advantageous) contracts with vendors and suppliers. When 
you operate on the margins like IHS, Tribal and Urban Indian Health 
programs do, short term funds are just not practical and limits the 
care provided to our patients. On an advance appropriations cycle, 
Tribal health care providers, as well as the IHS, now know the funding 
a year earlier than was previously the case under often lengthy CRs. In 
addition to protecting Tribal members from the harmful effects of a 
shutdown, providing advance appropriations will allow Tribal health 
programs the ability to better recruit and retain health professionals, 
to better plan programmatic activity over several years, thereby 
leading to better health outcomes for our people and decreased long-
term healthcare costs. Further savings will be achieved by allowing 
long-term contracts with outside vendors and suppliers. All of these 
benefits come at no additional costs to the Federal Government. We 
would urge the subcommittee to make permanent Advance Appropriations 
for IHS, while we work toward the goal of mandatory funding.
                    public safety funding at the bia
    Like many Tribes we are seeing a drastic increase in drug 
trafficking and related crime coming onto our lands. There is a 
significant need for the Federal Government to improve law enforcement 
resources and bring State and local authorities to the table with 
Tribes to address public safety. Congress needs to provide additional 
resources to BIA law enforcement, the U.S. Attorney's Offices, the FBI, 
and other agencies to help us stem the flow of illegal drugs, 
investigate crimes, and prosecute offenders. The underfunding of Tribal 
law enforcement and justice systems is well-documented. In 2022, the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) submitted a report to Congress required 
by the Tribal Law and Order Act estimating that to provide a minimum 
base level of service to all federally recognized Tribal nations, $1.3 
billion is needed for Tribal law enforcement, $1.2 billion is needed 
for Tribal courts, and $240.6 million is needed for existing detention 
centers. Based on actual funding provided in FY 2023, Tribal law 
enforcement, detentions/corrections, and Tribal courts are funded at a 
staggeringly low 18.6 percent of estimated need.
    The funding short falls for law enforcement endangers public safety 
on our reservation and forces us to use Tribal discretionary funds 
which means less resources in other areas and it hamstrings future 
business development. Another complicating factor is that our police 
and detention officers are required to be federally trained, however 
the state of Montana has an excellent officer training program and it 
would be more efficient financially and logistically to take advantage 
of the Montana Law Enforcement Academy. The BIA needs to provide more 
flexibility in allowing officers to train at state academies rather 
than needing to go the Federal training center in New Mexico, which 
often has a long wait list. In line with recommendations put forth by 
the Tribal Interior Budget Council (TIBC) we urge this subcommittee to 
provide $2.924 billion for Public Safety and Justice funding, with 
approximately $1.766 billion for BIA Law Enforcement and $1.155 billion 
for Tribal courts in FY 2024.
                      bia self-governance funding
    As I mentioned earlier in my testimony, we are a Self-Governance 
Tribe and have carried out all functions of the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs and Indian Health Service on our Reservation for decades. Under 
the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) the 
Federal Government is supposed to provide the funding necessary for 
Tribal nations that have elected to use Self-Governance for the 
delivery of programs and services to our citizens and communities. 
However, current funding levels are insufficient and funding over the 
past decade has remained flat, which is taking into account current 
inflation is actually a decrease.
    There have also been delays in the BIA distributing funding to 
self-governance Tribes. These delays have resulted in our Tribe being 
forced to collateralize discretionary resources to secure operating 
lines of credit and encumber interest rates and other fees. The funding 
mechanisms used by the BIA need to be streamlined to ensure Tribes 
receive their funding in a timely manner and have the flexibility 
needed to operate programs and provide services in the way that works 
best for our people. We encourage Congress to ensure full funding of 
BIA programs based on need and hold the agency accountable to ensure 
that this funding is allocated to Tribes in a transparent, fair and 
timely manner.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to submit this testimony and I 
urge the members of this subcommittee to work with your colleagues to 
provide robust funding for Tribal programs in FY 2024 to ensure that we 
have the resources needed to provide basic and essential services to 
our people and ensure their health, safety, and wellbeing.

      Prepared Statement of the Chippewa Ottawa Resource Authority
                              introduction
    Aanii (Hello)! I am providing this testimony regarding FY 2024 
funding in my capacity as President of the Bay Mills Indian Community, 
an Ojibwe Tribal Nation located on the south shore of Lake Superior in 
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. My Tribal Nation is a member of the 
Chippewa Ottawa Resource Authority (CORA) and I serve on the Board of 
that inter-Tribal entity, and present this testimony on CORA's behalf.
    CORA is a consortium of five federally recognized Tribal Nations in 
Michigan that are parties to the 1836 Treaty of Washington with the 
United States; they are: Bay Mills Indian Community; Grand Traverse 
Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians; Little River Band of Ottawa 
Indians; Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians; and the Sault Ste. 
Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians.
                                purpose
    I cannot emphasize enough the importance of Federal funding to 
support the exercise of reserved treaty rights and management of 
natural resources protected by these treaties. Within the Department of 
the Interior annual budget exists funding for the Rights Protection 
Implementation (RPI) program. That program provides to those Tribal 
Nations with judicially-recognized reserved usufructuary rights, funds 
which are necessary to protect and preserve the ability of the Tribal 
Nations to facilitate sustainable use and enjoyment of these protected 
natural resources. RPI funds are targeted to enable Tribal Nations to 
identify and implement appropriate management and protection 
activities, to utilize expert management and biological services, and 
to employ sufficient law enforcement personnel enforce Tribal, State 
and Federal laws regulating the natural resource use and protection.
    In FY 2023, RPI funding in the amount of $6,994,659.00 was provided 
to CORA's Tribal Nations. This level of funding is essential to the 
ability of each Tribal Nation to carry out the obligations under 
current Consent Decrees, and additional funding in the amount of 
$8,237.031.00 is needed to fund the additional Tribal responsibilities 
and obligations under a successor Great Lakes Consent Decree currently 
under the consideration of the U.S. District Court for the Western 
District of Michigan.
                               background
    In 1836, the Ojibwe (Chippewa) and Odawa (Ottawa) Tribal Nations 
(``CORA Tribal Nations'') in Michigan negotiated a treaty with the 
United States that ceded lands to the Federal Government which were 
used to create the State of Michigan in 1837. The ceded lands comprise 
more than forty per cent (40%) of what is now the State of Michigan. 
However, the CORA Tribal Nations reserved the right to hunt, fish, trap 
and gather throughout the ceded territory, including the waters of 
Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.
    Thereafter, Tribal members continued to exercise their treaty-
guaranteed rights. Their ability to do so was adversely impacted by the 
State of Michigan, which in the 1950's and 1960's asserted its 
authority to exclusively regulate hunting and fishing by Tribal members 
and to limit what activities were protected by the Treaty. At that 
time, only the Bay Mills Indian Community was a federally recognized 
Tribal Nation, so its Tribal members, including my grandfather, Albert 
``Big Abe'' LeBlanc, resisted State efforts to control treaty-protected 
activities and continued to hunt and fish with traditional gear and 
without a State License.
    The resistance culminated in 1971, with the citation of Albert 
``Big Abe'' LeBlanc for fishing in Lake Superior with gill nets, then a 
State criminal offense. In defense, the Bay Mills Indian Community 
supported its fisher's positions that the rights reserved in the 1836 
Treaty continued to exist and supersede Michigan fishing regulation 
under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case wound 
through various State court levels, culminating in 1976 with the 
issuance of a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court, holding in People 
v. LeBlanc that the right to fish in the Great Lakes waters ceded in 
the Treaty of 1836 continued to exist, and that the State could apply 
its law to Treaty-protected fishing if it could demonstrate that the 
regulation is necessary to conserve the resource.
    The ongoing battle shifted to Federal court, as the United States 
had filed suit in 1973 against the State of Michigan, on the grounds 
that Michigan lacked the right to regulate treaty-protected Great Lakes 
fishing activities. The case is known as United States v. Michigan and 
remains an open case file. The Bay Mills Indian Community and Sault 
Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians joined the case as intervenors 
prior to trial. In 1979, the trial court declared that the right to 
fish in the Great Lakes waters ceded in 1836 continues to exist; the 
decision is known as the ``Fox Decision.'' The Grand Traverse Band of 
Ottawa and Chippewa Indians intervened in the case within the year.
    Many issues remained unresolved, as the Fox Decision did not 
determine what gear could be employed in the Treaty fishery, what 
species could be harvested, when harvest could occur, and most 
importantly, what amount of fish of each species could be taken by 
Tribal fishers. All the parties in the case-United States; State of 
Michigan; Bay Mills Indian Community; Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of 
Chippewa Indians; and Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa 
Indians-participated in court-ordered negotiations which resulted in a 
comprehensive agreement regarding allocation of harvest opportunity, 
management, and regulation and was approved and entered as an order of 
the court in May 1985.
    That agreement was for a term of 15 years, and was succeeded by a 
new agreement covering allocation, management, regulation, enhancement 
and restoration of the Great Lakes fishery which was negotiated by all 
the prior participants and joined by the Little River Band of Ottawa 
Indians and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. This 
successor agreement was signed on August 7, 2000, for a term of 20 
years. All the parties have been working on a third agreement since the 
fall of 2019, and continuing to manage the fishery under the terms of 
the 2000 agreement until it is superseded by a successor agreement. A 
proposed comprehensive agreement was filed with the trial court on 
December 11, 2022, which is currently the subject of review by the 
court, including hearings to hear objections by any party which does 
not agree with the 2022 proposed Decree. They are scheduled for May 24 
and 25, 2023.
    Under these circumstances, the final text of the successor 
comprehensive Decree is not complete. What is clear is that the CORA 
Tribal Nations must create more frequent and comprehensive harvest 
reporting and oversight, so that stressors of the fishery are 
identified and management strategies developed and implemented to 
address them. Harvest is not the primary source of fish mortality in 
this century; instead, water quality, higher water temperatures and 
invasive species are causing the fishery to change in ways that must be 
closely monitored to identify and remediate impediments to a healthy 
fish stock for decades.
    These activities will require additional funding to address them.
    The parties have also addressed the nature and scope of inland 
treaty-protected activities in the 1836 Treaty ceded lands. In 2007, 
the parties abandoned planned litigation on this subject in favor on 
negotiating a separate agreement addressing the treaty-protected rights 
to hunt, fish, and gather on all lands and inland waters ceded in the 
1836 Treaty. This comprehensive agreement was entered as an order of 
the Federal district court, which has no termination date. Among other 
matters, the Consent Decree recognizes exclusive Tribal regulation of 
member hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering activities, and 
allocates harvest opportunities for elk, bear, and sturgeon. Joint 
management protocols for certain species are also created as well as 
cooperative law enforcement agreements.
    In each comprehensive agreement to date, the management framework 
has been approved and ordered by the court in the United States v. 
Michigan litigation. Equally significant is the active role of the 
Federal Government in negotiating the terms of these cooperative 
resource management frameworks.
        fy 2024 budget request: rights protection implementation
    Currently, CORA's Tribal Nations receive funding through the 
``Treaty Fisheries'' line item in the Rights Protection Implementation 
(RPI) program for the Great Lakes Treaty fishery. (``Inland treaty 
rights'' are separately funded within the RPI program and are addressed 
separately.) That line item supports the following activities, with 
additional activities for which funding is sought identified by use of 
italics:

  --Establishment of conservation-based fishing regulations; Biological 
        support services to monitor the fishery; Resource protection 
        and enhancement programs;

  --Conservation law enforcement activities and Tribal Court staffing 
        for Great Lakes fishing conservation cases;

  --Additional oversight of harvest activities by biological staff and 
        enforcement personnel;

  --Implementation of electronic harvest reporting by Tribal fishers 
        and wholesalers and maintenance of inter-Tribal harvest 
        reporting system;

  --Monitoring of environmental factors which adversely affect the 
        treaty fishery;

  --Establishment of and/or cooperation with Federal and State 
        researchers in remediation projects to address identified 
        environmental factors' impact on fish stocks; and

  --Invasive species monitoring and controls.

    CORA's Tribal Nations also receive RPI funding relating to ``inland 
treaty rights'' implementation of the 2007 Consent Decree. The 
following activities are supported:

  --Establishment of conservation-based hunting, fishing and gathering 
        regulations;

  --Biological support services to monitor wildlife, plant life and 
        habitat;

  --Resource protection and enhancement programs;

  --Invasive species monitoring and controls;

  --Conservation law enforcement activities and Tribal Court staffing 
        for inland conservation cases; and

  --Inter-Tribal coordination of activities and policies with Federal 
        and State agencies.

    CORA does not, and cannot, support any budget request for RPI funds 
in FY 2024 that is less than the sum appropriated for FY 2023. CORA 
supports a proportionate share of no less than $49,5420,000, the amount 
of Rights Protection Implementation funding proposed in FY2024, but 
supports full funding for the RPI line item at no less than 
$66,000,000. CORA also supports GLRI funding of no less than the FY 
2024 proposed appropriation of $358,154 million, including no less than 
a 5% share for a distinct Tribal program.
    Less funding, especially in light of the soon to be completed Great 
Lakes Treaty Fishing Decree this year, will require severe cuts to 
conservation, monitoring and enforcement activities, with attendant 
staff layoffs. That situation will not only increase conflict between 
Tribal Nations and other communities over resources, but will also 
significantly reduce the level of protection of the fishery, wildlife 
and habitat throughout the ceded territory. It is almost a certainty 
that the parties to these management and allocation agreements will 
bring disputes over program changes to the Federal court for 
resolution.
    CORA requests that Rights Protection Implementation continue to be 
a budget priority, and that CORA's Tribal Nations' share be increased 
for FY 2024 to $8,237,031.00, which is added to the Great Lakes base 
funding, for the identified purposes listed above.

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of the Chugach Regional Resources Commission
    My testimony is regarding the Department of Interior--Bureau of 
Indian Affairs--Natural Resources Management--Tribal Management 
Development Program funding on behalf of the Chugach Regional Resources 
Commission (CRRC). CRRC requests an increase to the FY 2024 
appropriation of our Natural Resources Management--Tribal Management 
Development Program (TMDP) within the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to 
a recurring Federal base program award of $1.18 million (50% of our 
operating budget) to develop and manage the natural resources located 
within the Chugach Region of Alaska, expand the resource management 
capabilities of the Tribes located there, and conduct vital research 
and mariculture activities at the Alutiiq Pride Marine Institute (APMI) 
in Seward. We also request that you exercise your oversight power to 
ensure that Tribal nations receive self-determination and self-
governance funds in a timely manner, with appropriate communication 
from the BIA.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony to the 
subcommittee on the FY 2024 Federal budget. We value this opportunity 
since you are vested with both the authority over appropriations and 
with the responsibility to ensure the Federal trust responsibility is 
fulfilled to Tribal nations without discrimination or uneven 
treatment--even if such treatment is unintentional. We submit this 
testimony to urge you to bring our Tribal citizens' services up to the 
same level of support as the other programs that perform natural 
resources management activities under contracts and compacts with the 
Federal Government.
    CRRC is an inter-Tribal fish and wildlife commission authorized as 
a Tribal consortium under the Indian Self Determination and Educational 
Assistance Act of 1991. We provide essential governmental services to 
Tribal citizens in the Chugach region of Alaska, an expanse of 20,000 
square miles of marine waters and more than 5,000 miles of coastline 
surrounded in large part by the Chugach National Forest. Our seven 
member Tribes founded CRRC to respond to the devastation of our 
ecosystem and traditional food sources caused by the 1964 earthquake 
and the catastrophic 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, which dumped millions 
of gallons of crude oil into our region. CRRC supports the health, 
economic stability, food security, and continuity of traditional ways 
of life for people throughout the entire Chugach region. We perform all 
these duties working with our Federal, State, and local partners. By 
providing stable and sufficient Federal funds for our work, the 
benefits are not felt just at the local level in Alaska. Every dollar 
of TMDP funds for CRRC also results in decreased need for Federal 
services in a remote region of Alaska.
A. Your Oversight Is Needed To Require The BIA To Communicate With 
        Tribes And Make Payments On Time
    Imagine you don't receive a paycheck after 1 month of work. When 
you ask why, your company doesn't explain or let you know when you can 
expect to be paid for the work you already did. Then another month goes 
by. After 9 months, you still have not been paid, but your rent, 
utilities, and living expenses have continued to pile up. You scramble 
to take out loans, find other work, and rob Peter to pay Paul to make 
ends meet. Today, this is the situation we are in.
    Nine months into the fiscal year, we have not received any funds 
for the responsibilities we continue to fulfill under the Indian Self-
Determination Act. Nor have we been able to get any response from BIA 
about when funds may be expected, or even when we may be able to sign 
paperwork. We have to consider whether to furlough our staff or borrow 
other funds. And we have no recourse but to wait or to file a lawsuit. 
This situation is not unique to this fiscal year--it is a situation we 
confront year after year. We still have not been paid contract support 
costs for FY 2020. And every year we have to decide what to do when 
funds have not arrived 3 months, 6 months, or 9 months into the fiscal 
year. This is the opposite of the alignment of resources to 
responsibilities that we should expect from our Federal trustee. We 
implore you to exercise your oversight power and require BIA to pay 
contracts and compacts on time, and to report to you when they do not.
    During last year's budget process, Congress worked hard to enact 
the budget and allow the government to take up FY 2023 activities in a 
timely manner. Federal agencies, including the BIA, received their 
funds at the start of the fiscal year on October 1. Yet not all Tribal 
nations are accorded the same treatment by the agency designated to 
carry out Federal trust responsibilities for self-determination and 
self-governance.
    Despite our repeated requests to BIA officials, we have never 
received written confirmation of our true recurring base award of TMDP 
funds in advance of annual negotiations with the BIA. Nor do we know 
our base funding for FY 2023, even 9 months into the fiscal year. This 
makes efficient planning and budgeting impossible. This is not how 
Tribal organizations should have to operate. Tribal organizations 
deserve this information. Delays in the payment of our funding and 
uncertainties about our contract's true ``Secretarial amount'' 
undermine our program goals and our ability to carry out services for 
our region's Native population. This in turn undermines the Federal 
work in our region, since it jeopardizes CRRC's work on the 
government's behalf.
    We respectfully ask the subcommittee to include report language 
directing the BIA to report back to the subcommittee on any funds that 
are disbursed to Tribes later than is permitted in self-determination 
and self-governance Annual Funding Agreements (typically 10 days after 
the start of the fiscal year). We also request that you require BIA to 
include in future budget submissions to Congress its requested 
recurring TMDP funding amount for each of the nearly three dozen 
programs financed within TMDP--and to notify the Tribal organizations 
in the TMDP program of the funding requests that BIA has prepared on 
their behalf. Without such information, CRRC and other Tribal 
organizations are left to guess what our recurring funding level is 
when Interior officials do not disclose it to us. Doing so would permit 
Tribal organizations like CRRC to know what our fiscal year base award 
amount is, and to plan, budget, and negotiate our upcoming Annual 
Funding Agreement with the BIA with certainty.
B. A History Of Unequal Treatment Can Only Be Made Right By Increasing 
        CRRC's Budget To A Similar Level As Other TMDP Programs
    CRRC currently receives less than a quarter of its current 
operating budget from BIA. We cobble together enough funds to meet our 
member Tribes' needs through vigorous efforts to secure grant and 
private funding, and we sometimes are faced with difficult decisions of 
which services to provide or deny to our citizens. In 2021, we timely 
submitted a request to BIA for a budget increase for FY 2023 for our 
funds from the TMDP subaccount. BIA denied our request, citing a lack 
of funds. So we were shocked to see that the President's FY 2023 budget 
proposed--and Congress awarded--increases for every TMDP recipient 
except for CRRC.
    CRRC has not had any program funding increase in the past 10 years, 
while the funding for the TMDP subaccount has more than doubled in that 
time--from $9.2 million in 2013 to $18.5 million in FY 2023. Our Tribal 
member base and services have also increased exponentially during that 
time. There is a funding increase of $114,000 proposed for the TMDP 
subaccount in the FY 2024 budget, yet our funding remains flatlined.
    The increases to the TMDP account that appropriators have included 
in annual spending measures is a great testament to the efforts of 
Congress and all the Tribal recipients of TMDP funds. It reflects 
Congress's commitment to fulfill its trust responsibility to support 
these important programs. But during that same period, we have seen our 
funding arbitrarily and unilaterally reduced in the President's Budget 
Justification from $410,000 to as low as $348,000. For example, among 
the 35 TMDP Programs funded in FY 2018, our program was the only 
program singled out by the Administration for a 15% cut.
    Over the years, CRRC has not received critical recurring budget 
increases equal to the growth of the TMDP account, while carrying out 
similar subsistence fish and shellfish management services, habitat 
restoration, and mariculture activities for our member villages. In 
prior years, arbitrary reductions by the BIA to CRRC's TMDP base 
recurring funding level undermined our services, reduced our natural 
resource and marine research and development, stretched our limited 
resources, and made it difficult to retain staff. In 2020, we were 
forced to file a Contract Disputes Act claim against BIA to challenge 
these reductions--in which we prevailed. We need budget certainty, 
without extraneous administrative burden.
C. Meeting CRRC's Budget Needs Upholds Your Federal Trust 
        Responsibility And Saves Federal Dollars
    The annual recurring Federal budget increase that we request will 
bring our program back into parity with the other TMDP programs and 
allow CRRC to:

  --Protect and reinvigorate traditional subsistence species and their 
        habitat;

  --Sustain shellfish sanctuaries at Tribal beaches throughout the 
        region;

  --Expand our study of ocean acidification as part of the Alaska Ocean 
        Acidification Network and its impact on fish and shellfish 
        stocks;

  --Expand the subsistence fishery in Nanwalek to rejuvenate the 
        availability of fish for direct consumption;

  --Expand our community-driven water sampling project, which provides 
        vital information on the safety of shellfish stocks and helps 
        prevent paralytic shellfish poisoning in Alaska Natives and 
        others engaged in shellfish gathering throughout the region;

  --Conduct natural resource efforts on behalf of our Tribes, including 
        wetlands monitoring and planning, traditional foods advocacy 
        and protection, climate change vulnerability and adaptation 
        planning, subsistence resource advocacy, and the development 
        and management of a Tribal Conservation District;

  --Expand our production of oyster and littleneck clams, geoducks, 
        cockles, and razor clams;

  --Educate Alaska Native youth in science, sustainable fishing, 
        mariculture farming, and hunting;

  --Provide resources and education on kelp farming to potential Tribal 
        entrepreneurs within the region;

  --Enhance the monitoring and refinement of our Natural Resource 
        Management Program objectives for each of our Alaska Native 
        villages; and

  --Support the documentation and use of traditional Alaska Native 
        ecological knowledge in Tribal, Federal, and State regulation 
        and management decisions.

    For FY 2024, we would like to increase TMDP funding to a level that 
will permit us to cover 50%, or $1.18 million, of our target operating 
budget of $2.36 million with these program funds. A $2.36 million 
operating budget includes $1.375 million to cover the salary and fringe 
benefits of 14 full-time staff, including a Mariculture Director, 
Science Director, Marine Mammal Program Coordinator, Fish and Wildlife 
Coordinator, Environmental Coordinator, Shellfish Technician, Ocean 
Acidification Lab Manager, Nanwalek Salmon Technicians, Inter-Tribal 
Liaison, Climate Specialist, and Executive Director. Another $400,000 
is required for salary and fringe benefits for six (6) additional 
positions, including two additional Hatchery Technicians (totals 
$71,500 with fringe benefits), a Research Scientist position and Tribal 
Conservation District (TCD) Program Coordinator (totals $177,320 with 
fringe benefits), and an Executive Assistant and Maintenance Supervisor 
(totals $150,150 with fringe benefits). CRRC also covers Tribal special 
projects in our villages, travel costs to and from villages, and 
program costs for our annual subsistence gathering.
    Federal investment in CRRC translates into community investments 
that have a great impact on the Chugach Region of Southcentral Alaska. 
CRRC fills gaps in data from Federal and State wildlife management 
agencies and assists in the creation of sustainable mariculture jobs 
for our Alaska Native people. We help protect the health, economic 
stability, and food security of our member villages. This is a vital 
lifeline while continuing fallout from the pandemic and supply chain 
challenges create drastic conditions of food and economic insecurity in 
our Villages.
    Our programs also support future economic and commercial 
opportunities for the Prince William Sound and Lower Cook Inlet regions 
through the protection and development of the Alaskan shellfish 
industry and other natural resources. We provide seed stock to 
mariculture operations around the State and contribute to research on 
mariculture, techniques for species enhancement, and the effects of 
climate change on our ecosystem. These activities are essential to 
develop a science-driven approach--informed by Indigenous Knowledge--to 
address the declining populations of the species that Alaskans, 
especially Native Alaskans, depend on.
    Increasing TMDP funds for CRRC also benefits the Federal Government 
by decreasing the need for Federal activities in a remote region of 
Alaska. It costs much more for the Federal Government to conduct direct 
oversight and program activities, travel, and transportation than for 
CRRC to locally manage such activities.
    Our work is important for food security throughout our vast region, 
and for the future of the mariculture industry in all of Alaska. We 
require a stable Federal budget, together with the timely payment of 
contract support cost funds, to help us perform our programs, pay 
staff, and operate and maintain the hatchery.
    Please help us achieve our mission. We urge the subcommittee to 
build upon any increases it has planned for the BIA's TMDP account, and 
to include CRRC in those increases. Thank you for giving us the 
opportunity to share our FY 2024 budget needs.

       Prepared Statement of the Coalition for American Heritage
    The Coalition for American Heritage (``the Coalition'') is an 
organization comprised of heritage professionals, scholars, small 
businesses, non-profits and history-lovers across the country. Our 
350,000 members work together to promote our Nation's commitment to 
historic preservation. Preserving historic resources helps stabilize 
neighborhoods, attract investment, create jobs, generate tax revenues, 
support small businesses, and power America's heritage tourism 
industry.
    We appreciate the strong funding provided to historic preservation 
programs in recent Interior Appropriations legislation. Investing in 
these programs will help ensure the continuance of our country's proud 
tradition of preservation. The Coalition requests robust funding for 
all of the U.S. Department of the Interior's historic preservation and 
cultural management programs, and for the National Endowment for the 
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Respectfully, the 
Coalition urges the Committee to approve the following funding levels 
for FY24:

  --NPS Historic Preservation Fund: $225 million

  --National Recreation and Preservation, African American Burial 
        Grounds Preservation Program: $3 million

  --NPS National Heritage Areas and Heritage Partnership Program: $34 
        million

  --BLM National Conservation Lands: $78 million

  --Advisory Council on Historic Preservation: $10.5 million

  --National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment 
        for the Humanities (NEH): at least $211 million for each one
                         national park service
    The popularity of our National parks is at an all-time high. Our 
country cannot afford unwarranted reductions to visitor services and 
cuts to the responsible stewardship of our historic and cultural 
resources. The NPS is responsible for 418 National Park System units. 
Over the past 20 years, more than 40 new parks have been added to the 
park system. Many recent additions preserve historic places and themes 
that have traditionally been underrepresented within the system.
    Within the requested funds, we recommend robust funding for 
Resource Stewardship, including the National Underground Railroad 
Network to Freedom, the African American Civil Rights Network, and the 
Reconstruction Era National Historic Network. Funding for these popular 
initiatives provides the public with valuable educational resources 
that honor and preserve our country's rich African-American heritage 
and history for future generations.
    We also urge the Committee to address the deferred maintenance 
backlog at America's national parks. Almost half of the current backlog 
concern historic assets. Robust investments in this area will 
contribute to the successful preservation of historic sites and 
structures and other NPS cultural resources. Without critically needed 
funding for repair and rehabilitation, these critical sites, buildings 
and artifacts that draw visitors to our National parks' assets risk 
further deterioration and potential loss.
                     nps historic preservation fund
    We urge the Committee to appropriate $225 million in FY24 for the 
Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), a vital program that, in partnership 
with States, local governments and Tribes, is the cornerstone of our 
country's historic preservation initiatives.
    Within the $225 million request, we recommend the following funding 
breakdown:

  --$70 million for State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) for 
        heritage preservation and protection programs.

  --$34 million for Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs).

  --$28 million for competitive grants to document, interpret, and 
        preserve historic sites associated with the Civil Rights 
        Movement.

  --$7 million for the competitive grants program to preserve the sites 
        and stories associated with securing civil rights for all 
        Americans, including women, Latinos, Native Americans, Native 
        Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and LGBTQ Americans.

  --$40 million for Save America's Treasures grants for the 
        preservation of nationally significant sites, structures, and 
        artifacts.

  --$13 million for grants to Historically Black Colleges and 
        Universities to preserve and repair historic buildings.

  --$17 million for Paul Bruhn preservation grants to revitalize 
        historic properties of national, State, and local significance.

  --$5 million for competitive grants for the survey and nomination of 
        properties associated with communities currently 
        underrepresented on the National Register of Historic Places 
        and National Historic Landmarks.

  --$11 million for the Semiquincentennial Grants program.
                  national recreation and preservation
    The Coalition asks the Committee to provide $3 million for the 
recently established African American Burial Grounds Preservation 
Program, a program the Coalition strongly supports. The African 
American Burial Grounds Preservation Program will help identify burial 
grounds ahead of infrastructure projects and commercial development, 
thereby minimizing construction delays and avoiding unnecessary 
community heartache. These sacred sites, and the stories they tell, are 
an integral part of our American heritage. This legislation will assist 
descendants and communities in honoring and remembering their shared 
past by providing grant monies to identify, interpret, and preserve 
historic cemeteries.
    The Coalition support the President's budget request for $1 million 
in additional resources for NPS administration of grant programs 
commensurate with recent increases in funding for National Recreation 
and Preservation grant programs, such as Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation, Japanese American Confinement Sites, 
American Indian and Native Hawaiian Art and Culture, the 9/11 Memorial 
Act, and multiple Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) programs that 
provide competitive grants to preserve the stories of civil and equal 
rights and underrepresented communities.
                      nps national heritage areas
    We recommend $34 million in funding for the Heritage Partnership 
Program and our National Heritage Areas (NHAs). Through the use of 
public-private partnerships, NHAs support historic preservation, 
heritage tourism, and recreation. These programs collaborate with 
communities to make heritage relevant to local interests and needs.
                   blm cultural resources management
    We recommend $25 be allocated to BLM Cultural Resources Management. 
We appreciate the Committee's ongoing oversight of BLM's ability to 
oversee the largest, most diverse collection of historic and cultural 
resources on America's public lands. It is vital that BLM has 
sufficient staff to support Section 106 reviews, monitor compliance 
with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and 
consult with Tribes.
    We respectfully request that the committee provide $1 million in 
dedicated funds to enhance its National Cultural Resources Information 
Management System (NCIMS). This funding would also support ongoing 
collaboration with state historic preservation offices to standardize 
and integrate cultural resources data for BLM lands. Strengthening 
BLM's ability to update predictive modeling and data analysis will 
enhance the agency's ability to address large-scale, cross-
jurisdictional land-use projects.
                    blm national conservation lands
    We urge a $78 million FY24 appropriation for the National 
Conservation Lands. An increase in base funding will prevent critical 
damage to 36 million acres of congressionally and presidentially 
designated National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wilderness, 
Wilderness Study Areas, National Scenic and Historic Trails, and Wild 
Scenic Rivers managed by BLM. Increased funding will help achieve 
President Biden's goal of conserving at least 30% of our lands and 
waters by 2030.
    independent agencies: advisory council on historic preservation
    We request $10.5 million for the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation (ACHP), to fund its work to administer the rulemaking 
process for historic preservation law, assist in resolving conflicts 
from historic resource reviews, and provide advice on historic 
preservation.
          national endowments for the arts and the humanities
    The Coalition urges the Committee to fund the NEA and the NEH at a 
minimum of $211 million each in FY24. Robust funding for the NEA and 
NEH is critical to communities across America. NEH Preservation 
Assistance Grants help small and mid-sized institutions--such as 
libraries, museums, historical societies, archival repositories, 
cultural organizations, town and county records offices, and colleges 
and universities--improve their ability to preserve and care for their 
significant humanities collections, which may include books and 
journals, archives and manuscripts, prints and photographs, 
architectural and cartographic records, decorative and fine art 
objects, archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, furniture, 
historical objects, and digital materials.
    The Coalition is grateful to the Committee for the opportunity to 
offer its perspective on FY24 appropriations for the Interior, 
Environment and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The Coalition 
stands ready to work with the Committee on finding common ground to 
achieve the FY24 funding levels that will support and enhance historic 
preservation.

                                 ______
                                 
Prepared Statement of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, I am Michael B. (Mike) Murray, Chair of the Executive 
Council of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks 
(Coalition). The Coalition is a non-profit organization composed of 
more than 2,400 retired, former, and current employees of the National 
Park Service (NPS) who collectively have over 40,000 years of 
experience managing and protecting our National parks. The Coalition 
studies, educates, speaks, and acts for the preservation of America's 
National Park System. We appreciate the opportunity to present this 
statement for the record on the FY 2024 Appropriations for the NPS, our 
National parks, and their partnership grant and assistance programs.
    The Coalition was pleased to see the president request an increase 
in the FY 2024 NPS discretionary budget with his recommendation of a 
total of $3.8 billion. This represents over a $289 million increase for 
the NPS from the FY 2023 enacted level.
    For years, our National parks have been trying to manage 
dramatically increasing visitation with inadequate operating budgets 
and staff reductions in parks, program offices, as well as regional and 
central offices. These reductions resulted in fewer programs, shortened 
hours of operations, and reduced capacity in the parks to address park 
maintenance issues and visitor safety. In program offices, reduced 
staff resulted in less support for parks and programs. Additionally, 
concerns about adequate funding have led to low staff morale.
    The rapid growth in visitation and corresponding decreases in park 
funding and staffing are resulting in a decline in the quality of 
visitor experience, the degradation of natural and cultural resources, 
growing traffic and parking issues as well as crowding, along with 
increasing safety and public health concerns for both visitors and 
employees. One major park superintendent told the Coalition that he/she 
has never been so concerned for the future of the park and for park 
staff. As just one example, the park's visitation has increased by 90 
percent since 2010, yet its funding has declined by 12 percent. Meeting 
these complex challenges will be difficult, but failing to adequately 
address these needs equates to failing at the NPS mission of preserving 
our Nation's natural and cultural heritage while providing for a 
quality visitor use experience. Park funding and staffing must be 
increased and additional government housing must be provided or these 
problems will only grow worse according to numerous park managers.
    The actions authorized in the past few years through the Great 
American Outdoors (GAOA) and Inflation Reduction Acts begin to address 
the financial shortfalls that the NPS has been experiencing. The 
concern is that many of these recently appropriated funds are temporary 
and/or project specific. Base increases that are permanent are needed 
to ensure that park and program fixed costs are addressed and that 
staffing is restored to previous levels or increased levels so that 
parks and programs can address the needs and impacts that increased 
visitation has on both the visitor experience and safety and protection 
of park resources. Rebuilding park, program, and regional and central 
office staff will also address the agency's low employee morale 
concerns as it will ensure that staff are not asked continually to do 
more with fewer staff resources.

    The president's FY 2024 budget is a good step forward toward 
addressing important needs of the NPS. The Coalition provides the 
following recommendations for these funds in the coming fiscal year:
    1) Continuing to Enhance and Build Operational Capacity (ONPS). The 
top priority for the Coalition this year is a focus on the NPS 
employees and the services they provide for park visitors. The 
president's budget recommends an additional $266.3 million in park 
operations and their support services. The budget increases provided in 
the ONPS and other accounts of the NPS would result in filling over 
1,300 positions that were lost over the past decade. This, in turn, 
would help ensure that all parks, including the small and medium-sized 
parks, which rely on services provided by regional and Washington, 
D.C., program offices, would benefit.
    To ensure park, regional, and program offices do not go backwards, 
it is imperative that fixed costs are appropriated first. The budget 
recommends a total of $124.9 million for fixed costs, which the 
Coalition strongly supports. Additionally, the budget recommends the 
proposed increased funding focus on staffing for new parks as well as 
those parks experiencing increased visitation. The Coalition agrees 
with these priorities to help ensure a quality visitor experience and 
to address the employee workload at parks where visitation continues to 
grow from year to year.
    This proposed budget builds on Congress' action in the current 
year's appropriation that provided important increases for the 
preservation of the natural resources entrusted to the care of the NPS. 
The Coalition supported last year's appropriations bill and agrees with 
the continued focus in the FY 2024 recommendations in order to address 
climate change and other natural resource protection programs.
    As the Coalition noted last year, equally important for the 
subcommittee is doing something to replace the loss of almost 30 
percent of cultural resource management positions in our National 
parks, regional, and program offices. Many cultural resources, 
including historic buildings, museum objects, and archaeological sites, 
are unmaintained, severely threatened, or degraded. The FY 2024 budget 
recommendations propose an additional $18.8 million to support programs 
to address cultural resource protection, address racial equity, and to 
support underserved communities.
    In the past, cultural resource protection often has been a lower 
priority among the needs of the NPS, and we are aware it is difficult 
for the subcommittee to ensure additional funding is used by the parks 
for cultural resource protection when parks find their budgets 
stretched. We recommend the subcommittee include report language to 
accompany the FY 2024 bill that directs the NPS to provide guidance to 
the parks on using funding equitably among natural and cultural 
resource protection programs and to provide an accounting of these 
funds to the House and Senate committees during FY 2024.
    Additionally, the Coalition expresses its continued support for the 
NPS proposal to extend the period of availability of funding in the 
ONPS account to 2 years, which will allow more efficient management of 
resources and permit adjustment for disruptions that occur within the 
fiscal year. This request is consistent with that provided to other 
bureaus within the Department of the Interior.
    2) National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P). Within the 
president's budget, various programs such as the National Register of 
Historic Places, Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance, and 
several grant programs including the Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation, Japanese American Confinement Sites, and National 
Heritage Areas, are funded under this account.
    The Coalition notes that these programs are critical to the 
partnership work of the NPS, and they need adequate staff to fulfill 
their partnership responsibilities in a timely manner, which has been a 
critical area of concern in recent years. The president's budget 
recommends an additional $2.7 million in FY 2024 for the various 
programs covered under this account to assist in effective 
administration of these programs, which the Coalition strongly 
supports.
    3) Construction. The president's budget recommends $286.6 million 
for the Construction account, which is an increase of $46.8 million 
over the FY 2023 enacted level. The Coalition supports this funding as 
a needed partner to the mandatory funding provided by the GAOA. The NPS 
construction funding helps to ensure cyclic maintenance and repair/
rehab activities are carried out so that the backlog of NPS maintenance 
does not continue to grow.
    Of particular importance to the Coalition is funding to address the 
NPS' park housing needs. The FY 2024 budget recommends building on last 
year's momentum by increasing the housing request to $14.9 million, an 
additional $7 million over the current year's enacted level. The 
Coalition strongly supports this proposed increase to assist the parks 
in attracting and retaining the needed permanent and seasonal staffing 
who can live in affordable housing in many areas where such housing 
options are either unavailable or unaffordable by staff living on 
government salaries.
    4) Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Most national parks 
have private lands within their Congressionally established boundaries. 
To fully protect the park's natural and cultural resources, these 
inholdings must be acquired. Acquiring these parcels is not expanding 
parks, but rather completing them, making management of the parks more 
efficient and saving money as well as staff time that is otherwise 
spent dealing with land use conflicts and threats of inappropriate use 
or resource damage.
    The NPS officially estimates $2 billion is needed to acquire the 
private inholdings within park boundaries. Ever since the passage of 
the GAOA, the share the NPS has received for specific Federal LWCF 
acquisitions in any 1 year has hovered just slightly over $60 million. 
This level of funding makes it difficult to even begin to address the 
backlog or to have sufficient funds available to acquire key parcels 
when opportunities quickly arise.
    The president's request for the Federal land acquisition program of 
the NPS is $104.3 million of which $61.8 million is for specific 
acquisitions. The NPS should be allocated a more proportionate share of 
the LWCF to address its backlog. Additionally, the number of 
emergencies, hardships, and unexpected situations that occur each year 
cannot be adequately addressed in a timely manner with the $5 million 
requested. This amount should be increased to at least $10 million to 
ensure funding is available to meet these opportunities as they come 
about.
    5) Other programs. We end our statement by noting our support for 
the administration's efforts and associated funding to improve 
coordination with Tribal nations, for its request for the critical work 
of the Historic Preservation Fund to preserve historically and 
culturally significant sites and provide competitive grants to non-
Federal entities, and for the $15 million in matching funding for the 
Centennial Challenge program, which benefits several parks within the 
system.
    Thank you for consideration of our request. We look forward to 
continuing to work with you during the consideration of the FY 2024 
Interior appropriations bill.

Prepared Statement of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program
    Congress authorized the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Program (Program) through the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act 
(Act) in 1974 to offset increased damages caused by development and use 
of the waters of the Colorado River. Congress has directed the 
Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to implement a comprehensive 
program for minimizing salt contributions to the Colorado River from 
lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). BLM has 
funded these efforts as directed by Congress through its Aquatic 
Resources Program. BLM's efforts are an essential part of the overall 
effort. A funding level of $2.0 million for salinity specific projects 
in 2024 is requested to prevent further degradation of the quality of 
the Colorado River and a commensurate increase in downstream economic 
damages.
    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified that 
more than 60 percent of the salt load of the Colorado River comes from 
natural sources. The majority of land within the Colorado River Basin 
is federally owned, much of which is administered by BLM. In 
authorizing Program, Congress recognized that most of the salts in the 
Colorado River originate from federally owned lands. Title II of the 
act addresses measures upstream from Imperial Dam, thus improving the 
quality of the water delivered to users in the United States. This 
testimony deals specifically with Title II efforts. In 1984, Congress 
amended the Salinity Control Act and directed the Secretary to develop 
a comprehensive program for minimizing salt contributions to the 
Colorado River from lands administered by BLM. In 2000, Congress 
reiterated its directive to the Secretary and requested a report on the 
implementation of BLM's program. Beginning in 2003, BLM employed a 
Salinity Coordinator to increase BLM efforts in the Colorado River 
Basin to pursue salinity control studies and to implement specific 
salinity control practices.
    BLM is now working on a comprehensive Colorado River Basin salinity 
control program as directed by Congress. In January 2018 BLM issued A 
Framework for Improving the Effectiveness of the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Program, 2018-2023. This document lays out how BLM 
intends to implement Colorado River Basin salinity control activities 
over the 5-year period. Meaningful resources have been expended by BLM 
in the past few years to better understand salt mobilization on 
rangelands. With a significant portion of the salt load of the Colorado 
River coming from BLM administered lands, the BLM portion of the 
overall program is essential to the success of the effort. Inadequate 
BLM salinity control efforts will result in significant additional 
economic damage to water users downstream.

    Damages to water users in the United States and Mexico, caused by 
the high concentration of salt in the Colorado River, include:

  --reduced ability to reclaim and reuse water for beneficial uses,

  --reduced yield of salt sensitive crops,

  --increased use of imported water and cost of desalination,

  --reduced useful life of galvanized water pipe systems and 
        appliances,

  --increased use of bottled water and water softeners,

  --increased cost of cooling operations and water softening,

  --increased cost of water treatment,

  --increased sewer fees,

  --decreased lifespan of treatment facilities and pipelines,

  --difficulty meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply with 
        National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        requirements,

    The State of New Mexico is a member of the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Forum (Forum) which is composed of gubernatorial 
appointees from Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, 
Utah, and Wyoming. Every third year, the Forum adopts a Plan of 
Implementation consistent with efforts to facilitate compliance with 
the Clean Water Act. The level of appropriation requested in this 
testimony is in keeping with the adopted Plan of Implementation. If 
adequate funds are not appropriated, significant damages from higher 
salinity concentrations in the water will be more widespread in the 
United States and Mexico.
    New Mexico stands in support of a continuation of BLM's work and 
requests that this committee direct BLM to expend at least $2.0 million 
in 2024 from its Aquatic Resources Program for Colorado River specific 
salinity control activities.

   Prepared Statement of Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum
    Waters from the Colorado River are used by nearly 40 million people 
for municipal and industrial purposes and for irrigation of 
approximately 5.5 million acres in the United States. Natural and 
human-induced salt loading to the Colorado River causes environmental 
and economic damages. Though past efforts have reduced annual damages 
to water users by several hundred million dollars per year, in 2020 the 
Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) estimated the quantifiable damages 
to Lower Basin water users due to elevated salinity levels still at 
about $354 million per year (unquantifiable damages add to this 
amount). Congress authorized the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Program (Program) through the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act 
(Act) (Public Law 93-320) in 1974 to offset increased damages caused by 
development and use of the waters of the Colorado River. Modeling by 
Reclamation indicates that the quantifiable damages would rise to 
approximately $671 million by the year 2040 without continuation of the 
Program. Congress has directed the Secretary of the Interior 
(Secretary) to implement a comprehensive program for minimizing salt 
contributions to the Colorado River from lands administered by the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM). BLM has funded these efforts as

downstream of Imperial Dam that enable the U.S. to meet its commitment 
regarding the quality of waters being delivered to Mexico (Minute No. 
242 of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States 
and Mexico). Title II of the act addresses measures upstream from 
Imperial Dam, thus improving the quality of the water delivered to 
users in the United States. This testimony deals specifically with 
Title II efforts. In 1984, Congress amended the Salinity Control Act 
(Public Law 98-569) and directed the Secretary to develop a

BLM salinity control efforts will result in significant additional 
economic damage to water users downstream.
    Damages to water users in the United States and Mexico, caused by 
the concentration of salt in the Colorado River, by water usage sector, 
include the following:

  --a reduction in the ability to reclaim and reuse water for 
        beneficial uses, including drinking water and irrigation water 
        supplies, due to high salinities in the water delivered to 
        water treatment and reclamation facilities,

  --a reduction in the yield of salt sensitive crops, increased water 
        use to meet leaching requirements and additional actions 
        necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act for the 
        agricultural sector,

  --an increased use of imported water and cost of desalination and 
        brine disposal for recycling water in the municipal sector,

  --a reduction in the useful life of galvanized water pipe systems, 
        water heaters, faucets, garbage disposals, clothes washers and 
        dishwashers, and increased use of bottled water and water 
        softeners in the household sector,

  --an increase in the cost of cooling operations and the cost of water 
        softening, and a decrease in equipment service life in the 
        commercial sector,

  --an increase in the use of water and the cost of water treatment, 
        and a corresponding increase in sewer fees in the industrial 
        sector,

  --a decrease in the lifespan of treatment facilities and pipelines in 
        the utility sector, and

  --difficulty in meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply 
        with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        terms and conditions, and an increase in desalination and brine 
        disposal costs necessary to minimize accumulation of salts in 
        groundwater basins.

    The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum (Forum) is composed 
of gubernatorial appointees from Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. The Forum is charged with reviewing the 
Colorado River's water quality standards for salinity every 3 years to 
facilitate compliance with Section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act 
(Public Law 92-500). In so doing, it adopts a Plan of Implementation 
consistent with these standards. The level of appropriation requested 
in this testimony is consistent with the adopted Plan of 
Implementation. If adequate funds are not appropriated, significant 
damages from higher salinity concentrations in the waters of the 
Colorado River will be more widespread in the United States and Mexico.
    In summary, implementation of salinity control practices through 
BLM is a cost-effective method of controlling the salinity of the 
Colorado River and is an essential component to the overall Program. 
Continuation of adequate funding levels for salinity control within the 
Aquatic Resources Program will assist in preventing further degradation 
of the Colorado River's water quality and a commensurate significant 
increase in economic damages to municipal, industrial and irrigation 
users. A modest investment in source control pays huge dividends in 
improved water quality to nearly 40 million Americans. The Forum 
requests that this committee direct that BLM continue its support of 
the Program and expend at least $2.0 million in 2024 from its Aquatic 
Resources Program for Colorado River specific salinity control 
activities.

Prepared Statement of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony in 
support of fiscal year 2024 (FY24) funding for the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Program (Program) in the amounts listed in the table 
below. Congress authorized the Program in the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Act (Public Law 93-320) to enhance and protect the 
quality of water available for Colorado River water users in the United 
Sates and the Republic of Mexico. This FY24 funding request will help 
fulfill obligations of this act and prevent further water quality 
degradation and related economic damages in our region.

    As a regional water wholesaler, The Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California (Metropolitan) provides supplemental water for 26 
public member agencies to deliver-either directly or through their sub-
agencies-to nearly 19 million people living in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura counties. Roughly one-
half of Metropolitan's imported water comes from the Colorado River.
    The Program has successfully reduced the salinity of the Colorado 
River by over 90 milligrams per liter (mg/l) at Lake Havasu. Despite 
the Program's success, salt in the Colorado River continues to cause an 
estimated $354 million in damages to water users each year, including 
damages to consumer and commercial equipment, water supply treatment 
processes, agriculture, groundwater replenishment activities, and 
wastewater recycling. Many of these damages occur within Metropolitan's 
service area as water imported via the Colorado River Aqueduct has the 
highest salinity of all of Metropolitan's supplies, averaging around 
630 mg/L since 1976. The continuing drought in the western United 
States threatens to exacerbate these damages as low river flows and 
record-low reservoir volumes provide less water to dilute saline 
inflows.
    Without the Program, damages to Colorado River water users would be 
much higher. Modeling by Reclamation indicates that economic damages 
would rise to approximately $671 million-almost double current damages-
by the year 2040 without continuation of the Program. Metropolitan 
urges the subcommittee to support funding for the Program in FY24 at 
the levels outlined above so that it can avoid these additional impacts 
of increased salinity.
    Given the scale of these potential damages, Congress's continuing 
modest investment in the Program yields a substantial rate of return. 
In addition to Congress's contribution, the seven Colorado River Basin 
States provide matching funds up to 30% of Program funding, extending 
the value of Congress's contribution even further.
    The Program funds the Paradox Valley Unit (PVU), which includes a 
deep injection well used to sequester brine from the hyper-saline 
Dolores River (a tributary to the Colorado River) in western Colorado. 
Until recently, the well was virtually non-operational due to induced 
seismic activity in the valley. The PVU is especially important to our 
region as it is the largest single salinity control project in the 
Program. Historically, the PVU has reduced salt loads to the Colorado 
River by over 100,000 tons per year and salt concentrations at key 
downstream locations by up to 9 mg/L. Although the PVU has resumed 
operation on a trial basis at two-thirds of injection capacity, given 
the project's unique importance, Metropolitan urges Reclamation to 
expedite the identification of a long-term solution that prevents the 
salt from reaching the Colorado River.
    The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum (Forum) was formed 
in 1973 to coordinate the Colorado River Basin States' salinity control 
efforts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has charged the 
Forum with reviewing the Colorado River's water quality standards for 
salinity every 3 years (the ``Triennial Review''). In so doing, the 
Forum adopts a Plan of Implementation consistent with these standards. 
The level of appropriations requested in this testimony is in keeping 
with the Forum's Plan of Implementation adopted in the 2020 Triennial 
Review, which will be implemented by the BLM, Reclamation, and the 
NRCS.
    Metropolitan appreciates your consideration of this request. Please 
feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

    Prepared Statement of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control
    This testimony is in support of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 funding for 
the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 
associated activities that assist the implementation of Title II of the 
Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-320). 
This long-standing successful and cost-effective salinity control 
program in the Colorado River Basin is being carried out pursuant to 
the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act and the Clean Water Act 
(Public Law 92-500). Congress has directed the Secretary of the 
Interior to implement a comprehensive program for minimizing salt 
contributions to the Colorado River from lands administered by the BLM. 
BLM funds these efforts through the Aquatic Resources Program. BLM's 
efforts are an essential part of the overall effort. A funding level of 
$2.0 million for salinity specific projects in FY-2024 is requested to 
prevent further degradation of the quality of Colorado River water 
supplies and increased environmental and economic damages.
    The Colorado River Board of California (Colorado River Board) is 
the state agency charged with protecting California's interests and 
rights in the water and power resources of the Colorado River system. 
In this capacity, California participates along with the other six 
Colorado River Basin States through the Colorado River Basin Salinity 
Control Forum (Forum), the interstate organization responsible for 
coordinating the Basin States' salinity control efforts. In close 
cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 
pursuant to requirements of the Clean Water Act, the Forum is charged 
with reviewing the Colorado River water quality standards every 3 
years. Every 3 years the Forum adopts a Plan of Implementation 
consistent with these water quality standards. If adequate funds are 
not appropriated, significant damages associated with increasing 
salinity concentrations of Colorado River water will become more 
widespread in the United States and Mexican portions of the Colorado 
River Basin.
    The EPA has determined that more than sixty percent of the salt 
load of the Colorado River comes from natural sources. Through passage 
of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act in 1974, Congress 
recognized that much of the salts in the Colorado River originate on 
federally owned lands, much of which is administered by BLM. Title I of 
the Salinity Control Act deals with the U.S. commitment to efforts 
related to maintaining the quality of waters being delivered to Mexico 
pursuant to the 1944 Water Treaty. Title II of the act deals with 
improving the quality of the water delivered to water users in the 
United States. In 1984, Congress amended the Salinity Control Act and 
directed that the Secretary of the Interior develop a comprehensive 
program for minimizing salt contributions to the Colorado River from 
lands administered by BLM. In 2000, Congress reiterated its directive 
to the Secretary and requested a report on the implementation of BLM's 
program (Public Law 106-459). In 2003, BLM employed a Salinity 
Coordinator to coordinate BLM efforts in the Colorado River Basin 
States to pursue salinity control studies and to implement specific 
salinity control practices. BLM is now working to create a 
comprehensive Colorado River Basin salinity control program as directed 
by Congress. In January 2018 BLM issued A Framework for Improving the 
Effectiveness of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program, 
2018-2023. This document lays out how BLM intends to implement Colorado 
River Basin salinity control activities over the next 5 years. 
Meaningful resources have been expended by BLM in the past few years to 
better understand salt mobilization on rangelands. With a significant 
portion of the salt load of the Colorado River coming from BLM-
administered lands, the BLM portion of the overall program is essential 
to the success of the entire effort. Inadequate support for BLM 
salinity control efforts will result in significant additional economic 
damages to water users downstream.
    Over the forty-nine years since the passage of the Colorado River 
Basin Salinity Control Act, much has been learned about the impact of 
salts in the Colorado River system. As described in the 2020 Plan of 
Implementation, the salinity concentration of Colorado River water 
causes about $354 million in quantifiable economic damages in the 
United States annually. Economic and hydrologic modeling by Reclamation 
indicates that these economic damages could rise to more than $671 
million by the year 2040 without continued implementation of the 
salinity control program. For example, damages can be incurred related 
to the following activities:

  --A reduction in the ability and increased costs to reclaim and reuse 
        water due to high salinities in the water delivered to water 
        treatment and reclamation facilities;

  --A reduction in the yield of salt-sensitive crops and increased 
        water use to meet the leaching requirements in the agricultural 
        sector;

  --Increases in the amount of imported water;

  --Increased costs of desalination and brine disposal for recycled 
        water in the municipal sector;

  --A reduction in the useful life of galvanized water pipe systems, 
        water heaters, faucets, and other household appliances, and 
        increased use of bottled water and water softeners in the 
        residential sectors;

  --Increased costs of cooling operations and the cost of water 
        softening, and a decrease in equipment service life in the 
        commercial sector;

  --Increases in the use of water and cost of water treatment, and an 
        increase in sewer fees in the industrial sector;

  --Decreased life of treatment facilities and pipelines in the utility 
        sector;

  --Increasing difficulty in meeting wastewater discharge requirements 
        to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 
        permit terms and conditions; and

  --Increased desalination and brine disposal costs due to accumulation 
        of salts in groundwater basins.

    Based on current program cost levels, a funding level of $2.0 
million for salinity specific projects in FY-2024 is requested to 
continue this longstanding program for minimizing salt contributions to 
the Colorado River from lands administered by the BLM
    The Colorado River is, and will continue to be, a major and vital 
water resource to the nearly 20 million residents of southern 
California, including municipal, industrial, and agricultural water 
users in Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San 
Diego, and Ventura Counties. The protection and improvement of Colorado 
River water quality through the continued implementation of this very 
effective salinity control program avoids, or reduces, additional 
environmental and economic damages to California, the other Colorado 
River Basin States, and Mexico that rely on Colorado River water 
resources.
    Thank you for your consideration of this testimony.

    II.  Provide Funding for Tribal Climate Resilience--$5 million

    Good afternoon, Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and 
members of the subcommittee. My name is Ron Suppah and I have the 
privilege of serving as Chair of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish 
Commission (CRITFC). I also serve as Vice Chair of the Off-Reservation 
Fish and Wildlife Committee of the Warm Springs Tribes.
    CRITFC was founded in 1977 by the four Columbia River treaty 
Tribes: Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, 
Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, 
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, and the Nez Perce 
Tribe. CRITFC provides coordination and technical assistance to these 
Tribes in regional, national, and international efforts to protect and 
restore our shared salmon, steelhead, Pacific lamprey, and white 
sturgeon resources and the habitat upon which these species depend.
    Our collective ancestral homelands are an area the size of the 
State of Georgia and cover nearly one-third of the U.S. portion of the 
Columbia River basin. In 1855, the U.S. entered into treaties with the 
four Tribes whereupon we ceded millions of acres of our homelands. In 
return, the U.S. pledged to honor our ancestral rights, including the 
right to fish in all Usual and Accustomed stations. Unfortunately, a 
perilous history has brought the salmon, steelhead, and Pacific lamprey 
populations to the edge of extinction. Twelve Columbia Basin salmon and 
steelhead populations in the are listed under the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA), Pacific lamprey have declined 95% from historic numbers, and 
the white sturgeon population is struggling to maintain itself.
    The CRITFC member Tribes are internationally recognized leaders in 
fisheries restoration and management. We are principals in the region's 
efforts to halt the decline of salmon, lamprey, and sturgeon 
populations and rebuild them to levels that support ceremonial, 
subsistence, and economic needs. Columbia River fish stocks form the 
core of high value fisheries from the interior West to Southeast Alaska 
valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. To restore these fish 
population, our actions emphasize 'gravel-to-gravel' management, 
including supplementation of natural stocks, healthy watersheds, and 
collaboration with State, Federal, and private entities.
    For CRITFC to continue to do this critical work, we need adequate 
funding from Congress. Therefore, I thank you for the opportunity to 
testify regarding CRITFC's funding priorities. My testimony will focus 
on the appropriations necessary to continue the exercise of our treaty-
reserved rights to harvest fish on the Columbia River.
         increase funding for rights protection implementation
          a. Columbia River Fisheries Management

    The Tribes are leaders in one of the Nation's largest fishery 
restoration efforts in response to the negative impacts of the Federal 
Columbia River Power System. Management is increasing in complexity and 
sophistication requiring greater data collection, collaboration, and 
enforcement. Funding shortfalls prohibit the achievement of Tribal 
self-determination goals for fisheries management, ESA recovery 
efforts, protecting non-listed species, conservation enforcement, and 
harvest monitoring. The BIA's Columbia River Fisheries Management 
budget supports the core fishery program efforts of CRITFC and our 
member Tribes and allows us to work across the bulk of current 
anadromous fish habitat in the Columbia Basin. We request an increase 
of $624,000 over FY 2023 levels for a new program base of $6.865 
million.
    CRITFC and our member Tribes are principal implementers of actions 
laid out in three landmark agreements: 1) the Columbia Basin Fish 
Accords with Federal action agencies overseeing the Federal hydro 
system in the Columbia Basin \1\, 2) continuing engagement in a 10-year 
Fisheries Management Plan with federal, Tribal, and state parties under 
U.S. v Oregon, and 3) a new Chinook Chapter of the Pacific Salmon 
Treaty. These agreements establish regional and international 
commitments to harvest and fish production efforts, commitments to 
critical investments in habitat restoration, and resolving contentious 
issues by seeking balance of the many demands within the Columbia River 
basin. While the Tribes have committed to substantial on-the-ground 
projects through these agreements with additional resources from the 
Bonneville Power Administration, the overall management 
responsibilities of the Tribal programs have grown exponentially 
without commensurate increases in BIA base funding capacity. For 
example, Congress recently enacted the Endangered Salmon Predation 
Control Act, Public Law 115-329, which recognizes that CRITFC and its 
member Tribes are a part of the regional effort to manage sea lion 
predation in the Columbia River. The Tribes are also addressing unmet 
mitigation obligations such as fish losses associated with the John Day 
and The Dalles dams and increasing avian and piscivorous fish 
predation. Rights Protection Implementation funding takes on even 
greater importance as funding for State co-management agencies has 
become inconsistent or decreased.

signatory

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
          b. Columbia River-In Lieu Sites Law Enforcement

    Public safety is a high priority for CRITFC and our member Tribes. 
Our conservation and criminal enforcement officers are the cornerstone 
of public safety in the heavily used Columbia River Gorge area, 
patrolling 150 miles of the river and its shorelines in Oregon and 
Washington. We are the primary provider of enforcement services at 31 
fishing access sites developed pursuant to Public Law 87-14 and Public 
Law 100-581 for use by treaty fisheries. CRITFC's officers possess BIA 
Special Law Enforcement Commissions to enhance protection and service 
to Tribal members and Federal trust properties along the river. CRITFC 
entered a Public Law 93-638 contract with BIA in 2011 for enforcement 
services along the Columbia River. That contract provides funding for 
two positions. Additional appropriations were provided in FY2021 
($1.5m), FY2022 ($1.5m), and FY 2023 ($1.575m) to enhance public safety 
and law enforcement services. Funding has become reoccurring, and this 
leads to the long-term stability of this public safety effort.

          c. Columbia River-Fishing Access Site Operations

    A Federal commitment to provide O&M funding was established under a 
1997 MOU between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and BIA and assigned 
to CRITFC in 2003. This O&M need was funded in FY 2022 and FY 2023 at 
$1.7 million. This base O+M funding is very important to the health and 
safety of our treaty fishers as they access the Columbia River in 
exercise of their treaty reserved fishing rights.

          d. U.S. Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty

    In response to declining salmon populations and pending treaty 
fishing rights litigation, the U.S. and Canada forged the Pacific 
Salmon Treaty in 1985 to conserve and rebuild salmon stocks, provide 
for optimum production, and control salmon interceptions.
    The Pacific Salmon Treaty established the Pacific Salmon Commission 
(PSC) as a forum to collaborate on intermingled salmon stocks. The U.S. 
Section of the PSC annually develops a coordinated budget for Tribal, 
State, and Federal programs to ensure cost and program efficiencies. 
The 2008 agreement, which expired at the end of 2018, represented a 
step forward in ensuring the conservation and rebuilding of the shared 
salmon resource. The Parties recently completed revisions to the 2008 
agreement. The revised agreement calls for the implementation of 
additional data requirements.
    For Tribal participation in the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the U.S. 
Section has identified a continuing program need of $6.792 million for 
the 25 participating Tribes to implement the revised agreement. These 
funds provide for direct Tribal participation with the Commission, 
panels, and technical committees. This funding maintains Tribal 
resource assessment and research programs structured to fulfill 
required treaty implementation activities which protect trust resources 
and ensures that our Tribal fishers receive an equitable portion of the 
harvestable fish numbers. Our FY 2023 recommended level for this 
program is consistent with the FY 2022 level and correlates with the 
U.S. Section's recommendation.

          e. Implementation of Public Law 116-99

    Public Law 116-99 recognized the deteriorating condition of the 
sites due to age and significant use and Congress authorized $11 
million to refurbish the sites in order to meet human health and safety 
standards. We are requesting $5 million in FY 2024, to continue 
implementation of the act. The assessment of the sites was completed in 
2022 and we are conducting architecture and design and beginning 
construction based on the assessment findings.

          f. Youth Program Initiatives

    CRITFC strives to build a Tribal workforce pool of respected and 
skilled Native American scientists, policy analysts, technicians, and 
managers that serve the Tribes' fisheries and natural resource 
management program needs. CRITFC's Workforce Development Program helps 
prepare Tribal members of all ages for jobs and careers in natural 
resources management by providing hands-on, culturally relevant 
experiences that expand their exposure to science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM). Except for a pandemic-related pause in 
2020 and 2021, CRITFC has held a week-long Salmon Camp for middle 
school students in collaboration with our member Tribes since 2010 
using limited funding resources. Adequate funding would enable the 
Tribes to continue this program. From 2014-2017, CRITFC was able to 
offer paid internships and research experiences for college students 
interested in fisheries and natural resources, but due to a lack of 
funding, those opportunities are not currently available. In 2020, 
CRITFC acquired an estuary and near coastal observation program which 
we hope can provide Tribal workforce opportunities in the estuary and 
marine environments.

          g. Columbia River Treaty Modernization

    Rights Protection Implementation supports CRITFC's participation in 
the Columbia River Treaty re-negotiation. The treaty-reserved rights of 
CRITFC's member Tribes, as well as management authorities and 
responsibilities, are substantially affected by the Columbia River 
Treaty. While the Columbia River Treaty is evergreen and continues to 
provide benefits to both the U.S. and Canada through coordinated flood 
risk management and hydropower production, the Regional Recommendation 
urges modernizations by incorporating ecosystem function as a third 
primary purpose of the treaty. This necessary amendment would enhance 
the Columbia River Treaty to provide built-in principles in a pro-
active, comprehensive manner rather than reacting in a piecemeal 
approach to individual salmon listings under the Endangered Species 
Act. Increased RPI funds will allow the Columbia Basin Tribes to 
continue collaborating with the States, Federal agencies, and regional 
stakeholders to provide technical analyses in support of the 
negotiations with Canada being led by the State Department.
             provide funding for tribal climate resilience
    The Columbia River treaty fishing Tribes are a place-based people. 
We have lived thousands of years on our homelands. We walk in the 
footsteps of our ancestors. Our place is on the specific landscape of 
the Columbia River. Climate-related stress was evident in 2020 in the 
form of historic forest fires and in 2015 with the loss of up to 
400,000 adult sockeye salmon, including 99% of the sockeye returning to 
Idaho, due to elevated water temperatures. There must be continued 
funding to help the Tribes collaborate with public, private, and non-
profit sectors to develop and implement adaptation strategies to 
protect species at risk. CRITFC requests $5 million for our four 
constituent Tribes and CRITFC for planning and coordination development 
needed to continue the work of addressing the myriad of issues climate 
change is creating for our natural resources.
    On behalf of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, thank 
you for the opportunity to provide the subcommittee with our funding 
priorities for Fiscal Year 2024.

                                 Nation
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and distinguished members 
of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the Interior, Environment 
and Related Agencies, this testimony is submitted on behalf of the 
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation (``Yakama Nation''). 
The Yakama Nation is an inherently sovereign Native Nation with 
reserved rights and privileges pursuant to the 1855 Treaty between the 
United States and the Yakamas (``Treaty'').\1\ A Federal treaty is 
considered the supreme Law of the Land under the U.S. Constitution.\2\ 
The Yakama Nation protects all of its natural and cultural resources in 
Yakama Nation's Treaty-territory and provides for the health, safety, 
and welfare of the more than 11,000 enrolled Yakama Members pursuant to 
the Yakama Nation's status as a sovereign Native Nation and its Treaty-
reserved authority. The United States has duties and obligations under 
the Treaty, statute, and the trust relationship to provide for the 
public safety, resource protection, and human services set forth below.

    \1\ See Treaty with the Yakamas, U.S.--Yakama Nation, June 9, 1855, 
12 Stat. 951.
    \2\ See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   bureau of indian affairs (``bia'')
    The Yakama Nation carries out many Federal trust functions through 
contracts issued by the United States pursuant to Public Law 93-638, 
Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (``ISDEAA''). 
Thus, ``638ed'' Federal functions are administered by Tribes under 
``638 Contracts''. A 638 Contract generally establishes the 
organizational framework and performance standards, and is supposed to 
provide the funding necessary for the contracted Tribal department to 
perform the Federal function--however, current funding levels are 
insufficient and funding over the past decade has remained flat, which 
is a decrease due to inflation. The Yakama Nation has been thrifty with 
available staff and budgets to ensure Yakama Members receive some 
measure of services owed to them by the United States. To avoid 
endangering public safety, health, and welfare, the Yakama Nation has 
also supplemented Federal services with its own dollars to avoid 
critical lapses in Federal trust functions and the Yakama Nation has 
secured non-federal funds through State legislative and grant 
processes.
a.  Additional Public Safety & Law Enforcement Funding is Needed
    The Yakama Nation has roughly a quarter of the officers needed to 
protect and serve the community that resides withing the largest Treaty 
Reservation in Washington State.
    The Yakama Nation protects its people and communities under a 638 
Contract through the BIA, with oversight from the Interior's Office of 
Justice Services (``OJS''). Guidance from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation States that 2.3 police officers per 1,000 residents are 
needed, which is roughly 76 officers. The 638 Contract currently funds 
20 patrol officers for the 1.4 million acre Yakama Reservation. Less 
are often deployed due to training requirements and non-competitive 
compensation; during 2022 and 2023, as a few as 14 officers were on 
patrol.
    The Yakama Nation has experienced an increase in violent crime and 
property crimes, and has the highest occurrence of Missing and Murdered 
Indigenous Women/People in the region. The alarming rise in Latin 
American based gang and cartel-related drug activities is terrifying 
and the fentanyl epidemic plagues our Reservation communities. There 
are simply not enough law enforcement resources to meet our public 
safety needs. The Yakama Nation has collaborated with local municipal 
and county law enforcement agencies to create regional taskforce 
solutions and bring additional resources for the protection of Yakama 
and non-Yakama communities alike, but with the woefully inadequate 
funding for additional patrol officers our residents on the Yakama 
Reservation do not experience the safe neighborhoods that they deserve. 
The Yakama Nation's coalition-building is not enough; more police 
resources are needed.
    The Yakama Nation Police Department needs more officers and more 
equipment. The region needs better public safety infrastructure to 
execute investigations and provide evidence for criminal prosecution. 
The Federal 638 contract has been flat for the past two decades despite 
requests to OJS for any base increase, even to keep pace with 
inflation. The OJS has their hands tied by budgetary constraints. The 
Yakama Nation has had to figure out how to do more with less, year 
after year for decades. We need more law enforcement funding. We can no 
longer legitimately ask our People for patience when they reasonably 
demand public safety. The Yakama Nation is working with Senator 
Cantwell and the Congressional Delegation to secure temporary enhanced 
patrol funding through the Department of Justice Byrne Justice 
Assistance Grant Program for the purpose of providing community safety 
with dedicated patrol officers working under a Yakama Nation Drug and 
Fentanyl Taskforce.
b.  Appraisal Backlog--'Cobell' Part Two For Probate & Leasing
    The Yakama Nation Appraisals Program lacks the required staff and 
funding levels to address the unwieldly and cascading appraisal backlog 
affecting the probate and leasing programs. The Yakama Nation 
Appraisals Program is 638 Contracted with the Federal Appraisal and 
Valuation Services Office (``AVSO''). Appraisals are critical to 
probate and leasing. With probate, a value determination is made for a 
decedent's trust land. This valuation is necessary for courts to rule 
on a decedent's estate for inheritance decisions. An appraisal is also 
necessary to establish the lease rates for Tribal trust and allotment 
land. In the case of trespass, the appraised lease value will be 
assessed for damage. Timely appraisals are a Federal fiduciary 
obligation.
    Current funding levels only provide for a single appraiser. Given 
the volume of work, the Yakama Nation has hired consultants to assist 
with completing appraisals. But, regardless of supplemental staff 
support, the appraisal backlog accrues at a faster rate. The Yakama 
Nation has submitted mass appraisals based on regression modeling to 
the AVSO as a solution to this trust mismanagement, but the AVSO has 
inexplicably rejected all mass appraisals. Congress needs to provide 
authority for creative solutions like mass appraisals or funding for 
additional staff.
c.  Forest Mismanagement--A Direct Federal Service
    The Yakama Nation has a 650,000 acre forest, and last year the BIA 
only completed one (1) timber sale. Under the National Indian Forest 
Resource Management Act and implementing regulations, express trust 
duties were established for Federal management of Indian forests. The 
BIA Forestry Program at the Yakama Agency has failed to hire many 
dozens of vacant forestry positions for more than a decade. In 2014, 
the BIA Director identified that BIA Forestry at the Yakama Agency is, 
in his words, ``on the verge of collapse.'' The program has only 
continued to deteriorate since then.
    The Yakama Nation made the sovereign decision, and consistent with 
ISDEAA, for the U.S. to provide direct services through the BIA 
Forestry Program. Importantly, forestry management directly implicates 
Treaty-reserved rights and privileges. The BIA is functionally 
abrogating its direct services obligation through its gross 
mismanagement. The Forestry program has nearly stopped functioning 
altogether, and the U.S. is forcing the Yakama Nation to accept lost 
revenue through sheer neglect. This is a dramatic breach of the United 
States' trust obligations established by Treaty, statute, and 
regulation. Congress needs to fund maintenance and increased staffing 
consistent with the Federal obligation.
    This Forest mismanagement is a crisis of lost economic benefit and 
has put Yakama Member-owned logging companies out of business. The 
Yakama Nation's commercial mill can no longer sustain itself on timber 
harvested from the Yakama Nation's own forest--threatening over 200 
Yakama Member-held jobs. Yakama Members are losing the trust revenues 
that they should be receiving from a viable timber economy. This is an 
unconscionable failure for the U.S. to waste this timber resource 
through forest decay and wildfire. Resist the calls for spending cuts 
because such short-term savings will incur greater cost, expense, and 
harm over the decade for these deferred Federal obligations. Instead, 
increase budgetary resources for the BIA to ensure that Federal direct 
service programs can fulfill this Federal duty so that the Yakama 
Nation and its Members can benefit from the forest resources.
d.  Degraded In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites
    The Yakama Nation truly appreciates Senator Merkley's efforts at 
leading this region to address the issue of Federal management of In-
Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites (``Sites'') (see PL 116-99 and 25 
CFR part 248) which have historically provided deplorable conditions 
and substandard living amenities for many Yakama People along the 
Columbia River for decades. More than $40 million is needed to address 
the list of repairs that must be completed across various Sites to 
maintain public safety and access, including but not limited to: 
abandoned property removal; environmental cleanup of soils; restroom/
shower restoration; safety fencing and gate installation and repair; 
access road repair; dock repair; site utility and water main 
improvements; and, wastewater treatment system repairs and septic drain 
field enhancements. To be clear, these are not simple fishing sites. 
These Sites host year-round residents including families and children.
    The Yakama Nation has Treaty-reserved rights to fish the banks of 
the lower Columbia River at all usual and accustomed fishing areas. The 
U.S. broke this Treaty-promise with the construction of the Bonneville 
Dam (1938), the Dalles Dam (1957), and the John Day Dam (1971), each 
inundating traditional villages and countless usual and accustomed 
fishing places. In response to these Treaty-breaches the Site 
improvements were made ``to provide access to usual and accustomed 
fishing areas and ancillary fishing facilities'' for the Yakama Nation 
and its Members. Deterioration threatens continued access and safety at 
these 28 Sites.
    Operation and maintenance of the 28 Sites is 638 Contracted with 
the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (``CRITFC'') to address 
infrastructure repairs, sanitation and safety needs, and property 
improvements. However, beyond minor repairs and improvements, the 
infrastructure needs listed above are unfunded. The Sites need 
improvements that cannot be addressed through the existing 638 
Contract. Congress needs to provide for an annual base funding increase 
to support ongoing operation and improvement obligations.
e.  Salmon Recovery & Treaty Resources
    The Columbia River salmon fishery, Steelhead, Chinook, Sockeye, and 
Coho populations, are in jeopardy--for four decades the recovery 
funding has failed to keep pace with the required mitigation for the 
salmon lost each year to the hydroelectric system. Fishery returns have 
never come close to the Northwest Electric Power and Conservation 
Planning Council (``NPCC'') goal of 5 million salmon returning each 
year, the hydroelectric system continues to kill 5--11 million salmon 
per year, and the Federal Government continues to fail its Treaty-
obligation to the Yakama Nation for 50% of the Treaty-era fishery 
harvest.
    The Yakama Nation's 638 Contract funding levels for fish and 
wildlife programs need to increase above the rate of inflation to 
ensure protection of the Treaty-protected resources. Today, salmon are 
experiencing additional bellwether pressures from climate change, 
warmer water temperatures, and drought-level water levels in the rivers 
and streams. The Yakama Nation's resource programs are regional leaders 
in hatchery management, habitat restoration, and fishery recovery, but 
even this tireless work cannot reverse the effects of the Federal 
hydroelectric system's annual unmitigated fish kill and its $1 billion 
backlog in unfunded fish mitigation infrastructure, including but not 
limited to: hatchery projects; restoration work; and fish passage on 
the Columbia River and all of its tributaries. Congress needs a plan to 
fund the billion-dollar backlog so the next decade is an investment in 
keeping the United States' Treaty-promises.
                  bureau of indian education (``bie'')
    Education on the Yakama Reservation is a Treaty-promise to the 
Yakama People by the Federal Government. Today, the Tribal School 
building is a nearly 70-year old dilapidated facility that is evaluated 
in ``poor'' condition by the BIE's Facility Condition Index. Under the 
available and projected BIE construction funding, the timeline for a 
new school facility is waitlisted for 25--30 years. The Yakama Nation 
cannot wait decades to provide its children with modern facilities and 
a safe learning environment. In 2023, the Yakama Nation secured $3.2 
million from the Washington State Legislature to complete 'shovel 
ready' design documents for a new 80,000 square-foot school facility 
for construction starting July 1, 2025. Now is the time for Federal 
entities at the BIE, BIA, and U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant Program to have the authority 
and funding necessary to pledge grants equal to the amount that Yakama 
Nation will finance for new school construction.
    A Federal commitment now will provide budgetary savings to the BIE 
school replacement fund by matching other funding channels that are 
being secured through the Yakama Nation's leadership. Additionally, BIE 
maintenance expenditures on the current dilapidated facility are sunk-
costs in the Federal budget because they are a band-aid to prevent 
total failure of building systems while Tribal School languishes on a 
BIE building replacement list. Invest now in the Yakama Nation's future 
generations, not only because it is a Federal obligation, but it also 
makes fiscal sense.

              Prepared Statement of the Conservation Fund
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the 
Appropriations subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies, thank you for this opportunity to submit outside witness 
testimony on behalf of The Conservation Fund (TCF). TCF supports the 
mandatory funding request of $900 million and additional discretionary 
funding in Fiscal Year 2024 for the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
(LWCF), which includes the Federal land acquisition programs of the 
Bureau of Land Management ($80 million), National Park Service ($115 
million), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ($120 million), U.S. Forest 
Service ($134 million), as well as three State grant programs, among 
others: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Cooperative Endangered 
Species Conservation Fund ($32 million); National Park Service's State 
Assistance Grants program ($270 million); and the U.S. Forest Service's 
Forest Legacy Program ($100 million). TCF also supports a funding 
request for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's North American 
Wetlands Conservation Fund ($50 million); U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Programs ($100 million); U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake Watershed Investments for 
Landscape Defense Program ($15 million); National Park Service's 
Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Program ($3 million); and the 
U.S. Forest Service's Community Forest and Open Space Conservation 
Program ($7 million); and the Department of Interior's (DOI) Natural 
Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration Program ($10 million). TCF 
requests funding for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative ($425 million) and Chesapeake Bay Program 
($91.5 million).
    TCF is a national, non-profit conservation organization dedicated 
to conserving America's land and water legacy for future generations. 
Established in 1985, TCF works with landowners; federal, State and 
local agencies; and other partners to conserve our Nation's important 
lands for people, wildlife and communities. To date, TCF has helped our 
partners to conserve over 8.5 million acres. These accomplishments are 
due, in large measure, to the leadership of this subcommittee over many 
years to appropriate funds to acquire lands for future generations, 
working forests, recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, and many 
other benefits.
    Below are highlights of some benefits of the LWCF and land 
acquisition programs. While these projects show the tremendous 
diversity of benefits of land acquisition for the public, they have one 
thing in common: each of these projects is driven by landowners. Many 
farmers, ranchers and forestland owners have significant financial 
equity in their land. By enabling a landowner to sell a conservation 
easement or fee title, the LWCF program provides landowners with funds 
to stay in business, reinvest in businesses, or meet other financial 
goals.
    As the subcommittee crafts its Interior, Environment and Related 
Agencies Appropriations bill, there are several key points we 
respectfully request you to consider, listed below.
    Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at $900 million in 
mandatory and additional discretionary funding: The enactment of the 
Great American Outdoors Act is a top momentous land conservation 
victory in a generation. The Conservation Fund applauds Congress for 
passing the bipartisan, bicameral legislation that provides full and 
mandatory funding (at $900 million) for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. We also encourage Congress to provide discretionary funding to 
address emerging needs and opportunities. Funding the Nation's premier 
conservation program with both mandatory and discretionary funding in 
FY2024 will ensure LWCF continues to fulfill its mission to safeguard 
natural areas, water resources, and our cultural heritage, and to 
provide recreation opportunities to all Americans.
    The Conservation Fund applauds the Senate and House Committees for 
its support for land acquisition and appraisal process improvements, as 
was included in the Fiscal Year 2023 report. TCF urges the Committees 
to continue working with the Departments to streamline and improve 
processes, particularly appraisal timelines and partnerships with non-
federal parties, to deliver on priority land conservation efforts and 
effectively implement the Great American Outdoors Act.
    The Conservation Fund also urges the Senate and House Committees to 
continue to support reprogramming of prior years' funding from the 
LWCF, as opposed to rescinding the funding as that practice undermines 
this critical conservation program. It is common for Federal land 
acquisition funds to remain ``unobligated'' until the last step in an 
acquisition project-this can reasonably take up to 5 years. Unobligated 
balances are not a problem in and of themselves, but funding should be 
moved to other acquisition projects if it is no longer needed for 
acquisitions within the Federal unit originally receiving the LWCF 
funding. To this end, Congress should continue to encourage the 
agencies to use a tool they already have-reprogramming-rather than 
rescissions to ensure LWCF funds are spent on critical conservation 
needs, fulfilling the purpose of the LWCF and the intent of the Great 
American Outdoors Act.

                LWCF-Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Land Acquisition 
                at $80 million. The BLM and its National Conservation 
                Lands provide some of our Nation's best recreation and 
                historic areas, from opening new recreational access to 
                sportsmen along with North Platte River SRMA in Wyoming 
                to protecting riverside lands of the Upper Snake/South 
                Fork ACEC SRMA in Idaho. We request $80 million to fund 
                BLM's land acquisition program and projects.

                LWCF-National Park Service (NPS) Federal Land 
                Acquisition at $115 million. Hosting more than 312 
                million visitors in 2022, the 424 National Park units 
                provide an economic boost to their local communities 
                and those employed directly and indirectly. Funding for 
                NPS LWCF will help protect key access points for 
                recreation, historic areas, trails and more. We 
                respectfully request $115 million to fund NPS's land 
                acquisition program and projects.

                LWCF-U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Land 
                Acquisition at $120 million. National Wildlife Refuges 
                (NWR) are our Nation's protectors of clean water, clean 
                air, abundant wildlife and world-class recreation. 
                Funding for FY2024 FWS LWCF will help protect critical 
                wildlife habitat, provide public access and recreation, 
                and improve water quality at Refuges, including 
                Maryland's Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and 
                Texas' Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge; as 
                well as preserving our Nation's working lands, such as 
                at Montana's Rocky Mountain Front Conservation Area. We 
                respectfully request $120 million to fund FWS's land 
                acquisition program and projects.

                LWCF-USDA Forest Service (FS) Land Acquisition at $134 
                million. FS LWCF funds help with forest management by 
                protecting key inholdings and reducing fire threats. 
                From Colorado's White River National Forest to 
                Minnesota's Superior National Forest-Boundary Water 
                Canoe Area Wilderness to the Appalachian Mountain's 
                White Mountain (NH/ME), George Washington-Jefferson 
                (VA), Cherokee (TN), Pisgah (NC), and Chattahoochee 
                (GA) National Forests, we are working with willing 
                landowners at priority project areas and respectfully 
                request $134 million to fund FS's land acquisition 
                program and projects.

                LWCF State Grant Programs: FWS-Cooperative Endangered 
                Species Fund, NPS- State Conservation Grants, and USFS-
                Forest Legacy: We encourage the subcommittee to fund:

  --FWS-Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund: $32 million 
    (for the LWCF-funded portion)

  --NPS-State Assistance Grants program: $270 million

  --USFS-Forest Legacy Program: $100 million

    DOI and USFS Conservation and Land Acquisition Programs: TCF 
encourages the Committee to fund:

  --FWS-North American Wetlands Conservation Fund at $50 million

  --FWS-State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program at $100 million. The 
        State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program is the only Federal 
        funding source available to States that leverages non-federal 
        funds to help protect critical habitat for over 12,000 species 
        in greatest conservation need identified in state wildlife 
        action plans. To build upon the State and Tribal Wildlife 
        Program, TCF urges Congress to enact the Recovering America's 
        Wildlife Act. This legislation aims to provide critical 
        resources to conduct proactive, non-regulatory fish and 
        wildlife conservation efforts nationwide.
  --FWS-Chesapeake Watershed Investments for Landscape Defense Program 
        at $15 million

  --NPS-Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Program at $3 million

  --USFS-Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program at $7 
        million

    Department of the Interior-Natural Resource Damage Assessment and 
Restoration Program at $10 million. The Restoration Program leads the 
National response for recovery of natural resources that have been 
injured or destroyed because of oil spills or releases of other 
hazardous substances. Recoveries from responsible parties can only be 
spent to implement restoration plans developed by the Trustee Council 
for each incident. These funds are one hundred percent private and 
represent the amount needed to restore environmental resources or 
compensate for lost public use since the damage in question. The FY2024 
funds would allow the Program to add carefully targeted staff allocated 
to Interior bureaus and offices through its Restoration Support Unit to 
accelerate restoration activities.

    Environmental Protection Agency Programs: TCF encourages the 
Committee to fund:

  --Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GRLI) at $425 million. TCF 
        urges funding of GLRI at $425 million. The Initiative provides 
        critical support for on-the-ground restoration programs and 
        projects targeted at the most significant environmental 
        problems in the Great Lakes ecosystem.

  --Chesapeake Bay Program at $91.5 million: TCF urges funding of the 
        Chesapeake Bay program at $91.5 million. This program brings 
        together a diverse partnership to support the Bay's 
        restoration.

    The Conservation Fund stands ready to work with you to secure full 
and consistent funding for the LWCF and the other critically important 
programs that help protect the environment, economies, forests, and 
community values across our Nation. Thank you for the opportunity to 
provide this testimony and your consideration of our request.

 Prepared Statement of the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement
    The Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement urges Congress to 
sufficiently fund the Operations & Maintenance budget of the National 
Wildlife Refuge System and address the staffing shortfall so it can 
continue to effectively fulfill its conservation mission, provide 
opportunities for wildlife dependent recreation, and connect 
communities to nature.
    Since 1995, the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement (CARE) 
has worked to showcase the value of the Refuge System and to secure a 
strong congressional commitment for conserving these special 
landscapes. All CARE members listed below have endorsed this testimony 
and our request to your subcommittee. We represent millions of users of 
the National Wildlife Refuge System-wildlife watchers, hunters, 
anglers, wildlife professionals and conservationists, and Friends 
members.

    The National Wildlife Refuge System is the world's largest network 
of lands and waters dedicated to wildlife conservation, and the only 
set of Federal lands in the Nation set aside for the management of 
America's native wildlife. Found in every U.S. state and four 
territories, national wildlife refuges conserve a diversity of 
America's environmentally sensitive and recreationally vital 
ecosystems, including wetlands, coasts, forests, prairie, tundra, 
deserts, and oceans, and provide Americans with an opportunity to 
encounter and engage with these areas.
    These lands and waters are important recreational and tourism 
destinations in communities across the United States, and offer a 
variety of recreational opportunities, including sustainable hunting 
and fishing, wildlife observation, photography, environmental 
education, and interpretation.
    However, without adequate funding, the ecological and recreational 
potential of the Refuge System cannot be fully realized. The 
President's $624.9 million request for Refuge Operations & Maintenance 
represents a needed increase over FY2023 funding levels and will help 
secure a strong future for the Refuge System, but more needs to be 
done.
    The $503 million appropriated to the Refuge System in FY 2010 
equates to $700 million in 2022 dollars. Current funding ($541 million) 
provides a mere .64 cents per acre for management. Since funding has 
not not kept pace with inflation, this has led to unsustainably low 
staffing levels, lost capacity, and a significant maintenance backlog.
                                staffing
    At its peak, staffing levels exceeded 3,240 employees across the 
Refuge System. Over 800 permanent refuge positions have been lost since 
FY 2011, an enormous 25% loss in capacity. Today, the Refuge System is 
staffed by approximately 2,400 permanent staff while the actual need is 
estimated to be 7,300. An additional $560 million would be needed to 
hire enough staff to reach full staffing capacity.
    Some refuges have seen staff reductions of 75% or more, requiring 
consolidation or reduction of visitor services, management and law 
enforcement. No refuges are fully staffed, and more than half of 
refuges have zero staff on site. Many refuges are closed to the public 
and are completely unmanaged.
    Rising fixed costs are also eating into increases in 
appropriations. It costs the refuge system an estimated $3 million for 
every one percent raise in payroll costs. System-wide, the modest 
funding increase provided in FY 2021 did not even cover the cost of the 
scheduled 1% Federal wage increase. Without base increases in the 
budget to cover these fixed costs, several much-needed positions are 
eliminated every year.
                                planning
    By law, the Refuge System must update their Comprehensive 
Conservation Planning (CCPs) every 15 years. Up-to-date management 
plans ensure that each wildlife refuge can be adaptable to present and 
upcoming needs, from a changing climate and extreme weather events like 
wildfires, to rising recreational visitors and commercial uses. 
However, due to a consistent lack of funding, over forty percent of 
CCPs have become out-of-date or were never finalized. Not only do some 
wildlife refuges not have the staff or capacity to carry out a new CCP 
process, but some simply do not have the resources to renew these 
important plans. With an increased planning budget, the Refuge System 
could modernize and update these important management plans that help 
them reach their conservation goals.
                            visitor services
    Despite staffing and planning shortages, the Refuge System has 
grown significantly since FY 2010, both in terms of acreage (14 new 
refuge units and millions of acres of marine national monuments) and 
services (the urban program has dramatically changed the way 
conservation is delivered to constituents, and visitor numbers have 
grown, to over 67 million visitors a year in FY 2022). These pressures 
are putting increased strain on the System that provides vital wildlife 
habitat and important services to hunters, anglers, birders, and other 
nature enthusiasts.
    CARE welcomes sustainable recreational use of national wildlife 
refuges. The ``Big 6'' uses of the Refuge System-hunting, fishing, 
wildlife watching, photography, environmental education, and 
interpretation-were enshrined into law in the 1997 National Wildlife 
Refuge System Improvement Act. As the Refuge System has opened 
additional acres for hunting and fishing, there is not an equivalent 
increase in funding to improve habitat, maintain necessary 
infrastructure like blinds, boat launches, piers, parking lots, and 
restrooms, or support popular hunting and fishing programs for youth 
and serve people with disabilities, veterans, seniors and others. 
Insufficient funding does not allow the Refuge System to retain and 
hire enough qualified biologists, visitor services staff, law 
enforcement, and the wage-grade staff to provide the services needed to 
properly maintain these places enjoyed by so many Americans.
                      impacts to fish and wildlife
    CARE's primary concern is what this means for wildlife populations. 
Shorebird populations have declined 40% over the last 40 years, the 
primary cause of which is human disturbances. There are numerous refuge 
units along the east coast, which should be a haven and resting spot 
for migratory birds. However, funding shortages have meant that there 
are few staff on the beaches to prevent and mitigate conflicts between 
people and wildlife.
    Significant progress has been made in the early detection and rapid 
response against newly introduced invasive species on refuge system 
lands thanks to the expansion of invasive species strike teams. Now up 
to 14 teams, this program prevents the spread of newly introduced 
invasive species on the refuge system and nearby public and private 
lands, protecting resources for adjoining communities. However, 
additional funding for access enhancements and infrastructure, such as 
watercraft cleaning stations, are needed to empower public adoption of 
invasive species prevention best practices. Funding for wildlife and 
habitat management activities is desperately needed to deal with longer 
term invasive species management challenges. Without funding to apply 
prevention measures, new threats will emerge and known invasive species 
such as phragmites, kudzu, quagga mussels, purple loosestrife, feral 
hogs, and invasive carps will continue their spread throughout the 
refuge system.
                          the need for action
    If funding for refuges remains stagnant for operations and 
maintenance activities, we anticipate further impacts both within and 
outside of refuge boundaries. These impacts could include closures of 
visitor centers, elimination of environmental education programs for 
schools, reduced habitat quality, diminished hunting and fishing 
opportunities, reduced invasive species management on refuge lands and 
nearby private lands, and reduced capacity for prescribed fire, which 
is an important tool to improve wildlife habitat and to reduce 
hazardous fuels.
    The common denominator to all these challenges is a lack of 
funding. Adequate staffing and funding are critical to the maintenance 
of healthy wildlife populations and access for recreational users to 
healthy ecosystems. Increasing funding for the System will empower and 
enable individual refuge units to deliver on-the-ground conservation 
that benefits not only wildlife and recreation, but also local 
communities across the Nation.
    On behalf of our more than 16 million members and supporters, CARE 
thanks the subcommittee for the opportunity to submit comments on the 
FY 2024 Senate Interior Appropriations bill. We are available to 
discuss our request with the committee at a time of their convenience.

     Prepared Statement of the Council of Infrastructure Financing 
                              Authorities
    The Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities (CIFA) 
represents the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds 
(SRFs), the Nation's premier programs for funding water infrastructure 
that protects public health and the environment. The SRFs provide 
subsidized, low-interest loans to repair, replace, rehabilitate and 
improve water, wastewater, recycled water and stormwater 
infrastructure.
         requests from the clean water and drinking water srfs

  --Fund the SRFs to the full authorizations--$3 billion each

  --Fund WIFIA for state financing authorities to the full 
        authorization--$5 million

  --Fund congressional earmarks without cutting funding to the SRFs

  --End duplicative mandates for additional subsidy

  --Eliminate state match for federally mandated additional subsidy in 
        the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)

  --Increase flexibility for generating state match

  --Increase flexibility for lead service lines and emerging 
        contaminants in the IIJA

                        why fully fund the srfs?
    CIFA urges Congress to fund the SRFs to their full authorizations 
in the law--$3 billion each.
    According to the results of the 7th Drinking Water Needs Survey, 
America needs to invest $625 billion over the next 20 years to provide 
safe drinking water to communities across the Nation, a 32% increase 
from previous assessment. While Congress reauthorized the SRFs at 
significantly higher levels in the IIJA, Congress has failed to fund 
the SRFs at new levels.
    Increasing Federal funding for the Clean Water and Drinking Water 
SRFs is a long-term, fiscally responsible approach to funding 
infrastructure that protects public health and the environment. As 
revolving loan programs, the SRFs provide a perpetual, renewable source 
of revenue for the never-ending, and always evolving, need for ongoing 
investment in water infrastructure. Every Federal dollar provided to 
the SRFs is loaned and repaid over and over again--funding projects 
that would never have been built if the SRFs were a traditional grant 
program. Federal funding provided in 2024 will pay for projects for 
future generations, forever.
    The SRFs efficiently and effectively deliver State and Federal 
funding to thousands of communities across the Nation. States, not 
Federal agencies, pick the projects based on State and local 
priorities. In 2021, the SRFs provided nearly $9.4 billion--including 
more than $6.4 billion in state funds--for 2,767 projects. That year, 
68% of SRF subsidized loans were directed to projects in small, rural 
and disadvantaged communities, many of which couldn't otherwise afford 
to pay for the infrastructure needed to meet stringent water quality 
standards.
    Subsidized loans provide significant savings to communities, which 
relieves pressure on utilities to raise rates on households. Compared 
to a municipal bond at the current rate of 3.65%, an SRF subsidized 
loan at 1% can save as much as 75% in interest payments over the life 
of the loan. With rising interest rates in the municipal bond market, 
savings from SRF subsidized loans will increase. Increased funding is 
also needed to help keep pace with historic inflation, which 
disproportionately impacts water infrastructure due to increased 
competition from other well-funded infrastructure sectors.
    While the IIJA provided significant supplemental appropriations to 
the SRFs, nearly half of funding in the IIJA--$20 billion--can only be 
used to replace lead service lines and address emerging contaminants; 
these funds can't be used to repair or replace a broken water main--
even one made of lead!
    Additionally, CIFA urges Congress to fully fund delegated water 
quality programs, including the Public Water System Supervision Grants 
and Water Pollution Control (Section 106) Grants. These programs play 
an integral role in the permitting of water infrastructure projects 
that protect water quality and public health. Without increased Federal 
funding, States may not have adequate resources to implement these 
delegated programs and process permit applications for drinking water 
and wastewater infrastructure projects, the number of which have 
increased due to supplemental appropriations in the IIJA.
   fund congressional projects without cutting srf funding for state 
                                projects
    CIFA urges Congress to fund congressional projects (earmarks) in 
addition to fully funding the SRFs for state projects. Over the last 2 
years, Congress used the SRF capitalization grant to pay for earmarks 
which has resulted in cuts to net Federal funding (SRFs + earmarks) for 
water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure in 36 States, Puerto 
Rico and Washington, D.C. State profiles on the impact of earmarks.
    As a result of these cuts, an estimated one-third of 
``supplemental'' funding for 2023 in the IIJA was needed to offset cuts 
in annual Federal funding. In addition to less funding for SRF state 
projects, using the capitalization grant to pay for congressional 
earmarks has a cascade of consequences:

  --Less funding for principal forgiveness and grants for small, rural 
        and disadvantaged communities.

  --Increased interest rates on SRF subsidized loans to secure a bond 
        for leveraged programs.

  --Cuts to State and local water quality programs and technical 
        assistance for small and disadvantaged communities.

  --A permanent reduction in funding for future water infrastructure 
        projects.

    If funding remains the same as 2022 or 2023 levels and all project 
requests from the U.S. House of Representatives are funded, funding for 
the Clean Water SRFs would be cut by more than 75% and the Drinking 
Water SRFs would receive zero funding.

     eliminate duplicative federal mandates for additional subsidy
    CIFA urges Congress to eliminate mandates for additional subsidy in 
the annual appropriations bill. Additional subsidy is the portion of an 
SRF subsidized loan that doesn't have to be repaid and comes in the 
form of principal forgiveness or a grant.
    Federal mandates for additional subsidy erode the fundamental 
nature of the SRF subsidized loan programs which were intended to 
create a permanent, protected, recurring source of funding to meet 
water infrastructure needs for future generations.
    In addition to the additional subsidy mandates in the IIJA, the 
2023 appropriations bill required the Clean Water SRFs to use 10% of 
annual Federal funding and the Drinking Water SRFs to use 14% of annual 
Federal funding for grants or principal forgiveness.

  --The IIJA mandates that 55% of total SRF appropriations in the law 
        be provided as grants or principal forgiveness.

  --The IIJA doubled the amount of annual Federal funding to the 
        Drinking Water SRF that must be provided as grants or principal 
        forgiveness, from 6% to 12%. SRFs may provide up to 35% of 
        annual Federal funding for additional subsidy.

  --The IIJA established a new mandate for additional subsidy for the 
        Clean Water SRF, requiring 10% of annual Federal funding be 
        provided as grants or principal forgiveness. Previously, Clean 
        Water SRFs had the flexibility to provide up to 30% of annual 
        Federal funding to communities that met affordability criteria 
        or implemented green projects.
eliminate state match for federally mandated additional subsidy in the 
                                  iija
    CIFA urges Congress to exclude federally mandated additional 
subsidy from state match requirements. Mandates for additional subsidy 
jeopardize the ability of SRFs to generate adequate revenue for state 
match and program administration and have the unintended consequence of 
increased costs for borrowers.
    States can only use interest payments, not loan repayments, as a 
way to generate state match. When mandates for additional subsidy 
reduce funding for subsidized loans, SRFs must increase interest rates 
on loans to generate enough revenue to meet its obligations.
               remove barriers for generating state match
    CIFA urges Congress to remove the prohibition on cross-
collateralization for bonds used for state match. Cross-
collateralization allows interest payments from both programs to secure 
a bond. Combining the assets of both programs can reduce interest rates 
on bonds, which is especially helpful for the Drinking Water SRFs that 
have fewer assets than the Clean Water SRFs. While Federal law allows 
cross-collateralization to leverage a program, Federal law doesn't 
extend the cost-saving benefits for the purposes of generating state 
match.
 increase flexibility for lead service lines and emerging contaminants 
                              in the iija
    CIFA urges Congress to increase flexibility for IIJA funding to 
replace lead pipes and remediate emerging contaminants with a focus on 
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). No permanent changes are 
needed, but providing more flexibility to these restricted funds will 
allow the SRFs to move Federal funding more quickly into communities to 
address these serious threats to public health.

    Drinking Water SRF Funding for Lead Service Line Replacement:

  --Maintain the current 49% mandate for additional subsidy but allow 
        SRFs to use up to 100% of Federal funding for grants or 
        principal forgiveness for any community. Additional flexibility 
        is needed to cover the cost of replacement of the private 
        portion of the lead service line without passing on the cost to 
        homeowners. In many communities, replacement projects are less 
        likely to move forward without additional financial assistance.

  --Provide SRFs with the flexibility to contract directly for lead 
        service line inventories. Additional flexibility is needed to 
        more efficiently procure services to conduct the inventories, 
        especially for small, rural and disadvantaged communities.

  --Allow communities to use lead funding to replace all lead pipes, 
        including lead water mains which are currently ineligible.

  --Allow funding to be used to replace indoor lead plumbing in limited 
        circumstances, such as water fountains and faucets, in public 
        buildings or buildings that serve vulnerable populations, such 
        as daycare centers, schools, nursing homes, libraries, and 
        courthouses.

    Clean Water SRF Funding for Remediation of Emerging Contaminants:

  --Allow communities to use funding for testing, monitoring and 
        watershed studies to find the existence and sources of emerging 
        contaminants. U.S. EPA currently prohibits the use of this 
        funding to find PFAS, which is ubiquitous.

  --Allow SRFs to use funding to contract directly for remediation 
        efforts. Additional flexibility will allow States to remove 
        known contaminants that are a threat to water quality on 
        property not owned by a water system.

  --Extend the deadline to apply for the capitalization grant by 1 year 
        to provide sufficient time for SRFs to build a pipeline of 
        high-quality projects for this funding.

              Prepared Statement of Defenders of Wildlife
    Mister Chairman, Ranking Member and Members of the subcommittee, 
thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony. I am Mary Beth 
Beetham, Director of Legislative Affairs at Defenders of Wildlife. 
Founded in 1947, Defenders has nearly 2.2 million members and 
supporters and is dedicated to the conservation of wild animals and 
plants in their natural communities.
    Biodiversity is in crisis on a global scale. Numerous scientific 
studies in the last several years have raised the alarm about this 
crisis. A landmark 2019 study \1\ compiled by hundreds of the world's 
leading scientists found that about one million species are facing 
extinction. In February 2023, a new study \2\ found that 40% of animals 
and 34% of plants in the United States are at risk of extinction, while 
41% of ecosystems are facing collapse. The health of wildlife and 
ecosystems is directly related to human health--healthy ecosystems 
support clean water, clean air, and pollination, on which we all 
depend. The 2023 World Economic Forum Global Risks report continues to 
find that biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse is seen as one of 
the fastest growing global risks over the next 10 years.\3\

    The biodiversity crisis cannot be addressed without funding--more 
than 1,900 scientists previously signed a letter \4\ published in the 
journal Science which asked Congress to fully fund conservation 
programs to protect biodiversity, including the Endangered Species Act 
(ESA). While we appreciate the modest increases provided in the final 
FY 2023 bill, years of severely inadequate funding and the scale of the 
catastrophe facing the planet's wildlife make them gravely 
insufficient. Significantly more funding is needed in every area.

funding.'' Science 365 (6459): 1256
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, Defenders is deeply disturbed that, although neither 
the House nor Senate FY 2023 bill included the sage-grouse rider, the 
omnibus yet again included this longstanding prohibition on protecting 
the sage-grouse under the ESA that has been in the bill since 2014. 
This rider, which undermines sound science and the ESA, must be removed 
from the FY 2024 bill once and for all. Any additional riders that 
undermine the ESA and protections for wildlife must also be rejected.
                       fish and wildlife service
    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is our Nation's premier 
wildlife conservation agency. To address the biodiversity crisis, the 
agency needs additional increases to support recovery of threatened and 
endangered species; protect migratory birds and fish, species of global 
conservation concern and other trust species; and prevent domestic and 
international wildlife crimes.
    Ecological Services--Defenders is part of a coalition of more than 
120 organizations requesting a significant infusion of funds into the 
Ecological Services program to begin to address the biodiversity 
crisis. We very much appreciate the $384.5 million in the president's 
request, but the need is far greater. Based on available data on the 
needs and costs for ESA implementation by FWS across its programs, as 
well as inflation adjustment, our recommendation is $723.7 million, or 
$455.2 million more than the FY 2023 level:

  --Listing: There are approximately 200 species on the FWS National 
        Listing Workplan for FY 2022-FY 2027 that must be reviewed for 
        protections under the ESA, with more species petitioned for 
        protection every year. For FWS to meet this obligation, a total 
        of $66.3 million is needed annually, an increase of $42.9 
        million.

  --Recovery: Of the more than 1600 listed U.S. species, more than 1200 
        have no recovery plans or have plans that are at least a decade 
        old and that may no longer contain current scientific 
        information, especially related to climate change. Hundreds of 
        listed species receive less than $1,000 per year for recovery 
        and many receive no FWS funding at all. Congress should provide 
        a minimum of $50,000 per year per species for recovery. For FWS 
        to meet its obligations under the recovery budget, a total of 
        at least $467.9 million is needed annually, an increase of 
        $353.7 million. We very much appreciate the continuation of 
        report language directing FWS to incorporate climate change 
        adaptation into recovery plans and recovery implementation 
        strategies. We urge ongoing oversight of this effort.

  --Planning and Consultation: FWS conducts ESA Section 7 consultations 
        on more than 10,000 Federal actions each year so that projects 
        can move forward while minimizing harm to listed species. The 
        agency also has significantly increased obligations under the 
        Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). To meet these 
        needs and to work with non-federal stakeholders to develop 
        Habitat Conservation Plans, $179.3 million is needed annually, 
        an increase of $58.5 million. We are grateful for the continued 
        support for the Integrated Planning and Consultation system and 
        for compliance monitoring and we urge continued oversight. In 
        addition, we strongly support the request in the president's 
        budget to expand authority beyond existing reimbursable and 
        Economy Act authorities to enable Federal agencies to transfer 
        funds provided under the IIJA to FWS and the National Marine 
        Fisheries Service to increase capacity for planning and 
        consultation.

  --Conservation and Restoration: At least $10.2 million per year is 
        needed for the Candidate Conservation element of Conservation 
        and Restoration to assist with early conservation action on the 
        current 23 candidate species.

  --Wolf Livestock Loss Demonstration Program: Defenders urges 
        continued funding at no less than $1 million for this program 
        that assists livestock owners co-existing with wolves.

    National Wildlife Refuge System Operations and Maintenance--A key 
component in addressing the biodiversity crisis in the U.S. is to 
refocus Federal land management on it. Our National Wildlife Refuge 
System is the largest network of public lands and waters in the Nation 
dedicated to wildlife conservation. Since 2010, the System has added 2 
million land acres, 14 national wildlife refuges, and nearly 600 
million acres of marine national monuments, has experienced a 34 
percent increase in visitation, and has worked to significantly expand 
its urban refuge program in historically excluded communities. Yet the 
System has lost 25 percent of its staff since 2010, and despite 
increases provided in the FY 2023 bill, its funding is far below the FY 
2010 inflation adjusted level of roughly $700 million. Defenders 
recommends $1.5 billion, an increase of $958 million, which is needed 
for the System to meet its mission.
    Partners for Fish and Wildlife--Defenders supports the $79.7 
million in the president's request, an increase of $19.5 million, to 
address a backlog of applications and fund practices that could restore 
tens of thousands of land acres and stream miles on private land. We 
urge inclusion of report language directing continued prioritization of 
projects that connect, enlarge, and buffer National Wildlife Refuges.
    Migratory Bird Management--In North America nearly 3 billion birds 
have disappeared since 1970 and the only groups to not suffer severe 
declines were waterbirds that have received substantial funding over 
the decades.\5\ The administration is currently working to develop 
regulations to govern incidental take under the Migratory Bird Treaty 
Act following the reversal of harmful Trump-era policies. We are 
extremely pleased with the $78.5 million in the request, an increase of 
$24.6 million, to support crucial survey and monitoring programs, to 
build resilience of bird species and their habitats, to help support 
development of proposed regulations under the MBTA, and to support 
Urban Treaties intended to create bird-safe environments in cities.

avifauna.'' Science 366 (6461): 120-124.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) and International Affairs (IA)--For 
OLE, we support the $104.4 million in the request, an increase of $12.3 
million, to help OLE continue to address the crisis in the illegal 
global wildlife trade and the threat of zoonotic disease. For IA, we 
support $31 million, an increase of $1.9 million, crucial in continuing 
to combat illegal wildlife trade and to build capacity in range 
countries.
    Science Applications--We support the request of $55.5 million, an 
increase of $20.1 million, to support partnerships and habitat 
strategies focused on biodiversity, adaptation, and resilience.
    Key grant programs--We support: $117.7 million for the Cooperative 
Endangered Species Fund, an increase of $60.3 million; $10 million for 
the Neotropical Migratory Bird Fund, an increase of $4.9 million; and 
$30 million for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, an 
increase of $9 million.
            u.s forest service and bureau of land management
    The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service 
(FS) manage close to 20 percent of the country's land base, providing 
habitat for hundreds of species listed under the ESA and thousands of 
sensitive species. These agencies have long been deprived of the 
funding they need to adequately conserve and recover imperiled species. 
We thank the subcommittee for increases provided in the FY 2023 bill. 
Proactive investments to recover at-risk species can prevent the need 
for listing under the ESA. Likewise, recovery actions help listed 
species reach the point where they can eventually be delisted. Given 
the enormity, urgency, and complexity of the extinction crisis and the 
importance of Federal public lands, continued increases are still 
needed for programs listed below to help prevent species' extinctions 
and restore resilient native ecosystems.
    FS Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive (TES) Species--Defenders 
recommends $23 million, an increase of $21 million, and reestablishing 
a specific line item for TES under Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat 
Management (WFHM). This amount should also be reflected in top-line 
increases for WFHM to ensure that increased capacity for TES does not 
detract from WFHM's other mission-critical functions. Based on cost 
estimates in ESA recovery plans, the FS would need to spend $43 million 
annually to start meeting its obligations to help recover the over 400 
listed species that occur on FS-administered lands. Recognizing the 
significant gap between current funding and projected need, Defenders 
recommends a 2-year ramp-up to reach this $43 million goal by the end 
of this Congress, starting with $23 million in FY 2024. Additionally, 
we request report language stipulating that these funds are intended 
for recovery programs and actions rather than consultations under ESA 
Section 7(a)(2), which should be funded by the benefitting programs. We 
also request report language directing the FS to provide an accounting 
of how funds are allocated to specific recovery programs and 
activities.
    FS Legacy Roads and Trails (LRT)--Defenders recommends $100 million 
for LRT, an increase of $94 million, including salaries and expenses to 
support the program. The increase would restore capacity and address 
the $4.4 billion backlog of projects that the FS has identified. LRT 
lacked specific funding between FY 2018 and FY 2021 when the line item 
was absorbed into the broader Capital Improvement and Maintenance 
budget, mostly halting projects and compounding the backlog. IIJA 
provided funding to partially address this funding gap, but annual 
appropriations remain essential. The enacted level of $6 million is a 
fraction of the $40 million that LRT received prior to budget 
modernization. Contracts and materials account for a much higher 
proportion of LRT's costs than other programs and must be accounted for 
in a significantly higher line item.
    BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration--Defenders supports $34.7 
million, an increase of $14.1 million, for BLM, in coordination with 
other agencies, to operationalize recent National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS) recommendations \6\ for providing a reliable supply of native 
seeds necessary for ecological restoration and climate resilience. NAS 
warned that insufficient supplies of native seeds and plant materials 
are a major barrier to ecological restoration and revegetation and that 
``substantial inter-institutional commitment...at a much more intensive 
and expansive level than is currently underway'' is needed. We also 
urge establishment of the program as its own activity with requisite 
FTEs and report language directing the Departments of the Interior and 
Agriculture to brief the Committee on implementation of the NAS report.

    BLM Threatened and Endangered (T&E) Species--Defenders recommends 
$38.5 million, an increase of $4.5 million, and elevation of the 
program to its own subactivity to meet its obligations to help recover 
the over 300 listed species that occur on public lands and promote 
conservation of over 2,400 additional at-risk (unlisted) species. This 
increase should be reflected in top-line increases for Wildlife Habitat 
Management (WHM) to ensure that increased capacity for T&E does not 
detract from WHM's other mission-critical functions.
    BLM Wildlife Habitat Management (WHM)--Defenders supports $176.7 
million, an increase of $27.7 million and $14.7 above the president's 
budget. The increase addresses the recent deficit of $6.3 million that 
resulted from recent increases in the T&E and Plant Conservation and 
Restoration programs without fully commensurate increases in WHM. It 
also accounts for recommended FY 2024 increases for the nested programs 
as well as inflation.

increase of $87.8 million to support development of crucial scientific 
information for sound management of our Nation's biological resources. 
This includes a total of $87.3 million, an increase of $24.2 million 
for the National and Regional Climate Adaptation Centers.

    Prepared Statement of the Department for Professional Employees
    On behalf of the Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO 
(DPE), I write in support of funding the National Endowment for the 
Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) at no 
less than $211 million each in fiscal year (FY) 2024.
    Many members of DPE's affiliate unions in the arts, entertainment, 
and media industries earn their living working on NEA and NEH-supported 
productions, programs, and performances. Still, more union creative 
professionals who work now in the commercial parts of these industries 
benefited from the nonprofit arts and media sector's role as a proving 
ground for establishing their lifelong careers.
    Funding the NEA and NEH at no less than $211 million each will 
ensure that the agencies can continue to support good-paying, family-
supporting jobs for creative professionals in every State and 
congressional district, including the members of DPE's unions. Through 
grants, seed money, and technical support, the two agencies help put 
these people to work on artistic and educational content that is 
available to Americans of all means, geographies, and abilities. NEA 
and NEH-funded programs help veterans heal from the invisible scars of 
war, inspire the next generation of creators and innovators, and 
deliver content that unites people across small towns and big cities. 
Increasing the NEA and NEH annual funding level to no less than $211 
million each in FY 2024 is also an important step toward a full funding 
level of $1 per capita.
    Additional NEA and NEH funding will help ensure that creative 
professionals can continue to work safely and sustain their recovery 
from the COVID-19 pandemic's economic devastation. Creative 
professionals were among the first to lose their jobs at the pandemic's 
outset, and they have been among the last to return to their jobs.
    Increased funding for the NEA and NEH is also good for local 
communities and the small businesses that rely on the customer traffic 
that gets generated when people attend a nearby production or 
performance. Pre-pandemic research shows that audiences spend an 
estimated $31.47 per person, per event, beyond the cost of admission, 
on lodging, restaurants, clothing, transportation, and other goods and 
services.
    In addition, DPE believes the NEA and NEH are instrumental to 
creating diverse talent pipelines and developing a well-trained, 
representative workforce for a sector that generates more than four 
percent of the United States' GDP and produces a positive trade 
balance.
    Put simply, the NEA and NEH are critical agencies for working 
people and local economies. Their work delivers a high return on 
investment and cannot be replaced by the private sector. I urge the 
subcommittee to fund the NEA and NEH at no less than $211 million each.
    If you have any questions, please contact me or DPE Assistant to 
the President/Legislative Director, Michael Wasser, at

                                   Sincerely,

    Prepared Statement of the Dine Bi Olta School Board Association
    The Navajo Nation established the Dine Bi Olta School Board 
Association (DBOSBA) to represent the locally-elected school boards 
within the Navajo Nation. With its representation of school boards from 
the 66 Bureau of Indian Education-funded (BIE) schools located on the 
Navajo Nation in Arizona and in New Mexico, DBOSBA's membership 
constitutes more than one-third of the 183 BIE-funded schools 
nationwide. Of those 66 BIE-funded schools, 32 are operated by the BIE 
and 34 are tribally-operated (33 pursuant to grants under the Tribally 
Controlled Schools Act, Public Law 100-297 (TCSA) and one pursuant to a 
contract under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act, Public Law 93-638 (ISDEAA)). DBOSBA unites school boards to 
advocate for educational programs and services that help ensure each 
Navajo student graduates with the preparation necessary to lead a 
productive and fulfilling life, with knowledge and understanding of 
Navajo language and culture.
    DBOSBA appreciates the key increases the subcommittees provided FY 
2023. DBOSBA respectfully asks that Congress continue to build upon 
these achievements. Our priorities for the FY 2024 Indian Affairs 
budget are:

  --50% increase for ISEP Formula Funds (BIE);

  --Ensure full funding for Teacher Pay Parity (BIE);

  --Ensure that the employees of all BIE-funded schools are eligible to 
        participate in the Federal Employee Retirement System (BIE);

  --Forward and full funding for Facilities Operations and Facilities 
        Maintenance (BIE);

  --Increases for Student Transportation (BIE) and Road Maintenance for 
        School Bus Routes (BIA);

  --Increases for Early Childhood and Family Development and Special 
        Education (BIE);

  --Increases for Education IT (BIE);

  --Continued full funding for Tribal Grant Support Costs (BIE);

  --Mandatory funding for Tribal 105(l) (``full service'') leases 
        (BIA);

  --Increases for Education Construction (BIE);

  --Accountability for how the percentage of COVID relief funds set-
        aside for the BIE was allocated and distributed (BIE);

  --Rescission of Secretarial Order 3334 Reorganizing the BIE; and

  --End unlawful reporting requirements imposed on schools (BIE).

    ISEP Formula Funds are the core account for BIE-operated and 
tribally controlled schools (also known as ``grant schools''). This 
account funds everything from classroom instruction materials and 
teacher salaries to gifted and talented programs, summer programs, and 
food services. Increases in ISEP Formula Funds directly benefit 
students and help attract and retain the quality teachers vital to our 
students' academic success. BIE-funded schools across the Nation are 
facing a significant teacher shortage, but that shortage is 
particularly acute here on the Navajo Nation, where many schools 
operate in remote locations and because the surrounding public schools 
in New Mexico and Arizona have responded to the teacher shortage by 
substantially increasing teacher pay. Having the resources to attract 
and retain quality teachers is one of our biggest challenges and 
substantial increases are needed.
    Full Funding for Teacher and Counselor Pay Parity is a critical 
tool for attracting and retaining quality teachers. Federal law 
requires the BIE provide funding so that teachers and counselors in the 
BIE-funded school system may be paid equivalent salaries to their 
counterparts in the Department of Defense Education Activity. Federal 
law also provides that, at the discretion of the local school board, a 
BIE-operated school may pay salaries consistent with those paid by 
public schools in the state where the BIE school is located.
    DBOSBA would like to thank the subcommittees for the ongoing 
references to the FY 2021 House Report 116-448 and the Joint 
Explanatory Statement accompanying the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations 
Act which direct the BIE to ``clearly display funding amounts required 
to comply with Defense Department-equivalent pay rates as part of 
future budget justifications and to include sufficient funding in its 
budget request to fully fund these requirements.'' We ask the 
subcommittees to continue to hold the BIE accountable for quantifying 
and requesting the correct amount for pay parity and ensuring that the 
amounts provided are sufficient to match the increases provided by the 
Defense Department schools or are consistent with the rate of pay of 
public schools in the States where our BIE-operated and tribally 
controlled schools are located, whichever of these rates is higher. 
Given the acute teacher shortages, this parity is essential to our 
schools' ability to recruit and retain qualified teachers.
    Ensuring that employees of all BIE-funded schools are eligible to 
participate in the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) would 
significantly bolster the ability of grant schools in the BIE school 
system to attract and retain quality teachers. Congress recently 
extended grant schools the opportunity to offer their employees 
insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and 
Federal Employee Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) programs. Also, in House 
Report 117-400 accompanying the FY2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
Congress directed Indian Affairs to ``study the systems, processes, and 
authorizations necessary to extend FERS benefits to police officers 
employed under a Public Law 93-638 contract or compact.'' DBOSBA is 
seeking similar language for teachers and staff employed by Bureau of 
Indian Education-funded, Tribally Controlled Schools operated under 
Public Law 100-297 grants or Public Law 93-638 contracts.
    Forward and full funding for Facilities Operations and Facilities 
Maintenance. These two accounts play a pivotal role in the health and 
safety of our students and staff. These two accounts are also severely 
underfunded and two of the remaining core school operations accounts 
not forward funded. This means that when there are government shut 
downs or continuing resolutions, some schools do not receive these 
critical funds until the end of the school year! Further, significantly 
more funding is needed to address the BIE system-wide maintenance 
backlog (of more than $725 million as of 2019) and to ensure schools 
have enough funding to adequately heat and cool buildings. DBOSBA 
encourages Congress to both fully fund and to shift these two accounts 
to the forward funded portion of the BIE's budget to further insulate 
schools from the uncertainties of continuing resolutions and government 
shutdowns.
    Student Transportation (BIE) and Road Maintenance for School Bus 
Routes (BIA) are of particular importance to schools located on the 
Navajo Nation. Our students travel some of the longest distances to 
their schools on some of the worst roads in the Nation. Outdated buses 
improperly equipped to handle the many unpaved and unimproved roads put 
our students' safety at risk or can mean that our students miss 
critical instruction days and fall behind their peers in other 
jurisdictions. DBOSBA also cautions that the proposed conversion to 
electric buses could actually present new problems given the extensive 
distances of remote bus routes on the Navajo Nation and the limited 
electric system capacity of many of our communities. Without further 
increases for Student Transportation and Road Maintenance, and the 
alignment of new technologies to our circumstances, this precarious 
situation will continue.
    Early Childhood and Family Development funding plays a critical 
role in preparing children for school and supporting and empowering 
their parents. Substantial program increases are needed each year to 
expand these opportunities to more BIE-system schools. Of the 183 
schools in the BIE school system, the Administration's FY 2023 budget 
justification reports that just 51 receive Early Childhood and Family 
Development funds. The National Education Association finds that 
children in early childhood education programs are: less likely to 
repeat a grade; less likely to be identified as having special needs; 
more prepared academically for later grades; more likely to graduate 
from high school; and more likely to become higher earners in the 
workforce. DBOSBA asks the subcommittees to increase funds for this 
critical line item.
    Special Education requires greater investment and improved 
congressional oversight of the BIE. American Indian children are more 
likely to require special education services than any other group in 
the United States (18% of students, according to the National Center 
for Education Statistics in 2020, but our experience indicates an even 
higher rate for students at Navajo Nation schools). Yet, our schools do 
not have the resources to recruit qualified and culturally 
knowledgeable special education teachers. In addition to funding, 
greater accountability of the BIE is needed to ensure that the 
resources made available to the BIE serve to enhance special education 
programming and services for the students who need them.
    Education IT, specifically, funding to increase connectivity for 
schools and students is critical: our schools' connectivity needs 
persist even after the worst of the pandemic recedes.
    School Facilities Improvement & Repair and School Replacement 
Construction in the BIE's Education Construction budget also 
significantly impact the health and safety of our students and staff. 
This funding not only helps keep our students and staff safe, it also 
helps prolong the useful life of our school buildings. Unfortunately, 
many schools throughout the BIE system are far beyond the end of their 
safe and useful life and must be replaced. Many of these schools in 
poor or dangerous condition are located on the Navajo Nation. The BIE's 
FY 2023 budget justification reports that only two of the 10 schools on 
the 2016 School Replacement List are complete. It is critical for 
Congress to continue to provide robust levels of funding for School 
Replacement Construction so the remaining schools on the list can be 
completed expeditiously and progress can be made on the list of schools 
identified through the now yearly Site Assessment Capital Investment 
(SA-CI) program.
    Continued Full Funding for Tribal Grant Support Costs means that 
tribally controlled schools can focus ISEP funds where it counts: 
supporting students, improving classroom instruction, and attracting 
and retaining quality teachers. DBOSBA thanks Congress for providing 
full funding for Tribal Grant Support Costs since FY 2016.
    Shifting 105(l) Tribal Leases to Mandatory Funding would make the 
discretionary budget process more predictable and would free up 
additional funding for Indian programs within the topline allocation 
for the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies appropriations bill. 
In FY 2024, the Administration is requesting that this account be 
classified as mandatory spending. DBOSBA strongly supports the 
Administration's request.
    Accountability for how the percentage of COVID relief funds set-
aside for the BIE was allocated and distributed (BIE). DBOSBA is 
particularly concerned by the BIE's failure provide regular updates on 
its COVID-19 pandemic relief funds. The BIE withheld 10% of pandemic 
relief funding-or $124,939,000-for BIE-system schools without providing 
meaningful updates on how the funds have been allocated and 
distributed. The agency previously communicated that it would dedicate 
a portion of its overall pandemic relief monies to carry out much 
needed upgrades to information technology and ventilation systems, but 
the BIE has not been transparent about its progress in implementing 
these upgrades or how it will use or distribute the remaining balance 
of the amounts withheld from the allocation of pandemic response funds. 
Many students and schools in the Navajo Nation continue to face 
significant technological limitations, which includes limited or no 
access to reliable internet connectivity. Further, many of our schools 
operate in buildings with substandard heating, ventilation and cooling 
systems. As schools in the Navajo Nation continue to adapt to changes 
in Federal guidance and the threats posed by new COVID-19 variants, it 
is critical that the BIE regularly consult with schools as to pandemic-
recovery priorities and that BIE expeditiously utilize its pandemic 
relief funding to implement the targeted upgrades it promised.
    Rescission of Secretarial Order 3334 Reorganizing the BIE. DBOSBA 
asks that the subcommittees urge the Department of Interior to rescind 
Secretarial Order No. 3334 (``Order'') which directed the 
reorganization of the BIE, and to instead implement programs and 
changes consistent with the Order's overarching purpose, and reaffirm 
Interior's commitment to ``facilitate Indian control of Indian affairs 
in all matters relating to education,'' and, more broadly, to support 
Tribal sovereignty and self-determination in the education of Native 
children.
    End unlawful reporting requirements imposed on schools. DBOSBA asks 
that the subcommittees urge the BIE to immediately halt the imposition 
of burdensome reporting requirements that are not permitted by statute, 
have not been agreed to by the schools, and that operate to perpetuate 
the Federal bureaucratic domination of Indian education programs.
    DBOSBA thanks the subcommittees for the opportunity to provide this 
testimony.

       Prepared Statement of the Entomological Society of America
    The Entomological Society of America (ESA) respectfully submits 
this statement for the official record in support of funding for 
entomology-related activities at the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, 
and the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI). For fiscal year (FY) 2024, 
ESA recommends $967.8 million for the EPA Science and Technology (S&T) 
account, with $40 million towards the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) 
Program, as well as strong support for programs across the agency that 
advance the safe application of pesticides. ESA also strongly supports 
EPA's commitment to work with other Federal agencies to monitor and 
improve pollinator health. In addition, ESA requests the Forest Service 
be funded at no less than $9.7 billion in discretionary funds. Within 
the Forest Service, ESA requests the Forest and Rangeland Research 
budget be supported with at least $349 million to preserve valuable 
invasive species research and development. The Society also supports 
continued investment in Forest Health Management programs across the 
Forest Service at no less than the FY 2020 request level of $100 
million. ESA also recommends that DOI continue to support the important 
work of the National Invasive Species Council (NISC), at a level no 
less than $2 million for its critical coordination of efforts across 
agencies to respond to the threats posed by invasive species.
    Advances in forestry and environmental sciences, including the 
field of entomology, protect our ecosystems and communities from 
threats to our Nation's economy, public health, and agricultural 
productivity and safety. Through improved understanding of invasive 
insect pests and the development of biological approaches to pest 
management, entomology plays a critical role in reducing and preventing 
the spread of infestation and diseases harmful to national forests and 
grasslands. The study of entomology also contributes to the development 
of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, which use science-
based, environmentally conscious, comprehensive methods to take 
effective management action against pests, often resulting in lower 
costs through a more judicious use of pesticides. Entomology also 
improves our knowledge of pollinators and factors affecting pollinator 
health and populations, helping to ensure safe, reliable crop 
production that meets the needs of a growing world population.
    EPA carries out its mission to protect human health and the 
environment by developing and enforcing regulations, awarding grants 
for research and other projects, conducting studies on environmental 
issues, facilitating partnerships, and providing information through 
public outreach. Through these efforts, EPA strives to supply the 
Nation with clean water, clean air, a safe food supply, and communities 
free from pollution and harmful chemical exposures. EPA's Pesticides 
Licensing Program Area, supported by EPA's Science & Technology and 
Environmental Program & Management budgets, evaluates, and regulates 
new pesticides to ensure safe and proper usage by consumers. Through 
the mandate of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA), EPA uses scientific expertise and data, including knowledge 
gained from entomological sciences, to set maximum tolerated residue 
levels and to register pesticide products as effective and safe. By 
controlling insects that carry diseases of humans and domesticated 
animals, consume agricultural and horticultural products, and become 
established as invasive species that endanger our environment, 
pesticides registered by EPA help protect public health and the 
Nation's food supply.
    Although pesticide registrations and regulations are within EPA's 
purview, the agency has not been a major sponsor of entomology 
research. However, EPA has provided support to projects that promote 
IPM adoption and the safe application of pesticides while also 
promoting pollinator protection. For example, the EPA has supported the 
Pesticide Educational Resources Collaborative (PERC), a cooperative 
agreement between the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs and University 
of California Davis Extension, in collaboration with Oregon State 
University, which empowers farmworkers and other pesticide handlers to 
employ better and safer practices in pesticide use. Since 2016, PERC 
has developed and implemented over 40 multilingual pesticide-related 
training programs, manuals, videos, and guides which are widely relied 
upon by the community.\1\ The program has been so successful that it 
was renewed in 2021 for a second cycle, along with a similar program, 
PERC-Med focused on education and awareness raising of the safe 
application of pesticides among health professionals. In addition, the 
EPA's Pesticide Environmental Stewardship Program (PESP) grants enable 
grantees to ``implement sustainable pest management practices that 
reduce unnecessary risks from pests and pesticides.\2\ While IPM is a 
long-standing paradigm for mitigating pests, relatively few focused 
funding sources are available to support entomologists conducting 
research or participating in community outreach on this subject. ESA 
encourages the committee to encourage EPA to expand its investment in 
IPM and other innovative programs to promote the safe use of pesticides 
through increased funding for such activities across the agency's 
research and regulatory portfolios. ESA also requests $967.8 million 
for EPA S&T account including $40 million for the EPA's Science to 
Achieve Results (STAR) Program.

    ESA is also supportive of increased funding for scientific studies 
and other efforts to protect pollinator populations and health. 
Pollinators play a vital role in our Nation's agriculture industry. 
Honeybees alone pollinate more than 100 crops in the U.S. and are 
essential to produce an estimated one-third of all the food we eat or 
export, contributing over $24 billion in annual crop and seed 
production in the U.S. alone, with even greater contributions when 
accounting for ecosystems services. To ensure a healthy bee population, 
more research is needed to fully understand the diverse factors that 
endanger bee health. Pesticides represent just one potential risk to 
bees, but both the risks and benefits must be balanced, and they will 
vary between different crops and different crop-producing regions of 
the U.S. EPA is well-positioned to identify methods for protecting bee 
health. The agency has awarded agricultural grants to three 
universities to aid in the development of IPM practices that lower 
pesticide risks to bees while protecting valuable crops from pests. ESA 
supports EPA's continued participation in multi-agency efforts to 
investigate pollinator health and implement plans to prevent pollinator 
population decline -including the new vulnerable Species Pilot Project.
    The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) sustains the health, diversity, and 
productivity of 193 million acres of public lands in national forests 
and grasslands across 44 States and territories. Serving as the largest 
supporter of forestry research in the world, the agency employs 
approximately 30,000 scientists, administrators, and land managers. In 
addition to activities at the Federal level, the Forest Service 
provides technical expertise and financial assistance to state and 
private forestry agency partners.
    The USFS Forest and Rangeland Research budget supports the 
development and delivery of scientific data and innovative 
technological tools to improve the health, use, and management of the 
Nation's forests and rangelands. Programs within Forest and Rangeland 
Research provide science-based approaches to reduce and prevent the 
spread of destructive insects, plants, and diseases that can have 
serious economic and environmental consequences for our Nation. For 
example, USFS scientists are working to understand the impact of the 
mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) on U.S. forests. 
Since 2000, outbreaks of MPB have affected more than 10 million 
hectares of lodgepole pine forests, compromising long-term forest 
health while creating the potential for more dangerous wildfires, loss 
of wildlife habitat, poorer water quality, and soil erosion.\3\ Such 
outbreaks are predicted to continue in the face of increased 
temperatures and drought associated with climate change. Funding for 
such studies will enable land managers to better predict and respond to 
ecosystem changes that occur following such outbreaks. ESA requests 
that Forest and Rangeland Research be funded with at least $349 million 
for FY 2024.

    The Forest Health Management program, also implemented by the USFS, 
conducts mapping and surveys on public and private lands to monitor and 
assess risks from potentially harmful insects, diseases, and invasive 
plants. The program also aids State and local partners to prevent and 
control outbreaks that threaten forest health. Invasive forest insects 
cost local governments alone an average of over $2 billion per year; 
direct costs to homeowners from property loss, tree removal, and 
treatment averages $1.5 billion per year.\4\ Initiatives within the 
Forest Health Management program help control these costly pests. The 
program's ``Slow the Spread'' activities have led to a 60 percent 
reduction in the rate of the spread of the spongy moth (Lymantria 
dispar dispar), another invasive species, resulting in a consistent 
estimated benefit-to-cost ratio of 3:1 since the program started in 
2000. Additionally, the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) 
is the most destructive pest of pine trees from New Jersey to Florida 
and west to Texas. This beetle caused an estimated $1 billion in damage 
during an outbreak across the southern U.S., and it has since rapidly 
moved further northward. The new northeast range of the southern pine 
beetle includes threatened and rare pine ecosystems, such as the Pine 
Barrens of New Jersey\5\. Funding for the Forest Health Management 
Program supports detection, monitoring, prevention, and management of 
this pest to slow its spread and limit its damage as it affects more 
and more of our country's forests. To support these important 
functions, ESA requests that the subcommittee provide no less than $100 
million for Forest Health Management.

    The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) plays a critical role 
in coordinating policy, communication, and technology application to 
address invasive species detection and response across 16 Federal 
agencies. NISC serves a vital function since the impacts of invasive 
species are felt across a variety of sectors (agriculture, 
environmental protection, public health). According to the NISC, 
invasive species impose substantial costs on society, leading to an 
estimated $120 billion in environmental damages and losses annually in 
the United States. Invasive insects have directly impacted native 
insect populations and entire ecosystems through predation, plant 
consumption, and disease transmission. For example, emerald ash borer 
(EAB, Agrilus planipennis) is an exotic beetle that was discovered in 
Michigan in 2002. Since its discovery, EAB has been detected in 36 
States, Washington, D.C. and five Canadian provinces. It has killed 
hundreds of millions of ash trees in North America and cost cities, 
property owners, Major League Baseball, tree nurseries, and forest 
products industries hundreds of millions of dollars.\6\ Preventing 
establishment of invasive species like EAB depends on early detection 
and rapid response. Improving these efforts requires not only relying 
on standard means of inspection and tracking but taking advantage of 
new technologies as well. To respond to such threats, NISC helped 
coordinate the development of guidelines for use by decision makers 
that improve access to and analysis of invasive species information\7\. 
Such methods can enable more effective communication and aid in early 
detection of invasive species and rapid response, potentially saving 
billions of dollars' worth of crops, safeguarding native ecosystems, 
and preventing the destruction of private property. ESA requests that 
the Committee provide the DOI funds to support NISC at no less than $2 
million in FY 2024.

     Prepared Statement of the Environmental Council of the States
    The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS)--the national 
nonprofit, nonpartisan association of State and territorial 
environmental agency leaders--appreciates the opportunity to submit 
written testimony on the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) President's budget 
request for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ECOS 
requests $692.3M for four specific Categorical Grant programs and 
support for addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 
other EPA programs.
      states lead in implementing the nation's environmental laws
    Congress has established in the Nation's three key environmental 
statutes--the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Clean Air Act (CAA), and the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C--its intent 
for States to have primary responsibility and rights to prevent, 
reduce, eliminate, and control water, air, and hazardous waste 
pollution through the management of permit and enforcement programs. 
EPA notes in its March 2022 FY2022-2026 Strategic Plan that ``States 
and local governments serve as primary implementers of many of the 
Nation's environmental laws.'' As an example, of the 51,927 facilities 
permitted for air emissions in 2022, States were the permitting agency 
for more than 47,300 facilities--that is 91%--with just under 4,000 
facilities permitted by local governments and 663 by EPA.\1\ Through 
permitting, state environmental agencies protect human health and the 
environment while also supporting economic development. States conduct 
public meetings to promote understanding and help communities and 
regulated entities, including small businesses, navigate the sometimes-
complex permitting process through technical assistance. States also 
conduct most inspections and enforcement activities nationwide through 
Federal delegation to ensure compliance, a level playing field, and 
protect communities. Sufficient funding is critical to maintaining the 
core ability of state staff to issue and renew permits, gather data for 
determinations regarding the health of local and regional air and water 
resources, and meet inspection and enforcement priorities for existing 
and new obligations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The scope and breadth of state environmental agency activities is 
ever expanding. With respect to PFAS, ECOS has requested that EPA 
urgently provide States funding and flexibility to address PFAS.\2\ 
Many States report spending significant resources taking samples, 
gathering data, conducting testing, and investigating and responding to 
complaints and concerns related to drinking water, air quality, 
wastewater discharges, contaminated properties and the management of 
waste. While States, Federal agencies, industry, and others have worked 
together on PFAS through the Interstate Regulatory and Technology 
Council (ITRC) and ECOS has published a PFAS and biosolids report and a 
paper on setting state PFAS standards, States will need more funding to 
build capacity and infrastructure to implement and enforce PFAS-related 
regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ ECOS Resolution 21-1: Advancing Collaboration and Coordination 
on Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl Substances
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to the challenges posed by emerging contaminants, there 
are new Federal expectations regarding the implementation of delegated 
programs, such as stepped-up community engagement including increased 
translation service expenses, support for public involvement, 
cybersecurity protection, and other activities that require expanded 
state activities to support permit issuance and other delegated 
activities. For example, EPA has asked States to analyze disparate 
impacts in the issuance of some permits.
    Categorical Grant funding to States is the most significant Federal 
support for core day-to-day delegated program activity and state staff 
capacity. In FY2002, State & Tribal Categorical Grants received $1.1B. 
Two decades later, funding is $1.16B. At the same time, inflationary 
pressures \3\ make it hard for States to keep up with recruitment and 
retention of key staff given the rising cost of living. There is also 
an increasing need for investment in modern infrastructure like 
electronic permitting and air monitoring networks and a corresponding 
need for analysis of growing environmental monitoring data. In sum, 
Federal support to States has eroded.

    Through an ECOS resolution, States urge the U.S. Congress and EPA 
to financially support state implementation efforts commensurate with 
the complexity and breadth of Federal requirements so we may fulfill 
our obligations to our communities. Please consider the following:
   i. increase state and tribal assistance (stag) categorical grants
    ECOS has looked closely at three critical Categorical Grant 
programs: State and Local Air Quality Management (CAA Sec. Sec. 103, 
105, and 106); Pollution Control (CWA Sec. 106); and Resource Recovery 
and Hazardous Waste (formerly Hazardous Waste Financial Assistance) 
(RCRA Sec. 3011) and determined that a course correction is necessary 
to address persistent erosion in Federal support. ECOS finds that a 
modest 1% compounding annual escalation is the minimum ongoing Federal 
funding trajectory needed. Going back to FY10 and course correcting 
based on a 1% compounding increase would amount to a $51.7M funding 
increase in FY24. Accordingly, for FY24, ECOS requests that Congress 
enact a combined $642.3M for these three programs as shown in the table 
below--$260.4M for air; $263.5M for water, and $118.8M for hazardous 
waste.

**Source: FY23 Joint Explanatory Statement

    In FY23, Congress provided small increases over FY22 levels to all 
Categorical Grant programs. However, some increases funded new work 
rather than existing core work. As an example, the increase of $2.5M 
for the Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste Categorical Grant 
includes $4M for development and implementation of state coal 
combustion residuals (CCR) programs, effectively a cut to State 
hazardous waste programs. True increases for hazardous waste program 
work, independent of CCR program work, are needed.
    Changes in Federal law have resulted in a steady decrease in the 
volume of hazardous waste being regulated in many States impacting 
program funding. While there has been a drop in revenues from decreased 
hazardous waste volume, the number of entities requiring permits and 
inspections has increased, particularly small quantity generators. The 
Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials 
state survey from 2019 indicated the total cost of operating the RCRA 
program nationwide was $168.8M. States were required to provide a 25% 
match, and with congressionally enacted funding, States provided 
another $37M beyond the required match, a rate that is not sustainable. 
In 2018, EPA's OIG noted, ``Most States are authorized to implement the 
majority of new required hazardous waste rules promulgated by the EPA. 
However, States and the EPA have taken many years to authorize rules-
from less than 1 year to more than 31 years. No state has been 
authorized by the EPA for all required rules. For the 173 required 
rules, the number not authorized ranges from six to 98 per State; eight 
States have not been authorized for more than 50 rules.'' Further, 
``For Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) rules, EPA 
regions can administer the requirements if a State has not received 
authorization. However, for non-HSWA rules, the EPA cannot administer a 
rule when a State has not yet been authorized for the rule, which 
creates regulatory gaps. Unauthorized non-HSWA rules create risks to 
human health and the environment.'' \4\ A second OIG report in 2022 
noted that not all treatment, storage, or disposal facilities are being 
inspected at the frequency mandated by RCRA.\5\ Underfunding may lead 
to program challenges and delays.

    Given constraints on the use of major source air permit fees under 
the CAA and Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 70, many other 
critical--and federally required--activities are under-funded, 
including updating State Implementation Plans, support for small 
business programs and emission reductions from smaller sources, support 
for enhanced community air monitoring, and the development of 
inventories and rules. Congress has mandated that the U.S. Forest 
Service conduct prescribed fires yet has not provided a companion 
declaration for EPA to respond to increased prescribed fires and their 
potential impact on State and local air quality attainment. EPA is now 
considering lowering fine particulate matter levels under the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which would likely result in 
many areas nationally falling out of compliance with those lower NAAQS. 
This may also create further tension with wildfire risk mitigation 
strategies with prescribed burns that may be limited by air quality 
standards. The majority of the State and Local Air Quality Management 
Categorical Grant is provided as CAA Sec. 105 air grants that require a 
40% match or maintenance of effort, whichever is higher. States 
continue to seek an increase in funding and for this to be provided as 
CAA Sec. 103 awards to avoid a match requirement and allow agencies 
that do not have suficient matching funds to still obtain grants.
    CWA Sec. 106 grants support work with 900,000 National Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulated facilities with 
increasing complex challenges to reduce nutrients in surface waters, 
meet electronic reporting requirements, address PFAS and other 
contaminants, and more.\6\ State water programs also need funding to 
close the monitoring gap for state water quality impairments and 
improvements including the use and tracking of nature-based solutions. 
These and other such activities are needed to develop water quality 
standards and total maximum daily load listings, improve surface water 
quality, restore impaired waterbodies, increase water reuse activities 
to respond to climate change, address backlogged NPDES general permits, 
and conduct other core water pollution control activities.

ii. ``off the top'' cuts erode clean water state revolving fund (cwsrf) 
        and drinking water state revolving fund (dwsrf) programs
    In the FY23 enacted budget, Congress stipulated $863M of CWSRF and 
$609M of DWSRF funds go to Community Project Funding/Congressionally 
Directed Spending (CPF/CDS). EPA has taken $1.472B for 715 CPF/CDS 
projects ``off the top'' of the state capitalization grants, 53% of the 
annual SRF funding provided, prior to state capitalization awards being 
made and importantly, before state ``set-asides'' are taken. The state 
set-asides are used to supplement public water system supervision 
program funding, to protect source water, to address failing septic 
systems, to provide stormwater control measures, to take cybersecurity 
measures, to provide technical assistance, and more--up to 6% for CWSRF 
and up to 31% for DWSRF. These across-the-board cuts create challenges 
and uncertainty for States with year-to-year staff planning, with 
budgeting for non-infrastructure support activities, and with long-term 
viability of SRFs, as funds will not ``revolve'' in future years as the 
CPF/CDS funds are not repaid. CPF/CDS projects are also managed outside 
existing State programs, creating a parallel bureaucracy. States ask 
that CPF/CDS not be taken from SRFs and ask that Congress maintain and 
increase SRF funding levels for state-run programs in FY24 and beyond.
                     iii. additional considerations
    These issues also remain important to state environmental agencies:

1. Fund Multipurpose Categorical Grants. States seek $50M for these 
    flexible funds, which can be applied broadly to state identified 
    priorities, do not require a match, and expand state implementation 
    capacity of Federal environmental programs.

2. Continue to invest in data modernization for drinking water, clean 
    water, and clean air. Through E-Enterprise for the Environment, 
    States, Tribes, and EPA are working jointly to modernize the 
    complex reporting processes for sharing Safe Drinking Water Act and 
    Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act state enforcement information, a 
    critical collaboration to develop effective multi-directional data 
    flows that are not duplicative, burdensome, and expensive and focus 
    on efficient data exchange solutions and on providing more accurate 
    information to the public.

3. State Research Needs. ECOS affiliate the Environmental Research 
    Institute of the States published its 2022 biannual survey of state 
    environmental agency research needs. ECOS urges Congress to provide 
    funding to EPA to help States meet these needs.

    On behalf of ECOS, I thank the subcommittee for considering the 
views of state environmental agencies as you prepare EPA's FY24 budget. 
Please don't hesitate to reach out to me or ECOS Executive Director Ben 
Grumbles at bgrumbles@ecos.org or (202) 266-4929.

   Prepared Statement of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony for the 
record in support of programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction 
that support climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) is a non-profit 
organization founded in 1984 on a bipartisan basis by members of 
Congress to help educate and inform policymakers, their staff, 
stakeholders, and the American public about the benefits of a low-
emissions economy that prioritizes energy efficiency, renewable energy, 
and new clean energy technologies. In 1988, EESI declared that 
addressing climate change is a moral imperative, and that has since 
guided our work.
    Climate adaptation and resilience work should complement and, when 
possible, contribute to a decarbonized, clean energy economy. From 
droughts to wildfires and hurricanes to extreme heat, different 
regions, States, and communities will experience different climate 
change-related threats. Communities need locally tailored, accessible, 
actionable, and coordinated data to make informed decisions to reduce 
their climate risks and safeguard the ecosystems on which they depend.
    Effectively synchronizing landscape conservation and climate 
adaptation efforts across Federal agencies and with non-federal 
partners will require investing in a new durable, comprehensive, and 
inclusive structure and approach to landscape conservation. EESI's 
Congressional briefing, Building a Durable National Framework for Large 
Landscape Conservation,\1\ provides more information on the 
intersection of collaborative, landscape-scale conservation and climate 
adaptation efforts.

    To advance this work, we support the following funding requests in 
the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request:
                     u.s. fish and wildlife service
  --$55.5 million for the Science Applications Program. This program 
        effectively coordinates large landscape conservation, climate 
        resilience, and habitat connectivity efforts across the Federal 
        Government and with state, Tribal, and nongovernmental partners 
        nationwide. More specifically, this funding would support 
        collaborative partnerships in areas ranging from the 
        Appalachian Mountains to the Pacific Northwest. It would also 
        support landscape conservation designs, which are developed 
        with communities to spatially identify the most strategic 
        conservation and restoration priorities in areas such as the 
        Southeast and the sagebrush sea.

  --$79.7 million for the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program under 
        the Habitat Conservation activity. In particular, we urge you 
        to fund the $3M requested within this program to specifically 
        to expand successful work with private landowners and other 
        partners to conserve wildlife migration corridors, improve 
        landscape connectivity, and restore fish passage. This funding 
        enables implementation Secretarial Order 3362, Improving 
        Habitat Quality in Western Big Game Winter Range and Migration 
        Corridors, which has transcended Republican and Democratic 
        administrations. Securing dedicated funding for this work is 
        essential, as continuing to compete for and cobble together the 
        funding necessary for this program is neither a strategic nor a 
        sustainable funding strategy.

  --$20.4 million for the Coastal Program under the Habitat 
        Conservation Activity. This program enhances the resilience of 
        coastal communities while enhancing coastal habitat 
        connectivity. Additionally, if funded at the requested level, 
        this program could remove dozens of fish passage barriers.

  --$624.9 million for the National Wildlife Refuge System. This 
        funding would enable the agency to take a large landscape 
        conservation approach to planning, conservation, and 
        restoration of the habitat they manage, which is especially 
        important for migratory species.

  --$18.5 million for the Migratory Bird Joint Ventures Program under 
        the Migratory Bird Management activity. This funding would 
        enable continued collaboration with diverse stakeholders to 
        conserve and restore habitat within critical flyways across the 
        country.
                       bureau of land management
  --$162 million for the Wildlife Habitat Management activity. This 
        funding would allow the bureau to conserve seasonal habitats 
        and migration corridors, as well as support Tribal co-
        stewardship efforts, including habitat connectivity 
        initiatives. More specifically, it would enable the bureau to 
        implement a landscape-scale approach to conserving and 
        restoring the threatened sagebrush ecosystem, which provides 
        essential habitat for migratory birds, pollinators, and big 
        game.
                         u.s. geological survey
  --$13 million for the Species Management Research subactivity under 
        the Ecosystems Activity. This funding would support important 
        conservation science, including producing maps of desert 
        tortoise connectivity to guide responsible solar energy 
        development decisions.

  --$79.6 million for the Land Management Research subactivity under 
        the Ecosystems Activity. In particular, we urge you to fund the 
        $2.4 million requested within this program for the agency to 
        expand its work with States and Tribes to map big game 
        migration corridors in the western U.S. The additional $2 
        million of funding for this work would also allow the agency to 
        support partners to incorporate the data into conservation, 
        restoration, and transportation planning to enhance habitat 
        connectivity and reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.
                         national park service
  --$509.6 million for the Resource Stewardship subactivity of the Park 
        Management activity. This funding would support conservation of 
        our natural and cultural heritage, including support for 
        collaborative landscape conservation science and projects.
                       u.s. bureau of reclamation
  --$2.3 million for the Cooperative Watershed Management Program 
        within the WaterSMART Program. This program provides crucial 
        financial assistance for collaborative groups to coordinate, 
        plan, and implement strategic watershed management projects.

    Overall, these programs provide critical support for landscape 
conservation and connectivity-a practice that conserves biodiversity, 
supports regional economies, and enhances the resilience of communities 
and nature in an era of rapid change.
    Thank you for your consideration.

   Prepared Statement of the Federation of State Humanities Councils
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, my name is Phoebe Stein and I am the President of the 
Federation of State Humanities Councils (Federation), the membership 
organization of the 56 state and jurisdictional humanities councils. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony.
    The state and jurisdictional humanities councils were authorized in 
the founding legislation for the National Foundation for the Arts and 
Humanities and are funded, in part, through the Federal/State 
Partnership (F/SP) line in the National Endowment for the Humanities 
(NEH) budget. The councils are 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, with 
voluntary boards and they leverage their NEH funding to raise millions 
of dollars to invest in local projects and grassroots organizations. 
While councils' funding comes from a variety of sources, NEH support is 
critical, especially for on-going operations.
    The Federal/State Partnership (F/SP) funding, currently (FY 2023) 
at $65 million, goes directly to the state councils by formula. To 
ensure that every council receives approximately $100,000 in additional 
funding in a year, an additional appropriation in excess of $6 million 
is needed in the F/SP; for a $50,000 increase for each council, an 
additional $3+ million is needed.
    Councils operate in nearly all Congressional districts. Each year, 
councils make thousands of grants to local cultural organizations--
schools, libraries, museums, historical societies, preservation groups, 
and other non-profit organizations--to develop and/or present programs, 
exhibits, lectures, and discussions free to their communities. Many 
councils conceive, create, and deliver their own programs. In 2022, 
councils made more than 3,700 grants to local entities, partnered with 
more than 5,000 local organizations and reached more than 71 million of 
your constituents.
    In response to COVID, councils served as the grant-making agency 
for both CARES and ARP funding. Councils oversaw the award of more than 
7,000 grants under the two programs. But, those funds were obligated 
quickly; and the ARP process identified more than $40 million in 
proposals unmet for lack of resources; furthermore new community needs 
and interests continue to arise. Thus, we are back to the 
appropriations level that supports approximately 3,700 grants, a 
reminder of the needs that exist not only in COVID's aftermath (such as 
teacher institutes and re-learning in the K-12 system) but also in new 
and expanding areas (history, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration 
of Independence, health and well-being, inclusion and belonging, 
environmental humanities, and the multitude of other issues where the 
humanities help define us and our communities).
    Furthermore, numerous studies have indicated that thriving, 
innovative communities require a combination of factors. Economic 
strength and opportunities depend not only upon jobs, housing, a 
trained workforce, access to healthcare, and transportation, but also, 
importantly, local cultural and recreational activities as well. 
Placemaking is a significant part of economic development.
    Councils seek to meet the needs of a multitude of interests and 
constituencies in the States, but, there are common threads. In 2022, 
over 85% of councils provided cultural resources to rural residents; 
55% of councils provided programs for veterans, active military, and 
families; and 43% of councils provided programs focused on health and 
well-being outcomes.
       strengthening rural connections and cultural opportunities
    Ninety-seven percent of the American landscape is rural and rural 
areas play a role in many aspects of our lives: food supply, water and 
other natural resources, forest products, recreational activities, and 
are home to millions of Americans. As previously noted, 85% of councils 
bring excitement and vitality to rural areas of their States and 
promote discussion of challenges facing these locations.
    For more than 25 years, councils have partnered with the 
Smithsonian's Museum on Main Street (MoMS), a series of traveling 
exhibitions that facilitate local discussions, understanding, and 
connections. Last year alone, councils supported MoMS programming in 76 
communities across 21 States. The current exhibit ``Crossroads'' 
focuses on the changing rural landscape, with other exhibits relating 
to such topics as food, work, water, local stories, innovation, and 
culture. In 2023-24, the Alabama Humanities Alliance will enhance the 
exhibits with local discussions of how small places in the state are 
being transformed by economic pressures, the pandemic and population 
changes.
    In addition, many councils offer programs for their States and 
communities. In Montana, for example, the council developed ``Hometown 
Humanities'' which works with individual communities to build capacity 
and make long-term investments to strengthen cultural infrastructure. 
Humanities North Dakota's Public University Program provides quality 
lifelong learning opportunities to residents of rural communities 
through a wide range of courses from literature and history to 
economics and social science.
                 understanding and sharing our history
    Historical and cultural events, local, State, national, and 
international, have been a mainstay of councils over the past half-
century. A review of any council website will illustrate the breadth 
and scope of programming on historical topics. The West Virginia 
Humanities Council maintains eWV, a comprehensive collection of 
articles on West Virginia's people and places, history, arts, science 
and culture. The council also partners with public radio to provide 
podcasts on historical events. eWV also includes under its eWV 
Classroom section a selection of lesson plans designed by West Virginia 
teachers. Humanities Washington supported a program, ``A Matter of 
Loyalty: Poetry, Stories, and Images,'' in honor of Day of Remembrance 
of Japanese-American Incarceration and several other programs honoring 
Japanese culture.
    Most councils participate in the annual National History Day 
Program which reaches far beyond a ``day.'' The effort involves more 
than half a million students in grades 6-12 and tens of thousands of 
teachers annually in the student history contest which culminates in a 
week-long session for 3,000 winners. Students produce papers, exhibits, 
performances, documentaries, and websites as part of their research and 
communications work. The Alabama Humanities Alliance has initiated a 
vigorous outreach throughout the state to teachers, parents and 
students to broaden and diversify participation in the program. And, 
councils are involved in plans for the Semiquincentennial in 2026 when 
our Nation will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of 
Independence. Nevada Humanities, for instance, has held many events 
through A More Perfect Union to deepen appreciation of humanities' 
connection to untold stories in Nevada communities and promote 
understanding the founding of the Nation in all its complexities.
                            civic education
    For decades, the State and jurisdictional humanities councils have 
actively conducted or supported nonpartisan programs, resources, and 
events providing civic education in support of our democracy. Recently, 
the humanities councils offered programs in 43 States and territories 
as part of the ``Why It Matters: Civic and Electoral Participation'' 
initiative. These events provided free humanities programming to engage 
the public in collaborative, accessible, and thought-provoking 
dialogues on the importance of electoral and civic participation. Since 
2018, nearly all councils have conducted or supported programs as part 
of the Federation's Mellon-funded ``Democracy and the Informed 
Citizen'' national initiative, which focuses on the role of journalism 
and the humanities in a democratic society as well as on the ways 
citizens gather, assess, and share information to make decisions about 
the futures of their communities and nation. Rhode Island Humanities, 
with its partners, has produced a Civic Health Index that examines five 
areas: community well-being, social connection, public participation, 
collective understanding and engagement with government.
                     serving teachers and students
    Support for our Nation's educators and students has never been more 
important. Kentucky Humanities, continues to support educators, 
students, and families with nationally-recognized literacy programs, 
such as ``PRIME TIME, Inc.''. Humanities Nebraska holds Capitol Forum 
Day to enable high school students from across the State to discuss 
important global issues and interact with the Governor and Members of 
Congress.
    Councils are also seeing the need for additional teacher and 
student support in the aftermath of COVID and the expansion of pre-
school programs. Many schools continue to confront problems associated 
with learning and academic loss and recovery, staff shortages, 
absenteeism, and mental and emotional issues. Creation of resource 
materials, teacher institutes, and support for summer, after school, 
and other literacy interventions alleviate academic gaps and improve 
pre-school preparation for developing reading skills.
                   inclusion, respect, and belonging
    Helping to bridge the divides in our communities remains of 
paramount importance. Programs such as Oregon's onstage conversation 
with author and journalist Monica Guzman examined creating connections 
across political divides and depolarizing our Nation. California 
Humanities has featured programs on Black Mariners, looking at maritime 
practices of commercial mariners, whalers, fishers, explorers, and 
sailors from the 16th to the 20th century.
          collaborating with native and indigenous populations
    Councils have regularly partnered with Indigenous communities over 
the years. For example, the New Mexico Humanities Council has supported 
Native American storyteller Esther Martinez and her work to preserve 
the Pueblo history and culture, as well as the Tewa language. Michigan 
Humanities in their Great Michigan Read program has featured the debut 
novel Fire Keeper's Daughter, by Angeline Boulley, an enrolled member 
of the Sault Ste.Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. Boulley writes about 
her Ojibwa community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
                        environmental humanities
    Environmental humanities programs use literature and history to 
make sense of the changing environmental concerns facing Americans. 
Humanities Nebraska conducted a session, Weathering Nebraska, that 
explored the interrelationships of water, climate, health, agriculture, 
and local impact. Humanities Washington worked with a small community 
to present the lecture ``After the Blast: Mt. St. Helen's 40 Years 
Later.''
                     healthcare and the humanities
    Councils have a long history of collaborating with the medical 
community and play a prominent role in enhancing the lives and work of 
healthcare providers. Council work also helps individuals and their 
families manage the many aspects of their illnesses. Since 1997, when 
Maine Humanities Council created and piloted ``Literature & Medicine: 
Humanities at the Heart of Healthcare,'' the reading and discussion 
program for healthcare workers has been a hallmark effort for many 
councils. Councils have also targeted specific medical challenges, such 
as opioid addiction, with their programming.
                                veterans
    Councils support veterans and their families in many ways, 
including the collection of oral histories, the sharing of experiences, 
the examination of service as seen through literature, writing 
workshops that encourage the expression of and reflection on aspects of 
war and its aftermath, dealing with injuries and medical conditions, 
support for VA medical staff, and helping communities to understand 
their challenges. Literature & Medicine, mentioned above, has been 
offered in various veterans' hospitals and medical facilities.
    Since 2015 Maryland Humanities has worked with veterans and 
community partners to plan and facilitate small group reading and 
discussion programs for veterans in five counties. This program 
supports current and former service members by offering an opportunity 
to give voice to their experiences. Families and friends have 
benefitted from a deepened understanding of the history, experience, 
and meaning of war.
                                 youth
    Youth programs have been integral to council activities for 
decades. For example, Alaska's ``Ilakucaraq Project,'' conducted in 
collaboration with the Alaska Native American Education Program, 
empowers youth to identify their heritage as a source of strength 
through personal reflections, positive self- and cultural- identity 
formation, cross-cultural experiences, peer-to-peer learning, elder and 
culture-bearer teachings, and art. National History Day is designed for 
6-12 graders. Other programs impact youth, such as sessions at book 
festivals, participation in literacy programs, and increasing 
collaborations with community colleges. Humanities North Dakota's We 
The People: The Citizen and the Constitution program for high school 
students focuses on the Constitution and its relevance to the lives of 
young people today.
                         community connections
    In August the Alaska Humanities Forum will offer training sessions 
for discussion facilitators to lead conversations about vital issues 
and ideas across differences, beliefs and backgrounds. These 
discussions will help build strong relationships within organizations 
and among communities. As previously mentioned the Rhode Island council 
has developed a civic health index to examine engagement across 
communities.
    In this space, I described only a very few of the activities 
underway in communities across the Nation. Councils are proud of their 
work and their contributions. But we are far from meeting the needs and 
interests of the States and localities. We need additional resources 
and we ask this subcommittee's support for directing those additional 
resources to cities, towns, and rural areas throughout the Nation. With 
additional funding, we can easily move forward with doubling the 3,700 
grants currently awarded annually.
    We can reach beyond the 71 million currently served. Councils are 
on-the-ground, grassroots organizations with broad and deep connections 
to other local organizations. Investments in the Federal/State 
Partnership are a direct investment in communities. In a complex, fast-
paced and rapidly-changing nation, much work remains to be done.

        Prepared Statement of the Geological Society of America
                                summary
    The Geological Society of America (GSA) recommends that Congress 
provide $1.85 billion in annual appropriations for the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS) in Fiscal Year 2024. As one of our Nation's key science 
agencies, the USGS plays a vital role in locating, characterizing and 
documenting mineral and energy resources that underpin economic 
security and growth; researching and monitoring potential natural 
hazards that threaten lives and property; keeping communities informed 
about the impacts of a changing climate; and determining and assessing 
water quality and availability. Approximately two thirds of the USGS 
budget is allocated for research and development. In addition to 
supporting the science activities and decisions of the Department of 
the Interior, USGS research, data, and products are used by communities 
across the Nation to make informed decisions in land-use planning, 
emergency response, natural resource management, engineering, and 
education. To fully implement the agency's mission and fulfill the USGS 
21st-Century Science Strategy will require $1.85 billion in annual 
appropriations.

    The Geological Society of America (GSA) is a scientific society 
with 19,000 members from academia, government, and industry. Through 
its meetings, publications, and programs, GSA enhances the professional 
growth of its members and promotes the geosciences in the service of 
humankind. GSA encourages cooperative research among earth, life, 
planetary, and social scientists, fosters public dialogue on geoscience 
issues, and supports all levels of earth science education.

    The Geological Society of America (GSA) thanks the Committee for 
recognizing the importance of the work of the U.S. Geological Survey 
(USGS) to protect lives, property, and national security, and to 
stimulate economic growth. GSA urges Congress to provide USGS $1.85 
billion in Fiscal Year 2024. This increase will allow the USGS to 
implement new initiatives, maintain the base funding for critical 
research and monitoring, fill vacant positions, and address deferred 
maintenance on existing facilities.
u.s. geological survey contributions to national security, health, and 
                                welfare
    The USGS is one of the Nation's premier science agencies, with the 
unique capacity to engage interdisciplinary teams of experts to gather 
data, conduct research, and develop integrated decision-support tools. 
USGS research is used by communities across the Nation to make informed 
decisions regarding land-use planning, emergency response, natural 
resource management, engineering, and education. USGS provides 
practical, pragmatic science that informs many of society's greatest 
challenges related to national security, economic competitiveness, 
health, and welfare. Several are highlighted below.
                          energy and minerals
    As articulated in the Energy Policy Act of 2020, there is a vital 
need to understand the global and domestic abundance and distribution 
of critical mineral resources, as well as the geologic processes that 
form them. Achieving this goal will require continually expanding 
collection and analysis of geological, geochemical, and geophysical 
data. Specifically, GSA supports completing the new Energy and Minerals 
Research Facility on the Colorado School of Mines campus, a USGS 
facility that will be critical to establishing the workforce needed to 
secure our energy future by expanding STEM talent, and increasing 
diversity through student engagement and university partnerships.
    GSA supports energy and minerals science, research, data collection 
and analysis that will allow for more economic and environmental 
management and utilization. GSA appreciates congressional support for 
the EarthMRI program, which will both provide new resources and 
leverage current data to accelerate geological and geophysical mapping, 
identify critical mineral sites for further scientific study to aid 
defense, security, and economic uses. The mapping has a central focus 
on minerals still in the ground and minerals that may be reprocessed 
from legacy mine waste, and will also provide important data for 
abandoned mine remediation and for understanding other natural 
resources.
                            natural hazards
    Natural hazards are a major cause of fatalities and economic 
losses. In 2022 alone, NOAA found that the U.S. disaster costs exceeded 
$165 billion. An improved scientific understanding of geologic and 
atmospheric hazards will reduce future losses by informing effective 
planning, mitigation, and resilience. USGS's products are innovative, 
reliable, timely, and actionable, providing critical information on 
potential and developing hazards like floods, droughts, earthquakes, 
volcanos, landslides, and space weather events. GSA urges Congress to 
continue supporting efforts for USGS to both maintain its fundamental 
research capabilities, and modernize and upgrade its natural hazards 
monitoring and warning systems, such as the ShakeAlert Earthquake Early 
Warning System which, even while still under development, produced 
several successful earthquake alerts in California this past year.
    Decision makers in many sectors rely upon USGS data to respond to 
natural hazards. For example, USGS volcano monitoring provides data to 
enable decisions to ensure aviation safety. Similarly, the USGS plays a 
key role in the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program by tracking 
tsunami sources using seismic data, and USGS research on storm surge is 
used by the National Hurricane Center.
    USGS is a key partner in obtaining data necessary to predict severe 
space weather events, which affect the electric power grid, satellite 
communications, and navigation systems. The Promoting Research and 
Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow 
Act (PROSWIFT Act) provides a path forward for USGS research to 
understand and mitigate space weather risks. In addition, the new Space 
Weather Advisory Group established by the PROSWIFT Act will conduct a 
comprehensive survey to identify the research, observations, 
forecasting, and modeling advances required to improve response to 
space weather products.
    GSA recommends adequate funding to implement recently-enacted 
hazards-related legislation. For example, the National Landslide 
Preparedness Act expanded the USGS Landslide Hazards Program, and 
authorized the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) which leverages partnerships 
with the private sector, State and local governments, and other 
agencies to update and coordinate the collection of high-resolution 
elevation data across the country. Directives to USGS include 
identifying, mapping, and understanding landslide hazards, responding 
to landslide events, and developing landslide guidelines for 
geoscientists, emergency management personnel, and land-use decision-
makers in order to reduce landslide losses and protect communities at 
risk.
                            water resources
    Improved understanding of the quantity, quality, distribution, and 
use of water resources through monitoring, assessment, research, and 
delivery of actionable information by the USGS and associated partners 
is necessary to ensure adequate and safe water resources for the health 
and welfare of society. For example, the USGS national network of 
stream gages provides key data for the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor Maps 
and classifications, but its funding has been flatlined for many years. 
A reinvestment in this program will allow the Survey to maintain 
significant long-term data collection necessary for assessing impacts 
to water resources brought on by stressors such as climate change.
                             climate change
    USGS research on climate impacts is used by local policymakers and 
resource managers to make sound decisions based on the best possible 
science. In addition to fundamental, long-term climate change research, 
the USGS provides scientific information necessary to anticipate, 
monitor, and adapt to the effects of climate change at regional and 
local levels, allowing communities to make smart, cost-effective 
decisions. Much of this work operates through the network of nine 
regional Climate Adaptation Centers (CASC). For example, the Alaska 
CASC has assessed future landslide risks along road corridors in Denali 
and other Alaska parks, which will assist planning for new and existing 
infrastructure to endure under a changing climate. In addition, the 
Southeast CASC is using artificial intelligence to predict flood damage 
changes in response to rising sea levels, and Northwest CASC 
researchers studied the impacts of wildfire severity and climate change 
on tree species that rely on fire to release their seeds. Additionally, 
the Federal Climate Data Portal will provide actionable climate tools 
and products that will help public and private decision-makers address 
climate risks.
         core science systems, facilities, and science support
    Activities from hazard monitoring to mineral forecasts are 
supported by Core Science Systems, Facilities, and Science Support. 
These programs and services, such as geologic mapping, data 
preservation, and satellite observation, provide critical information, 
data, and infrastructure that underpin the research of the USGS. 
Investment in advanced scientific computing will allow the agency 
cutting-edge analytics and models needed to study wildfires and 
droughts. Stagnant funding has created backlogs in the hiring of new 
scientists; the agency has fewer employees than in FY1995. Increased 
investment is needed to fill these critical roles and allow for the 
recruitment and training of a strong and diverse STEM workforce 
pipeline, paving the way for increased diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and accessibility within the field of Earth sciences.
    GSA appreciates the committee's recent investments in USGS 
facilities, including the creation of the Energy and Mineral Research 
Facility, and encourages continued investment to address deferred 
maintenance issues. GSA also recommends long-term funding and support 
for the USGS library, which is used by both Federal scientists and 
external researchers. The Library houses more than 1.5 million volumes 
and more than three million maps, photographs and field records, with 
much of the information unique to the USGS.
    The Landsat satellites have amassed the largest archive of remotely 
sensed land data in the world, a tremendously important resource for 
land use planning, and for assessment of water, energy, mineral and 
other natural resources, the impacts of natural disasters, and global 
agriculture production. GSA encourages continued support for existing 
programs, as well as interagency efforts for LandsatNext with improved 
spatial resolution and the ability to provide updated imagery with 
greater frequency.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony about the U.S. 
Geological Survey. For additional information or to learn more about

climate change, water resources, mineral and energy resources, natural 
hazards, and public investment in Earth science research--please visit

        Prepared Statement of Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
    I am Howard Learner, the Executive Director of the Environmental 
Law & Policy Center (ELPC), which is the Midwest's leading 
environmental legal advocacy and sustainability innovation 
organization. ELPC's staff works throughout the Great Lakes States, in 
Washington D.C. and with Canada to protect the Great Lakes. Since 2008, 
we have participated with policymakers and colleagues to build, 
effectively implement, and expand the successful Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative (GLRI).
    Thank you, Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and all members 
of the subcommittee for the opportunity to submit testimony in support 
of full funding of $425 million in FY 2024 for the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative as provided in the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative Act of 2019 (signed into law on January 5, 2021). GLRI funds 
have been effectively deployed to protect safe clean drinking water 
supplies, clean up toxic sites, protect wetlands and shorelines, hold 
off invasive species from entering the Great Lakes, and safeguard 
aquatic resources. Restoring the Great Lakes creates substantial 
environmental, public health, and recreational benefits, as well as 
fostering economic growth. GLRI is a program that has worked very well 
and has demonstrated success consistently.
    The Great Lakes are a global gem. They contain 21% of the planet's 
fresh water supply, and 42 million people rely on the Great Lakes for 
safe drinking water. They provide a rich aquatic habitat for many 
species. They support a $7 billion annual fishing industry, and Great 
Lakes recreation draws millions of tourists who boost the economies of 
shoreline communities. In short, the Great Lakes are where many 
millions of people live, work and play.
    ELPC strongly supported reauthorization of the GLRI and the ramp up 
of funding to $475 million in 2026, matching the funding the program 
received in its initial year. We request that the Committee fully fund 
the GLRI program with at least the authorized $425 million for FY 2024 
and, hopefully, consider a higher amount.

    I'll make two points in support of fully funding the GLRI:

    First, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is vitally important, 
and it is successful. This is a model Federal program providing 
significant environmental and economic benefits, and it is working 
well.
    Second, the challenges to the Great Lakes from increases in harmful 
algal blooms and climate change merit full funding of at least the 
authorized $425 million for FY 2024, and the program could benefit from 
a higher funding amount in FY 2024.

1. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is vitally important and 
        successful. This is a model Federal program providing important 
        benefits, and it is working well with strong bipartisan 
        federal, State and local support.

    The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a breakthrough 
program injecting critical funding and structure that had been missing 
in order to restore the Lakes. Over the past 14 years, the GLRI has 
achieved strong results with sustained funding. As the third GLRI 
Action Plan States: ``the GLRI has been a catalyst for unprecedented 
Federal agency coordination, which has, in turn, produced unprecedented 
results.'' The program supports shoreline and wetlands protection 
projects, keeping out invasive species, and reducing harmful algal 
blooms. Congress' recognition of the effectiveness of the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative is reflected in the strong bipartisan support 
for fully funding this program with increasing funding.
    The GLRI funds and supports thousands of projects across the Great 
Lakes States to:

  --Improve water quality for safe drinking water supplies, fisheries 
        and aquatic habitats.

  --Protect shorelines and restore wetlands.

  --Protect and restore native habitats and species.

  --Help prevent and control invasive species.

  --Clean up toxic sediments on lake bottoms.

  --Reduce agricultural and other nutrient runoff that causes harmful 
        algal blooms.

    The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative creates an effective system 
of coordination among Federal agencies, State entities and local 
partners to achieve important outcomes to make a meaningful difference 
for the Great Lakes. Since its inception, the program has achieved 
strong results with sustained funding.
    There are countless examples of GLRI projects that deliver multiple 
benefits to the Great Lakes: from watershed and natural area 
restoration projects, to addressing and ultimately delisting Areas of 
Concern. The Healing Our Waters Coalition provides examples of projects 
across the region. Projects include:

  --Rouge River Area of Concern (MI): This heavily populated and 
        industrialized area in southeast Michigan includes highly 
        degraded natural habitat and high levels of contamination. 
        Multiple GLRI-funded projects are addressing nine habitat areas 
        including the Venoy Dorsey Park habitat project to restore 
        wetlands and stabilize streambanks.

  --Wequoick Creek Restoration (WI): This project in Lake Michigan's 
        watershed is restoring Midwestern oak savanna/wet meadow and 
        riparian forest adjacent to the Point au Sable Nature Reserve 
        in lower Green Bay, Wisconsin. This project will control 
        invasive species and restore a native riparian corridor.

  --Grand Marais (MN): This project will update stormwater management 
        for the City of Grand Marais with wetlands, trees and riparian 
        habitat to store and filter stormwater to reduce flooding. This 
        project will address increasing storm intensity and add native 
        plants to the areas to better protect Lake Superior.

    GLRI projects bring together a broad array of partners to achieve 
the program's goals and create jobs. The GLRI Action Plan III details 
work to address Areas of Concern, including those that are now 
delisted: Ashtabula River in Ohio, Lower Menominee River in Wisconsin, 
Presque Isle Bay in Pennsylvania, and Deer Lake and White Lake in 
Michigan. Significant work remains to be done, however, to fully 
address the 25 Areas of Concern across the Great Lakes basin. We 
greatly appreciate that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
added $1 billion for the GLRI to accelerate clean up and restoration of 
these toxic Areas of Concern.
    GLRI has broad regional economic benefits. A University of Michigan 
study showed that every Federal dollar spent on GLRI projects between 
2010 and 2016 will produce $3.35 in additional economic activity in the 
Great Lakes region through 2036.

2. The challenges to the Great Lakes from fluctuating lake levels and 
        increases in harmful algal blooms and climate change merit full 
        funding of at least the authorized $425 million for FY 2024, 
        and we urge Congress to consider an even higher amount.

    While recognizing the GLRI's success, the growing threats from 
climate change and recurring severe algal outbreaks are getting worse.
    ELPC commissioned 18 leading Midwest and Canadian university and 
research center scientists to write the state-of-the-science report, An 
Assessment of the Impacts of Climate Change on the Great Lakes, which 
we released in 2019, along with recommended policy solutions. The 
scientists concluded that climate change is causing significant and 
far-reaching impacts on the Great Lakes region, including increasingly 
extreme water level fluctuations, which wreak havoc on communities, 
homes, beaches, businesses and the overall shoreline's built 
environment. Annual precipitation in the region has increased at a 
higher percentage than in the rest of the country, and more 
precipitation is coming in unusually large events, such as derechos and 
intense storms. Lake Michigan had record-high water levels in 2021--
especially when whipped by strong winds and heavy waves, this caused 
extensive flooding that damaged the shoreline and infrastructure.
    According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), 2022 was the 6th hottest year on record as climate change 
continues to impact the Great Lakes region.
    ELPC issued a report in June 2022 focused on the threats to people, 
communities and businesses from high Lake Michigan water and wave 
levels: Rising Waters: Climate Change Impacts and Toxic Risks to Lake 
Michigan's Shoreline Communities. Using NOAA's Enhanced Digital 
Elevation Model data, this report visualizes the extent and severity of 
inundation at 12 hot spots along Lake Michigan's shoreline and 
surrounding areas due to extreme weather events of the scale expected 
in the near future. This report points to opportunities for the GLRI 
and other programs to invest in projects that will enhance coastal 
protection and resilience, and flood control.
    Climate change impacts on the Great Lakes also exacerbate the 
growing problem of agricultural runoff pollution--mostly fertilizers 
and manure--that is the principal cause of severe recurring toxic algal 
outbreaks in western Lake Erie and other shallow water bays in the 
Great Lakes. The Ohio EPA concluded that agricultural runoff pollution 
accounts for about 90% of the phosphorus flowing into western Lake 
Erie.
    The current GLRI Action Plan provides a detailed look at strategies 
to reduce this harmful agricultural runoff pollution, noting that GLRI 
projects have kept more than one million pounds of phosphorous out of 
the Great Lakes. The nutrient pollution threats from CAFOs to the Great 
Lakes region, including those in the Maumee River flowing into Lake 
Erie, continue and are exacerbated by changing rainfall patterns. GLRI 
funds could be used to support wetlands restoration to more effectively 
capture phosphorous, and water testing and monitoring to identify 
effective approaches to reducing agricultural runoff pollution. A more 
robust GLRI will continue to be an important source of solutions to 
address this urgent problem.
    In conclusion, the Environmental Law & Policy Center and I commend 
the Senate Appropriations Committee and this subcommittee's strong 
support for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative with each year's 
budget. GLRI is a successful program and a model for federal, State and 
local cooperation. We urge the Committee to fully fund the program with 
at least the authorized $425 million for FY 2024 and, also, to consider 
additional funding.

    These programs fulfill Federal treaty, trust, and contract 
obligations to GLIFWC's member Tribes, providing vital resources to 
sustain their governmental programs. We ask that Congress maintain and 
enhance these programs.
              glifwc's fy 2024 funding request highlights
1.  Should Congress provide an increase to the RPI line item, GLIFWC's 
        top funding priority would be to adjust the overall grades/
        steps of current and incoming employees. With the increase 
        provided in FY 2023, GLIFWC was able to match the FY 2023 GS 
        scale, however GLIFWC is still unable to compensate its 
        employees at rates similar to their State and Federal 
        counterparts, and this is hindering its ability to attract 
        candidates for open positions. GLIFWC was recently unable to 
        fill 17% of its conservation officer force due to this pay 
        discrepancy. Annual RPI increases are needed to keep pace with 
        the Federal scale so that no such shortfall occurs again.

2.  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding of no less than 
        $368,154,000, as proposed in FY 2024, with an increase to the 
        Distinct Tribal Program (DTP) to at least $20,900,000, the 
        amount EPA has committed to provide in FY 2023.

3.  Full funding for contract support costs, as required by the ISDEA 
        Act.

4.  Sufficient funding in the Tribal Management and Development line 
        item for GLIFWC's member Tribes to fulfill their needs for 
        reservation-based natural resource programs and to fund the 
        Circle of Flight wetlands program.
  glifwc's goal--a secure funding base to fulfill treaty purposes and 
                           legal obligations
    For over 35 years, Congress has funded GLIFWC to implement 
comprehensive conservation, natural resource protection, and law 
enforcement programs that: 1) ensure member Tribes are able to 
implement their treaty reserved rights to hunt, fish, and gather 
throughout the ceded territories; 2) ensure a healthy and sustainable 
natural resource base to support those rights; 3) protect public 
safety; and 4) promote healthy, safe communities. These programs also 
provide a wide range of public benefits, and facilitate participation 
in management partnerships in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

 glifwc's programs--promoting healthy communities and educating tribal 
                 members through treaty rights exercise
    Established in 1984, GLIFWC is a natural resources management 
agency of 11 member Ojibwe Tribes with resource management 
responsibilities over their ceded territory (off-reservation) hunting, 
fishing, and gathering treaty rights. These ceded territories extend 
over a 60,000 square mile area in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and 
Michigan.\2\ GLIFWC employs over 80 full-time staff, including natural 
resource scientists, technicians, conservation enforcement officers, 
policy specialists, and public information specialists.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ GLIFWC's programs do not duplicate those of the Chippewa Ottawa 
Resource Authority or the 1854 Treaty Authority. GLIFWC also 
coordinates with its member Tribes with respect to Tribal treaty 
fishing that extends beyond reservation boundaries by virtue of the 
Treaty of 1854 and the reservations' locations on Lake Superior.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    GLIFWC strives to implement its programs in a holistic, integrated 
manner consistent with the culture and values of its member Tribes, 
especially in light of Tribal lifeways that the exercise of treaty 
rights supports. This means not only ensuring that Tribal members can 
legally exercise their rights but supporting community efforts to 
educate them about the benefits (physical, spiritual, and cultural) of 
harvesting and consuming a more traditional diet, as well as promoting 
inter-generational learning and the transmission of traditional 
cultural and management practices.
    GLIFWC and its member Tribes thank Congress, and particularly this 
subcommittee, for its continuing support of these treaty obligations 
and its recognition of the ongoing success of these programs. GLIFWC's 
FY 2024 funding request includes two main elements:

1.  BIA Rights Protection Implementation/Great Lakes Area Management 
        (Within the RPI Line Item):

    No less than $49,542,000, the amount proposed in the 
Administration's FY 2024 budget. The five treaty commissions have 
estimated the cost of full implementation of the court orders governing 
their treaty-reserved rights at, collectively, no less than 
$66,000,000. The overall FY 2023 increase of $3,513,000 is greatly 
appreciated. GLIFWC continues to support allocating increases to the 
RPI line item among the treaty commissions in the historically 
proportionate amounts, regardless of additional directed funding. As we 
stated in our testimony before this subcommittee last year, GLIFWC's 
top priority with any increase to RPI funding was to compensate its 
employees at a rate commensurate with colleagues in other agencies. 
With the FY 2023 increase, GLIFWC was able to adjust its pay to the FY 
2023 pay scale. However, the funding discrepancy is still significant. 
GLIFWC estimates that it would need an increase of approximately 
$963,000 to fully adjust its compensation structure.
    There is a long history of Federal funding for treaty rights 
protection and implementation programs. For more than thirty years, 
Congress and each Administration have appropriated funding for these 
programs. GLIFWC has testified about the fact that the need is 
consistently greater than RPI funding, and the impacts that 
underfunding has on treaty rights programs. The Federal Government, as 
a treaty signatory, is required to uphold treaty rights. It has 
appropriately chosen to invest in our programs as efficient, cost-
effective service delivery mechanisms at the governmental level most 
appropriate to most effectively implement Federal court orders and to 
protect and restore the natural resources on which the treaty rights 
are based. GLIFWC continues to support allocating any increase to the 
RPI line item among the treaty commissions in the historically 
proportionate amounts.
    GLIFWC's holistic approach to protecting treaty rights and the 
natural resources that support them requires that we undertake a 
variety of activities that promote Tribal lifeways and inform natural 
resource management activities. These include scientific, technical and 
policy analyses, promotion of healthy foods, and language 
revitalization. To this end, maximum flexibility should be provided to 
GLIFWC and its Tribes to define for themselves the science and research 
activities best suited to the needs of their member Tribes and the 
particular issues within their region.

2.  EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative: $368,154,000. Distinct 
        Tribal Program (DTP): $20,900,000.

    GLIFWC supports continued funding for the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative (GLRI) as an important non-regulatory program that enhances 
and ensures coordinated governance in the Great Lakes, fulfillment of 
international agreements, and substantive natural resource protection 
and restoration projects. GLIFWC supports the continuation of GLRI 
funding at no less than $368,154,000 proposed in FY 2024.
    GLIFWC continues to appreciate the directive that EPA should follow 
the guidance in House Report 117-83, which directs the EPA and other 
Federal agencies to fund Tribal activities at not less than $15 
million. The DTP has proven to be a successful program, and an 
increasing number of Tribes are participating. This is in part because 
the EPA and the BIA have proven to be engaged and cooperative partners 
with Tribes throughout the implementation of the DTP. However, the DTP 
should include some insurance of predictability when overall GLRI 
funding changes. We ask that Congress provide direction to the EPA to 
direct no less than 5% of total GLRI funding to the DTP, never to fall 
below the $15 million base.
               results and benefits of glifwc's programs
1.  Maintain the Requisite Capability to Meet Legal Obligations, to 
        Conserve Natural Resources, and to Regulate Treaty Harvests: At 
        its most basic level, GLIFWC's programs support Tribal 
        compliance with court decrees and intergovernmental agreements 
        that govern the Tribes' treaty-reserved rights. Funding for 
        science and research enhances GLIFWC's ability to address 
        ecosystem threats that harm treaty natural resources, including 
        those related to climate change.

2.  Remain a Trusted Management and Law Enforcement Partner, and 
        Scientific Contributor in the Great Lakes Region: GLIFWC has 
        become a respected and integral part of management and law 
        enforcement partnerships that conserve natural resources and 
        protect public safety. It brings a Tribal perspective to 
        interjurisdictional Great Lakes management forums and would use 
        its scientific expertise to study issues and geographic areas 
        that are important to its member Tribes but that others may not 
        be examining.

3.  Maintain the Overall Public Benefits that Derive from its Programs: 
        Over the years, GLIFWC has become a recognized and valued 
        partner in natural resource management. Because of its 
        institutional experience and staff expertise, GLIFWC has built 
        and maintained numerous partnerships that: i) provide accurate 
        information and data to counter social misconceptions about 
        Tribal treaty harvests and the status of ceded territory 
        natural resources; ii) maximize each partner's financial 
        resources and avoid duplication of effort and costs; iii) 
        engender cooperation rather than competition; and iv) undertake 
        projects that achieve public benefits that no one partner could 
        accomplish alone.

4.  Encourage and Contribute to Healthy Tribal Communities. GLIFWC 
        works with its member Tribes' communities to promote the 
        benefits of treaty rights exercise. These include the health 
        benefits associated with a more traditional diet and the 
        intergenerational learning that takes place when elders teach 
        youth. In addition, GLIFWC sponsors a camp each summer where 
        Tribal youth build leadership skills, strengthen connections to 
        the outdoors, and learn about treaty rights and careers in 
        natural resource fields.

                   Prepared Statement of GreenLatinos
    As an organization engaging in Federal public lands issues since 
2013, GreenLatinos in partnership with our 802 members throughout the 
United States and its territories, including ECODiversity and the 
Latino Heritage Sites Action Network, appreciate the opportunity to 
provide comments on the proposed FY 2024 Department of Interior (DOI) 
and National Park Service (NPS) budget.
    The Department of Interior is a critical agency charged with the 
stewardship of some of the United States' most critical cultural and 
environmental resources including over 480 million acres of lands. We 
expect that all agencies within DOI, especially the Park Service and 
Bureau of Land Management which administer public lands significant to 
Hispanic and Latino cultures and histories, are accountable to the 
various executive orders and agency memorandums intending to establish 
increasingly equitable outcomes for underserved communities, including 
but not limited to:

  --Executive Order 13171--Hispanic Employment in the Federal 
        Government--Recognizes that Hispanics are underrepresented in 
        the Federal workforce and directs deal agencies to maintain 
        programs for the recruitment and career development of 
        Hispanics in Federal employment.

  --Executive Order 13985--Advancing Racial Equity and Support for 
        Underserved Communities Through the Government: Directs Federal 
        agencies to assess whether and to what extent their programs 
        perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for 
        people of color and other underserved groups

  --Executive Order 14045--Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, 
        and Economic Opportunities for Hispanics: Directs agencies to 
        design plans and measurable actions to advance educational 
        equity and economic opportunity for Hispanic and Latino 
        communities.

  --Executive Order 13583--Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide 
        Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal 
        Workforce: Directs executive departments and agencies to 
        develop and implement a more comprehensive, integrated, and 
        strategic focus on diversity and inclusion as a key component 
        of their human resources strategies.

  --Executive Order 11478--Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal 
        Government: Prohibits discrimination in employment because of 
        race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age; 
        promotes the full realization of equal employment opportunity 
        through a continuing affirmative program in each executive 
        department and agency.

  --Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Our 
        National Parks, National Forests, Marine Protected Areas, and 
        other Public Lands and Waters--Expands on Executive Order 13985 
        to further direct agencies to pursue additional efforts to 
        create and maintain a diverse and inclusive Federal workforce.

  --Department of Interior Secretary Order 3406--Creates a Diversity, 
        Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Council that will 
        ensure that the Department prioritizes action on the 
        advancement of DEIA and further its implementation of the DEIA 
        executive orders.

    We appreciate the overall commitment in the proposed FY 2024 budget 
towards improving the quality of equitable outcomes for the Department 
of Interior's workforce and managed lands such as highlighting the need 
for racial justice and the ``inclusion of underserved communities''. To 
further support these goals, GreenLatinos has identified three areas 
for improvement regarding the proposed FY 2024 budget:

    1) Advancing equitable hiring practices and removing barriers to 
career pathways within DOI and its umbrella agencies to ensure fair and 
equitable representation of Hispanics and Latinos in employment through 
the Federal Government.

    2) Ensuring adequate funding for the maintenance of existing Latino 
Heritage sites and public lands in close proximity to communities of 
color and;

    3) Ensuring accurate and equitable representation of Hispanic and 
Latino histories at conservation and recreation sites under DOI 
jurisdiction.
 advancing equitable hiring practices and removing barriers to career 
   pathways within doi and its umbrella agencies to ensure fair and 
                        equitable representation
    We support DOI's increased funding to expand the total number of 
full-time equivalent staff (FTEs) up to 1,369 FTEs through 2023. A 
fully-staffed workforce is essential to successfully meet the Nation's 
environmental goals, yet at the end of 2020, Interior's staffing was at 
a 10-year low, with 60,558 FTE (OS-10). Although progress has been made 
on the aforementioned commitments to diversity DOI's workforce 
composition, much work is needed to ensure this projected expansion 
includes Latinos and other members of underserved communities. For 
example, a 2021 DOI assessment of workplace composition further 
revealed that:

  --26.2 percent of the total DOI workforce in FY 2021 was identified 
        of race and ethnicity categories other than ``White'' or ``Not 
        Identified.''' In comparison, the Civilian Labor (CLF) 
        benchmark from 2014 to 2018 was 32.5 percent

  --6 of 11 bureaus fall below the DOI average of 26.2 percent for 
        workforce representation from race and ethnicity categories 
        other than ``White'' or ``Not Identified'' in FY 2021

  --65.7 percent of the promotions in 2021 were issued to employees in 
        the category ``White"

  --Of the 887,383 applications received for DOI job opportunities that 
        were audited in FY 2021, 78.4 percent of the applicants were 
        ``White"

  --81.6 percent of selected applicants in FY 2021 were ``White"

    As such, we are supportive of the $20+ million dedicated to 
advancing DEIA initiatives within DOI and its umbrella agencies. 
Congress must support the Biden Administration's proposed budget 
allocations to ensure timely advancement and adequate resourcing of 
these efforts. Moreover, successful implementation will also support 
eliminating barriers to access for underrepresented communities. 
Specifically, we support the following allocations in the proposed FY 
2024 budget:

  --increase of $11.1 million as part of a Department Wide Diversity, 
        Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiative

  --increase includes $3.2 million to address resourcing and compliance 
        gaps identified by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
        (EEOC) .

  --increase of $7.0 million for the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, 
        and Civil Rights; Office of Human Capital; and Office of 
        Collaborative Alternative Dispute Resolution.
ensure adequate funding for the maintenance of existing latino heritage 
   sites and public lands in close proximity to communities of color
    We are supportive of the increase of $266.3 million for operational 
capacity and visitor services for the public. We hope this increased 
funding can support visitor services and the backlog of maintenance for 
Latino-serving sites under DOI's jurisdiction such as Cesar Chavez 
National Monument, etc. Towards this end, we also support the proposed 
$3 million allocation to support start-up costs for sites recently 
added to the National Park System, in particular the $250,000 for the 
Blackwell School National Historic Monument (NPS Overview-7). We also 
support the $8.2 million for new and critical responsibilities at parks 
and offices (NPS Overview-8), in particular the $215,000 for Cesar 
Chavez National Monument for interpretation and education capacity. 
(NPS Overview-9,12)
 ensuring accurate and equitable representation of hispanic and latino 
             histories at conservation and recreation sites
    The FY24 National Park Service appropriations for National 
Recreation and Preservation programs, and the Historic Preservation 
Fund indicate specific program funding related to African American, 
Japanese American, Indigenous American, and Native Hawaiian histories 
and cultural resources including but not limited to historic sites, 
landscapes, ecosystems, parks and rivers. We celebrate and commend the 
Park Service's work to elevate the stories of underserved communities 
but we are struck by what past NPS budgets have meant for the minority 
groups that are not explicitly identified from the Historic 
Preservation Fund, National Recreation and Preservation, and other 
program appropriation. At worst, the exclusion of other racial and 
ethnic groups of color makes a Statement that those who are excluded do 
not matter. Hispanic and Latino Americans, Middle-Eastern Americans, 
and Alaska Natives have been excluded from meaningful investments in 
the Historic Preservation Fund and the National Recreation and 
Preservation appropriations year after year during the Biden 
Administration.
    Despite the robust framework of policy direction, Latinos, 
communities of color, and other underrepresented identity groups such 
as the LGBTQ+, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and other 
communities are not currently equitably represented in lands managed by 
DOI and its umbrella agencies. For example, less than eight percent of 
designated landmarks specifically represent the stories of Native 
Americans, African Americans, American Latinos, Asian Americans, women 
and other underrepresented groups.
    Specifically regarding Latino history, the National Park Foundation 
reports that only 24 of the more than 400 National Park units 
specifically preserve Latino/a/x history; most represent the history of 
Spanish colonization rather than recognizing contemporary history and 
the multitude of Latino cultures. Moreover, there are 190 Latino 
Heritage Sites out of the nearly 96,000 sites in the National Historic 
Register that are managed by the National Park Service and many are 
tied to Spanish colonial or military history such as the Cabrillo 
National Monument (CA), Old Spanish National Historic Trail (NV), San 
Antonio Missions National Historical Park (TX), and San Juan National 
Historic Site (PR). Additionally, while States like California, New 
Mexico, and Texas have many sites, other States with significant Latino 
populations have much less Latino Heritage Sites such as Illinois, New 
York, and New Mexico. Other States do not have any Latino Heritage 
Sites at all such as Connecticut, Delaware, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
    Additionally, we were dismayed to see that land acquisition for the 
National Park Service was reduced by nearly $30 million. While the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund and Great American Outdoors Act have 
provided much-needed additional funding for various park and site 
protections, Congress must ensure land acquisition funding is increased 
in order to reach the long-term goals set through the America The 
Beautiful Initiative. Increased land acquisition funding will also 
support DOI's goals of expanding the equitable representation of 
various historically marginalized communities in conservation and 
recreation site designations.
        establish funding specifically for latino heritage sites
    As is, the NPS budget does not meet its declared intention to fund 
``new and critical responsibilities at parks preserving the stories of 
underrepresented communities and for interpretive projects that tell 
these stories''. We recommend a one-time allocation of funds in the 
FY2024 budget to allow the Department of Interior, in close 
collaboration with agency staff and conservation, historical, and 
community experts to conduct a national systematic review of existing 
parks, recreation areas, and historic sites to identify areas to 
include Latino and Hispanic history where appropriate, including 
potential sites for new Federal protections.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide our recommendations. For 
any questions or clarifications please reach out to Pedro Hernandez at

            unique and successful federal-state partnership
    Understanding the importance of our National heritage, in 1966 
Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA, Title 54 
U.S.C. 300101 et seq), which established historic preservation as a 
national priority, particularly in the face of widespread loss of 
historic buildings and places that represent the American identity in 
communities throughout the country. Recognizing that State officials 
have local expertise and knowledge with the ability to work most 
directly with and for constituents, the act's authors directed Federal 
entities charged with its implementation--the Department of the 
Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation--to partner 
with the States to fulfill this vital national priority through a 
remarkably successful exercise in federalism.
    Federal NHPA duties delegated to the SHPOs include: 1) locating and 
recording historic resources; 2) nominating significant historic 
resources to the National Register of Historic Places; 3) cultivating 
historic preservation programs at the local government level; 4) 
providing funds for preservation activities; 5) commenting on Federal 
rehabilitation tax credit projects; 6) review of all Federal projects 
for their impact on historic properties; and 7) providing technical 
assistance to Federal agencies, State and local governments and the 
private sector.
    Ten years later in 1976, Congress established the Historic 
Preservation Fund (HPF) to assist the States in accomplishing this 
federally delegated work. Congress at that time opted to fund the HPF 
from outer-continental shelf lease revenues (rather than tax dollars), 
based on an initial premise that the depletion of one non-renewable 
resource could be used to help preserve another non-renewable 
resource--our heritage. The States also contribute to the current 
funding mechanism, matching at least 40 percent of the Federal HPF 
funding they receive.
                       saving america's heritage
    The foundational step in preserving and protecting America's 
heritage is to identify it--through the survey, documentation, 
stewardship and sharing of historic place data. Adequate funding is 
essential for SHPOs to do this work in a way that takes advantage of 
and reflects advances in technology. Recent shortfalls in funding mean 
that many States must continue to rely upon outdated paper records and 
inefficient manual processes. Having accurate, up-to-date, and 
digitally accessible information about our Nation's historic resources 
dramatically increases the efficiency of project consultation as well 
as builds a permanent record of our Nation's physical heritage. From 
decisions on the design of local infill development, to state 
transportation planning projects, to Federal large-scale energy 
projects and disaster recovery efforts--every single project that could 
impact historic places, and by extension, the American people, benefit 
from enhanced and accessible historic resource maps and databases.
    Once identified and documented, America's historic resources are 
primarily recognized at the local, State, and national levels by 
listing on both the National Register as well as State and local 
historic registers with varying degrees of protection, consideration, 
and recognition. SHPOs, through the authority of the NHPA assist, 
support, and encourage communities with their preservation efforts and 
are the gateway to listing on the National Register of Historic Places. 
National Register recognition by the Secretary of the Interior confirms 
citizens' belief in the significance of their communities' historic 
places as well as provides incentives for the further preservation of 
these irreplaceable places, often through public-private partnerships.
    Allow me to underscore that the National Historic Preservation 
program is primarily one of assistance, not acquisition. The Federal 
Government does not own, manage, or maintain responsibility for the 
vast majority of the historic assets aided by the National Historic 
Preservation program. Rather, the program, through the States and 
SHPOs, provides individual Americans and communities, together with 
local, State, and Federal Governments with the tools they need to 
identify, preserve, and utilize the historic assets of importance to 
them. SHPOs are constituent-oriented and constituent-focused, and 
working closely and cooperatively with individual Americans to preserve 
historic places across the Nation is a fundamental role.
    Directing $70 million for FY 2024 to SHPO offices will provide much 
needed operational funding to aid in increased capacity and efficiency 
to maximize constituent assistance and responsiveness. Specifically, 
with the recent $500 billion in new Federal infrastructure spending, 
SHPOs are in dire need of resources to operate programs as they 
continue to fulfill responsibilities to review and comment on 
increasing numbers of Federal undertakings under NHPA. Likewise, Tribal 
Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs) assume many of the 
responsibilities of the SHPO on their respective Tribal lands. The 
number of THPOs continues to increase annually, requiring funding to 
keep pace with expanding needs. With over 200 THPOs in place, funding 
of $34 million for THPO offices is necessary to prevent a decrease in 
the average THPO grant.
    HPF funds also support competitive grant programs aimed at 
protecting and promoting the Nation's historic and cultural resources, 
while furthering efforts to tell the full scope of America's history 
through recognition and preservation of our irreplaceable historic 
places. As such, NCSHPO encourages HPF funding of $40 million for the 
Save America's Treasures grant program; $28 million for the African 
American Civil Rights grant program; $17 million for the Paul Bruhn 
Historic Revitalization grant program to support historic preservation 
in rural communities; $13 million to assist in the preservation and 
rehabilitation of buildings on the campuses of Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); $11 million to support the 
Semiquincentennial grant program to commemorate the Nation's 250th 
anniversary; $7 million for the History of Equal Rights grant program; 
and $5 million for competitive grants to identify, recognize and 
preserve the sites and stories related to Underrepresented Communities.
    The FY23 omnibus spending level for the HPF in the amount of $204.5 
million underscores Congresses commitment to the need of having 
appropriate funds to protect and promote our historic and cultural 
assets. This historic allocation exceeded the previously authorized 
level for the HPF of $150 million, a sum that has gone unchanged since 
the program's inception five decades ago.
         jobs, economic development & community revitalization
    Historic preservation has stimulated economic growth, promoted 
community education and pride, and rescued and rehabilitated 
significant historic resources throughout the country. By positively 
combatting the effects of blight and vacancy through respectful 
repurposing of existing historic building stock, historic preservation 
is frequently a catalyst for positive community change--resulting in 
dynamic destinations for visitors and residents alike. Further, 
preservation incentives and programs foster affordable housing and 
solutions to the challenge of climate change.
    The Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit (HTC) program, administered 
by the State Historic Preservation Offices in cooperation with the 
National Park Service, is an important driver for economic development. 
Throughout the program's history, the HTC has driven completion of 
nearly 48,000 individual projects since 1976, and leveraged over 
$122.90 billion in private investment nationwide, and created 192,314 
low and moderate income housing units\1\. On average, the HTC leverages 
$5 dollars in private investment for every $1 dollar in Federal 
funding, cultivating highly effective public-private partnerships and 
community focused re-investment. 39 States currently offer a historic 
tax credit program\2\, including my own state of North Carolina. State 
tax credit programs complement the Federal HTC program incentives and 
provide additional opportunities for community revitalization and 
saving historic places for the use and enjoyment of future generations 
of Americans.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As an example of return on the Federal HPF investment in my own 
state of North Carolina, the modest Federal funding provided to our 
office of less than $1.5 million in the last fiscal year helped our 
professional staff to facilitate in that 1 year approximately $200 
million of historic tax credit-fueled private investment in historic 
buildings, which employs local workers at the construction and post-
rehab stage, brought about local construction material spending, 
generated new sources of local, State, and Federal tax revenue, and 
enhanced community pride through the renewal of historic building stock 
for a new generation of productive use.
    Historic preservation also stimulates economic development through 
heritage tourism. SHPOs are essential local partners in identifying and 
interpreting the historic places that attract and inspire visitors. A 
modest increase in SHPO funding would allow SHPOs to expand their 
public outreach and assistance efforts, enabling communities to take 
greater advantage of heritage tourism opportunities which likewise lead 
to job creation, new business development and strong community 
identity.
          state historic preservation offices' accomplishments
    The HPF has facilitated nearly 100,000 listings to the National 
Register, with over 1.9 million contributing resources, and the survey 
of millions of acres for cultural resources. The HPF has also provided 
SHPOs with the administrative capacity for constituent access to the 
Federal Historic Preservation Tax Credit program, which has generated 
more than $39.4 billion in Federal tax revenue from historic 
rehabilitation projects from inception through FY 20202. In FY 2021, 
HPF funding also enabled SHPOs to review 124,300 Federal undertakings, 
and in so doing, aid in a conscientious public consideration of how to 
balance two fundamental needs--public investments for the future and 
preservation of America's historic places.
    Many SHPOs have also made extensive use of HPF grant programs that 
are intended to make sure that a wide variety of historic places are 
preserved. In North Carolina, over the last several years, we have 
applied for and received grants under several of these grant programs. 
A 2015 Underrepresented Communities grant yielded National Register 
nominations and listings for eight Rosenwald School nominations, two 
historic African American cemeteries, and the College Heights Historic 
District, which is associated with the HBCU North Carolina Central 
University; a 2022 award through this program will survey and nominate 
to the National Register extant Green Book properties, as examples of 
Black entrepreneurship during the difficult segregation era. A 2020 
Civil Rights grant is currently underway with a study to gather and 
document oral histories, background research, and places associated 
with the Civil Right Movement in northeastern North Carolina. The North 
Carolina Division of State Historic Sites has also recently received a 
Civil Rights grant to rehabilitate the home of Civil Rights leader 
Golden Frinks in Edenton and update the existing National Register 
listing for the home to capture its Civil Rights significance. A 
current American Battlefield Protection Program planning grant is 
providing needed funding to study the combat role of US Colored Troops 
in North Carolina with an eye to strategizing battlefield preservation 
priorities in the future.
                               conclusion
    Historic preservation recognizes that what was common and ordinary 
in the past is often rare and precious today, and what is common and 
ordinary today may be extraordinary, whether it is fifty, one hundred 
or five hundred years from now. The national network of State Historic 
Preservation Offices, employing public history professionals in service 
to American citizens, helps to ensure that the places associated with 
the history of all Americans are recognized and preserved. To that end, 
I would like to thank the committee sincerely for its commitment to 
historic preservation. The Federal Government plays an invaluable role 
in preserving our Nation's history and our collective sense of place. 
Through our federalism partnership, SHPOs remain committed to working 
together to identify, protect, and maintain our Nation's heritage and 
in doing so, provide Americans with a strong sense of orientation 
towards our common history.
    On behalf of all 59 SHPOs, I'd like to thank you, Chairman Merkley, 
Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the U.S. Senate Committee on 
Appropriations, subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies for the opportunity to submit testimony.

Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers.]

                  Prepared Statement of the Hopi Tribe
    Greetings Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and Members of 
the subcommittee on Interior, Environment, & Related Agencies. My name 
is Timothy Nuvangyaoma and I have the honor of serving as Chairman of 
the Hopi Tribe (``Tribe''). The Hopi Reservation, located in the 
northeast corner of Arizona, includes more than 1.5 million acres. The 
Tribe has over 14,000 enrolled Tribal members, over half of whom reside 
in the Reservation's 12 villages. The residents of the Reservation 
suffer from a 60% unemployment rate due, in part, to the lack of 
economic development opportunities caused by the remote and landlocked 
nature of the Reservation.
    I would like to begin my testimony by thanking the subcommittee for 
fully funding the new Hopi Detention Center (``HDC''). As you may 
recall, in December 2016, the Hopi Tribe declared a State of emergency 
following the abrupt condemnation and closure of the previous detention 
center by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (``BIA''). The subcommittee was 
integral in appropriating funding for the HDC, as well as conducting 
oversight as there were constant delays with the project. The Tribe is 
now pleased to report that construction on the Hopi Detention Center is 
nearly 50 percent complete.
    With construction of the HDC well underway, the Tribe is now 
focused on securing funding for the proposed Hopi Justice Complex (``A 
New House''). Since the HDC design does not provide for an integrated 
comprehensive justice complex and services, the Tribe needs funding for 
facilities that would house the Trial, Appellate, Wellness, and Traffic 
Courts; Probation; Security; and Administration.
    The need for the A New House project is outlined in the 2020 Hopi 
Judicial Commission Annual Report and Findings, as well as the 2022 
Tribal Court Assessment, which was conducted by the BIA's Tribal 
Justice Support Division. Collectively, these reports found that 
critical capital improvements are needed to renovate or construct a 
comprehensive service Judicial Complex, and that an inspection needs to 
be undertaken by a trained environmental hazard expert to determine if 
the current facility must be abandoned.
    President Biden's Budget for Fiscal Year 2024 calls on Congress to 
provide $75.3 million for Public Safety & Justice (``PS&J'') 
Construction, an increase of $23.7 million over the FY 2023 enacted 
level. Managed by the BIA Division of Management and Construction 
(``DFMC''), PS&J Construction supports law enforcement, detention, and 
court facility replacement, improvements, and repairs, employee housing 
construction, fire safety improvements and repairs, and other various 
programs that support the mission of the BIA Office of Justice Services 
(``OJS'').
    Within the proposed $75.3 million for PS&J Construction is $48.5 
million for Facilities Replacement/New Construction, an increase of $15 
million over the FY 2023 enacted level; and $15.8 million for 
Facilities Improvement & Repair, an increase of $6 million over the FY 
2023 enacted level. The Hopi Tribe strongly supports these proposed 
increases in funding and urges the subcommittee to substantially 
increase funding for PS&J Construction.
    The Hopi Tribe thanks the subcommittee for the opportunity to 
provide testimony on the Fiscal Year 2024 budget.

the Hopi Tribe.]
                                 ______
                                 
           Prepared Statement of Hoopa Valley Tribal Council
    On behalf of the Hoopa Valley Tribal Council and our citizens, it 
is an honor to provide our funding priorities and recommendations for 
the FY2024 Budgets for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Indian 
Health Service (IHS), and Related agencies. First, we strongly urge 
this Committee to protect the Federal trust and treaty obligations as 
you consider Tribal program funding for FY 2024. While the United 
States has yet to fully live up to the promises it has made to Tribal 
nations, the Hoopa Valley Tribe (``Tribe'') continues to pursue our 
goals in building a strong and prosperous economy and providing 
necessary public services to our citizens. Second, the Tribe is one of 
the initial Tribes to enter into a Compact of Self-Governance with the 
United States in both the Departments of the Interior and Health and 
Human Services. We have had great success in implementing Tribal Self-
Governance, but we are still woefully underfunded in many of our 
critical programs, services, functions and activities. The following 
summarizes our priority funding requests and justifications.

I. Hoopa Valley Tribe Specific Requests

  1. $800,000 Increase--Law Enforcement--Special Agents in Charge--BIA
  2. $740,000--Hoopa Office of Emergency Services (OES)--BIA
  3. $750,000--Social Services/Indian Child Welfare Act--BIA
  4. $160,000--Forestry--BIA
  5. $1.25 million Base Funding Increase--Wildland Fire--BIA
  6. $750,000 Increase--Fisheries--BOR and Related Agencies
  7. $750,000--Irrigation--BIA
  8. $900,000 Annual Allocation--Hoopa Valley Public Utility District 
    (Operation/Maintenance)--IHS
  9. $3.6 million Increase--Clinic Staffing, Recruitment & Retention 
    (Human Resources)--IHS
  10. $760,000--Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)--IHS

    Support National and Regional FY 2024 Budget Requests and 
Recommendations for the BIA and IHS--by the National Congress of 
American Indians, National Indian Health Board, National Indian 
Education Association, and Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians.

II. Background on the Hoopa Valley Tribe

    The Tribe is located in northeast Humboldt County, California along 
the Trinity River, approximately fifty-nine miles east of Eureka and 
272 miles north of Sacramento. The Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation 
(Reservation) is approximately 89,400 acres of forest and mountain land 
ranging in elevation from 320 to 5,000 feet.

III. Hoopa Valley Tribe Specific Requests/Justifications

1. $800,000 Increase--Law Enforcement--Police Officers and Special 
Agents in Charge (SACs)--BIA

    The Hoopa Valley Tribal Police Department (HVTPD) was officially 
formed in 1984. In November 2016, the Department of Justice consented 
to the Tribe's request for reassumption of concurrent Federal criminal 
jurisdiction over the Indian Country of the Tribe. To allow all Tribal, 
Federal and State partners involved sufficient time to establish 
appropriate guidelines and procedures to effectuate concurrent Federal 
jurisdiction in the Tribe's jurisdiction, the Tribe subsequently 
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Attorney for 
the Northern District of California, the District Attorney for the 
County of Humboldt and the Sheriff of the County of Humboldt.
    Since that time, the HVTPD has provided enforcement at all three 
levels of authority, with inadequate and minimal funding provided from 
BIA. As a result, HVTPD has been unable to meet the BIA's assessment of 
the Department, which identified a need for 15 officers to function 
properly. Presently, HVTPD has seven full-time officers. The costs of 
hiring, training and outfitting an officer is on average $100,000/
officer. To meet this shortfall and hire the necessary officer, the 
Tribe is requesting an increase in BIA Law Enforcement funding. Further 
the need for additional BIA Special Agents in Charge (SAC) is for more 
than on-the-ground response. We need BIA support for processing Special 
Law Enforcement Commissions (SLEC) applications, assisting with officer 
training and other administrative matters. California is a big State 
and deserves at least 3 SACs.

2. $740,000--Hoopa Office of Emergency Services (OES)--BIA

    OES is a Tribal emergency management program established in 2011 to 
develop and implement emergency management plans and programs for the 
Tribe. OES is responsible for coordinating emergency management 
activities, including planning, training, and response operations, and 
for working closely with Tribal, State, and Federal partners to ensure 
effective emergency response and recovery. OES provides a service to 
all community members, both Tribal members and non-Tribal members. The 
program is a critical service that plays a vital role in the safety and 
well-being of the entire Hoopa Valley community. Unlike State and local 
county emergency management programs, Tribal emergency management 
programs do not have annual funding s or compact agreements. Emergency 
management and response is particularly challenging due to the remote 
and rugged terrain. Therefore, the requested funding will assist with 
operations, will enable OES to have more control over the emergency 
management resources available to the Tribe, and to better meet the 
needs of the Tribal community in emergency situations.

3. $750,000--Social Services/Indian Child Welfare Act--BIA

    The Tribe receives inadequate funding to properly administer 
services to our abused and neglected elders, dependent adults and 
children. These disparities include inadequate funding for Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) cases. The Tribe has the second largest ICWA 
caseload in the State of California. There is no funding for ICWA 
attorneys and only enough funds for one ICWA social worker (whereas our 
caseload dictates the need for 3 to 5 case managers). Further, there is 
no funding support for our at-risk youth. The requested funding will be 
used to address these shortfalls including prevention activities to 
address drug, alcohol, violence and abuse.

4. $160,000--Forestry--BIA

    The Forestry Department (Forestry) receives compact funding which 
has averaged $849,013 over the last 6 years. In 2017, the payment was 
$812,325; however, these funds were underpaid, and the funding has not 
increased for well over a decade. In 2008, the end of the Timber 
Harvest Initiative funds had a detrimental impact on Forestry's ability 
to cover wages for personnel and Arch and Geological surveys producing 
required NEPA documentation. As a result, the continued lack of funding 
and uncertainly of funding is negatively impacting our workforce 
retention and operations. Separately, we have experienced delays in 
processing of timber sale contracts and timber sales payments from the 
BIA. This is very troubling and has placed additional burden on 
existing staff. It is crucial for the Department's to receive 
reimbursements from the BIA in a timely manner.

5. $1.25M Base Funding Increase--Wildland Fire--BIA

    The Hoopa Valley Tribe Self-Governance base amount for Wildland 
Fire preparedness has not increased for 24 years. The Hoopa Valley 
Tribe is one of two Tribes within the Pacific Region that took 
advantage of the 1999 opportunity to dedicate their staff and resources 
to complete the only approved Fire Management Planning Analysis (FMP). 
This enabled the Tribes to receive updated funding for their operation 
of BIA wildland fire programs. Now in 2023, Hoopa is still one of two 
Tribes to meet the 90 International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers (IAM) Chapter 3 Wildland Fire Management Preparedness 
policy combined with a legitimate approved method of funding needs 
analysis. In the face of a very real and probable risk of catastrophic 
wildland fire, there is a life and death need for the Tribe to have a 
base funding increase of $1.25 million for wildland fire preparedness. 
Timely reimbursements are critically needed. The delay is resulting in 
detrimental and negative impacts.

6. $750,000 Increase--Fisheries--BOR and Related Agencies

    The Fisheries Department (Fisheries) is charged with the health and 
safety of the Trinity River, the fish, and water quality. Fisheries 
emphasizes the United States trust responsibility in defending and 
protecting the Trinity River which holds cultural, historical, and 
sacred significance to our people. Fisheries requires funding to assist 
with the hiring and retention of specialized personnel; equipment; 
operational, maintenance, and legal expenses; and the renovation of a 
conservation hatchery project.

7. $750,000--Irrigation--BIA

    The Hoopa Valley Public Utilities District (HVPUD) is a duly 
chartered entity of the Hoopa Valley Tribe. Per the Charter and By-Laws 
of HVPUD, the District is responsible for maintaining and managing the 
irrigation system within the Reservation. Per the Self-Governance 
Compact and Funding Agreement with the BIA, the HVPUD receives $47,416 
on an annual basis to operate and manage Hoopa's entire irrigation 
infrastructure. This amount has remained the same since the early 
1990's. The cost to operate and maintain the irrigation system greatly 
outweighs the funding that is received. These expenses include 
staffing, fuel, parts, pumping costs, repair and replacement from 
normal wear and tear, repair due to vandalism and damage, heavy 
equipment costs, etc. HVPUD has spent more than its annual funding 
allocation trying to remedy the irrigation pumping issue. HVPUD 
requires an increased annual allocation for the irrigation funding 
provided in the BIA Self-Governance Funding Agreement.

8. $900,000 Annual Allocation--Hoopa Valley Public Utility District 
(Operation/Maintenance)--IHS

    The HVPUD provides critical health and safety related services to 
the residents of the Reservation, including safe drinking water, 
irrigation services, fire flow, sanitation facilities (water and septic 
installation) and solid waste management. In addition, HVPUD 
facilitates the broadband and energy related projects on behalf of the 
Tribe. For 42 years, HVPUD has provided essential utility services to 
this Tribal community with zero allocated funding to support the 
operation and maintenance of the largest Tribal water utility in the 
State of California.
    The Hoopa Valley wide system (Public Water System #: 0605126) 
consists of 2 water treatment facilities, 20 water storage tanks, 14 
pumping facilities, 13 distribution systems and miles and miles of 
waterlines of various age, make, and size. HVPUD lacks the means to 
adequately cover the operations and maintenance of our public water 
system, which are the functions, duties and labor associated with the 
daily operations and normal repairs, replacement of parts and 
structural components, and other activities needed by a water system to 
preserve its capital assets to continue to provide safe drinking water.
    The IHS has a trust responsibility to provide service to Indians 
including healthcare. Safe drinking is a critical component of having a 
healthy community for hydration, cooking and sanitation uses.

9. $3.6M Increase- Clinic Staffing, Recruitment & Retention (Human 
Resource)--IHS

    K'ima:w Medical Center (KMC) is a rural ambulatory clinic and 
entity of the Tribe. The expenses for locums to fill critical positions 
has grown exorbitantly. At the height of the COVID- 19 pandemic, KMC 
had over 30 vacancies. In FY2022 alone, KMC had to utilize 8 different 
locum agencies and 27 different locum providers. Staff cover multiple 
duties and roles to carry out health services. Clinical staff, both 
nurses and providers, are currently majority locums/travelers. This has 
led to high salary costs, but also barriers for continuity of care and 
an increased burden on staff who are recruiting, training, and 
orienting new staff members every few months. While third-party revenue 
and grants help cover some operating costs, the resources put into 
recruitment and retention are increasing exponentially, and sadly, we 
aren't even achieving the goal of full permanent staffing. KMC remains 
at a disadvantage when competing with appropriately funded urban 
organizations.

10. $760,000--Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)--IHS

    Given the transportation challenges of our rural residents, coupled 
with not having emergency care at our local health facility, ambulance 
services are critical for mitigating harm and saving lives. Our 
ambulance service has been a cornerstone for care within our community 
for two decades. Private ambulance services do not cover rural areas 
because it is not lucrative (less calls and greater distance to 
travel), as is our case. In 2022, KMC Ambulance responded to 1,257 
calls. We rely on unstable funding to subsidize our ambulance 
department, such as Measure Z/O. Although clearly demonstrating how 
vital ambulance services are for our community, KMC does not receive 
the needed HIS funding to support these operational costs.
    I appreciate the opportunity to provide our FY2024 BIA, IHS, and 
related agency budget priorities of the Hoopa Valley Tribe and 
respectfully urge your support of these requests.

    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to offer testimony on 
matters of importance to our organizations and to our millions of 
supporters. We thank you for the support and investment in animal 
protection in the subcommittee's Fiscal Year 2023 appropriations bill. 
We appreciate your continued consideration in Fiscal Year 2024 and urge 
you to address the following requests in the FY24 Department of 
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies budget:

  --FWS Big Cat Public Safety Act: report language
  --FWS Office of Law Enforcement: increase of $7.2 million and 29 FTEs 
        per President's Budget request
  --FWS trophy hunting reporting: report language
  --FWS Endangered Species Act: exclude policy riders that delist 
        species, including grizzly bears and gray wolves
  --FWS Ecological Services Program: $841 million
  --BLM Wild Horse and Burro Program: $175 million; implementation of 
        nonlethal management strategy addressing the considerations 
        detailed below; expeditious action to fill staff vacancies
  --BLM & USFS prohibition on destruction of healthy wild horses and 
        burros: bill language per President's Budget request
  --EPA sunsetting mammalian testing: report language

 fish and wildlife service--big cat public safety act implementation & 
                       office of law enforcement
    The Big Cat Public Safety Act (Public Law 117-243) was signed into 
law on December 20, 2023. This law revises restrictions on the 
possession and exhibition of big cats, including restrictions on direct 
contact between the public and big cats. Numerous large cat species are 
now subject to seizure and forfeiture when possessed or exhibited 
illegally, the disposition of which will require collaboration with 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Justice, and private 
sector entities to ensure proper placement and care.

    We urge the inclusion of the following report language:

Big Cat Public Act Implementation.-The Committee is aware of the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service's additional responsibilities pursuant to the 
enactment of Public Law 117-243. The Committee encourages the Service 
to collaborate with United States Department of Agriculture and the 
Department of Justice and directs the submission of a report within 90 
days of enactment of this act describing staffing and resource needs, 
implementation including reporting violations, and enforcement status 
related to Public Law 117-243.

    We also support and urge inclusion of the President's Budget 
request for an additional $7.2 million and 29 FTEs for Wildlife Law 
Enforcement Capacity to investigate possible violations of, and as 
appropriate enforce, the Big Cat Public Safety Act and other wildlife 
laws. This function is within the Office of Law Enforcement's Law 
Enforcement Operations program, which was funded at $91.2 million in 
FY23.
          fish and wildlife service--trophy hunting reporting
    African elephant and lion numbers have dropped steeply in the last 
decade from poaching, habitat loss, and other threats. Poorly managed 
trophy hunting exacerbates this decline. The Endangered Species Act 
requires that imports of these and other listed species enhance their 
survival. Congress previously directed FWS to reevaluate its trophy-
import policy to this end, but the agency has not yet done so. It is 
time for FWS to show that importing African elephant and lion trophies 
helps, not harms, the species.

    We therefore urge the inclusion of the following report language:

Trophy Hunting Reporting.-The Committee reminds the Service of its 
direction in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the Fiscal 
Year 2023 omnibus for the Service to continue to provide updates on 
actions regarding protecting lions, elephants, and other iconic species 
that are hunted for trophies. The Service is directed to provide 
quarterly reports to the Committee on these actions.
  fish and wildlife service--endangered species act implementation & 
                      ecological services program
    Maintaining Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections for large 
native carnivores such as grizzly bears and gray wolves is vital to the 
long-term, sustainable recovery of these species, to our Nation's 
interest in preventing the loss of vulnerable species, and to 
maintaining healthy ecosystems. Large native carnivores are 
particularly likely to be imperiled. In addition to their direct 
killing by poachers, trophy hunters, and trappers, they face many other 
threats, including loss of habitat and prey species. This is 
exacerbated by the fact that they have long reproductive cycles and 
produce relatively few offspring.
    When Congress passed this landmark law 50 years ago, it did so with 
the intention that decisions under the statute be made on scientific 
grounds. Delisting individual species through legislation undermines a 
system that has successfully prevented 99% of listed species from going 
extinct. It also sets a dangerous precedent that politics may trump 
science, even in the face of extinction. We therefore urge the 
subcommittee to exclude policy riders that delist species, including 
grizzly bears and gray wolves, from the ESA in the FY24 Interior, 
Environment and Related Agencies bill.
    As we prepare to celebrate the ESA's 50th anniversary, we urge 
Congress to make a bold investment to our Nation's most vulnerable 
species by appropriating $841 million to the Ecological Services 
Program to fully implement the Endangered Species Act. Currently, the 
Service only receives around 50% of the funding required to fully 
implement the act. As a result, too many species sit in limbo, or 
receive funding only after declining even closer to extinction, when 
the costs of action are higher or the options for conservation more 
limited. The requested funding level will ensure every listed species 
receives a minimum of $50,000 per year for recovery, allowing the 
Endangered Species Act to be implemented the way Congress originally 
intended.
        bureau of land management--wild horse and burro program
    To maintain the wild horse population in a humane and fiscally 
conservative manner, we, along with our partner stakeholders in the 
Path Forward for Wild Horse and Burro Management, request continued 
support for BLM's implementation of a humane, nonlethal, and effective 
program. We support a funding level of $175 million for the Wild Horse 
and Burro Program, an increase of $27.1 million from the FY23 enacted 
level. We support directives to implement a nonlethal management 
strategy with specific attention on: increasing the use of fertility 
control, including measurable objectives in reducing population growth 
with fertility controls; targeting removals from the most heavily 
ecologically impacted and populated areas; expanding long-term, off-
range humane holding; developing contingency plans for emergency 
situations to ensure the continuation of proactive management under a 
variety of conditions including extreme drought; and continuing 
adoptions while fully implementing and enforcing existing safeguards, 
including pre-approval of adoption applicants and postadoption 
compliance checks for adopted wild horses and burros. Additionally, we 
request that the agency act expeditiously to fill the high number of 
staff vacancies within the program.
    bureau of land management & u.s. forest service--prohibition on 
             destruction of healthy wild horses and burros
    We strongly support and urge the subcommittee to include as bill 
language text from the President's FY24 request that bars BLM and USFS 
from sending any wild horse or burro to slaughter or selling/
transferring any horse or burro in a manner that results in its 
destruction, and bars any federal, state, or local government that 
receives any wild horse or burro transferred from BLM or USFS from 
doing likewise.
     environmental protection agency--sunsetting mammalian testing
    The EPA has a history of embracing new approach methodologies 
(NAMs) that do not use animals to assess the safety of pesticides and 
industrial chemicals. In 2019, EPA confirmed its commitment to NAMs by 
setting a goal to end reliance on mammalian testing for its regulated 
products by 2035 and achieve a 30% reduction by 2025 (including tests 
commissioned in-house and that businesses must conduct). The Frank R. 
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (Public Law 114-
182) included statutory language to reduce and ultimately end use of 
animals in toxicity testing for risk assessments of chemicals under the 
Toxic Substances Control Act.
    Non-animal approaches include cell cultures, computer modeling, 
organ-on-a-chip technologies, and other methods that are often faster, 
cheaper and more predictive of human health or environmental risks than 
animal tests. Different animal species and even differing sexes or sub-
species can respond differently when exposed to the same chemicals. As 
a result, results from animal tests may not be relevant to humans or 
other non-target species, or may under- or over-estimate health 
hazards. NAMs, by contrast, are much more likely to provide relevant 
safety information to protect human health and the environment. 
Finally, because animal testing is time-consuming and expensive, it 
limits the number of chemicals and products that can be tested. 
Thousands of new chemicals are created every year with tens of 
thousands more already in use. Using animal tests to evaluate the human 
and environmental safety of all these chemicals would take decades to 
complete and cost millions of animal lives.

    We therefore urge the inclusion of the following report language:

Expedite Sunsetting Mammalian Testing.-The Committee recognizes that 
new approach methodologies (NAMs) represent the cutting edge of 
toxicity testing and should be prioritized for use in testing the 
safety of pesticides and industrial chemicals over the use of animals 
and encourages EPA to continue to fund the development of NAMs and 
eliminate animal testing where possible. The Committee reminds the EPA 
that the joint explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 117-328 
directed the agency to publish information regarding NAMs, including 
submissions to the NAMs list that are currently being evaluated and 
those that have been rejected; incorporate specific goals reflecting 
the current regulatory landscape; and outline the necessary steps to 
reduce animal testing and to assess progress in order to end the use of 
mammals in testing and to assess associated progress. U.S. EPA 
Memorandum ``Directive to Prioritize Efforts to Reduce Animal Testing'' 
issued on September 10, 2019 outlined that the agency would end the use 
of mammals in testing by 2035; we urge the EPA to expedite this 
timeline.

          Prepared Statement of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe
    On behalf of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, I am pleased to submit 
this written testimony on our funding priorities and requests for 
Fiscal Year 2024 for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the Indian 
Health Service (IHS) budgets. We continue to urge Congress to provide 
robust investments in Tribal programs and services to ensure Tribes are 
empowered with the tools and resources needed for effective and 
efficient governmental operations; a critical prerequisite to achieving 
Tribal self-sufficiency.
    Congress can further Tribal Self-Governance and support strong 
Tribal governments, economies, and communities by enacting measures 
that address the structural deficiencies across the Federal system. To 
include, providing mandatory funding for all Tribal programs and 
services, requiring the Administration to submit an annual estimate of 
the total cost to fully fund trust and treaty obligations, break down 
the funding silos and allow funding from all Federal agencies to be 
allocated through Self-Governance compacts and funding agreements, 
provide direct funding to Tribes, increase funding for base and 
recurring programs instead of grant programs, and empower Tribes with 
maximum flexibility to improve programmatic outcomes.

Tribal Funding Priority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, DOI

  1. $712 Millon Operations and Maintenance Funding for the National 
        Wildlife Refuge

  2. $100 Million State and Tribal Wildlife Grants

    1. $712 Million--National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Fund--A significant 
investment of at least $712 million in Operations and Maintenance 
funding for the NWR is needed to meet our shared mission and goals and 
to begin to address a range of critical services, including wildlife 
and habitat management, conservation planning, conservation law 
enforcement, infrastructure, maintenance and repairs, and visitor 
services. Encompassing over 850 million acres, the NWR is the largest 
and most diverse network of conservation lands and waters in the world. 
There are 568 NWR across the United States and these lands and waters 
are comprised of critical ecosystems that serve as habitat for hundreds 
of rare, threatened, and endangered species of fish, animals, and 
plants. However, chronic underfunding and understaffing has undermined 
the ability of the FWS to fulfill its core mission.
    Our Tribe has a strong interest in ensuring the health and vitality 
of the NWR ecosystems. The Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) is 
part of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe's ancestral homelands. Our Tribal 
villages were located along the shoreline and we continue to use and 
inhabit the Dungeness as we have done since time immemorial. Jamestown 
has significant historical, cultural, and spiritual connections to 
these lands and waters and this area is critical to the preservation of 
our oral history, creation stories, language, ceremonies, and culture. 
We have an obligation to protect these lands and waters for our future 
generations which is why we are partnering with the FWS by entering 
into a Co-stewardship Agreement. Tribal Nations have developed 
comprehensive approaches to implementing programs and services at the 
local level using holistic techniques, innovative solutions, and 
partnerships that have proven successful in leveraging the Federal 
dollar to yield a higher return on the investment.
    2. $100 Million--State and Tribal Wildlife Grants Program--The 
State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program (STWGP) funds foster strong 
partnerships between Federal, State, and Tribal Governments as well as, 
Private and Non-Profit entities. These partnerships pool resources to 
enable wildlife professionals to implement conservation techniques that 
benefit over 12,000 at risk species. We request that Congress 
appropriate $100 million to support this grant program.

Tribal Top Three Priorities and Recommendations for the BIA/BIE and 
IHS:

  1. Advanced Appropriations for Tribal Programs and Services

  2. Mandatory Appropriations for Section 105(l) Leases and Contract 
        Support Costs

  3. Increase Funding for Tribal Base Budgets

    Advance Appropriations for Tribal Programs and Services--We are 
grateful that Congress enacted Advanced Appropriations for the Indian 
Health Service for FY2024; however, we now urge Congress to make 
Advanced Appropriations for the Indian Health Service permanent and to 
extend advanced appropriations to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the 
Bureau of Indian Education. Providing appropriations 1 year in advance 
for the BIA, BIE and IHS will mitigate the adverse financial effects of 
Federal budgetary uncertainties and allow Tribes to engage in more 
effective strategic planning, spend funds more efficiently, grow our 
Tribal economies and businesses and increase the quality of care and 
well-being of our Tribal citizens and communities.
    Reclassify Discretionary Spending for Section 105(l) Leases and 
Contract Support Costs (CSC) to Mandatory -Separate, indefinite 
accounts were established to support Section105(l) leases and CSC but 
have resulted in the unintended reduction of funding for critical 
Tribal programs. Funding for 105(l) leases and CSC should be 
reclassified as mandatory funding to prevent programmatic decreases. In 
addition, we urge Congress to take legislative action to clarify its 
intent that space used to provide services within the scope of the 
ISDEAA to any patient is compensable under 105(l). Many Tribes are the 
only healthcare providers in their rural communities and the only ones 
who will accept Medicare and Medicaid patients. Tribes generate third 
party revenue by serving these individuals as authorized under Section 
813 of the IHCIA and this money in turn is used to provide healthcare 
to their own citizens. The IHS, however, has adopted a policy that 
denies compensation to Tribes for the portion of their healthcare 
facility that the agency decides serves non-beneficiaries even though 
Congress authorized such services under Section 813 of the IHCIA.
    Increase Funding for Tribal Base Budgets--Tribal Priority 
Allocations (TPA) and Recurring Programs are consistently identified as 
funding priorities by the Tribal Interior Budget Council (TIBC) because 
they provide core funding that supports critical government programs 
and services. Flexibility in the use of funds to support local needs is 
an important aspect of this funding. TPA and Recurring Program funding 
provides security and certainty for Tribes rather than funding provided 
through grant dollars. There has been a growing trend among agencies to 
fund Tribal programs and services with grant dollars rather than 
providing base and recurring funding. Grant funding is incongruent with 
the trust and treaty obligations.

Tribal Priorities, National & Regional Requests and Recommendations for 
the BIA:

1. Trust Natural Resources/Treaty Rights/Habitat Restoration/Climate 
        Resiliency

  --$60 million BIA Rights Protection Implementation

  --$17.1 million Western Washington Fisheries Management

  --$10 million Wildlife & Parks Program TPA

  --$35 million BIA Climate Resilience

2. Human Services

  --$70 million Social Services

  --$100 million Welfare Assistance

  --$30 million Indian Child Welfare Act

    $60 million--BIA Rights Protection Implementation--Rights 
Protection Implementation is essential to preserve our Tribal treaty 
rights through resource management activities. The Federal investment 
in our trust natural resources serves two primary purposes: (1) It 
allows us to fulfill our environmental stewardship responsibilities 
through the protection and restoration of the ecosystems and habitats 
of our Tribal homelands and waters through sustainable conservation 
policies and practices; and (2) it fosters Tribal self-sufficiency by 
allowing us to grow our economies and cultivate partnerships with State 
and local governments and other entities. It also allows us to create 
jobs for our Tribal citizens and community members and promotes and 
advances trade of our marine resources in local, regional, national, 
and international markets.
    $17.1 million--Western Washington Fisheries Management--This 
critical funding supports Tribal co-management activities of our treaty 
resources with the State of Washington. This funding is critical to 
support day to day activities and monitoring of endangered habitat and 
fish stocks. Increased commercial and recreational activities coupled 
with the severe consequences of climate change has increased the 
urgency and costs associated with protecting our treaty resources. The 
vitality and sustainability of our natural resources is integral to the 
health and welfare of our Tribal citizens, communities, culture and 
religious practices and economies.
    $15 million--Wildlife and Parks- Aquaculture allows us to 
demonstrate best practices in restoring our waterways, producing more 
seafood to alleviate food insecurity, combining our Tribal ecological 
knowledge with advanced technology in marine science to address 
endangered species concerns, and create economic opportunities while at 
the same time protecting the environment and preserving our cultural 
heritage and traditional practices. This funding supports our hatchery 
operations that harvest salmon, oysters and other fish and shellfish 
stocks. Our Tribal culture and traditions, ceremonies and subsistence 
are dependent on the survival of these species.
    $35 million--BIA Climate Resilience--Climate resilience funding is 
essential to restore ecological functions, healthy habitats, and 
protect our resources. Our Tribal Treaty Rights are at risk. Climate 
change is having a profound impact on Tribal communities, lands, 
resources and infrastructure and degradation of our natural environment 
is happening faster than we can restore it in the Northwest.
    $200 million--Human Services/Social Services/Welfare Assistance/
ICWA--Funding for our social service programs is an investment in our 
most important resources, our elders, our children, and our Tribal 
families. American Indian/Alaska Native children have a unique legal 
status as citizens of Tribal governments and the Indian Child Welfare 
Act (ICWA) provides safeguards to maintain Tribal and family 
connections and relationships. We lead our citizens down the path of 
self-sufficiency by developing their leadership skills, educational 
skills, job skills, and fostering their health and well-being in a 
culturally appropriate way. The return on this investment is measured 
by the increased number of Tribal citizens and descendants entering 
higher education and earning degrees, the composition of our growing 
workforce with over 80% comprised of Tribal citizens, descendants, and 
other Natives, participation in cultural preservation classes that 
instill a sense of pride in our people to create marketable products 
that are sold through the Tribe's retail outlet.

    Tribal Priorities, National and Regional Requests and 
Recommendations for the IHS:

    1. $2.9 billion to Support Current Services

    2. $1 billion for Purchased and Referred Care

    3. $82 million for Behavioral Health Mental and Alcohol and 
Substance Abuse

    $2.9 billion--Support Current Services--The Federal trust 
obligation requires significant investment in Tribal healthcare 
systems. To maintain current services, factors such as the inflationary 
rate, pay costs, contract support costs, population growth and staffing 
needs for recently constructed facilities all need to be fully funded. 
When these mandatory factors are not funded, Tribes must supplement 
programs with their own limited revenue, or chose between limiting 
services or shutting down services completely.
    $1 billion--Purchased and Referred Care (PRC)--PRC funds are used 
to purchase essential health care services, including inpatient and 
outpatient care, routine emergency ambulatory care, transportation, and 
medical support services, such as diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, 
laboratory, nutrition, and pharmacy services. PRC funds are extremely 
important to the Portland Area Tribes because the Portland Area lacks 
hospitals and specialty care centers, so Tribes in the Northwest are 
forced to turn to the private sector to fulfill this need.
    $82 million--Behavioral Health Mental and Alcohol and Substance 
Abuse -The Jamestown Healing Clinic will provide a holistic approach to 
treatment for those who suffer from opioid use disorders through the 
provision of wrap-around services, to include, primary care, dental 
services, transportation to and from the clinic, employment, housing, 
and other associated needs.
    The Jamestown S'Klallam Tribes supports the National and Regional 
Tribal Organizations requests for FY 2024. Thank you.

          Prepared Statement of the Kalispel Tribe of Indians
Summary of Budget Requests:

I.  Bureau of Indian Affairs, Trust--Real Estate Services--Increase 
        base funding for Tribes whose land base has changed since 1995.

II.  Bureau of Indian Affairs, Trust--Real Estate Services--Provide 
        Real Estate Services funding to support backlogged, inaccurate, 
        and expired easements, surveys, and leases

III. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Safety & Justice--Increase 
        funding for Criminal Investigation & Policing Services

IV. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Safety & Justice--Provide 
        additional funding for Detention/Correction Services

V.  Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Safety & Justice--Increase funding 
        to expand Tribal access to Fire Protection Services Tribal 
        Priority Allocation base funding.

    The Kalispel Tribe of Indians' (``Kalispel'' or ``Tribe'') 
aboriginal territory spanned over 2.3 million acres or about twice the 
size of Delaware. The territory follows the Pend Oreille and Clark Fork 
Rivers throughout present-day northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, 
and western Montana. Today, our Tribe resides on a 4,600-acre 
Reservation located along the Pend Oreille River near Usk in 
northeastern Washington State with an additional area of Reservation in 
Airway Heights.
    These 4,600 acres are essential to who we are as a Tribal Nation. 
These are the lands President Woodrow Wilson designated as our 
Reservation by Executive Order in 1914. This was the substantially 
reduced land base assigned to us after we refused to submit to Isaac 
Stevens' treaty negotiations or demands--first as an Indian agent and 
after as the territorial governor, a testament to the fact that the 
Kalispel people will not be separated from them.
    Since 1991, Kalispel has worked strategically to build a stronger, 
more resilient community with healthy Tribal Members through the 
development of economic opportunities, and the preservation of forests 
and other natural resources. These initiatives have allowed the Tribe 
to expand services for Tribal Members and our neighbors in Usk. The 
Tribe provides health services, natural resources management, fire 
protection, and law enforcement services with very little support from 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (``BIA'').
    Historically, the Kalispel Tribe has delivered services when the 
Federal Government has failed to deliver. Over the last three decades, 
the BIA has treated the Kalispel Tribe inequitably compared to other 
Tribes in the Northwest. More recently, the BIA Regional Office has 
made changes that negatively impacted the Tribe's access to funding to 
manage and operate Federal programs on the Reservation. Despite the 
lack of funding and services, the Tribe continues to make substantial 
investments in health care services, emergency management, and economic 
development to become a regional leader. If Congress were to increase 
the funding available to Kalispel, the Tribe could continue to support 
our Tribal Member, other Reservation residents needs along with 
regional partners.
    On behalf of the Kalispel Tribe, I appreciate the opportunity and 
respectfully request that the subcommittee strongly consider the 
following funding increases to better support the Kalispel Tribe's 
self-governance and fulfill the Federal Government's trust 
responsibility.

  I. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Trust--Real Estate Services--Increase 
        Base Funding for Tribes Whose Land Base Has Changed Since 1995.

    In recent discussions with BIA, we learned that the 1995 value of 
realty services available to Kalispel was $211. The value in Fiscal 
Year 2023 was $231. This funding level is based solely on the total 
number of the Tribe's trust acres in 1995. Since 1995, Kalispel has 
made significant investments to reacquire property, transfer property 
into trust, and protect individual trust landowners. The lack of 
investment in this line has resulted in trespass and right-of-way 
issues across Tribal and trust property including inaccurate easements, 
surveys, and leases of trust property. If trespass issues are not 
addressed by the BIA, Tribal authority and ownership diminish over time 
and the loss of property and lawful access becomes a reality. These 
land defects and trespasses undermine the Tribe's sovereignty.
    The Tribe was served for many years by a BIA Agency which had two 
(2) full time employees dedicated to Realty issues. When the other 
Tribe served by that agency contracted to provide those services 
themselves, the Kalispel Tribe was left with the $211 worth of 
services.
    The Committee should take action to provide an increase in Real 
Estate Services to protect trust property. Further, the Committee 
should direct the BIA to prioritize distribution of those increases to 
Tribes who have expanded their land base, instead of using historical 
bases that do not represent current Tribal landholdings. The BIA's 
current practice enshrines past funding systems that detrimentally 
impacted the Kalispel and will continue to detrimentally impact my 
people.

  II. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Safety & Justice--Increase 
        Funding for Criminal Investigation & Policing Services

    The Kalispel Tribe directly through their Public Safety Department, 
and through direct contracts, provides law enforcement, fire 
protection, and emergency medical services to residents and businesses 
of the entire Reservation, surrounding communities, and Tribal 
businesses. This department serves everyone from Tribal Members on the 
Reservation in Usk to apartment complex residents in Airway Heights, as 
well as patrons of all Tribal businesses. Recently the Tribe had to 
contract with a local agency at the rate of over $400,000 per year to 
provide fire and emergency medical services to the Tribal Reservation 
and trust land in Airway Heights. The Kalispel Law Enforcement 
Department is partially funded through a BIA Indian Self-Determination 
and Education Assistance Act contract. The funding provided from the 
BIA only supports twenty-seven (27) commissioned officers between the 
two sites--Usk and Airway Heights--which are separated by over sixty 
(60) miles of mostly rural highway. This can result in no officers left 
on a shift on the Usk Reservation and a limited number available for 
Kalispel Tribal residents, economic enterprises, and non-Indian 
residents, visitors, and customers.
    Maintaining this limited force is increasingly difficult because 
the BIA has not received any pay cost support for law enforcement 
officers, leaving the Tribe without the ability to pay competitive 
wages for the area. This funding must also support all capital costs 
and regular maintenance for police vehicles, buildings, and equipment. 
Most importantly for a division like that of Kalispel's is the need to 
regularly replace and maintain a motor vehicle pool for law enforcement 
officers that must travel large distances between the two Reservations. 
The current funding provided from the BIA to cover all equipment 
maintenance and fuel is less than $40,000 annually. Without additional 
funding, Kalispel will lose traction in recruiting and retaining 
officers, resulting in more risk to the safety of those officers in the 
field due to insufficient vehicle maintenance and equipment safety.

  III. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Safety & Justice--Provide 
        Additional Funding for Detention/Correction Services

    Lack of local detention services also creates a significant 
personnel challenge for the Kalispel Police Department because the BIA 
only provides support for detention services at the Wellpinit Adult 
Detention Center. Transportation to the Wellpinit Detention Center is 
at a least a four-hour trip, leaving Kalispel with limited force, 
sometimes during an inmate transport there are no officers on duty on 
the Reservation. The BIA historically contracted with local county 
facilities to provide detention services for Kalispel. However, the BIA 
recently unilaterally ended those contracts, which now requires 
significantly more transports to Wellpinit, without additional 
maintenance or fuel cost support to Kalispel. Unfortunately, this is 
the only BIA detention center in the region, leaving no services for 
juvenile incarceration. The detention center is often in a State of 
disrepair leaving portions of it unsafe for inmates and reducing the 
availability of detention services. While the instances of juvenile 
incarceration are rare, the BIA Office of Justice Services does not 
have a readily available solution should a serious case arise. Kalispel 
asks that Congress increase the funds available for detention services, 
and that new increases are distributed to those Tribes without BIA-
operated detention services. If increases are provided, Kalispel, and 
similarly positioned Tribes, can contract the services needed closer to 
their highest need areas and increase efficiency for their Police 
Division.

  IV. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Safety & Justice--Increase 
        Funding to Expand Tribal Access to Fire Protection Services 
        Tribal Priority Allocation Base Funding.

    The Kalispel Public Safety Division also includes fire protections 
services for the entire Reservation and all Tribal properties. Kalispel 
provides these fire services without any support from the BIA. These 
services are vital for the safety of people and property across the 
Tribe. The distance between the Tribe's Reservation locations in Usk 
and Airway Heights requires two different fire stations with three fire 
suppression units. In addition to servicing the Reservation, Kalispel 
also coordinates with surrounding communities to coordinate and provide 
services in response to emergencies. Kalispel urges this subcommittee 
to consider increasing funds for Fire Protection, specifically for 
those Tribes providing this service to reservations and trust property 
without any support from the BIA. Increases in this funding would allow 
Kalispel to plan capital equipment purchases and regular maintenance of 
equipment, in addition to compensation for Fire Protection employees.
    We hope that you will consider the above recommendations. We 
appreciate the partnership this subcommittee has shown to Tribes. We 
look forward to working with you and others to ensure that the Federal 
Government upholds the trust responsibility.

    Our aboriginal territory spanned over 2.3 million acres or about 
twice the size of Delaware. The territory followed the Pend Oreille and 
Clark Fork Rivers throughout present-day northeastern Washington, 
northern Idaho, and western Montana. Today, our Tribe resides on a 
4,600-acre Reservation located along the Pend Oreille River near Usk 
and Cusick in northeastern Washington state with an additional area of 
Reservation in Airway Heights.
    These 4,600 aces are the center of our universe. These are the 
lands we clung to after the arrival of homesteaders and that we refused 
to negotiate over when Isaac Stevens-first as the Indian agent and 
later as the territorial governor-came to discuss a treaty with the 
United States. We view President Woodrow Wilson's designation of these 
lands as our Reservation by Executive Order in 1914 as a testament to 
the fact that the Kalispel people will not be separated from them.
    Since 1991, Kalispel has worked strategically to build a stronger, 
more resilient community with healthy Tribal citizens through the 
development of economic opportunities, and the preservation of forests 
and other natural resources. These initiatives have allowed the Tribe 
to expand services for Tribal members and our neighbors in Usk and 
Cusick. Today, the Tribe provides health care services, natural 
resources management, fire protection, and law enforcement services 
with very little support from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the 
Indian Health Service.
    Historically, the Kalispel Tribe has delivered services when the 
Federal Government has failed to deliver. Over the last three decades, 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has treated the Kalispel Tribe 
inequitably compared to other Tribes in the Northwest. More recently, 
the BIA Regional Office has made changes that negatively impact the 
Tribe's access to funding to manage and operate Federal programs on the 
Reservation. Despite the lack of funding and services, the Tribe has 
made investments in health care services, emergency management, and 
economic development to become a regional leader. If Congress were to 
increase funding or make funding available to Kalispel, the Tribe could 
continue to support members' needs with regional partners.
    On behalf of the Kalispel Tribe, I appreciate the opportunity to 
submit this testimony and respectfully request that the subcommittee 
strongly consider the following funding increases to better support the 
Kalispel Tribe's self-governance and fulfill the Federal Government's 
trust responsibility.
bureau of indian affairs, public safety & justice--increase funding for 
               criminal investigation & policing services
    The Kalispel Tribal Public Safety Division provides law 
enforcement, fire protection, and emergency medical services to 
residents and businesses of the entire Reservation, surrounding 
communities, and Tribal businesses. This department serves everyone 
from Tribal members in Usk to apartment complex residents in Airway 
Heights, as well as patrons of all Tribal businesses. The Kalispel Law 
Enforcement Division is partially funded through a BIA Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act contract. The funding 
provided from the BIA only supports 24 commissioned officers between 
the two sites--Usk and Airway Heights--which are separated by over 60 
miles of mostly rural highway. This results in just five officers 
during a single shift for all Kalispel Tribal residents, economic 
enterprises, and non-Indian visitors and customers. Maintaining this 
limited force is increasingly difficult because the BIA has not 
received any pay cost support for law enforcement officers, leaving the 
Tribe without the ability to pay competitive wages for the area. This 
funding must also support all capital costs and regular maintenance for 
police vehicles, buildings, and equipment. Most importantly for a 
division like that of Kalispel's is the need to regularly replace and 
maintain a motor vehicle pool for law enforcement officers. The current 
funding provided from the BIA to cover all equipment maintenance and 
fuel is less than $40,000 annually. Without additional funding, 
Kalispel will lose traction in recruiting and retaining officers, 
resulting in more risk to the safety of those officers in the field due 
to insufficient vehicle maintenance and equipment safety.
 bureau of indian affairs, public safety & justice--provide additional 
               funding for detention/correction services
    Lack of local detention services also creates a significant 
personnel challenge for the Kalispel Police Department because the BIA 
only provides support for detention services at the Wellpinit Adult 
Detention Center. Transportation to the Wellpinit Detention Center is 
at a least a four-hour trip, leaving Kalispel with a total force of no 
more than four officers during an inmate transport. The BIA 
historically contracted with local county facilities to provide 
detention services for Kalispel. However, the BIA recently unilaterally 
ended those contracts, which now requires significantly more transports 
to Wellpinit, without additional maintenance or fuel cost support to 
Kalispel. Unfortunately, this is the only BIA detention center in the 
region, leaving no services for juvenile incarceration. The detention 
center is often in a State of disrepair leaving portions of it unsafe 
for inmates and reducing the availability of detention services. While 
the instances of juvenile incarceration are rare, the BIA Office of 
Justice Services does not have a readily available solution should a 
serious case arise. Kalispel asks that Congress increase the funds 
available for detention services, and that new increases are 
distributed to those Tribes without BIA-operated detention services. If 
increases are provided, Kalispel, and similarly positioned Tribes, can 
contract the services needed closer to their highest need areas and 
increase efficiency for their Police Division.
bureau of indian affairs, public safety & justice--increase funding to 
   expand tribal access to fire protection services tribal priority 
                        allocation base funding
    The Kalispel Public Safety Division also includes fire protections 
services for the entire Reservation and all Tribal properties. Kalispel 
provides these fire services without any support from the BIA. These 
services are vital for the safety of people and property across the 
Tribe. The distance between the Tribe's Reservation locations in Usk 
and Airway Heights requires two different fire stations with three fire 
suppression units. In addition to servicing the Reservation, Kalispel 
also coordinates with surrounding communities to coordinate and provide 
services in response to emergency. Kalispel urges this subcommittee to 
consider increasing funds for Fire Protection, specifically for those 
Tribes providing this service to Reservations and Trust property 
without any support from the BIA. Increases in this funding would allow 
Kalispel to plan capital equipment purchases and regular maintenance of 
equipment, in addition to compensation for Fire Protection employees.
  bureau of indian affairs, public safety & justice--increase tribal 
                courts funding for public law 280 states
    The State of Washington exercises limited jurisdiction over 
Kalispel Tribal members, requiring the Federal and Kalispel Tribal 
Governments to fill the gaps. However, the BIA does not provide 
consistent funding for Tribal Courts within Public Law 280 States, like 
Washington, nor does it provide services directly. Therefore Kalispel, 
and other similarly positioned Tribes, are forced to fund the costs of 
a Tribal Court without Federal support. Kalispel has managed to support 
Court services in Usk and Airway Heights using Federal competitive 
grants and economic development funding. Recurring funding through the 
BIA would provide a base for operations and allow the Tribe to address 
civil and criminal dockets more readily. It would also allow for 
capital improvements necessary to appropriately provide judicial 
services.
    Bureau of Indian Affairs, Trust--Real Estate Services--Provide Real 
Estate Services Funding to Support Backlogged, Inaccurate, and Expired 
Easements, Surveys, and Leases In the last several years, the Kalispel 
Tribe has identified numerous rights-of-way in trespass across Tribal 
and Trust property. The Kalispel Planning Department has shared their 
concerns regarding inaccurate easements, surveys, and leases of Trust 
Property with the agency and region, but no additional funding or 
immediate action has been taken to resolve trespass issues. If trespass 
issues are not addressed by the BIA, Tribal authority and ownership 
diminish over time and the loss of property and lawful access becomes a 
reality. These land defects and trespasses undermine the Tribe's 
sovereignty. Kalispel asks that Congress fund Real Estate Services so 
that the Tribe can correct decades of BIA neglect.
    Indian Health Service, Clinical Service--Increase Funding for 
Purchased/Referred Care The Kalispel Tribe receives funding from Indian 
Health Service (IHS) to provide valuable health services for Tribal and 
Non-Tribal members in Usk and Airway Heights. The Kalispel Compact 
transfers funding for basic administrative and behavioral health 
services, public health nursing, and purchased/referred care (PRC). The 
Tribe has grown this funding to provide primary care, dental services, 
aquatic physical therapy, and naturopathic services for Tribal and 
community members. Kalispel is one of just a handful of providers that 
accept Washington Medicaid and Medicare for dental services, keeping 
the dental clinic very busy. While Kalispel has experienced success 
providing community-based services, there remains a significant need 
for additional funding to provide services that the Tribe cannot 
provide directly. The Portland Area is one of the only IHS areas in the 
Nation without a single IHS or Tribal hospital. Therefore, Kalispel and 
other Tribes in the Area are PRC dependent. The incremental increases 
to PRC have provided additional support in the wake of COVID-19, but 
the need to support long-term COVID disorders and other complications 
has not yet been realized. Therefore, Kalispel asks that this 
subcommittee continue to provide increases so that Tribes do not leave 
patients without access to critical health services and support.
 bureau of indian affairs & indian health service, payments for tribal 
      leases--maintain indefinite appropriation for 105(l) leases
    Like many other Tribes, Kalispel believes that 105(l) Leases 
provide critical maintenance and operation support for former Federal 
programs. Indefinite appropriations for these leases support Tribal 
self-determination and acknowledge Tribal investments in the operation 
of Federal programs. Kalispel appreciates the work this subcommittee 
has done to support Tribal self- determination and urges the 
subcommittee to maintain access to these funds.
    We hope that you will consider the above recommendations. We 
appreciate the partnership this subcommittee has shown to Tribes. We 
look forward to working with you and others to ensure that the Federal 
Government upholds the trust responsibility.

                                 ______
                                 
       Prepared Statement of the Land and Water Conservation Fund
    Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony in support of 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) in the FY 2024 Interior 
Appropriations Bill, as a spokesperson on behalf of the LWCF Coalition. 
As a broad coalition of sportsmen, veterans, business, recreation, 
historic preservation and conservation leaders concerned with America's 
outdoor heritage, we support LWCF as our Nation's most important 
conservation and recreation program, delivering an array of benefits 
from protecting drinking water and conserving natural infrastructure, 
to providing landscape conservation, habitat protection, and outdoor 
recreation access for all. The program and its many benefits are 
critical to preserving America's most treasured landscapes for future 
generations. However, LWCF needs increased investment in Fiscal Year 
2024 to address all the outstanding conservation and recreation 
priorities across the country.
    Investments in LWCF support public land conservation and ensure 
access to the outdoors for all Americans, in rural communities and 
cities alike. It has created outdoor recreation opportunities in every 
State and 98 percent of counties across the country, opening up key 
areas for hunting, fishing, and other recreational access; supporting 
working forests and ranches; and acquiring inholdings and protecting 
critical lands in national parks, national wildlife refuges, national 
forests, Civil War battlefields, and other Federal areas. Our federal, 
State, and local public lands represent a critical economic asset and a 
smart investment. The parks, trails, forests, rivers, wildlife refuges, 
battlefields, historic sites, and working lands sustained by LWCF 
funding support an outdoor recreation and tourism sector that 
contributes a total of $1.06 trillion annually to the American economy, 
supporting 9.4 million jobs (1 out of every 15 jobs in the U.S.).
    We greatly appreciate the FY 2023 Interior, Environment and Related 
Agencies bill's investment in LWCF and urge that in the FY 2024 bill 
you recognize the resounding level of support for LWCF, and the backlog 
of compelling now-or-never conservation and recreation needs in 
communities across America by investing the increased resources needed 
to successfully implement this valuable, time-tested program. We thank 
the subcommittee for its vital work in FY23 to produce a bill with 
strong project oversight and balanced allocations among LWCF 
subprograms according to the formula set down by the Dingell Act: at 
least 40% for Federal agency conservation priorities, at least 40% for 
the suite of LWCF State and local grant programs, and the remaining 20% 
divided between those two sides based on need.
    Just as importantly, by retaining unobligated, prior-year 
discretionary LWCF funds within appropriated programs rather than 
allowing them to be rescinded, the FY23 bill also recognizes that the 
programs under the LWCF umbrella are oversubscribed and that full 
funding of LWCF has not eliminated the backlog of time-sensitive 
conservation and recreation priorities. We appreciate the 
subcommittee's commitment to addressing unmet needs by keeping funds in 
place for viable funded projects within these accounts, and for 
reinvesting them in LWCF program needs through reprogrammings in the 
event specified project needs have changed. With demand continuing to 
outstrip available LWCF funding, we urge you to retain this approach in 
FY24.
    However, there is real, urgent need to look beyond this solid 
foundation of funding for LWCF to meet the current moment of continuing 
rapid nature loss, persistent inequality of access to parks and outdoor 
recreation opportunities, and growing climate impacts. In FY 2024, the 
Biden Administration submitted more than $1.1 billion in LWCF needs in 
its budget request (including $201 million on the ready-to-go 
supplemental project lists), and hundreds of millions more were 
identified during the budget process but left off the final submission 
lists. Overall demand for LWCF is even higher, with many projects on 
the priority lists representing single phases of much larger projects. 
To avoid losing irreplaceable natural and cultural resources, we urge 
the subcommittee to include $450 million in discretionary funding, to 
complement the mandatory allocations provided by the Great American 
Outdoors Act (GAOA), in the FY 2024 Interior appropriations bill.
    Under GAOA, annual revenues covered into the LWCF account since 
FY2021 are dedicated for LWCF expenditure, allowing for increased 
investment in landscape-level conservation, working forests and 
ranchlands, historic and cultural sites, and access to the outdoors for 
all. The legislation left intact the ability of future Congresses to 
appropriate additional discretionary LWCF funds, and over $22 billion 
in prior LWCF receipts remain unspent from the LWCF Special Account in 
the Treasury. Meanwhile, project demand in every State continues to 
outstrip the level set for the program, with many now-or-never 
opportunities at risk.
    LWCF's $900 million level was authorized in 1978, when the 
purchasing power of that amount was more than four times what it is 
today. Since that time, chronic underfunding of LWCF created a backlog 
of unmet conservation and recreation needs and a long line of willing-
seller landowners and community stakeholders clamoring for access to 
these funds. GAOA's dedicated funding can begin to address these 
critical needs; to more fully address urgent conservation priorities 
and inequities, additional targeted investment is needed from the 
unobligated balances of the LWCF Special Account.
    Now is the time for America to make significant progress towards 
its conservation goals, to address longstanding disparities in equal 
access to the benefits of nature for underserved communities, and to 
avoid loss of sensitive lands and waters. We urge you to consider an 
investment of $450 million in discretionary funds, in addition to 
mandatory LWCF funding, be part of the subcommittee's legislation in FY 
2024 to support the numerous ready-to-go project opportunities. To 
maintain the strength of the land management agencies and the integrity 
of their overall work, we ask that these additional LWCF funds be 
provided to augment the budgets of these agencies, and not diminish 
other necessary operating spending.
    Thank you for your attention to this important program and we look 
forward to working with you to grow investment in conservation and 
recreation across the Nation.

        Prepared Statement of the League of American Orchestras
                    national endowment for the arts
    The League of American Orchestras urges the Senate Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations subcommittee to 
provide no less than $211 million for the National Endowment for the 
Arts in fiscal year 2024, as recommended by President Biden. We are 
grateful for the strong bipartisan support from Senate and House 
Appropriators over the last several years and encourage Congress to 
enable more communities across the country to inspire the next 
generation, provide connectivity, and continue to advance the arts as a 
necessary, creative way to express the full range of what makes us 
human.
    The NEA holds a unique and valuable Federal leadership role through 
direct and indirect grantmaking, cross-cutting research, and convenings 
that facilitate shared learning and advancement among arts 
organizations and practitioners. A direct grant awarded by the National 
Endowment for the Arts is a respected national designation that conveys 
an organization has passed a rigorous panel review and offers an 
artistic engagement worthy of Federal investment. Every orchestra-large 
and small-is a vital part of its local ecology, and those that receive 
an award from the National Endowment for the Arts highly value the 
support in their continual work to enhance the experience of live music 
for people of all ages and respond to community needs. The following 
examples offer a glimpse of recent orchestra-led engagement made 
possible in part by the NEA.
    The Utah Symphony presented Olivier Messiaen's Des canyons aux 
etoiles (From the Canyons to the Stars) at O.C. Tanner Amphitheater in 
Springdale, Utah this past June, with assistance from a Grants for Arts 
Projects award. This marked a rare opportunity for a capacity audience 
of more than 1,600 people from across the State-many driving hundreds 
of miles-to hear this monumental 12-movement work performed outside in 
one of the settings that inspired the composer. Maestro Thierry Fischer 
emphasized how fitting it was for the Utah Symphony to showcase its 
artistry with music that arose out of the composer's spiritual 
experiences stirred by the landscapes, night skies, and bird life of 
Zion and Bryce national parks and Cedar Breaks National Monument. ``It 
will be incredibly unique to hear Messiaen's music performed... by 
musicians who live in, know, and love the natural beauty of Utah,'' 
said Maestro Fischer when announcing the concert. This performance was 
one of the highlights in a multi-year vision introducing Utah audiences 
to the works of 20th and 21st-century composers, focused on music 
animated by nature and celebrating the natural beauty of Utah and its 
power to inspire.
    Also bringing music outdoors is The Jackson Symphony, which 
received an NEA Challenge America grant for its ``Symphony On the 
Move'' program. Eight communities across six counties in West Tennessee 
will enjoy free hour-long concerts along the theme of ``A Musical 
Journey Around the World.'' This year's theme informs not only the 
musical performances but is also designed in partnership with local 
schools and libraries to complement the summer read program. The 
ensemble itself will include six professional Jackson Symphony 
musicians and one local vocalist. Together, they will perform works of 
international composers and representing the diverse populations of 
Tennessee. Concerts will be performed in town squares, parks, and local 
gathering areas in each town, amplifying a sense of community and 
togetherness in each location. To date, the Jackson Symphony has 
performed more than 50 of these Symphony On the Move concerts, and in 
recognition of the limited ability of many Tennesseans to travel to a 
performance, this NEA support will directly assist in the orchestra's 
mission to bring the live music experience to more Tennesseans.
    Performing in wider parts of its state is also a priority for the 
Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra (FWSO)-the only professional symphony 
orchestra in Tarrant County. One of the ways the FWSO has historically 
achieved its goal of providing its community with equitable 
opportunities to access classical music is through its Statewide 
Touring Initiative, which brings live performances of classical music 
and engaging music education programs to adults and children living in 
rural areas of Texas. In fiscal year 2022, the FWSO received an NEA 
Grants for Arts Projects award to support this initiative and put that 
funding toward its tour to rural communities in North Texas such as: 
Glen Rose, Graham, Granbury, Keller, Stephenville, and Waxahachie. In 
each of these places, the FWSO performed a combination of educational 
concerts-designed to address cross-curricular goals and meet the Texas 
Essential Knowledge and Skills State educational standards-and free or 
reduced-cost evening concerts in familiar venues that residents of the 
communities could easily access.
    Picking up on the theme of both touring and engaging young people, 
the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra's Young People's Concert Tour 
introduces students to new music using a familiar genre that grabs 
their attention and creates a bond among the artist, conductor and the 
orchestra. Grammy nominated Progressive Hip-Hop Artist Christylez 
Bacon, in collaboration with composer Evan Meier and music director 
John Devlin, will perform Migrations in Rhythm that explores the 
progression of hip-hop from its beginnings. Christylez will perform 
lyrics and beat-box with orchestral accompaniments for 5,000 elementary 
students and their teachers from public, private and home-schools in 
West Virginia counties of Ohio, Marshall, and Brooke; Ohio counties of 
Belmont and Jefferson; and Washington County, Pennsylvania. With 
support from the NEA, free concerts will be performed in three school 
auditoriums in mid-April 2023, and to reach even more students in West 
Virginia, the performance will be filmed and distributed to students in 
school districts unable to travel the distance to attend one of the 
concerts in person. Using the Teacher's Guide prepared by the president 
of the WV Music Educators' Conference, teachers in each school will 
prepare students to attend the concert.
    The Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) is responding to both 
young people and adults in its NEA-supported expansion of its Care & 
Wellness Initiative. This arts accessibility program is built around 
addressing barriers due to health or disability status. Now in its 
second year, the Care and Wellness Initiative brings RPO musicians to 
hospitals, memory care units, special education centers, and more to 
bring appropriate, therapeutic performances directly to individuals who 
otherwise may not have access to live performance. This year the 
Philharmonic is mounting its first-ever Sensory-Friendly Concert for 
children and families with sensory challenges such as Autism spectrum 
disorder. Planned accommodations include noise-reduction headphones, 
``quiet rooms'' for those who are overstimulated or otherwise need a 
break, preparatory materials for families such as a social narrative, 
and adaptive concert etiquette. The orchestra anticipates that more 
than 1,250 individuals will be able to access and experience the RPO 
and live music through this initiative in 2023.
    Part of how orchestras respond to community is to utilize the art 
form to share the deep connection between music and historically 
significant events. The Portland Symphony Orchestra's Grants for Arts 
Project award contributed toward the production of a Concerts of 
Remembrance project last October which consisted of performances as 
well as exhibitions of more than 60 instruments from Violins of Hope. 
The exhibitions, which took place at the Maine Jewish Museum (MJM) in 
Portland and the Holocaust and Human Rights Center (HHRC) in Augusta, 
shared stories about the musical instruments and the Jewish people to 
whom they belonged before they were confiscated by the Nazis before and 
during World War II. Principal string players of the orchestra 
performed on instruments from this collection, offering free string 
quartet concerts of music by Jewish composers at MJM and HHRC. The PSO 
also offered performances and education programs at three area schools, 
reaching between 800-1,000 students in all. Lastly, the full symphony, 
along with Choral Art, gave two performances of Verdi's Requiem, which 
was made available for viewing on PSO TV throughout the month of 
November. These Requiem performances brought this poignant programming 
to more than 2,000 people, with an additional 1,000 viewers of the 
digital concert.
    The New Haven Symphony Orchestra (NHSO) is similarly planning to 
engage its audiences with music informed by historically and culturally 
significant events. Its NEA-supported program will focus on works by 
one contemporary and three historic Black composers: Margaret Bonds's 
Montgomery Variations (1964) was inspired by the civil rights movement; 
Florence Price's 1934 Piano Concerto in One Movement incorporates 
spirituals as well as the Juba, a dance originated by enslaved people; 
Helen Hagan's 1912 Concerto in C Minor has been re-orchestrated to 
intersperse Ragtime into a late Romantic style; and contemporary 
composer Quinn Mason describes A Joyous Trilogy as ``the very 
embodiment of happiness.'' Pianist Michelle Cann will join the Symphony 
for this performance. In addition to the performances at Lyman Center 
for the Performing Arts, free concerts will be held in community venues 
throughout New Haven featuring the orchestra's Harmony quartet and 
soprano Lisa Williamson, and will include opportunities for community 
artists to perform.
    The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra (SPCO) is also using music as a 
means to highlight important issues of our time, past and present-
focusing in particular on people who were not fully acknowledged in 
their own time. An NEA grant will assist the orchestra in highlighting 
several women in the field of classical music as part of the SPCO's 
larger efforts to include more historically underrepresented artists in 
its performance repertoire. Curated and led by Artistic Partner Tabea 
Zimmermann and SPCO musicians Maureen Nelson and Eunae Koh, the project 
additionally celebrates women in music leadership roles. A combination 
of 18 performances will showcase 6 women composers: Clara Schumann, 
Valborg Aulin, Hilary Tann, Louise Farrenc, Gabriela Lena Frank, and 
Fanny Mendelssohn-Hensel. In culmination, SPCO flautist Alicia 
McQuerrey will deliver a solo performance of Amy Beech. Delivering on 
the SPCO's mission of serving as many in the community as possible, 
performances will take place at 10 venues across the Minneapolis/Saint 
Paul Metro Area, and one program will be livestreamed for free.
    Thank you for this opportunity to share how the National Endowment 
for the Arts supports orchestras' engagement with their communities. 
These grants, and many others throughout the country, make a tremendous 
difference by helping orchestras provide employment to musicians and 
staff while fulfilling their core purpose of educating and serving. We 
applaud the NEA's consistent leadership in promoting public engagement 
with all forms of art and for its responsiveness to both present and 
future concerns for the sector. With Congressional support for an 
annual appropriation of at least $211 million for the National 
Endowment for the Arts in FY2024, more communities throughout our 
Nation will be able to experience the life-changing and affirming 
benefits of the arts.
    The League of American Orchestras leads, supports, and champions 
America's orchestras and the vitality of the music they perform. Its 
diverse membership of more than 1,800 organizations and individuals 
across North America runs the gamut from world-renowned orchestras to 
community groups, from summer festivals to student and youth ensembles, 
from conservatories to libraries, from businesses serving orchestras to 
individuals who love symphonic music. A national organization dedicated 
solely to the orchestral experience, the League is a nexus of knowledge 
and innovation, advocacy, and leadership advancement. Its conferences 
and events, award-winning Symphony magazine, website, and other 
publications inform people around the world about orchestral activity 
and developments. Founded in 1942 and chartered by Congress in 1962, 
the League links a national network of thousands of instrumentalists, 
conductors, managers and administrators, board members, volunteers, and 
business partners.

    Prepared Statement of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians
Summary of Budget Requests:

  I. Bureau of Indian Affairs--Increase ``Aid to Tribal Government 
        (TPA)'' funding

  II. Bureau of Indian Affairs--Increase ``Indian Child Welfare Act 
        (TPA)'' funding

  III. Indian Health Service--Increase ``Purchased/Referred Care'' 
        funding

  IV. Indian Health Service--Support for ``Accreditation Emergencies'' 
        Funding

    Greetings Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Honorable 
Members of the subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies. My name is Gerald Gray and I am honored to serve as Chairman 
of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians. Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide written testimony regarding the Tribe's Fiscal 
Year (``FY'') 2024 funding priorities within the subcommittee's 
jurisdiction.
    Little Shell Tribal members became eligible for services provided 
by the Indian Health Service (``IHS'') and the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(``BIA'') after enactment of the Little Shell Restoration Act in 
December 2019. Following restoration, these two Federal agencies 
requested specific funding to support Little Shell--essentially setting 
base funding for any future inflationary or appropriated increases. In 
FY 2024, the Tribe's funding will transition from ``New Tribes'' 
funding to ``Aid to Tribal Government.'' While the Tribe never received 
adequate ``New Tribes'' funding to meet the demands of our expanding 
government and growing population, it is critical to ensure that future 
allocations meet the Tribe's basic governmental needs.
   i. bureau of indian affairs--increase ``aid to tribal government 
                            (tpa)'' funding
    When a Tribe is recognized or restored to Federal recognition, the 
BIA requests additional funding for the newly recognized Tribe through 
the ``New Tribes'' program. The amount requested customarily becomes 
the base funding for the newly recognized tribe-essentially the amount 
the Tribe will receive every year going forward. ``New Tribes'' funding 
was designed to provide newly acknowledged Tribes with funding and 
assistance in initiating federally funded operations by strengthening 
Tribal government systems. New Tribes \1\ receive assistance under the 
program for 3 years, then funding for those Tribes is transferred to 
the ``Aid to Tribal Government'' program so that they may begin to 
establish program and funding priorities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The term ``new Tribes'' is meant only to reflect Tribes that 
are in the New Tribes funding line. Tribes cannot be new or created, 
only acknowledged. They have existed since time immemorial.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Prior to FY 1997, the amount of ``New Tribes'' funding received by 
newly recognized Tribes varied greatly. New Tribes would assess their 
needs, design, or propose operational programs to meet their needs, and 
submit proposed budgets to implement the proposed programs. In FY 1996 
alone, this led to newly recognized Tribes receiving amounts as small 
as $127,000 and as large as $1.492 million in ``New Tribes'' funding. 
In FY 1997, the ``New Tribes'' funding methodology was simplified by 
providing $160,000 in base funding for new Tribes with less than 1,500 
members and $320,000 to Tribes with a population of 1,501 to 3,000 
members. The funding level for new Tribes with more than 3,000 members 
was to be determined on a case- by-case basis.
    In FY 2011, the population component of the methodology was 
slightly changed moving from 1,500 to 1,700 members for the $160,000 
base level funding and 1,701 to 3,000 for the $320,000 funding level. 
The funding level for Tribes with over 3,000 members would still be 
determined on a case-by-case basis. This policy appears to have 
remained in place for the six Virginia Tribes recognized by Congress in 
January 2018.
    The Little Shell Tribe, with a Tribal membership of approximately 
6,300 members, qualifies for the ``case-by-case'' determination under 
the BIA's longstanding policy. Under the current methodology, Tribes 
with 1,701 to 3,000 members receive $320,000, which equals to a range 
of $106.66 to $188.12 per Tribal member. According to this methodology, 
the Little Shell Tribe's ``New Tribes'' allocation should be in the 
range of $671,000 to $1.18 million annually. However, in FY 2023, the 
Tribe only received $480,000 in ``New Tribes'' funding, which is 
hindering the Tribe's ability to operate its government.
    As the Tribe now transitions to receive funding for centralized 
government functions under the ``Aid to Tribal Government'' program, it 
is critically important to provide the Little Shell Tribe with adequate 
funding. In addition, Aid to Tribal Government funds have the broadest 
flexibility for Tribes to leverage in government operations. The Tribe 
strongly recommends that BIA prioritize funding to this program 
precisely because of its flexibility and because all Tribes would 
benefit from a programmatic increase. The Little Shell Tribe requests 
that the subcommittee provide, at a minimum, a $1.18 million increase 
in the Aid to Tribal Government program to provide the Tribe with the 
resources necessary to provide basic governmental services to its 
Tribal citizens.
   ii. bureau of indian affairs--increase ``indian child welfare act 
                            (tpa)'' funding
    Enacted in 1978 to help prevent the separation of Indian families 
and provide for family reunification, the Indian Child Welfare Act 
(``ICWA'') has been an invaluable tool for Tribes. Given that the 
Little Shell Tribe was reacknowledged by the Federal Government only 3 
years ago, we have missed out on countless opportunities to achieve the 
goals of ICWA. Since becoming eligible to utilize ICWA, the Tribe has 
initiated work to develop a Tribal ICWA code, retained an attorney to 
support ICWA activities, responded to hundreds of ICWA requests from 
many state ICWA agencies, and actively engaged in several ICWA case in 
Montana and Idaho.
    While the Tribe has identified resources to provide these services 
from non-recurring sources, we urge the subcommittee to increase ICWA 
funding to provide base funding for all Tribes. The current Federal 
funding streams for ICWA programming are sporadic, non-recurring, and 
no single funding source provides adequate assistance to support an 
entire Tribal ICWA program. This has caused the Little Shell Tribe to 
worry each year on how it will secure the required funding to ensure 
that Little Shell Tribal children are being protected.
    The Little Shell Tribe continues to build up its Tribal ICWA 
programming to protect the Tribe's culture and heritage by maintaining 
Tribal member connections to customs, traditions, and community. The 
Tribe would like to continue to grow and establish the necessary 
support and assistance to Little Shell Tribal children in the foster 
care system. Through the fundamentals of ICWA, the Little Shell Tribe 
is focused on preserving our cultural values and promoting stable 
placements of Little Shell children in loving, permanent homes, 
connected to their families and our culture.
   iii. indian health service--increase ``purchased/referred care'' 
                                funding
    Purchased/Referred Care (``PRC'') is typically used to purchase 
private care in areas where IHS does not provide services directly or 
when IHS provided care is not sufficient to meet patient needs. 
However, in FY 2021 the Little Shell Tribe asked and the IHS agreed to 
provide direct service care using the Tribe's PRC allocation, as 
allowed under the PRC regulations. The Little Shell Tribe acquired, 
renovated, and equipped a new health clinic for IHS to provide direct 
care in the four-county service area in late 2021.
    In FY 2021, IHS requested $2.560 million in Purchased/Referred Care 
funding ``to fund direct health care services'' for the Little Shell 
Tribe. IHS received the requested amount in FY 2021 and in FY 2022 for 
Little Shell. In FY 2022, IHS received $2.917 million for services, a 
slight increase due to this subcommittee's support for the program. The 
President's FY 2024 budget requests calls for $1.17 billion for 
Purchased/Referred Care, which is an increase of $181 million above the 
FY 2023 enacted level. It is critical that Congress provide a 
substantial increase for Purchased/Referred Care in the FY 2024 bill to 
meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native patients, including 
Little Shell patients.
    IHS has been a good partner in establishing appropriate direct care 
services within the service area in collaboration with Little Shell. 
However, IHS has limited authority to budget appropriated PRC funds to 
reflect common IHS operating lines, such as Hospital and Health Clinic, 
Dental Health, Mental Health, etc. This makes it challenging for 
Congress and Little Shell Tribal leadership to track how and if health 
priorities of the community are met. More importantly, it does not 
accurately capture the Service Unit operational status. The Little 
Shell Tribe also requests that IHS be given the flexibility to create 
operational budgets within the PRC line item that accurately reflect 
day-to-day operations of those facilities like to those of the Little 
Shell Service Unit.
   iv. indian health service--support ``accreditation emergencies'' 
                                funding
    Finally, Little Shell requests support for the Accreditation 
Emergencies Funding. While Little Shell Service Unit is in operation, 
it has not yet initiated the accreditation process. There are no 
existing concerns for patient safety or operational concerns. However, 
Little Shell acknowledges that accreditation ensures that regular 
safety protocol and standard operating procedures are observed by all 
staff. Access to these funds would ensure that the Little Shell Service 
Unit provides the highest standard of care.
    On behalf of the Little Shell Tribe, I would like to thank the 
subcommittee for the opportunity to share our funding priorities for FY 
2024.

 Prepared Statement of Medical Library Association and Association of 
                   Academic Health Sciences Libraries
    I, Mary M. Langman, Director, Information Issues and Policy, 
Medical Library Association (MLA), submit this statement on behalf of 
MLA and the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL). 
MLA is a global, nonprofit, educational organization with a membership 
of more than 400 institutions and 2,500 health information 
professionals. AAHSL supports academic health sciences libraries and 
directors to advance the patient care, research, education and 
community service missions of academic health centers through visionary 
executive leadership and expertise in health information, scholarly 
communication, and knowledge management.
    We thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to submit testimony 
supporting appropriations for the National Library of Medicine (NLM), 
an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and recommend 
$521 million for NLM in FY24, a 5% increase. Working in partnership 
with the NIH and other Federal agencies, NLM is a key link in the chain 
that translates the results of research, including data, findable and 
accessible to all who need it. As NLM works to achieve key objectives 
of its Strategic Plan--accelerating data powered discovery and health, 
reaching new users in new ways, and preparing a workforce for a future 
of data-driven research and health--it also supports NIH-wide efforts 
to answer the call to respond to national priorities, close the gap in 
health disparities, and capitalize on fundamental investments. NLM 
accomplishes this through effective preservation of valued scientific 
and data resources, judicious investments in extramural and intramural 
research, informed stewardship of Federal resources, and innovative 
partnerships to align priorities and leverage investments across HHS, 
the Federal Government, and the biomedical research community.
    As health sciences librarians who use NLM's programs and services 
every day, teach others how to use NLM resources, and promote NLM in 
our local communities, we can attest that NLM resources literally save 
lives. Investing in NLM is an investment in good health.
           leveraging nih investments in biomedical research
    NLM's budget supports information services, research, and programs 
that drive the Nation's biomedical research enterprise. In FY24 and 
beyond, NLM's budget must continue to be augmented to support the 
transformation and expansion of its information resources, services, 
research, and programs which collect, organize, and develop new ways to 
make readily accessible rapidly evolving biomedical knowledge resources 
and data. NLM maximizes the return on investment in research conducted 
by the NIH and other organizations. It also makes the results of 
biomedical information and data accessible to researchers, clinicians, 
business innovators, students, and the public, enabling such data and 
information to be used more efficiently and effectively to drive 
innovation and improve health. Rapid growth of data also necessitates 
funding that will ensure long-term sustainability of these valuable 
information resources. NLM is unique because it stimulates and supports 
innovative research in data science and information management that 
transcends specific disease areas and data types. This is especially 
crucial in an era where artificial intelligence algorithms are being 
rapidly developed and integrated into the systems of daily life, 
including healthcare.
    NLM plays a critical role in NIH's data science and open science 
initiatives. Its intramural and extramural research programs develop 
and apply data science techniques to accelerate discovery and improve 
health through all stages of life. `` In support of open science, NLM 
collaborates across NIH and the Federal Government to accelerate public 
access to federally funded research results through PMC and other 
relevant NLM data repositories. ``
    NLM builds, sustains, and augments a suite of almost 200 databases 
which provide information access to health professionals, researchers, 
educators, and the public. It supports the acquisition, organization, 
preservation, and dissemination of the world's biomedical literature. 
In FY 2022, NLM continued to support sharing of genetic sequence data 
in support of public health response. It launched the SARS-CoV-2 
Variants Overview interactive web resource. This free, open-access tool 
supports the identification of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and 
provides the public health community with valuable information needed 
to guide COVID-19 pandemic research and response efforts. NLM continued 
to support NIH and interagency initiatives to make SARS-CoV-2 and 
COVID-19 sequence data widely available for public health response.
             growing demand for nlm's information services
    Each day, millions of people use NLM websites and download more 
than 115 terabytes of data. Thousands of researchers and businesses 
upload approximately 15 terabytes of data daily. Annually, NLM 
information systems process more than six billion human requests and 
eight billion computer-to-computer interactions. NLM's information 
services help researchers advance scientific discovery and accelerate 
its translation into new therapies; provide health practitioners with 
information that improves medical care and lowers its costs; and give 
the public access to resources and tools that promote wellness and 
disease prevention. Every day, medical librarians across the Nation use 
NLM's services to assist clinicians, students, researchers, and the 
public in accessing information to save lives and improve health. 
Without NLM, our Nation's medical libraries would be unable to provide 
quality information services that our Nation's health professionals, 
educators, researchers and patients increasingly need.
    NLM's data repositories and online integrated services such as 
GenBank, MedlinePlus, dbGaP, MedlinePlus, dbGaP, PubMed, and PubMed 
Central (PMC) are revolutionizing medicine. GenBank is the definitive 
source of gene sequence information. This past year, more than 430 
million users accessed consumer-level information about health topics, 
which contains more than 22,000 links to authoritative health 
information on over 1,000 health topics. PubMed, with nearly 35 million 
references to the biomedical literature, is the world's most heavily 
used source of bibliographic information with almost 3.3 million users 
each day. PubMed Central is NLM's digital archive which provides public 
access to the full-text versions of more than 9 million biomedical 
journal articles, including those produced by NIH-funded researchers. 
In FY22, PubMed Central had an average of 3.2 million unique sessions 
per weekday.
    NLM continually expands biomedical information services to 
accommodate a growing volume of relevant data and information and 
enhances these services to support research and discovery. NLM ensures 
the availability of this information for future generations, making 
books, journals, technical reports, manuscripts, microfilms, 
photographs and images accessible to all Americans, irrespective of 
geography or ability to pay, and guaranteeing that citizens can make 
the best, most informed decisions about their healthcare.
                disseminating clinical trial information
    NLM's ClinicalTrials.gov is the world's largest publicly accessible 
database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies. In FY 2022, 
NLM received registration information for more than 38,000 new clinical 
research studies. NLM also added more than 4,000 new results summaries 
to ClinicalTrials.gov. Making this information visible and accessible 
improves transparency, accountability, and encourages public trust in 
science consistent with legislative requirements. With the support of 
NIH, NLM continued its ClinicalTrials.gov modernization effort and 
launched the first beta release of the modernized ClinicalTrials.gov 
website in FY 2022. This first release of the modernized website 
provides a more responsive design with an updated search experience and 
new study record display. The website also makes information about race 
and ethnicity, sex and gender, and age of participants easier to find 
and access.
partnerships ensuring outreach and engagement in communities across the 
                                 nation
    NLM's outreach programs are essential to the MLA and AAHSL 
membership and to the profession. The NLM coordinates its Network of 
the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) of more than 8,800 academic 
health science libraries, hospital and public libraries, and community 
organizations to improve access to health information for all. Through 
the NNLM, NLM educates medical librarians, health professionals, and 
the general public about its services and provides training in their 
effective use. The NNLM serves the public by promoting educational 
outreach for public libraries, secondary schools, senior centers and 
other consumer settings, and its outreach to underserved populations 
helps reduce health disparities.
    Since May 2018, the NNLM has partnered with the NIH All of Us 
Research Program to support community engagement efforts by United 
States public libraries and to raise awareness about the program. 
Together, NLM and NIH have built the NNLM All of Us Community 
Engagement Network (CEN). The CEN focuses on NNLM's mission to improve 
the public's access to health information and provide awareness of All 
of Us to communities that are Underrepresented in Biomedical Research 
by partnering with libraries across the United States. The CEN is 
designed to leverage the mission of the NNLM to help libraries in 
supporting the health information needs of their users.
    NLM's MedlinePlus provides consumers with trusted, reliable health 
information on 1,000 topics in English and Spanish. It attracts more 
than 1 million visitors daily. NLM continues to enhance MedlinePlus and 
disseminate authoritative information via the website, and social 
media. MedlinePlus and MedlinePlus en Espanol have been optimized for 
easier use on mobile phones and tablets. NIH MedlinePlus Magazine and 
NIH MedlinePlus Salud are available in doctors' offices nationwide, and 
NLM's MedlinePlus Connect enables clinical care organizations to link 
from their EHR systems to relevant patient education materials.
          strengthening data science and open science capacity
    NLM is a leader in data science and open science, including the 
acquisition and analysis of data for discovery and the training of 
biomedical data scientists. The library aims to strengthen its position 
as a center of excellence for health data analytics and discovery, and 
to spearhead the application of advanced data science tools to 
biological, clinical and health data. NLM is building a workforce for 
data-driven research and health by funding PhD-level research training 
in biomedical informatics and data science. The library also partners 
with NIH to ensure inclusion of data science and open science core 
skills in all NIH training programs, and is expanding training for 
librarians, information science professionals, and other research 
facilitators. NLM is participating in NIH-wide efforts to foster a 
culture that advances science and ensures the development and retention 
of a diverse, safe, and respectful workforce for data-driven research 
and health well into the future. In FY 2022, NLM hosted 28 postdoctoral 
researchers, 10 post-baccalaureate trainees, 3 predoctoral researchers, 
18 summer interns, 19 research fellows, 1 clinical fellow, and 2 
visiting scientists. It also launched a new research summer internship 
program in data science and informatics that provides biomedical 
informatics training and research opportunities to students from 
diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups. The 
inaugural cohort of five interns worked on a variety of projects to 
improve methods to derive meaning from free text clinical data, explore 
whether different modes of gene expression occur within a tumor, 
characterize elements of cells that control genetic expression, use AI 
to predict progression of eye disease, and understand bias in machine 
learning.
                responding to the coronavirus (covid-19)
    NLM has continued to support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
through the SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, 
Epidemiology, and Surveillance (SPHERES) consortium. NLM's involvement 
resulted in improved SARS-CoV-2 data submission and validation 
processes, enhanced graphic interfaces for data retrieval, coordinated 
U.S. efforts to provide publicly accessible SARS-CoV-2 data via GenBank 
and SRA, and support for the mpox public health emergency response with 
the creation of a reference genome sequence as a template for 
submissions. NLM continued to participate in the NIH Accelerating 
COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Tracking 
Resistance and Coronavirus Evolution (TRACE) initiative to develop 
processes and infrastructure to monitor and evaluate emerging SARS-CoV-
2 variants, and to standardize, gather, and share variant sequencing 
data. In FY 2022, as part of its engagement in ACTIV TRACE, NLM refined 
data processing and analysis methods, and provided results in a format 
that supports findability of data records and large-scale analysis.
   supporting biomedical informatics research and health information 
                         technology innovation
    NLM conducts and supports informatics research, training and the 
application of advanced computing and informatics to biomedical 
research and healthcare delivery. NLM's National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) focuses on genomics and biological 
data banks, and the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical 
Communications (LHC), is a leader in clinical information analytics and 
standards. Many of today's biomedical informatics leaders are graduates 
of NLM-funded informatics research programs at universities nationwide. 
A number of the country's exemplary electronic and personal health 
record systems benefit from findings developed with NLM grant support. 
A leader in supporting the development, maintenance, and dissemination 
of standard clinical terminologies, NLM partners with the Office of the 
National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to support the 
interoperability of EHRs. NLM also develops tools to make it easier for 
EHR developers and users to implement accepted health data standards 
and link to relevant patient education materials. In FY 2022, NLM 
funded 208 awards across the country, including 28 co-funded with other 
NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices. NLM-funded researchers develop 
methods to improve access, storage, retrieval, management, 
dissemination, and use of biomedical data and information to support 
discovery and decision-making. Active NLM-supported projects develop 
and test health IT solutions that support clinical care and patient 
self-management, employ computational approaches and tools to interpret 
and analyze health records, and develop new AI and machine learning 
tools and approaches.
                 closing the gap in health disparities
    The National Library of Medicine supports NIH's efforts to close 
the gap in health disparities and improve the diversity of the 
biomedical information science workforce. Their work supports our 
mission and core values to make MLA and AAHSL more diverse and 
inclusive organizations. NLM accomplishes this by:

  --Providing open access to scientific literature through PubMed and 
        PubMed Central make scientific literature accessible, lading to 
        biological discoveries and providing the foundation to 
        developing clinical guidelines that inform health care. 
        Resources include PubMed Special Query for Health Disparities 
        and Minority Health Information Resources.

  --Utilizing the Network of the National Library of Medicine to 
        provide equal access to biomedical information and improves the 
        public's access to information. NNLM supports events including 
        the recent DEI webinar series ``Nine Conversations that Matter 
        to Health Sciences Librarians'' as well as NNLM Reading Clubs 
        on Disability Health, LGBTQ Health, Racism and Health and 
        Diversity in Medicine.

  --Funding grant programs that support research to advance health 
        equity and grants to reduce health disparities research 
        supplements to promote diversity in health research and 
        leveraging health information technology to address minority 
        health and health disparities.

  --Raising awareness and sparking conversations about the intersection 
        of society and ethical considerations in biomedical research 
        and technology through the annual NLM Science, Technology, and 
        Society lecture series.

    The NLM Information Resource Grants to Reduce Health Disparities 
support projects that bring useful and understandable health 
information to populations affected by health disparities and to their 
health care providers. In FY 2022, NLM awarded two grants to develop: 
1) an online guide for people in rural Georgia living with and managing 
autism spectrum disorder, as well as resources for physicians, and 2) a 
combination digital resource and training program for Afghan and Syrian 
refugees to improve reproductive health literacy. The NLM Grants for 
Scholarly Works in Biomedicine and Health supports the development of 
monographs and books by health professionals, public health officials, 
biomedical researchers, and health science historians. In FY 2022, NLM 
awarded three grants for scholarly works about: 1) the history of 
health care in U.S. prisons, 2) a comparative study of medical examiner 
and coroner offices in the United States, and 3) the role of statistics 
and statisticians in modern medicine.
    We look forward to continuing this dialogue and thank you for your 
efforts to support funding of at least $521 million for NLM in FY24, 
with additional increases in future years.

    Thank you Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of 
the subcommittee for the opportunity to share our funding priorities 
for the FY 2024 Federal budget. The Metlakatla Indian Community (MIC) 
is located on the Annette Islands Reserve in southeast Alaska, a land 
base of 87,000 acres which includes significant fish and forestry 
resources. Through our Annette Island Service Unit we provide primary 
health services at our outpatient facility through funding from the IHS 
as a co-signer to the Alaska Tribal Health Compact under ISDEAA. The 
following testimony provides recommendations on FY 2024 BIA and IHS 
priorities.
        increased funding and advance appropriations for the bia
    In FY 2024, we recommend a substantial increase for the Operation 
of Indian Programs at the BIA. This base funding is critical in the 
functioning of our government and our survival as a Tribal Nation. As 
noted by the National Congress of American Indians ``Tribal nations are 
resilient and have demonstrated their resolve and dedication since time 
immemorial, yet are uniquely reliant on their Federal partner to 
fulfill the promises made in exchange for the land that created the 
foundation of the United States.'' These funds are essential as they 
provide for social services, law enforcement, court services, child 
care services, public health and safety, and other essential government 
functions.
    Unfortunately, year after year, we experience large funding 
shortfalls across all BIA-funded programs, causing government services 
in our community to constantly depend on an inconsistent patchwork of 
Federal funding. For example, we have been forced to choose between 
meeting water quality standards or providing scholarships to our 
students. In some cases, these shortfalls force us to cut services 
altogether. The programs that have been impacted are realty, higher 
education, Tribal scholarships, social services, and limiting services 
from the fire department.
    Additionally, we request that BIA appropriations be funded on an 
advance appropriations cycle. It has sadly become the norm that the 
Tribe does not receive its full yearly appropriation until several 
months (sometimes longer) after the start of the fiscal year. These 
funding delays make it impossible for the Tribe to plan and manage 
their annual budgets. Congress recognized these challenges when it 
provided the Veterans Administration with advance appropriations over a 
decade ago and then last year in a historic step, finally provided 
advance appropriations for key IHS accounts. However, when it comes to 
our critical BIA accounts, Tribes still remain vulnerable while 
awaiting funding. The practical implication of this is that the Tribe 
does not have the ability to plan our finances even weeks ahead due to 
the uncertainty as to the level of funding. It is nearly impossible to 
Tribes to plan, grow, or achieve self-sufficiency. Advance 
appropriations for the BIA would lead to better stability for Tribal 
self-governance, reduce dependence on uncertain grant funding, and 
improve practices over all.
                   improving the indian health system
    Full Funding for the IHS: Appropriations are essential to this 
effort and in fulfilling the Federal Government's trust and treaty 
obligations by ensuring critical programs and services receive adequate 
funding to fulfill their intended purpose. We support the IHS Tribal 
Budget Formulation Workgroup calculated need of $51.4 billion for full 
funding in FY 2024.
    Continuing Advance Appropriations for the IHS: For many years, 
Tribes have requested that the IHS be funded on an advance 
appropriations cycle, a position championed by the Biden Administration 
and many on this subcommittee. In the FY 2023 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, Congress in a historic move, finally provided 
advance appropriations for the IHS for FY 2024. We thank this 
subcommittee for your decisive leadership of this effort and applaud 
the 117th Congress for supporting this. Going forward, we urge the 
subcommittee to take the necessary steps to continue advance 
appropriations for the IHS for FY 2025 and beyond.
    Fully Fund Critical Infrastructure Investments: We would like to 
thank the subcommittee for funding Electronic Health Record 
modernization at $217 million for FY 2023, which was an increase of 
$72.5 million (50%) over FY 2022. For FY 2024, we ask that the 
subcommittee continue robust funding for full implementation of 
interoperable Electronic Health Records (EHR) and tele-health. This 
will ensure that IHS can provide services that are similar to other 
health providers. For Tribes and Tribal health organizations who have 
committed their own resources to move away from RPMS and making their 
systems functional, IHS should take this into consideration with any 
new resources and ensure these programs are not only interoperable, but 
compensated accordingly. We were thrilled to see that the Sanitation 
Facilities Construction program received $3.5 billion in appropriations 
in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58). That 
said, it is critical that Congress make still significant investments 
in Tribal health facilities construction. IHS and Tribal facilities are 
some of the oldest in the Nation, meaning that facilities are out of 
date, or not appropriate for the size of the patient populations they 
serve. Therefore, consistent with the Budget Formulation Workgroup's 
request, we recommend $9.6 billion for Facilities in FY 2024.
    Mandatory Funding for Contract Support Costs and 105(l) Lease 
Payments: We appreciate the subcommittee's commitment to ensuring that 
Contract Support Costs (CSC) and 105(l) lease costs are fully funded by 
including an indefinite discretionary appropriation in recent years for 
both of these accounts. We support the Biden Administration's request 
to transition these accounts to mandatory funding. This change would 
bring appropriations process into line with the clear legal 
requirements of the authorizing statute. CSC and 105(l) lease funds are 
already an entitlement under substantive law for the ISDEAA to function 
as intended by Congress. It is contradictory and problematic to 
appropriate funding for CSC on a discretionary basis. A simple 
amendment to a permanent appropriations statute could solve this 
challenge.
    Amend Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to 
Clarify CSC Provisions: We also request that the committee consider 
amending the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
(ISDEAA) to clarify that when agency funding paid to a Tribe for 
program operations is insufficient for contract and compact 
administration, contract support costs will remain available to cover 
the difference. In the recent court decision Cook Inlet Tribal Council, 
Inc. v. Dotomain, a Federal appeals court held that costs for 
activities normally carried out by IHS are ineligible for payment as 
CSC-even if IHS transfers insufficient, or even no, funding for these 
activities in the Secretarial amount. Under this new ruling, if 
facility costs are higher for a Tribe than for IHS, the Tribe is forced 
to cover the difference by diverting scarce program dollars. Recently, 
this serious misinterpretation of the ISDEAA that has been applied to 
one Tribal organization resulting in a 90% reduction of contract 
support costs reimbursement threatens Tribal self-governance and self-
determination. Therefore, we call upon Congress to provide a 
legislative fix to clarify the intent on Congress for this matter, and 
ensure consistency with precedent.
    Extend Self-Governance Funding Options to the Special Diabetes 
Program for Indians (SDPI) and Increase Funding to $250 million/year: 
While we understand that SDPI is not under the jurisdiction of the 
subcommittee, we appreciate that Congress included a 3-year 
reauthorization of SDPI in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 
(Public Law 116-260). SDPI's success rests in the flexibility of its 
program structure that allows for the incorporation of culture and 
local needs into its services. Congress should authorize SDPI 
participants the option of receiving their Federal funds through either 
a grant (as currently used) or self-governance funding mechanisms under 
ISDEAA. Additionally, SDPI has not had an increase in funding since FY 
2004. We recommend permanent reauthorization for SDPI at a minimum of 
$250 million per year with annual adjustments for inflationary 
increases.
    Tribal Hatcheries: We deeply appreciate the $1 million increase for 
the operation of fish hatcheries in the Fish, Wildlife, and Parks sub-
activity within the BIA Trust-Natural Resources Management budget in FY 
2023 and are asking the subcommittees to continue increased funding 
levels FY 2024.
    U.S./Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty: Pacific salmon migrate through a 
broad geographic range that includes rivers, streams and the coastal 
waters of both the United States and Canada. Recognizing this reality, 
the Pacific Salmon Treaty was negotiated between the U.S. and Canada in 
1985 to prevent overfishing and provide optimum production and fair 
sharing of the salmon harvest. In the U.S., salmon fisheries governed 
by the Treaty provide nearly 27,000 full time jobs and add nearly $2 
billion annually to the gross domestic product. Funding to carry out 
different elements of the Treaty is appropriated through the 
Departments of Interior, State and Commerce. In the Department of 
Interior's budget, this funding is appropriated through the BIA Trust-
Natural Resources Rights Protection Implementation sub-activity and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission. 
We thank the subcommittee for your continued support for this program 
in FY 2023, including the $3.5 million increase for Rights Protection 
Implementation, and encourage further investments in FY 2024.
    Tribal Court Assistance for Tribes Subject to PL 83-280: We 
appreciate the much-needed support for Tribes who are affected by 
Public Law 83-280 and who are striving to serve our communities with 
competent and appropriate judiciary systems. Specifically, under the 
BIA Public Safety and Justice Law Enforcement-Tribal Justice Support 
program element we appreciate the helpful report language continued 
from the FY 2021 Senate Appropriations Committee report (116-123) that 
outlined additional support for BIA to work with ``Indian Tribes and 
Tribal organizations to consider options that promote, design, or pilot 
Tribal court systems for Tribal communities subject to full or partial 
State jurisdiction under Public Law 83-280.'' We also appreciate the $2 
million increase for this program in FY 2023 and ask that in FY 2024, 
the subcommittees continue to include PL 280-specific funding under 
this program element and continue to reference the Senate 
Appropriations Committee report (116-123).
    Increased Funding to Address the Impacts of Climate Change: Like 
many Tribal communities we continue to be impacted by the growing 
challenge of climate change on our environment. Threats such as 
flooding, erosion, sea level rise, ocean acidification, increased 
wildfires, extended drought, and changes in seasons all contribute to 
the serious challenges that Tribal communities currently face. We are 
forced to reduce emissions, mitigate and adapt, but to be successful we 
need additional support. We appreciate the $216 million provided to the 
BIA through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-
58). We also appreciate the subcommittee's inclusion of $34.9 million 
for Tribal Climate Resilience in FY 2023 appropriations, but request 
significantly more investment in this account, specifically to 
implement mitigation actions identified through Climate Resilience 
plans. Tribal Nations throughout the United States, and especially in 
Alaska, are increasingly impacted by the threats of climate change.
    Continue Increases for Native Language Programs: As we have seen in 
the news everyday, through wars, plague, famine, and climate change, 
our health and wellbeing is under threat from many directions. While we 
urgently need the Federal Government to support our efforts to face 
these often existential challenges, there is also an invisible threat 
lurking all around us. Honorable Members of this subcommittee, the 
heritage language of my people is dying. Those in academia refer to the 
Tsimshian language as ``critically endangered.'' Just as our ocean 
coastline is eroding away, so too is the Sm'algyax, the Tsimshian 
language. There are only a few dozen speakers remaining in the entire 
world. We must impart the grave seriousness to every Member of this 
subcommittee. With permanent reoccurring annual funding as part of our 
compact, we can, in partnership with Congress, meet this challenge, and 
hold back the coming storm. We would like to thank to the subcommittee 
for the $2 million increase to the Community Development Central 
Oversight sub-activity under the Community and Economic Development 
activity directed towards supporting Native language instruction and 
immersion programs to Native students not enrolled at Bureau of Indian 
Education schools, including those Tribes and organizations in States 
without Bureau-funded schools.
    Reduce Dependence on Federal Grants: In addition to the critical 
funding needs that are outlined above, we also support moving away from 
competitive grants for Federal funding mechanisms across all 
departments. The Federal trust responsibility does not require that we 
jump through a myriad of hoops and onerous applications and compete 
against other Tribes to see that services are provided to our people. 
Tribes must also be granted the flexibility needed to respond to the 
specific needs of our own communities, not those prescribed by Federal 
grants. This also means providing enough resources so that funds are 
provided in meaningful amounts to all Tribes.

 Prepared Statement of the National Association of Abandoned Mine Land 
                                Programs
    My name is Benny McCament and I serve as the Chief of the Ohio 
Department of Natural Resources Division of Mineral Resources 
Management. I am providing this statement on behalf of the National 
Association of Abandoned Mine Land Programs (NAAMLP), for which I 
currently serve as President. NAAMLP represents 32 States and Tribes, 
of which 27 implement abandoned mine land reclamation (AML) programs 
authorized under Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation 
Act (SMCRA), and many implement state level programs for hardrock AML. 
My office's address is 29371 Wheelabout Road, McArthur OH 45651 and my 
office phone number is (740) 274-4947. My email is 
Benny.Mccament@dnr.ohio.gov.
    State and Tribal Hardrock AML Grants NAAMLP represents many States 
and Tribes with significant hardrock and noncoal AML problems 
(``hardrock AML'' hereafter). Hardrock AML threatens and damages the 
health and safety, environment, and economic vitality of impacted 
communities throughout the Country, especially in the West, but in 
every other region as well. There is no comprehensive accounting of the 
National hardrock AML problem at this time, but it is often cited in 
the tens of billions of dollars. In the absence of a steady hardrock 
AML funding source, State and Tribal hardrock AML programs struggle to 
maintain adequate funding and make consistent progress, and many States 
and Tribes with hardrock AML problems have no state/Tribal level 
program at all.
    The $3 billion funding authorization for hardrock AML grants ($1.5 
billion for States and Tribes) in Section 40704 of the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) is a very exciting development, despite 
the funding not yet being appropriated on the scale authorized. The 
$1.7m in funding for States and $400k for Tribes appropriated in FY 
2022 and 2023 for the energy community revitalization program (ECRP) is 
an encouraging start but is not enough to go around or to make 
meaningful progress addressing hardrock AML problems. We urge Congress 
to appropriate the amount authorized for hardrock AML by the IIJA at a 
rate of $300m per year.
    NAAMLP and IMCC have been working closely with DOI's Office of 
Environmental Policy and Compliance (OEPC) since the passage of the 
IIJA. We convened a group of 40+ States and Tribes to provide input to 
OEPC on how the new grants program should work. We believe a good plan 
has been developed, based on the amount of funding available, and 
appreciate OEPC's willingness to take state/Tribal input. These plans 
include a new national hardrock AML inventory being developed by USGS 
with State and Tribal input, which will eventually provide Congress 
with a nationwide picture of the scope and cost of the hardrock AML 
problem. It will take a significant amount of time and resources for 
this inventory to be fully developed.
    Congress does not need to wait for the inventory to be completed 
before increasing hardrock AML funding. The States and Tribes already 
know where the most dangerous safety and environmental problems exist. 
The know-how, planning, and will are already in place for States and 
Tribes to deliver immediate and ongoing benefits to communities in 
virtually every State.
    IIJA Coal AML Funding Implementation The infusion of much-needed 
funding for coal AML in the IIJA has ushered in a new, re-invigorated 
era for coal AML work. We thank Congress for recognizing the critical 
role the AML programs play in health and safety, environmental 
restoration, and the creation of jobs and economic growth. These 
benefits are appreciated throughout the Country, especially in places 
like Appalachia that are most affected by the energy transition. We 
also thank Congress for the passage of the STREAM Act at the end of 
last year, which ensures the gains enabled by the IIJA for AML water 
restoration will be lasting.
    We have been working closely with our sister organization, the 
Interstate Mining Compact Commission (IMCC), as well as our Federal 
partners at the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 
(OSMRE) on implementing the new AML funding. We are confident the 
program will be successful in delivering the many benefits Congress 
envisions. However, implementation of the IIJA coal AML funding has met 
with challenges. While some progress is being made in addressing them, 
we believe that Congressional oversight would be helpful to ensuring 
the new funding is implemented in the best way possible.
    The States and Tribes have primacy under SCMRA and are on the 
forefront of implementation of the new IIJA funding--but we have found 
OSMRE's willingness to collaborate with and accept the input of the 
States and Tribes on IIJA implementation to be lacking. We have 
repeatedly and in a variety of ways communicated our concerns to OSMRE 
and DOI leadership. We recently held a Roundtable meeting with OSMRE at 
DOI headquarters in attempt to improve the working relationship between 
the agency and the States and Tribes. This meeting was a promising step 
forward and led to a breakthrough for collaboration on a particular 
aspect of IIJA implementation. However, the majority of OSMRE's IIJA 
implementation plans currently remain unchanged.
    The changes OSMRE plans for the AML program are generally 
burdensome, reflect misunderstanding of how State and Tribal AML 
programs operate, and will ultimately be detrimental to the program and 
the AML-impacted communities that rely on it. For example, OSMRE is 
requiring entirely separate grant applications for the new IIJA 
treasury-sourced funding and pre-existing AML fee-based funding, 
despite the fact that the funding is for the same programs and purposes 
and could easily be tracked separately without separate applications. 
OSMRE reportedly plans to hire roughly 70 new staff to help it 
implement its new, unnecessary grant application and reporting 
processes. Congress should seek to ``right-size'' OSMRE's budget to 
give the agency the personnel it needs to efficiently oversee and 
manage the AML program but not allow it to over-manage and smother the 
program with bureaucracy.
    The State and Tribal AML programs have long been committed to 
preventing fraud, waste, and abuse, which is evidenced by the more than 
45-year history of the program absent any such issues. The unfortunate 
irony is that OSMRE's new requirements will themselves result in waste 
by diverting State and Tribal AML staff time and energy toward 
unnecessary, disproportionate administrative requirements and away from 
their core mission of planning and conducting AML projects. State and 
Tribal AML programs have no staff time to spare on non-essential 
activities. The bottom-line is that, for the IIJA-funded AML program to 
be maximally successful, Congressional oversight would be useful to 
encourage OSMRE to listen to the States and Tribes that implement these 
programs on the ground and retain as much as possible the existing 
processes for the well-established, reasonably efficient, and highly 
successful AML program. OSMRE's current plans for its training programs 
are another particular concern.
    OSMRE's current plans for the training program are not adequate to 
provide for the the upcoming influx of new State and Tribal AML 
personnel, which is necessary for the State and Tribal AML programs to 
utilize the greatly increased funding provided by the IIJA. The demands 
of implementing the increased funding will also mean that the training 
program will not be able to rely on volunteer trainers from State 
agencies as it currently does. We recommend Congress increase NTTP/TIPS 
funding and consider report language to encourage OSMRE to hire full-
time, paid instructors for the training program.
    OSMRE's current plans for the inventory funding provided by the 
IIJA is another cause for concern. IIJA section 40701(g) made $25 
million available ``to provide States and Indian Tribes with the 
financial and technical assistance necessary for the purpose of making 
amendments to the inventory maintained under section 403(C) of 
[SMCRA]''. We believe the intent for this funding was that all of it be 
delivered to the States and Tribes to supplement their efforts to 
visit, catalogue, and assess AML problem areas so that a more complete 
inventory of coal AML problems can be achieved. However, we understand 
that OSMRE intends to distribute only $8 million to the States and 
Tribes and keep the rest for cyber-security related and other upgrades 
to the inventory database known as e-AMLIS. We believe that these kinds 
of updates to e-AMLIS should be funded out of OSMRE's budget and not 
from funding set aside for States and Tribes' inventorying work.
    SMCRA Title IV Coal AML We encourage Congress to maintain OSMRE 
funding for SMCRA Title IV purposes that serves the agency's role of 
supporting State and Tribal AML programs. For example, we recommend 
continued funding for technical assistance and applied science. We also 
recommend continued funding for the NTTP and TIPS programs, including 
moneys for State and Tribal travel. These initiatives provide essential 
training, continuing education, and technical assistance for State and 
Tribal AML personnel.
    We also recommend funding for Watershed Cooperative Agreements be 
maintained. This funding serves an important role in facilitating State 
and local partnerships, thereby helping to leverage outside sources of 
funding and preserve precious reclamation grant funding.
    AMLER The States are proud of the projects they have conducted 
through the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization (AMLER) program 
(formerly known as the ``pilot program''), which look for creative ways 
to turn AML sites into opportunities for economic development. We 
request that funding in the amount of $135 million continue. However, 
we remain concerned with implementation of the AMLER program, which has 
been impeded by the same kind of untenable administrative processes and 
lack of respect for state primacy described above.
    The AMLER program suffers most of all from the ``vetting'' process, 
in which, despite not being anticipated in the law, OSMRE reviews and 
approves or denies every potential AMLER project before they have been 
fully planned. Poor communication and opaque vetting standards have led 
to paralyzing delays and uncertainty and a disproportionate amount of 
AML program staff time being devoted to this program. Meanwhile, 
OSMRE's review in the vetting process adds little if any value to AMLER 
project outcomes. The process involves slow, unproductive back-and-
forth regarding project details and administrative concerns and often 
amounts to OSMRE asserting its own opinions on how best to approach 
AMLER projects in place of the States and Tribes' better, more locally-
informed expertise. This is not how the AMLER program was meant to 
work.
    The vetting process has also become increasingly untenable for the 
States' project partners, whose cooperation is essential. Local 
businesses and community groups find it difficult to navigate the 
process or receive reasonable assurance that their projects will 
succeed if they do things right. For example, a proposed AMLER project 
that would have built affordable housing in an economically depressed 
coal community in Virginia was caught up in the OSMRE vetting process 
for over 1,200 days with virtually no communication until the project 
proponents withdrew due to their understandable frustration.
    We ask that Congress conduct oversight of the AMLER program and 
consider how to alleviate these problems. Stronger report language 
encouraging clearer vetting standards and better deference to State 
programs would be welcome. However, we believe report language is not 
enough to resolve the issues at hand and that a deeper change is 
necessary.
    We recommend OSMRE be directed to distribute AMLER funding directly 
to eligible State and Tribal Programs for deposit into State and Tribal 
accounts within 60 days. This would return the AMLER program to the way 
we believe Congress originally intended for it to operate, in which 
projects would be chosen and developed by States and Tribes in 
consultation with their economic development agencies and local 
stakeholders without unnecessary, unproductive involvement by OSMRE 
through vetting. The oversight and reporting processes already in place 
in the AML program will be more than enough to ensure funding is spent 
transparently and in the proper way as Congress envisions. The bottom-
line is that this approach would yield more, faster, and better health, 
safety, environmental, and economic benefits from the AMLER program.
                               conclusion
    In closing, the States and Tribes represented by NAAMLP again 
express our gratitude to Congress for the recognition of the value of 
the AML programs, both coal and hardrock, and the investment in their 
future represented by the IIJA. We look forward to beginning this new 
chapter for coal AML and are thrilled to be moving toward a national-
scale hardrock AML grants program as well. With Congress' continuing 
attentiveness to AML implementation issues, we feel confident that 
continued success of the State and Tribal AML programs can be assured.

Management, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, on Behalf of the 
National Association of Abandoned Mine Land Programs re. the FY 2024 
Proposed Budgets for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and 
Enforcement and Energy Community Revitalization Program before the 
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee--May 24, 2023.

                                 ______
                                 
   Prepared Statement of National Association of Clean Water Agencies
    The National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) represents 
over 350 public wastewater and stormwater utility members nationwide, 
who collectively provide essential clean water services to more than 
150 million Americans daily. These utilities serve communities both 
large and small, urban and rural, in nearly every State and work around 
the clock to protect public health and the environment and support 
economic growth.
    Providing these essential clean water services comes with a great 
deal of complex challenges including reinvesting in aging 
infrastructure, managing escalating operation and maintenance costs and 
supply chain disruptions, attracting and retaining a skilled workforce, 
addressing water quality impairments and regulations such as for per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), emerging contaminants, and 
nutrients, and investing in climate resilience and system security. 
Public clean water utilities are working each day to overcome these 
challenges and provide the highest level of service to the communities 
they serve while ensuring rates remain affordable for families and 
local businesses.
    NACWA greatly appreciates the direct appropriations provided for 
clean water by Congress under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act (IIJA). Other programs were authorized but not directly or fully 
funded through IIJA itself. It is important that Congress fully 
appropriate the clean water programs authorized and reauthorized under 
the IIJA to ensure local communities have the complete resources they 
need to provide essential public wastewater and stormwater services.
    Below are NACWA's FY24 Appropriations requests. As always, NACWA 
appreciates the subcommittee's strong engagement and collaboration with 
the Association and our members and consideration of these clean water 
priorities.
                clean water state revolving fund (cwsrf)
    The CWSRF is the primary Federal clean water financing tool that 
communities and public clean water utilities utilize to help meet their 
Clean Water Act (CWA) obligations and infrastructure needs. The CWSRF 
has been instrumental to communities' successes in advancing water 
quality and public health protection. While the IIJA provided a 5-year 
infusion of additional funds into the CWSRF, NACWA knows that it was 
clearly the intent of Congress for these funds to supplement--not 
supplant--continued robust annual CWSRF appropriations. NACWA supports 
annual CWSRF funding at the full IIJA authorized level of $3 billion 
for FY24.
    Additionally, NACWA members who benefited from Congressionally 
Directed Spending greatly appreciate the direct funding provided them 
through the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations. But as the Committee considers 
Congressionally Directed Spending moving forward, NACWA requests that 
funding for these projects not be taken from the CWSRF's annual 
appropriation. This will help ensure that communities who secured 
Congressionally Directed spending for their projects are funded without 
reducing access to the CWSRF by all eligible communities in a State, 
and will protect the revolving funds' long-term viability.
    Lastly, NACWA wishes to emphasize that innovative technology will 
play a vital role in ensuring public clean water utilities are able to 
continue efficiently and cost-effectively providing the highest level 
of safe, sustainable wastewater and stormwater services for their 
residents. NACWA appreciates the work of the subcommittee in the FY23 
Omnibus Appropriations package to enhance the use of clean water 
technology and looks forward to building on the role of innovative 
technology in FY24.
    NACWA requests that the Committee include language prioritizing 
eligibilities for technological innovation through the CWSRF by 
allowing States the ability to use up to five percent of the funds 
provided to them for projects that utilize proven or emerging clean 
water technology for publicly owned treatment works optimization and to 
meet or enhance local public health and environmental objectives.
          sewer overflow and stormwater reuse municipal grants
    Reducing sewer overflows has been a key driver of financial strain 
on many communities and their ratepayers. This is especially clear in 
communities under Federal consent decrees, addressing aging 
infrastructure, and/or adjusting to population and economic shifts, all 
while dealing with the growing impacts of climate change and extreme 
weather events.
    The Sewer Overflow and Stormwater Reuse Municipal Grants program 
provides grant dollars that can assist municipal clean water utilities 
and communities in more affordably managing combined sewer overflows, 
sanitary sewer overflows, and capturing stormwater flows for water 
reuse. NACWA strongly supports this key program which provides 
communities with direct grant dollars (as opposed to loans) to make 
these critical investments and supports full funding of the 
reauthorized level of $280 million in FY24.
                      low-income water assistance
    NACWA has long supported the creation of a Federal low-income water 
assistance program to assist households in maintaining access to 
affordable and reliable public clean and drinking water services. 
Similar Federal programs exist to help low-income households with food 
and energy costs, and the time has come for water to be equally 
recognized as a costly but vital public health need. A robust and 
permanent Federal water assistance program is critical to ensuring 
communities and public utilities can provide service to all customers 
while also being able to charge the rates necessary to maintain safe, 
reliable water and wastewater systems.
    NACWA is grateful for the steps Congress has taken to advance this 
important need by providing funding for a temporary emergency Low 
Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) administered by the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as 
authorizing the establishment of an EPA low-income water customer 
assistance pilot program in the IIJA.
    However, HHS' LIHWAP funding is set to expire at the end of 2023, 
potentially leaving many struggling families in a position to not be 
able to afford their essential water services. Additional resources are 
needed to bridge this gap and ensure long-term viability of a permanent 
low-income water assistance program, and NACWA requests the Committee 
provide $225 million in FY24 for EPA to implement its pilot program.
                          integrated planning
    Integrated Planning (IP), codified into the CWA by Congress in 
2018, can assist both large and small communities in managing costs and 
sequencing and prioritizing their clean water investments-empowering 
communities to maximize environmental benefits and prioritize their 
most critical environmental outcomes. The IP approach requires a shift 
from business as usual, requiring significant work upfront by 
communities, States, and EPA to achieve improved outcomes.
    NACWA greatly appreciates the $2 million provided by the Committee 
in the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations package to provide EPA with 
dedicated resources to help communities develop IP frameworks. The 
Agency is working with state regulators to incorporate IP approaches 
into permitting and enforcement, a critical step. NACWA requests an 
additional $2 million in FY24 appropriations to continue these efforts.
             water workforce infrastructure grants program
    The public clean water sector can provide stable career paths 
across skill levels where workers can take pride in serving their 
community. However, the water utility workforce is retiring rapidly, 
and public utilities are struggling more than ever to compete with 
other sectors for workers.
    NACWA strongly supports EPA's Water Workforce Infrastructure 
Development Grant Program and requests that FY24 funding is provided 
at, or higher than, the FY23 level of $6 million. This funding will 
support innovative efforts to develop tomorrow's utility workforce and 
ensure long-term stability in the sector.
    water infrastructure finance and innovation act (wifia) program
    The WIFIA program is a complement to the SRFs, accelerating 
significant water infrastructure investments and leveraging limited 
Federal resources. NACWA supports funding equal to the FY23 
appropriated amount of $75.6 million in FY24. NACWA also supports an 
additional $5 million for the SWIFIA program, which allows state 
financing authorities that administer the SRFs to apply for WIFIA loans 
directly through EPA. This ability of a State to bundle multiple 
projects on its approved intended use plan can increase participation 
in smaller, rural, and lesser-resourced communities.
    clean water infrastructure resilience and sustainability program
    NACWA is strongly supportive of this program that was established 
under the IIJA to help clean water utilities that are on the front 
lines of mitigating the impacts of climate change and wet weather 
events. Communities vary with regard to how climate change is impacting 
their utility systems and are trying to implement locally-appropriate 
solutions that ensure resilience for critical water services. NACWA 
requests the fully authorized amount of $25 million in FY24 to 
jumpstart this program.
                                  pfas
    Clean water utilities are very concerned about the presence of 
emerging contaminants in their influent, the impacts these chemicals 
have on their treated effluent and biosolids, and the potential costs 
that may accrue to public ratepayers. NACWA urges funding for EPA to 
advance its work to better develop a scientific understanding of PFAS 
in the environment--particularly exposure pathways, toxicity levels, 
and treatment technologies--to guide the development of appropriate, 
scientific, risk-based standards that protect public health and the 
environment. This work can also help advance source control and the 
transition from PFAS in products and supply chains to alternative 
materials. It is vital that EPA get the science right and determine 
actual risk levels from PFAS to human health before moving too quickly 
on regulatory requirements that could impose significant costs on 
public clean water utilities and the communities they serve.
    As a key part of this, NACWA urges Congress to provide dedicated 
funding to bolster EPA's Biosolids Program, which regulates the 
beneficial reuse of wastewater treatment residuals. EPA's ongoing work 
on the problem formulation for biosolids is critical to providing 
certainty regarding continued safe residuals management.
    NACWA strongly supported the $1 billion in appropriations under the 
IIJA for clean water utilities to address emerging contaminants such as 
PFAS. However, since these funds are flowing through the CWSRF there 
have been challenges to getting these funding plans approved and funds 
disbursed quickly. Some of the most immediate costs clean water 
utilities are facing is to proactively understand and limit PFAS in 
their systems through monitoring, analysis, and implementing 
pretreatment programs in conjunction with industries to reduce 
concentrated PFAS discharges into public sewer systems. However, these 
important steps are not necessarily eligible uses for IIJA funds as 
those dollars are coming through the CWSRF, which is focused on capital 
investments.
    NACWA has been working to identify potential near-term clean water 
utility uses of the IIJA PFAS funds that align with the CWSRF 
eligibilities and providing EPA and our members with recommendations. 
However, Congressional clarity from the Committee that these IIJA CWSRF 
emerging contaminant funds can be used for PFAS monitoring and 
assessment work would be an important step to ensure the funds are be 
put to their best possible use, meeting timely clean water PFAS needs. 
Clarifying language will support the work public clean water agencies 
are doing to understand and control PFAS before they enter the utility 
system or are released to the environment.
                        additional key programs
    NACWA also supports increased funding for EPA's Geographic 
Programs, which support critical watershed-based investments; Section 
319 Nonpoint Source grants that support watershed solutions to 
pollution driven by nonpoint sources, which remain the largest 
outstanding driver of water quality impairments; and for EPA's National 
Priorities Water Research grant program which supports work on timely 
national water research priorities.

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of National Association of Clean Air Agencies
    On behalf of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies 
(NACAA), thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony on the FY 
2024 budget for the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), particularly grants to State and local air pollution control 
agencies under Sections 103 and 105 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which 
are part of the State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) program. NACAA 
has four recommendations with respect to FY 2024 appropriations. The 
association urges Congress to 1) provide $500 million in grants to 
State and local air agencies, which is an increase of $251 million over 
the FY 2023 appropriation of $249 million and $100 million above the 
Administration's request; 2) provide flexibility to State and local air 
quality agencies to use Federal grants to address the highest priority 
programs in their areas; 3) retain grants for monitoring fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) under the authority of Section 103 of the 
Clean Air Act, rather than shifting it to Section 105; and 4) provide 
grant increases under authorities of the CAA that do not require 
matching funds (e.g., Section 103) as much as possible to allow 
agencies that do not have sufficient matching funds to still obtain the 
additional grants.
    NACAA is the National, non-partisan, non-profit association of air 
pollution control agencies in 40 States, including 117 local air 
agencies, the District of Columbia and five territories. NACAA exists 
to advance the equitable protection of clean air and public health for 
all, and to improve the capability and effectiveness of State and local 
air agencies. These agencies have the ``primary responsibility'' under 
the CAA for implementing our Nation's clean air programs. As such, they 
conduct an array of critical activities intended to improve and 
maintain air quality and protect public health.
           air pollution poses serious public health problems
    Overall, very few problems this subcommittee addresses pose greater 
threats to public health than air pollution and climate change. Air 
quality programs under the CAA have greatly reduced air pollution 
while, at the same time, our country has continued to experience strong 
economic growth.\1\ However, air pollution continues to threaten public 
health and welfare, especially in overburdened environmental justice 
communities that disproportionately suffer adverse human health and 
environmental impacts.

    Every year tens of thousands of Americans die prematurely from air 
pollution and millions are exposed to unhealthful levels of air 
contaminants, resulting in cancer, damage to respiratory, 
cardiovascular, neurological and reproductive systems and other health 
problems.\2\ In 2021, approximately 30 percent of the U.S. population--
about 102 million people--lived in areas that exceeded one or more 
Federal health-based air pollution standards.\3\ Additionally, EPA's 
most recent hazardous air pollution data show that ``millions of people 
live in areas where air toxics pose potential health concerns.'' \4\ 
Environmental justice communities are particularly at risk.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With respect to climate change, there is much work to be done to 
address increasing greenhouse gas emissions that result in more and 
worse wildfires, longer ozone seasons and upward-trending global 
temperatures. State and local governments have led the way by 
instituting some of our Nation's strongest climate change programs, 
making meaningful progress towards reducing greenhouse gases. It is 
essential that these and other programs be well funded.
        state and local air agencies continue to be underfunded
    Under the CAA, State and local agencies have the primary 
responsibility for implementing the Federal clean air program. This 
massive undertaking calls for monitoring, issuing permits, planning, 
developing emission-reduction strategies, enforcing rules, educating 
the public, hiring and training staff and conducting many other complex 
activities. Increasingly, these agencies are tasked with new and high-
priority responsibilities to reduce air pollution, address the 
disproportionate harm facing overburdened communities and tackle 
climate change. Unfortunately, this simply cannot be accomplished with 
current levels of funding.
    State and local air agencies have been underfunded for many years. 
Federal grants to State and local air quality agencies (under Sections 
103 and 105 of the CAA) were not much higher in FY 2023 than they were 
20 years ago, representing a substantial decrease in purchasing power 
when factoring in inflation. During this time, air quality issues have 
become more and more complicated and costly. Moreover, while Federal 
grants were originally intended to cover 60 percent of the cost of 
implementing the CAA, they cover less than a quarter of that today, 
with the remainder coming largely from State and local programs 
themselves.
    funds from recent legislation and permit fees are not the answer
    On August 12, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA),\5\ which includes essential and welcome funding for State and 
local air agencies to address climate change in particular. However, 
the IRA funds are not a substitute for the increases NACAA recommends, 
the latter of which are intended to make up for the historical deficits 
in State and local grant funding and bring the appropriations to the 
level they should be for these agencies to carry out the ongoing 
responsibilities that existed prior to the IRA and will continue into 
the future. It is essential that many State and local agencies hire new 
staff to carry out their traditional responsibilities and new programs 
to address more complex clean air and climate change programs. To cover 
the continuing costs of increased staffing, agencies require ongoing 
and permanent additional resources, such as those we are recommending 
here. The limited-time IRA funds will not replace the need for such 
increases. Finally, the successful implementation of the IRA will 
likely increase the responsibilities typically borne by State and local 
air agencies' core programs, but for which the measure did not allocate 
specific additional funding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Similarly, funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
\6\ are not the solution, as most are directed to water and 
infrastructure projects. While worthwhile, they do not address the day-
to-day work of State and local air agencies and much of those funds are 
tied to specific new work, rather than existing responsibilities, which 
does not address the current funding deficit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, the permit fee program under Title V of the Clean Air Act 
is not the solution to State and local air agencies' financial 
problems. While it provides essential revenues, it has significant 
limitations. First, Title V fees only support the operating permit 
program and must not be used for other activities (i.e., Federal grants 
and permit fees must not be mingled). Second, those fees apply only to 
major sources and do not cover the significant costs for non-major 
sources (e.g., permits, monitoring, enforcement, compliance 
assistance). Third, the current fees already are substantial and there 
would be considerable resistance to any increases. Fourth, and perhaps 
most significantly, fee revenue has decreased drastically due to 
reductions in emissions on which they are based (i.e., success in 
controlling emissions results in diminished fee revenue).
    These two significant pieces of legislation and the Title V fee 
program, while important to State and local agencies, are not the 
solutions to the funding shortfall. Traditional Federal grants must be 
expanded to meet the significant resource requirements.
                 how would additional funding be used?
    Many agencies report inadequate funding for the basic 
responsibilities identified above, which are the foundations of their 
programs. The recommended increases would allow for the continuation of 
these essential activities. In addition, increased Federal grants would 
support:

  --advancing new programs and expanding existing efforts that protect 
        all Americans, especially vulnerable communities that continue 
        to bear the greatest pollution burdens;

  --strengthening pollution detection and visualization efforts through 
        monitors, sensors and airborne- and mobile-detection equipment 
        for a variety of pollutants;

  --supporting small business programs and emission reductions from 
        smaller sources, including inspections, compliance assistance 
        and technical support;

  --addressing climate change with efforts including planning, 
        monitoring, permitting and enforcement; energy-transition 
        assistance for communities dependent on fossil fuels; and 
        adaptation and resilience for communities that face extreme 
        weather and climate impacts;

  --empowering State and local agencies to take on the additional air 
        quality responsibilities in new Federal clean energy and clean 
        transportation programs; and

  --tackling the ever-increasing threats posed by wildfires, including 
        mitigating adverse health impacts and communicating with the 
        public.
             agencies need flexibility in the use of grants
    Air pollution problems are not the same everywhere and each State 
or local agency must adapt its approach to fit its unique circumstances 
and the issues facing its community. A one-size-fits-all strategy for 
grants applied nationally may not recognize the need to focus resources 
effectively. Therefore, NACAA recommends that Congress provide State 
and local air agencies with the flexibility to use grant funds on the 
highest priority programs in their areas.
           allow agencies that cannot match to receive grants
    Section 105 of the Clean Air Act requires grant recipients to 
provide matching funds, while Section 103 does not. Providing certain 
grants under Section 103 authority, therefore, is very helpful for 
those State or local agencies that are unable to raise additional 
matching funds.
    In the past, EPA has proposed shifting the PM2.5 monitoring grant 
program from Section 103 authority to Section 105. NACAA has asked 
Congress in previous years to retain PM2.5 monitoring grants under 
Section 103 so that no agencies would be forced to refuse critical 
monitoring grants due to their inability to afford the required match. 
We are very grateful that Congress has been agreeable to this request 
in the past and we ask that these funds once again remain under Section 
103 authority in FY 2024.
    Concerns about agencies' abilities to match grant funds go beyond 
just the PM2.5 monitoring grant program, however. While some agencies 
have adequate matching funds, others do not. Often, these are the same 
agencies in dire need of the additional grants we are seeking. 
Therefore, we request that Congress provide as much of the grant 
increase as possible under authorities that do not require matching 
funds (e.g., Section 103), so that no agency would be ineligible for 
the additional grants, even if they do not have sufficient matching 
funds.
                               conclusion
    Federal grants to State and local air quality agencies are a 
relatively small piece of the National budget. Yet the return on 
investment is among the highest when considering the benefits of 
protecting public health and the environment against the serious 
threats posed by air pollution and climate change.
    State and local air quality agencies' efforts to protect and 
improve air quality are critically important both for public health and 
a sound economy. NACAA recommends that in FY 2024 Congress 1) provide 
$500 million in grants to State and local air agencies, which is an 
increase of $251 million over the FY 2023 appropriation of $249 million 
and $100 million above the Administration's request; 2) provide 
flexibility to State and local air quality agencies to use Federal 
grants to address the highest priority programs in their areas; 3) 
retain grants for monitoring PM2.5 under the authority of Section 103 
of the Clean Air Act, rather than shifting it to Section 105; and 4) 
provide grant increases under authorities of the CAA that do not 
require matching funds (e.g., Section 103) as much as possible to allow 
agencies that do not have sufficient matching funds to still obtain the 
additional grants.

    Prepared Statement of the National Association of State Energy 
                               Officials
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, I am David Terry, Executive Director of the National 
Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), which represents the 56 
State and Territory Energy Directors and their Offices. NASEO submits 
this testimony in support of funding for the ENERGY STAR program 
(within the Climate Protection Partnership Division of the Office of 
Air and Radiation) at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
NASEO supports funding of at least $50 million in FY'24, including 
specific report language directing that the funds be utilized only for 
the ENERGY STAR program. The program received $54 million a decade ago 
and is now down to $38 million. The ENERGY STAR program is successful, 
voluntary, and cost-effective. The program has a proven track record--
it makes sense, it saves energy and money, and Americans embrace it. 
ENERGY STAR helps consumers and businesses control expenditures over 
the long term. The program is strongly supported by product 
manufacturers, utilities, and homebuilders, and ENERGY STAR leverages 
the States' voluntary efficiency actions. Voluntary ENERGY STAR 
activities are occurring in public buildings, such as schools, in 
conjunction with State Energy Offices, in virtually every State, 
including Oregon and Alaska. The States and the public utilize ENERGY 
STAR because it is seen as unbiased and delivers cost-saving benefits 
to businesses, consumers and State and local governments.
    The ENERGY STAR program is focused on voluntary efforts that reduce 
energy waste, promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 
works with States, local governments, communities and business to 
achieve these goals in a cooperative, public-private manner. NASEO has 
worked closely with EPA and approximately 40 States are ENERGY STAR 
Partners. With very limited funding, EPA's ENERGY STAR program 
coordinates with the State Energy Offices to give consumers and 
businesses the opportunity and technical assistance tools to make 
better energy decisions and catalyzes product efficiency improvements 
by manufacturers without regulation or mandates. The program is 
voluntary.
    ENERGY STAR focuses on energy-efficient products as well as 
buildings (e.g., residential, commercial, and industrial). Over 300 
million ENERGY STAR qualified products were sold in 2019 alone, not 
including another 300 million ENERGY STAR certified light bulbs. The 
ENERGY STAR label is recognized across the United States. Approximately 
90 percent of households recognize the ENERGY STAR label and a majority 
of surveyed U.S. households reported having purchased an ENERGY STAR 
product. The manufacturing, installation, design, wholesale 
distribution, and provision of professional services related to ENERGY 
STAR products employed almost 827,000 American workers in 2019. It 
makes the work of the State Energy Offices much easier, by engaging the 
public on easily-recognized products, services, and targets. In order 
to obtain the ENERGY STAR label, a product has to meet established 
guidelines. ENERGY STAR's voluntary partnership programs include ENERGY 
STAR Buildings, ENERGY STAR Homes, ENERGY STAR Small Business, and 
ENERGY STAR Labeled Products. We are also encouraged by the ENERGY STAR 
Home Upgrades Program.
    Marketplace barriers are also eradicated through the ENERGY STAR 
program's collaborative approach to consumer education. State Energy 
Offices are working with EPA to promote ENERGY STAR products, ENERGY 
STAR for new construction, ENERGY STAR for public housing, etc. Another 
ENERGY STAR success is in the manufactured housing sector. Some States 
and utilities offer modest rebates for ENERGY STAR manufactured homes 
in order to deliver both energy cost savings to homeowners and lower 
overall electric grid operation costs for all customers.
    In 2022, millions of consumers and thousands of voluntary partners, 
including manufacturers, builders, businesses, communities, and 
utilities, tapped the value of ENERGY STAR and achieved impressive 
financial and environmental results.
    More than 840 utilities, State, and local governments and non-
profits utilize ENERGY STAR in their energy efficiency programs, as do 
1,800 manufacturers.
    The State Energy Offices are very encouraged by progress made at 
EPA, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, and in our 
States to promote programs to make schools more energy-efficient while 
improving indoor air quality and comfort. In fact, there are over 150 
ENERGY STAR-rated schools in States from Arizona to Maine. In addition, 
many States' private sector partners voluntarily utilize ENERGY STAR to 
promote energy efficiency and lower operating costs.
    EPA provides technical assistance to the State Energy Offices in 
such areas as ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (how to rate the 
performance of buildings), setting an energy target, and financing 
options for building improvements and building upgrade strategies. 
ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager is used extensively by State Energy 
Offices to benchmark performance of State and municipal buildings, 
saving taxpayer dollars. Portfolio Manager is the industry-leading 
benchmarking tool which has been used voluntarily in approximately 50% 
of the commercial buildings in the United States. Portfolio Manager is 
used to measure, track, assess, and report energy and water 
consumption.
    Additionally, the industrial sector embraces ENERGY STAR at job-
creating companies such as GM, Eastman Chemical, Nissan, Raytheon, and 
Boeing. At the close of 2021, more than 750 U.S. industrial sites had 
committed to the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry.
    The State Energy Offices are working cooperatively with our peers 
in the state environmental agencies and state public utilities 
commissions to ensure that programs, regulations, projects and policies 
are developed recognizing both energy and environmental concerns. We 
have worked closely with this program at EPA to address these issues. 
We encourage these continued efforts.
    For example, in Oregon, the State is focused on decarbonization 
efforts, and ENERGY STAR is a useful tool to promote sustained 
investments in energy efficiency. In Alaska, the State has worked with 
partners to promote the Village Energy Efficiency Program, and ENERGY 
STAR has been critical.
    Moreover, Oregon and Alaska have significant ENERGY STAR activities 
underway:

  --Oregon is home to more than 180 businesses and organizations 
        participating in U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR program: 9 
        manufacturers of ENERGY STAR certified products; and 10 
        companies supporting independent certification of ENERGY STAR 
        products and homes 49 companies building ENERGY STAR certified 
        homes. ENERGY STAR Partner Activity in Oregon includes 1.9 
        million customers served by ENERGY STAR utility partners in 
        2020; 3,607 buildings (255 million square feet) benchmarked 
        using EPA's ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager; 26,522 homes earned 
        the ENERGY STAR to-date; 437 buildings earned the ENERGY STAR 
        to-date, including 107 schools, 3 hotels, 6 hospitals, 142 
        office buildings and 5 industrial plants.

  --Alaska is home to more than 20 businesses and organizations 
        participating in U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR program; has 153 
        thousand customers being served by ENERGY STAR utility 
        partners; 437 buildings that have been benchmarked using EPA's 
        ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager; 11,891 homes have earned the 
        ENERGY STAR label; 31 schools, and 4 hospitals.
                               conclusion
    The ENERGY STAR program saves consumers billions of dollars every 
year. The payback and job creation benefits are enormous. NASEO 
supports robust program funding of at least $50 million in FY'24. 
Funding for the ENERGY STAR program is justified. It is a solid public-
private relationship that leverages resources, time and talent to 
produce tangible results by saving energy and money and, in light of 
Administrator Michael Regan's commitment to environmental justice, can 
provide immense benefits to high-need and underserved communities. 
NASEO endorses these activities as well as the constructive 
partnerships that the State Energy Offices have with EPA to 
cooperatively implement a variety of critical national programs without 
mandates.

   Prepared Statement of the National Association of State Foresters
    The National Association of State Foresters (NASF) appreciates the 
opportunity to submit written public testimony to the House Committee 
on Appropriations, subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies regarding our fiscal year (FY) 2024 appropriations 
recommendations. Our priorities focus primarily on appropriations for 
the USDA Forest Service (Forest Service) State, Private, and Tribal 
Forestry (SP&TF) programs, as well as the Research and Development 
(R&D) Forest Inventory and Analysis Program.
    State foresters deliver technical and financial assistance, along 
with forest health, water, and wildfire protection for more than two-
thirds of the Nation's 751 million acres of forests. The Forest Service 
SP&TF mission area provides vital support to deliver these services, 
which contribute to the socioeconomic and environmental health of rural 
and urban areas. The comprehensive process for delivering these 
services is articulated in each State's Forest Resource Assessment and 
Strategy (Forest Action Plan), authorized in the 2008 Farm Bill and 
continued in the 2018 Farm Bill. State Forest Action Plans-completed in 
2010, updated in 2015, and comprehensively revised in 2020 by all 59 
States, U.S. territories, freely associated States, and the District of 
Columbia-offer practical and comprehensive roadmaps for investing 
federal, State, local, and private resources where they can be most 
effective in achieving national conservation goals. SP&TF programs 
provide a significant return on the Federal investment by leveraging 
the boots-on-the-ground and financial resources of State agencies to 
deliver assistance to forest landowners, Tribes, and communities. As 
Federal and State governments continue to face financial challenges, 
state foresters, in partnership with the SP&TF mission area of the 
Forest Service, are best positioned to maximize the effectiveness of 
available resources by focusing work on priority forest issues where 
resources are needed most.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA/BIL) has provided 
game changing support in the form of flexible funding for State Forest 
Action Plan implementation-allowing States to address the highest 
priority forest management activities within their state, as identified 
and developed collaboratively with partners and stakeholders. 
Additionally, the IIJA/BIL provided critical support for the State Fire 
Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance Programs. We look forward to 
working with you to develop pathways for these historic investments to 
continue beyond FY2026.
    Your support of the following programs is critical to helping 
States address the many and varied challenges outlined in Forest Action 
Plans.
    state fire assistance (sfa) and volunteer fire assistance (vfa)
    More people living in fire-prone landscapes, high fuel loads, 
drought, and deteriorating forest health have led most state foresters 
to identify wildland fire as a priority issue in their Forest Action 
Plans. We now grapple with increasingly expensive and complex wildland 
fires--fires that frequently threaten human life and property. In 2022, 
roughly 69,000 wildland fires burned more than 7.5 million acres.\1\ 
State and local agencies respond to the majority of wildfires across 
the country; in 2022 State and local agencies were responsible for 
responding to 57,492 (83%) of the 69,988 reported wildfires across all 
jurisdictions.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SFC and VFC are the fundamental Federal mechanism for assisting 
States and local fire departments in responding to wildland fires and 
in conducting management activities that mitigate fire risk on non-
federal lands. SFC also helps train and equip local first responders 
who are often first to arrive at a wildland fire incident and who play 
a crucial role in keeping fires and their costs as minimal as possible. 
Attacking fires when they are small is the key to reducing fatalities, 
injuries, loss of homes, and cutting Federal fire-fighting costs. The 
need for increased funding for fire suppression on Federal lands has 
broad support. The need to increase fire suppression funding for state 
and private lands, where roughly 80 percent of wildfires occur, and 
where many Federal fires begin, is just as urgent. NASF supports 
funding the State Fire Capacity Program at $79 million, a $3M increase 
from the FY 2023 enacted level. and Volunteer Fire Capacity Program at 
$22 million in FY 2024, a $1M increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.
                    forest pests and invasive plants
    Also among the greatest threats identified in the Forest Action 
Plans are native and non-native pests and diseases which have the 
potential to displace native trees, shrubs, and other vegetation types 
in forests; the Forest Service estimates that hundreds of native and 
non-native insects and diseases damage the Nation's forests each year. 
The growing number of damaging pests and diseases are often introduced 
and spread by way of wooden shipping materials, movement of firewood, 
and through various types of recreation. An estimated 81 million acres 
at risk of attack by insects and disease.\3\ These extensive areas of 
high insect or disease mortality can set the stage for large-scale, 
catastrophic wildfire.

    The Cooperative Forest Health Management program supports 
activities related to prevention, monitoring, suppression, and 
eradication of insects, diseases, and plants through provision of 
technical and financial assistance to States and territories to 
maintain healthy, productive forest ecosystems on non-federal forest 
lands. The Cooperative Forest Health Management program plays a 
critical part in protecting communities already facing outbreaks and in 
preventing exposure of more forests and trees to the devastating and 
costly effects of damaging pests and pathogens. NASF supports funding 
the Forest Health-Cooperative Lands Program at $39.43 million in FY 
2024, a $6.43M increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.
     assisting landowners and maintaining healthy forests--forest 
             stewardship program and forest legacy program
    Actively managed healthy forest landscapes are a vital part of 
rural America, providing an estimated 900,000 jobs, clean water, wood 
products, and other essential services to millions of Americans. Over 
50% of U.S. forestland is privately owned and supports an average of 
eight jobs per 1,000 acres.\4\ However, the Forest Service estimates 
that 57 million acres of private forests in the U.S. are at risk of 
conversion to urban development over the next two decades. Programs 
like the Forest Stewardship Program (FSP) and the Forest Legacy Program 
(FLP) are key tools identified in the Forest Action Plans for keeping 
working forests intact and providing a full suite of benefits to 
society. With the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) signed into law, 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) will receive permanent 
annual funding at the full authorized level, nearly doubling historical 
appropriations for the LWCF. FLP should receive significantly increased 
funding levels commensurate with the increased funding provided to the 
LWCF by the GAOA.

directly to forestland owners, the Forest Stewardship Program often 
serves as a gateway to other landowner cost-share assistance 
programming, like the USDA Environmental Quality Incentives Program, 
State programs, and partner programs, that can help landowners keep 
their forests working and intact. In FY2022, the Forest Stewardship 
Program added 1.68 million acres of new or revised plans for a total of 
over 20 million acres currently enrolled in the program. Forest 
landowners with management plans are almost three times more likely to 
meet their management objectives compared to those without management 
plans. The FSP leads landowners to reach their management objectives 
while tying them to the State's Forest Action Plan. Increased Federal 
funding for FSP will allow state forestry agencies to ramp up outreach 
efforts and provide additional technical assistance to landowners to 
ensure that private forestland acres are maintained. Forest Stewardship 
plans provide guidance for family forest landowners to keep their land 
healthy and productive and often serve as management roadmaps for 
several generations.
    Following congressional direction, NASF has worked closely with the 
Forest Service to modernize the funding allocation formula to State 
agencies for FSP, focused on improving program delivery with greater 
emphasis on performance-based outcomes. Under the new allocation 
formula, priority areas and priority resource concerns have been 
designated in each State and greater emphasis has been placed on 
providing technical assistance and implementing land management plans 
in those priority areas. NASF supports funding for the Forest 
Stewardship Program at $22 million, a $9.5M increase from the FY 2023 
enacted level and the Forest Legacy Program at $128 million in FY 2024, 
a $50M increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.
            urban and community forest management challenges
    Urban forests are essential for achieving energy savings, improved 
air quality, neighborhood stability, aesthetic value, reduced noise, 
and improved quality of life in municipalities and communities around 
the country. Urban trees and forests provide a wide array of social, 
economic, and environmental benefits to people living in urban areas; 
today, more than 83 percent of the Nation's population lives in urban 
areas. Yet, urban and community forests face serious threats, such as 
development and urbanization, invasive pests and diseases, and fire in 
the wildland urban interface (WUI).
    The program is delivered in close partnership with state foresters 
and leverages existing local efforts that have helped thousands of 
communities and towns manage, maintain, and improve their tree cover 
and green spaces. In FY 2022, the U&CF program delivered technical, 
financial, educational, and research assistance to 7,447 communities 
across all 50 States, U.S. territories, three nations in compacts of 
free association with the U.S., and the District of Columbia. NASF 
supports funding the Urban and Community Forestry Program at $42 
million in FY 2024, a $2M increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.
    importance of forest inventory data in monitoring forest issues
    The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, managed by Forest 
Service, Forest and Rangeland Research, is the only comprehensive 
inventory system in the United States for assessing the health and 
sustainability of the Nation's forests across all ownerships. FIA 
provides essential data related to forest species composition, forest 
growth rates, and forest health data, and it delivers baseline 
inventory estimates used in Forest Action Plans. Further, this data is 
used by academics, researchers, industry, and others to understand 
forest trends and support investments in forest products facilities 
that provide jobs and products to society. The program provides 
unbiased information used in monitoring of wildlife habitat, wildfire 
risk, insect and disease threats, invasive species spread, and response 
to priorities identified in the Forest Action Plans.
    As the key partner in FIA program delivery via State contribution 
of matching funds, state foresters look forward to continued work with 
the Forest Service to improve efficiency in delivery of the program to 
meet the needs of the diverse user groups for FIA data. This will 
ensure that, at a minimum, the historical level of base program 
delivery is accomplished, which should include funding the collection 
of data on a 7-year cycle in the east and 10-year cycle in the west. 
NASF appreciates Congress supporting this program with a significant 
increase in FY 2023, and encourages ongoing support of the Forest 
Inventory and Analysis Program at $32.4 million in FY 2024, a $200K 
increase from the FY 2023 enacted level. Furthermore, we continue our 
request that you to work with the Forest Service to establish a budget 
line item for FIA for salaries and expenses.
                   landscape scale restoration (lsr)
    The Landscape Scale Restoration (LSR) program is an important way 
that States address critical forest priorities across the landscape, in 
collaboration with the Forest Service and other partners. LSR projects 
focus on the most critical priorities identified in each State's Forest 
Action Plan and on achieving resource objectives outlined in the 2018 
Farm Bill. The program prioritizes funding projects that reduce the 
risk of uncharacteristic wildfires, improve fish and wildlife habitats, 
maintain or improve water quality and watershed function, mitigate 
invasive species, insect infestation and disease, improve important 
forest ecosystems, and measure ecological and economic benefits 
including air and soil quality and productivity. As a result, LSR 
contributes to achieving results across the landscape and to making 
meaningful local, regional, and national impacts. NASF supports funding 
the Landscape Scale Restoration Program at $20 million in FY 2024, a 
$3M increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.
    NASF appreciates the opportunity to share our FY 2024 
appropriations recommendations for the Forest Service with the 
subcommittee.

     Prepared Statement of National Association of Tribal Historic 
                         Preservation Officers
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the 
subcommittee, I appreciate this opportunity to present the National 
Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers' (NATHPO)'s 
recommendations for Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations. My name is Valerie 
Grussing and I am the Executive Director.
    We greatly appreciated the Committee's decision to include $23 
million in the Tribal line item of the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) 
in the Fiscal Year 2023 Interior Appropriations bill, which matched the 
Biden Administration's request. And we were beyond thrilled that the 
FY23 Omnibus bill followed through on this commitment! What this means 
for THPOs: for the first time in the history of the Federal Tribal 
Historic Preservation Program, funding at this level provides each one 
an average of $108,000 per THPO, which funds one whole staff member per 
Tribe. Following decades of underfunding, we and our members have been 
ecstatic at this increase and its real impacts on THPOs' ability to 
protect Tribal Nations' cultural resources and sacred places.
    It is imperative that the subcommittee continue to close the gap by 
adequately funding the Tribal line item of the HPF. We urge the 
subcommittee to provide funding for Fiscal Year 2024 that continues to 
make up for more than two decades of failures to adequately support the 
Federal THPO program. Specifically, we urge the subcommittee to support 
these funding levels:

1. National Park Service, Historic Preservation Fund, Tribal line item 
    ($34 million)

2. National Park Service, National NAGPRA Program:

  a. Exclusively for NAGPRA Grants ($10 million)

  b. Program administration ($1 million for Program Use)

3. Bureau of Indian Affairs--Create line items and support the 
    following divisions:

  a. Cultural Resource compliance at the 12 Regional BIA Offices ($8 
        million);

  b. Central Office cultural resource efforts throughout the bureau 
        ($800,000);

  c. NAGPRA compliance work ($1.5 million);

  d. To fight ARPA crimes on Indian reservations ($850,000);

  e. Museum property and curation ($400,000).

4. Smithsonian Institution: For repatriation activities, including 
    Review Committee and repatriation office ($3 million)

5. Bureau of Land Management: Tribal Liaison Program, NAGRPA compliance 
    ($3 million)

    What are Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs)? THPOs are 
an exercise of Tribal sovereignty, appointed by federally recognized 
Tribal governments that have an agreement with the Department of the 
Interior to assume the Federal compliance role of the State Historic 
Preservation Officers (SHPO), per the National Historic Preservation 
Act (NHPA). Tribal historic preservation plans are grounded in self-
determination, traditional knowledge, and cultural values, and may 
involve projects to improve Indian schools, roads, health clinics, and 
housing. THPOs are the first responders when a sacred site is 
threatened or when Native ancestors are disturbed by development. THPOs 
are often responsible for their Tribe's oral history programs, 
operating museums and cultural centers, leading revitalization of 
Native traditions and languages, and many more related functions.

    What is NATHPO NATHPO is a national non-profit association of THPOs 
protecting culturally important places that perpetuate Native identity, 
resilience, and cultural endurance.

1. Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), administered by NPS--Tribal line 
item ($34 million)

    As of March 1, 2023, there were 215 National Park Service (NPS)-
recognized THPOs. Each THPO represents an affirmative step by an Indian 
Tribe to assume the responsibilities of the SHPO for their respective 
Tribal lands, as authorized by Congress in the 1992 amendments to the 
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Collectively, they exercise 
responsibilities over a land base exceeding 50 million acres in 30 
States. The HPF is the sole source of Federal funding for THPOs. We 
recommend $34 million to carry out the requirements of the NHPA. This 
would provide the 215 federally recognized THPOs an average of $158,139 
each to run their programs. Funding THPOs and staff creates jobs, 
generates economic development, and spurs community revitalization. It 
also facilitates required environmental and historic review processes, 
including for energy and infrastructure permitting. Tribes don't want 
to stop this development--they need it more than anyone. But they also 
need to reap the benefits rather than just continue to incur the costs. 
If these review processes are to proceed, THPOs must be able to do the 
required work.
    What is at stake? As the number of Indian Tribes with THPO programs 
increases, the amount of HPF funding appropriated to THPOs must catch 
up. Native American cultural properties on millions of acres of Tribal 
lands are at risk. For the past several years, each THPO program has 
been asked to conduct important Federal compliance work with fewer 
financial resources. In the first year of congressional funding support 
for THPOs (FY 1996), the original 12 THPOs each received an average of 
$80,000, while in FY 2022, 208 THPOs received an average of $76,923. 
This funding was inadequate for THPOs to handle their current 
workloads, which have increased exponentially with the enactment of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. Additionally, the number of Tribes with 
a THPO continues to grow; around 10 Tribes successfully establish a 
THPO program each year. The epidemics we see rampant in Indian Country 
are the symptoms of historical trauma--of people systematically cut off 
from their families, languages, practices, and lands. Reconnecting 
Native peoples to their cultural heritage, traditions, and places has 
the power to help heal deep generational wounds. Treating the cause: 
that is the work THPOs do. To continue this work in Indian Country, it 
is essential that THPO programs receive increased funding to meet the 
increasing need. The chart below demonstrates the program growth and 
funding need.

Additional HPF programs administered by the National Park Service:

    NATHPO supports the request of the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation that Congress provide a total FY 2024 HPF appropriation of 
$225 million. Within that funding we recommend:

  --$70 million for State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs);

  --$34 million for Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs);

  --$28 million for competitive grants related to African American 
        Civil Rights;

  --$7 million for the History of Equal Rights Grants program;

  --$13 million for grants to Historically Black Colleges and 
        Universities;

  --$40 million for Save America's Treasures grants;

  --$17 million for Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization grants;

  --$5 million for grants related to communities underrepresented on 
        the National Register of Historic Places and National Historic 
        Landmarks;

  --$5 million for grants related to communities underrepresented on 
        the National Register of Historic Places and National Historic 
        Landmarks;

  --$11 million for the Semiquincentennial grant program to preserve 
        historical sites commemorating the 250th Anniversary of the 
        United States of America.

    We also recommend the Committee encourage the NPS to work with 
States and Tribes to improve what has become a burdensome apportionment 
process so that SHPOs and THPOs can more readily and efficiently access 
funding Congress has allocated for their work.

    2. National Park Service, National NAGPRA Program

    The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) 
provides for the disposition of Native American cultural items \1\ 
removed from Federal or Tribal lands, or in the possession or control 
of museums or Federal agencies, to lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, 
or Native Hawaiian organizations based on descent or cultural or 
geographic affiliation. NAGPRA prohibits trafficking of Native American 
cultural items and created a grants program exclusively for Indian 
Tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and public museums.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Cultural items include human remains, funerary or sacred 
objects, and objects of cultural patrimony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NAGPRA Grants Program:

    The National Park Service is currently revising the regulations 
implementing NAGPRA. These revisions will dramatically increase the 
burden on Indian Tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and museums. We 
request that the NAGPRA grants program be funded at $10 million to be 
used exclusively for NAGPRA Grants to Indian Tribes, Native Hawaiian 
organizations, and museums. We also request that you direct the 
Government Accountability Office to evaluate the effectiveness of this 
grant program.

    Administration of National NAGPRA Program:

    $1 million, additionally, for NAGPRA program administration, 
including the publication of Federal Register notices, grant 
administration, civil penalty investigations, and Review Committee 
costs. We also request that you direct the Government Accountability 
Office to evaluate the effectiveness of the National NAGPRA Program's 
implementation of civil penalty investigations.

    3. Bureau of Indian Affairs--Create line items and support the 
following divisions

    The BIA has federally mandated responsibilities to work with Indian 
Tribes and comply with the NHPA, the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA), NAGPRA, and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA). 
Currently the BIA does not have any budget line items devoted to 
complying with these Federal laws. Funds are not only needed for the 
BIA to comply with their internal development efforts, such as roads 
and forestry, but also to conduct project reviews of outside 
development projects, such as oil and gas development. ARPA crime on 
Indian reservations continues to be a major problem, as looters and 
traffickers continue to steal valuable cultural resources from Tribal 
and Federal lands. Until recently, the BIA did not have any special 
agents or law enforcement forces to combat this uniquely destructive 
crime in Indian Country. There are now four agents nationwide and we 
urge the Committee to enable two additional agents nationwide plus two 
in Alaska.

    NATHPO recommends the BIA create line items and support the 
following divisions:

  a. Cultural Resource compliance at the 12 Regional BIA Offices ($8 
        million);

  b. Central Office cultural resource efforts throughout the bureau 
        ($800,000);

  c. NAGPRA compliance work ($1.5 million);

  d. To fight ARPA crimes on Indian reservations ($850,000);

  e. Museum property and curation ($400,000).

4. Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of the American Indian and 
the National Museum of Natural History Repatriation Programs

    NATHPO requests that the Smithsonian Institution receive $3 million 
specifically directed to expediting its repatriation activities.

5. Bureau of Land Management: Tribal Liaisons and Cultural Resources 
Management

    The BLM oversees the largest, most diverse and scientifically 
important collection of historic and cultural resources on our Nation's 
public lands, as well as the museum collections and data associated 
with them. We appreciate the Committee's commitment to ongoing 
oversight of the Department's reorganization. NATHPO and many other 
organizations are profoundly concerned with the impact of the 
reorganization and loss of staff within the Cultural Resources 
Division. The cultural resources program also supports NHPA Section 106 
review of land-use proposals, Section 110 inventory and protection of 
cultural resources, compliance with NAGPRA, and consultation with 
Tribes and Alaska Native Governments. We are very appreciative of the 
Committee's continuing support for the agency to enhance its National 
Cultural Resources Information Management System (NCRIMS).
    Additionally, responsive to recommendations in the 2010 GAO report 
on NAGPRA, BLM stated at that time that nine new positions and $22 
million were needed to improve compliance. Neither of these has 
happened, and now the current proposed NAGPRA regulation changes are 
anticipated to present further demands that BLM (and other agencies as 
well as Tribes) are not equipped to meet. It is incumbent upon this 
Committee to provide commensurate resources to assist with the critical 
and overdue task of bringing ancestors home. We recommend providing 
specific funding of $3 million above enacted, specifically to continue 
building the vital Tribal Liaison Program, including the Headquarters 
agency lead and 12 State Office positions, and staffing related to 
NAGPRA compliance.
    Thank you for considering our testimony. I would be pleased to 
answer any questions you have.

                                 ______
                                 
       Prepared Statement of the National Endowment for the Arts
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in 
support of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 funding for the National Endowment for 
the Arts (NEA) on behalf of The Creative Coalition. We respectfully 
request the Committee provide $211 million for the NEA in the upcoming 
fiscal year, building on the continued investment made by this 
Committee in Fiscal Year 2023 to support the arts economy of the United 
States.
    Founded in 1989 by prominent members of the entertainment 
community, The Creative Coalition dedicates itself to educating, 
mobilizing, and activating its members on the necessity of access to 
the arts for ALL Americans and the benefit of the arts to our society 
and economy.
    Art is a form of creative expression encompassing various 
disciplines, such as painting, sculpture, music, dance, theatre, 
literature, and film. Each of these aspects is an integral part of our 
society and the economy, reflecting the cultural, social, and economic 
values held. Year after year, the question arises about the importance 
of funding for the arts. While some continue to argue it is an 
unnecessary use of resources, The Creative Coalition sincerely 
appreciates the Committee's and Congress' recognition that Federal 
funding for the arts is a valuable investment, as illustrated by the 
historic level of funding provided to the NEA in the last fiscal year. 
Our testimony today reiterates the benefits of Federal funding for the 
arts, as well as arts education, and why both are prudent investments 
for society and the economy.
    Funding for the arts in education has numerous benefits, both for 
students and society as a whole. First and foremost, art education 
fosters creativity and imagination, two critical skills essential for 
success in any field. Art classes encourage students to think outside 
the box, experiment with different materials, and develop their own 
unique style of expression. This creativity can spill over into other 
subjects, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM)\1\, helping students approach problems and challenges in 
innovative ways.

STEM. New York: State Education Agency Directors of Arts Education
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, art education can have a significant impact on 
academic achievement. Studies have shown that students who participate 
in arts programs tend to have higher grades, better attendance records, 
and are more likely to graduate from high school.\2\ This is because 
art education engages students in learning and helps them develop 
critical thinking skills. For example, a student learning to draw a 
still life must analyze the shapes, proportions, and colors of the 
objects in front of them. This kind of analysis and problem-solving 
applies to other subjects such as science, math, and social studies.

education and the high school dropout problem. Journal of Cultural 
Economics, 39 (4): 327-339
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Arts education also positively impacts the mental health and well-
being of students. According to the CDC's Adolescent Behaviors and 
Experiences Survey, more than 40 percent of high school students 
surveyed expressed feelings of sadness and or hopelessness for weeks at 
a time.\3\ Addressing the mental health crisis is a priority for all 
Americans, especially in the wake of the pandemic that so profoundly 
impacted our collective mental health. Arts education provides 
opportunities for students to improve cognitive development, self-
esteem, and relationship skills to enhance their lives.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, funding for the arts in education can promote cultural 
understanding and tolerance. Art classes expose students to different 
styles, cultures, and traditions, allowing them to appreciate and 
respect diverse perspectives. This appreciation of diversity is 
essential in a globalized and changing world, where understanding 
different cultures and perspectives is becoming increasingly important 
to professional and personal development.
    Funding for the arts is not only a good investment in education but 
also in the economy. The arts sector contributes significantly to the 
economy in terms of job creation and revenue generation. According to 
the Department of Commerce, the arts and culture sector generated $1.02 
trillion in economic activity in 2021, supporting 4.9 million jobs.\5\

us-and-States-2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Funding for the arts can also help revitalize local economies, 
which is another critical contribution as we recover from the pandemic. 
Arts and cultural institutions such as museums, galleries, and theatres 
attract tourists and visitors, stimulating the local economy. These 
visitors spend money on transportation, lodging, food, and other goods 
and services, creating jobs and generating tax revenue. For example, 
the New Orleans French Quarter Festival attracted over 500,000 
visitors, generating a total economic impact of $190 million annually 
for the local economy in 2019.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ French Quarter Festival Facts (2019): https://
frenchquarterfest.org/festival-facts/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, funding for the arts can spur innovation and 
creativity in other industries. Many technological advancements have 
been made possible because of the intersection between art and 
technology. For instance, computer graphics and animation were 
initially developed for the film industry but are now widely used in 
video games, advertising, and virtual reality. This kind of cross-
disciplinary innovation can create new products, services, and 
industries, leading to job creation and economic growth.
    Despite the notable benefits of funding for the arts and arts 
education, some argue it is a waste of limited Federal resources. They 
argue art is a luxury society cannot afford, particularly in times of 
economic hardship, and that private funding can sustain the arts. 
However, this argument ignores the fact that art is not just a form of 
entertainment but an essential component of human expression and 
cultural heritage. It also ignores the mission of the NEA, which is to 
ensure that even the most impoverished Americans experience the arts. 
The NEA funds projects that are unlikely to benefit from private 
funding because of their location.
    Funding for the arts, and thereby the NEA, is not just about 
supporting artists and performers, but also about supporting the 
communities and institutions that promote art. Funding for the arts can 
help maintain and improve museums, galleries, theatres, and other 
sites, which is necessary for local revenue and economic growth. In 
President Biden's FY24 budget request, 40 percent of grant funding for 
promoting the arts is dedicated to NEA's State and Regional Partnership 
Program.\7\ Furthermore, in 2021, nearly 20 percent of NEA projects 
occurred in rural and small communities, impacting Americans from all 
walks of life.\8\

    NEA funding is also directed to Americans and organizations in 
great need of mental health and financial support. Thirty-five percent 
of Arts Endowment grants take place in high-poverty neighborhoods, and 
35 percent of grants reach low-income audiences or underserved 
populations such as people with disabilities, people in institutions, 
and veterans. NEA funding supports military families through its 
Creative Forces program, a collaboration with the Departments of 
Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to serve the unique needs of 
military patients and Veterans diagnosed with traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) and psychological health conditions such as post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). During visits to Walter Reed and Fort Belvoir over the 
years, members of The Creative Coalition have witnessed firsthand the 
healing power of the arts and art therapy. This funding is a necessary 
instrument to better the lives of our heroes through the arts.
    Thank you for this opportunity to submit this testimony, and thank 
you to Congress for demonstrating its support for the arts in America. 
The Creative Coalition again urges the Committee to continue to support 
all Americans' access to the arts by providing at least $211 million 
for the National Endowment of Arts for Fiscal Year 2024.

Coalition and Tim Daly, President, The Creative Coalition.]
                                 ______
                                 
       Prepared Statement of the National Endowment for the Arts
    Thank you for providing the opportunity to submit outside witness 
testimony as you consider investments in vital Federal agencies, 
including the National Endowment for the Arts (Arts Endowment). The 
Western States Arts Federation (WESTAF), a regional partner of the Arts 
Endowment, writes to affirm the integral impact the Endowment plays in 
communities throughout the West. Through innovative programming, 
advocacy, research, technology, and grantmaking, WESTAF encourages the 
creative advancement and preservation of the arts in the West, serving 
the States and jurisdictions of Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, 
Guam, Hawai'i, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, 
Washington, and Wyoming. We express gratitude for Congressional support 
in funding the National Endowment for the Arts and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities in the FY 2023 Interior Appropriations 
bill at the historic level of $207 million to broaden opportunities for 
western Americans to realize the cultural, educational, and economic 
benefits of the arts and to advance creativity and innovation in 
communities across the United States. We know that arts and creativity 
strengthen our Nation. Arts and creativity make us stronger-as 
individuals, families, communities, States and as a country. They are a 
backbone of innovation, prosperity, and thriving people and places. 
Public investment in arts and creativity is a high return investment 
that benefits every American in every city, town and rural community 
nationwide. As such, we urge you to increase the Arts Endowment's FY 
2024 budget to at least $211 million.
    Because of the leadership of Congress, this increase will mean 
expanded investment in arts and culture across the West driven by 
decisions made at the community level, indeed the structure of NEA and 
NEH investments are focused on the local control model. We also urge 
Congress to continue bipartisan support in substantially increasing 
National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the 
Humanities funding in the FY 2024 Interior Appropriations Bill in order 
to broaden opportunities for Western Americans to engage in the 
cultural, educational, and economic benefits of the arts and to advance 
creativity and innovation in communities across the United States. We 
further request you to support the arts sector by allowing the Arts 
Endowment to continue to provide more and larger grants, and offer 
general operating support funding to be provided within the scope of 
its grantmaking to arts and cultural organizations. Finally, we ask 
that Congress maintain parity between the National Endowment for the 
Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities budgets.

    We deeply understand the importance of the Arts Endowment's 
leadership in the West and would like to point out the following:

1.  The Arts Endowment is a significant funder and a positive force for 
        arts development in the West, a fast growing and exceptionally 
        diverse region that is home to nearly a quarter of the U.S. 
        population.

2.  Arts Endowment investment reaches every congressional district in 
        the West and throughout the United States. Its support is a 
        critical component in ensuring that arts funding reaches every 
        community in the U.S. Its support increases the grant making 
        capability of state arts agencies.

3.  The federal-state partnership is vital to the WESTAF region with 
        nine States and jurisdictions receiving over a third of agency 
        funds from the National Endowment for the Arts. Investment is 
        particularly critical to the most rural States and 
        jurisdictions within the region.

4.  Every dollar of Federal funding invested in the National Endowment 
        for the Arts leverages $9 of additional funding nationally. 
        Investment into state arts agencies in our region alone 
        provides a nearly 10:1 return on investment based on 2023 data 
        (see table below). In addition to leveraging significant State 
        and local government dollars, the Arts Endowment is also 
        leading to increased investment of private foundation funds 
        beneficial to arts activity and economic development.

    Examples of the Arts Endowment's support in the West include grants 
for local arts agencies in Juneau and Fairbanks, Alaska to regrant to 
interior communities and direct grants to organizations such as the 
Sitka Fine Arts Camp. Arts Endowment programming also includes Creative 
Forces(r) in partnership with the U.S. Departments of Defense and 
Veterans Affairs to improve the health, well-being, and quality of life 
for military and veteran populations exposed to trauma. The Arts 
Endowment invests in projects that represent all communities in the 
West, but the agency's support has been particularly important to 
engaging rural communities, indigenous communities, young people, and 
the full range of communities and cultures that make up the West in 
terms of race and ethnicity. The Endowment's long standing focus on the 
underserved, prompted in part by Congressional leadership, inspires the 
work of state arts agencies across the West and the work of WESTAF.
    In the West, jobs in creative occupations, creative industries 
earnings, and cultural nonprofit revenues have been on an upward growth 
trajectory for a decade. The National Endowment for the Arts acts as 
the flag bearer for this vital industry in our Nation that in the West 
alone grew by 85% between 2011 and 2020 (Creative Vitality Suite, 
2022).

    Arts and creativity are an American economic engine. According to 
the BEA, in 2021 Arts and cultural economic activity accounted for 4.4 
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), or $1.02 trillion. They 
provide people with the foundation for creativity, equipping an 
innovative workforce, generating new ideas in every field, and keeping 
our Nation globally competitive. Arts and creativity strengthen 
economic health by creating jobs in multiple industries, driving 
tourism, and providing workforce development opportunities for young 
people. Empirical analysis conducted by Douglas Noonan at Indiana 
University studied the role of the arts in economic recovery following 
the Great Recession revealed that the creative sector grew more quickly 
than the general economy. Unlike conventional industrial supply chains, 
the arts often grow independently from other sectors, which helps to 
diversify state economies. States with varied arts ecosystems posted 
bigger economic gains after the Great Recession than their less-
diversified neighbors. Creativity stimulates economic development while 
bolstering civic engagement, making the arts a powerful catalyst for 
building economic strength.
    Since 2020, the arts and cultural sector has faced tremendous 
challenges due to the in-person nature of the sector's work. Due to 
inflation, rising salaries, increased demand for services post-
pandemic, and receding pandemic-related support, experts are predicting 
a fiscal cliff in the sector. Investing in the creative economy will 
allow industries to get back on track and will reap rewards for the 
region and the Nation as a whole.
    Public funding for arts and creativity improves the lives of all 
Americans, equips an innovative workforce, and keeps us competitive 
globally. It is a great example of good management in government that 
fuels public-private partnerships, leverages considerable additional 
public and private investment far surpassing the required Federal match 
of 1:1, and puts tax dollars and decision-making authority into State 
and local hands. We encourage the Senate Interior Appropriations 
subcommittee to work with other Congressional leaders to build a 
specific path to index funding for the National Endowment for the Arts 
and National Endowment for the Humanities at $1 per capita. Currently 
funding is at about $0.62 cents per capita. A more robust agency budget 
would move us toward ensuring that the arts contribute to the present 
and future strength, pride, cohesion and economic success of every 
community in the United States.

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding fiscal 
year FY 2024 funding and thank you for your years of steadfast support 
of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's (NFWF) natural resource 
conservation work. Consistent with its mission, NFWF works to sustain, 
restore and enhance the Nation's fish, wildlife, plants and habitats 
for current and future generations. Many NFWF conservation outcomes 
also enhance nature-based infrastructure that protects communities 
across the Nation from the impacts of flooding, drought, wildfire, and 
other natural threats.
    NFWF will match FY 2024 funding provided to the Foundation at least 
dollar for dollar with non-federal funds to increase conservation 
benefits across the country through local partnerships. NFWF will 
accomplish this by applying 100% of the appropriated funding to on-the-
ground conservation projects with ZERO administrative cost to the 
Federal Government as required by law.
    We believe that NFWF is a sound investment because of our proven 
track record of leveraging Federal funding with private contributions 
to maximize the impact Federal resources can achieve. We appreciate the 
subcommittee's past support and respectfully request your approval of 
funding at the following levels:

  --$3.0 million provided through the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) 
        Management of Lands and Resources appropriation and restoration 
        of legislative bill text directing BLM to provide this funding 
        for NFWF to administer in support of BLM's wildlife 
        conservation efforts \1\;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Prior to the FY18 spending bill, the appropriations language 
required BLM to provide NFWF the full amount of appropriated funds. The 
FY18 appropriation bill changed the law by making the provision of 
funds to NFWF the discretion of the Director of the BLM and removed the 
language from the bill. This created questions about BLM's legal 
authority to provide funding to NFWF and has hindered the two 
organizations' ability to partner in the most effective manner. We 
request that the FY17 bill language be restored in the FY24 bill.

  --$7.032 million provided through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
        Service's Resource Management appropriation and inclusion of 
        this legislative text in the legislation as opposed to the bill 
        report in past years \2\ (same funding level as FY 2023); and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ In the past, the FWS appropriation for NFWF was included in the 
report accompanying the appropriations bill. We respectfully request 
that it be included in bill language. This will make NFWF's direct 
appropriations in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Bill 
consistent across all agencies in the bill and expedite the permitting 
of conservation projects. The exclusion of this provision from the bill 
text increases the time needed by FWS to approve permitting of 
conservation projects and significantly delays the implementation of 
urgent conservation efforts.

  --$3.0 million with the standard bill language through the Forest 
        Service's National Forest System appropriation (same funding 
        level as FY 2023).
                       bureau of land management
    The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has partnered with NFWF for 
many years to further conservation efforts on public lands throughout 
the United States. In the past 5-years (FY 2018--FY 2022), NFWF 
leveraged $10.8M in BLM appropriated funds across 102 projects into a 
total of $63.3 million in on-the-ground conservation impact. NFWF 
continues to work closely with the BLM, other Department of the 
Interior agencies, and 11 western States to achieve significant 
conservation gains.
    For example, the Foundation has administered a program since 2019 
that conserves habitat and migration corridors to maintain healthy 
populations of migratory animals. To date, the program has awarded 
$11.7 million across 52 projects, leveraging $57.5 million in matching 
contributions to generate a total conservation impact of more than 
$69.2 million. The projects collectively will protect 111,060 acres of 
private land from fragmentation through voluntary conservation 
easements; restore 68,000 acres of public, private and Tribal land 
through efforts like invasive weed and conifer removal treatments; 
improve management on 695,500 acres of public, private and Tribal land 
through efforts like grazing and wildlife management plans; remove or 
improve 670 miles of fencing to be more wildlife friendly, reducing 
direct mortality and increasing landscape connectivity; and reconnect 
307 miles of migration corridors for big game species.
    The committee's support for continuing funding for NFWF from BLM 
appropriations would help continue this work and help drive other 
conservation outcomes. For FY22, NFWF worked with BLM's Wildlife 
Division to determine allocations and priorities for four NFWF program 
landscapes, including Northern Great Plains, RESTORE Colorado, Pecos 
Watershed Conservation Initiative, and Southwest Rivers Headwaters. 
These programs focus on outcomes including perennial grassland 
management through the Northern Great Plains Program; wet meadow and 
sagebrush restoration through the Rocky Mountain Rangeland Program; 
watershed and associated upland restoration to benefit declining 
species through the Pecos, and emerging Gila River Initiatives. Other 
BLM partnership areas of interest include pollinator recovery through 
the Monarch Butterfly and Pollinators Conservation Fund and desert 
conservation through a new Mojave Desert Tortoise Initiative. Each of 
these programs provides opportunities to leverage BLM resources with 
corporate and foundation private sector partners.

    Requested restoration of FY17 BLM Bill Language for FY 2024:

                ``; of which $3,000,000 shall be available in fiscal 
                year 2024 subject to a match by at least an equal 
                amount by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for 
                cost shared projects supporting conservation of Bureau 
                lands; and such funds shall be advanced to the 
                Foundation as a lump-sum without regard to when 
                expenses are incurred.''
                united states fish and wildlife service
    The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has been a 
trusted partner since NFWF was created by Congress in 1984. In the past 
5-years (FY 2018--FY 2022), NFWF leveraged $34.2M in FWS appropriated 
funds across 344 projects into a total of $185.2 million in on-the-
ground conservation impact. The funds appropriated to NFWF serve as a 
magnet to attract funds from the private sector to create public-
private partnerships critical to restoring fish, wildlife, eco-system 
restoration, improving aquatic passage, addressing climate change, and 
increasing natural processes for immediate carbon sequestration.
    In the past, the FWS appropriation for NFWF has existed in the 
report accompanying the appropriations bill. However, we respectfully 
request that it be included in bill language. This will make NFWF's 
direct appropriations in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies 
Bill consistent across all agencies in the bill and expedite the 
permitting of conservation projects. The exclusion of the FWS 
appropriation for NFWF from bill text increases the time needed to 
approve permitting of conservation projects and significantly delays 
the implementation of urgent conservation efforts.

    Requested FWS Bill Language for FY 2024:

                ``; of which $7,032,000 shall be available in fiscal 
                year 2024 subject to a match by at least an equal 
                amount by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for 
                cost-shared projects supporting conservation of 
                wildlife and other natural resources; and such funds 
                shall be advanced to the Foundation as a lump-sum grant 
                without regard to when expenses are incurred.''

    Additionally, because NFWF works with FWS on discretionary 
cooperative agreements for conservation programs, we respectfully 
support the highest possible funding levels for the Delaware River 
Basin Conservation Act, Klamath Basin Restoration, Chesapeake WILD 
program, efforts to combat white-nosed syndrome in bats, and Recovery 
Challenge matching grants within the FWS, Resource Management 
appropriation.
                      united states forest service
    Congress has appropriated approximately $3 million in annual 
funding to NFWF for partnerships with the United States Forest Service 
(USFS) since FY 1998. In the past 5-years (FY 2018--FY 2022), NFWF 
leveraged $15.0M in USFS appropriated funds across 198 projects into a 
total of $110.5 million in on-the-ground conservation impact. This 
partnership between NFWF and USFS has proven extremely successful 
providing a 7:1 return on investment for Federal USFS dollars. We 
respectfully request that the Committee continue supporting cost 
effective partnership.

    Retain US Forest Service Language for FY 2023 as it has been in 
past years:

                ``Pursuant to section 2(b)(2) of Public Law 98-244, up 
                to $3,000,000 of the funds available to the Forest 
                Service may be advanced to the National Fish and 
                Wildlife Foundation in a lump sum to aid cost-share 
                conservation projects, without regard to when expenses 
                are incurred, on or benefitting National Forest System 
                lands or related to Forest Service programs: Provided, 
                That such funds shall be matched on at least a one-for-
                one basis by the Foundation or its sub-recipients: 
                Provided further, That the Foundation may transfer 
                Federal funds to a Federal or non-Federal recipient for 
                a project at the same rate that the recipient has 
                obtained the non-Federal matching funds.''
                    environmental protection agency
    NFWF has partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
since FY 1997 and since FY 2000 has worked with EPA to make grants to 
States and other grantees within the Geographic Programs appropriation. 
Therefore, we respectfully support the highest possible funding levels 
for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of 
Mexico, and Long Island Sound within the Environmental Protection 
Agency Geographic Programs. We also respectfully ask that the long-
standing report language that delineates the amount of funding for 
nutrient and sediment removal grants and small watershed grants within 
the Chesapeake Bay program be continued (Approved FY 2023 Senate 
language is below).

                Chesapeake Bay.-The Committee recommends $91,000,000 
                for the Chesapeake Bay program. The Committee directs 
                the Agency to allocate this funding and the Fiscal Year 
                2023 supplemental appropriation of $47,600,000 provided 
                in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public 
                Law 117-58) to support the three successful grant 
                programs that drive conservation dollars to State and 
                local partners as follows: at least $20,500,000 for 
                nutrient and sediment removal grants; at least 
                $25,500,000 for small watershed grants to control 
                polluted runoff from urban, suburban, and agricultural 
                lands; and at least $22,708,000 for State-based 
                implementation in the most effective basins.

    An example of a project made possible with EPA Geographic Programs 
funding is the Nutrient and Sediment Reduction through Healthy Soils 
and Regenerative Agriculture project. NFWF awarded $764,000 which was 
matched by the grantee with another $764,800 to a total conservation 
impact of $1,528,000. The project will use partnerships to catalyze 
nutrient and sediment reduction through healthy soils and regenerative 
agriculture in Maryland. Project will combine entry-level educational 
opportunities, advanced peer-to-peer learning via knowledge 
cooperatives; financial incentives for practice implementation; state-
specific economic case studies; and vouchers for technical assistance 
to support the adoption of soil health management systems (SHMS) and 
drive demand for soil health resources.
                            nfwf background
    NFWF was established by Congress in 1984 to catalyze private 
investments to conserve fish, wildlife and their habitats. NFWF raises 
private funds not only to leverage appropriated dollars, but also to 
support the associated management costs of implementing the 
appropriated funds. Since its creation by Congress in 1984, NFWF and 
its partners have funded more than 21,600 projects and supported more 
than 6,000 grantee organizations. The Foundation's investments since 
its founding have leveraged matching contributions from grantees and 
other partners to generate a total conservation impact of $8.1 billion.
    NFWF remains fully transparent and is required by law to notify 
Congress 30 days in advance of every grant that exceeds $10,000 in 
Federal funds. Details of all projects awarded during FY 2022 can be 
found in NFWF's annual investment guide and all NFWF's grants can be 
found on our website: https://www.nfwf.org/grants/grants-library
    In FY 2022, NFWF was audited by an independent accounting firm and 
issued an unqualified report with no material weaknesses identified and 
no deficiencies identified. This is the FOURTEENTH consecutive year of 
unqualified audits. In addition, NFWF has continually qualified as a 
low-risk auditee under OMB guidelines.
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and members of the 
subcommittee, we greatly appreciate your continued support and stand 
ready to answer any questions you or your staff might have.

Relations, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.]
                                 ______
                                 
         Prepared Statement of the National Humanities Alliance
    On behalf of the National Humanities Alliance (NHA), with our more 
than 260 member organizations, I write to express strong support for 
the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).
                                overview
    For FY 2024, we respectfully urge the subcommittee to consider no 
less than $211 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities.
    While we recognize the difficult choices that are before this 
subcommittee, we believe that expanding the capacity of the NEH is 
essential at this moment in the Nation's history, when the humanities 
are so needed to 1) build strong communities and foster civic dialogue; 
2) preserve cultural heritage, including Indigenous languages; 3) 
cultivate knowledge of world histories and cultures; and 4) shore up 
local tourism economies and community institutions.
    The NEH has a clear track record of supporting programs that work 
towards these ends, and additional capacity is needed to ensure that 
these crucial goals are met around the country. The NEH does not have 
the capacity to fund many of the highly rated proposals it receives-in 
FY 2020, 1,605 applications with high ratings were not funded, 
amounting to a total of $184,789,512.
        building strong communities and fostering civic dialogue
    NEH funding builds strong, civically-engaged communities through 
its support of cultural organizations. The agency's grantmaking helps 
establish and sustain robust community institutions, providing 
opportunities for learning, empathy, and understanding. The 
International Storytelling Center in Jonesborough, Tennessee, regularly 
hosts programs that promote discussion and dialogue. Ninety-three 
percent of respondents to an NHA survey indicated that they were 
``motivated to listen to the stories of people whose background was 
different from their own'' after participating in a program featuring 
the stories of Black Appalachians. Meanwhile, Dialogues on the 
Experiences of War grants strengthen communities by offering veterans 
the chance to reflect upon their experiences while building bonds with 
each other and with civilians. Ninety-nine percent of respondents 
across eight programs reported a desire to ``keep in touch with some of 
the people [they] met during the program.'' Programs have been held 
throughout the U.S. and are tailored to local audiences. In California, 
San Francisco's Chinese Historical Society of America is hosting a 
program on Chinese American Veteran experiences, while Cal Poly 
Pomona's program featured California voices more broadly. In Maryland, 
Bowie State University's program brings together ROTC cadets, student 
Veterans, and Veterans from the broader community, while a 2017 program 
hosted by the University of Maryland was designed for women Veterans.
    NEH funding has an especially outsized role in small and rural 
communities, where it can build and support the infrastructure and 
programs that are vital to strong communities. Foundational support 
from the NEH has enabled Bend, Oregon's High Desert Museum to create 
engaging exhibitions and programs that showcase the region's diverse 
history. Recently, NEH funding has helped the museum strengthen 
relationships with and support for local Indigenous populations. In 
Matewan, West Virginia, NEH funding has proven transformative for the 
grassroots Mine Wars Museum, enabling it to hire staff, engage with 
partners and stakeholders, and create events for the local community 
that explore the region's significance to U.S labor history and the 
struggle to unionize the southern coalfields. And in Red Cloud, 
Nebraska, NEH funding helped the Willa Cather Foundation expand its 
facilities and programming, having a robust impact on the rural town of 
1,000 as both an employer and as an educational and cultural center 
that hosts theatrical adaptations on Cather's work, children's film 
screenings, and an annual conference.
      preserving cultural heritage, including indigenous languages
    Our cultural heritage lives in many forms, from presidential 
letters and great works of art to community archives and endangered 
languages. It is also vulnerable and requires protection from natural 
and man-made disasters as well as decay over time. NEH funding is 
indispensable to ensuring that our cultural heritage is both accessible 
now and preserved for future generations. The NEH funds documentary 
editions that make the papers of significant Americans accessible-from 
The Papers of John Adams and Civil War Governors of Kentucky to New 
Mexico's Amador Family Correspondence, 1856-1949. In a partnership with 
the Library of Congress, the agency's Chronicling America program is 
digitizing the historic newspapers of every State. And the NEH helps 
small and mid-size institutions invest in their own preservation needs. 
Institutions such as Dothan, Alabama's Wiregrass Museum of Art and the 
Stillwater Public Library in Oklahoma have used NEH funds to help 
ensure their collections are protected for the future.
    Funding for documenting traditional cultures and endangered 
languages supports Indigenous people throughout the United States. 
Through the Dynamic Language Infrastructure-Documenting Endangered 
Languages (DEL) program, a partnership with the National Science 
Foundation, NEH funding has preserved and made accessible languages 
spoken by Indigenous communities, having a profound impact on their way 
of life. In North Dakota, DEL grants have supported Sitting Bull 
College's Standing Rock Lakota/Dakota Language Project, including funds 
for a Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program and to expand an 
accessible digital language archive. NEH support for the Coeur d'Alene 
Online Language Resource Center helped create a single, searchable 
repository for a wide range of language resources, from dictionaries to 
archival recordings of personal narratives and coyote stories. The NEH 
additionally supports the documentation and revitalization of 
Indigenous American languages through its regular grant programs.
          cultivating knowledge of world history and cultures
    Established in the midst of the Cold War, the NEH has always 
provided funding to support research and programs that help Americans 
understand and engage with timely world issues. From scholarly 
exchanges with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and language 
institutes in the 1970s to international research support for American 
scholars and professional development for schoolteachers today, NEH 
funding supports efforts to understand other nations' languages, 
cultures, and geopolitical contexts. NEH funding has supported the 
research and publication of books such as Treason in Transit: Soviet 
Defectors and the Borders of the Cold War World (2022), by Erik R. 
Scott, and Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956 
(2013)- among many other works of history that shed light on current 
events. NEH-supported English translations of Ukrainian literature, 
including Words for War: New Poems from Ukraine (2017) and The White 
Chalk of Days: The Contemporary Ukrainian Literature Series Anthology 
(2017) bring Ukrainian literature to broader American audiences.
    NEH funding also provides high-quality education on world affairs 
for school teachers and college educators. Using the Holocaust as a 
case study, Kean University's 2021 two-week seminar ``The Search for 
Humanity after Atrocity'' helped higher education faculty integrate 
atrocity studies into their research and curricula. A 2016 program for 
K-12 educators, hosted by Ferris State University, explored U.S.-
Russian/Soviet relations from 1776 to the present. Moreover, from 2013-
2018, a series of NEH grants helped community colleges throughout the 
U.S. integrate the study of world cultures into their curricula. These 
programs included content on Latin America, Asia, Russia, Eastern 
Europe, and the Middle East, among other topics.
 building local tourism economies and shoring up community institutions
    NEH funding catalyzes growth in local tourism economies and shores 
up local institutions so that they can continue serving their 
communities. A series of grants to the Dubuque County Historical 
Society, in Iowa, helped the organization transform from a small, 
regional museum into a world-class institution dedicated to the 
Mississippi River and its history-one that contributes more than $10.5 
million per year to the local economy. NEH support has also proven 
crucial to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, which is an important 
economic driver in its Virginia region: 50 percent of the site's 
400,000 annual visitors stay in a hotel for at least one night, 
contributing no less than $13.1 million to the local economy.
    Humanities organizations play a crucial role in their communities, 
and NEH funding helps ensure their financial stability and longevity. 
From offering COVID relief funding to New Hampshire's Currier Museum of 
Art, to supporting Appalshop following historic flooding in Kentucky, 
NEH funding helps cultural organizations survive times of crisis. NEH 
funding also offers crucial financial support necessary for 
accomplishing the more mundane tasks that private funders often 
overlook, such as replacing the roof on Libby, Montana's Heritage 
Museum or upgrading HVAC systems and improving ADA compliance at 
Detroit's Opera House.

         Prepared Statement of the National Indian Health Board
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and the distinguished 
members of this subcommittee, on behalf of the National Indian Health 
Board (NIHB) and the 574 sovereign federally recognized American Indian 
and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribal nations we serve, thank you for the 
opportunity to provide testimony on the Indian Health Service (IHS).
    Tribal nations have a unique legal and political relationship with 
the United States. Through its acquisition of land and resources, the 
United States formed a fiduciary relationship with Tribal nations 
whereby it has recognized a trust relationship to safeguard Tribal 
rights, lands, and resources.\1\ In fulfillment of this Tribal trust 
relationship, the United States ``charged itself with moral obligations 
of the highest responsibility and trust'' toward Tribal nations.\2\ 
Congress reaffirmed its duty to provide for Indian health care when it 
enacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. Sec. 1602), 
declaring that it is the policy of this Nation, in fulfillment of its 
special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to Indians-to 
ensure the highest possible health status for Indians and to provide 
all resources necessary to effect that policy. Unfortunately, those 
responsibilities and legal obligations remain unfulfilled and Indian 
Country remains in a health crisis.

                  the health status of indian country
    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now reports 
that life expectancy for AI/ANs has declined by nearly 7 years, and 
that our average life expectancy is now only 65 years-equivalent to the 
Nationwide average in 1944.\3\ With a life expectancy 10.9 years less 
than the National average,\4\ Native Americans die at higher rates that 
those of other Americans from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
diabetes mellitus, unintentional injuries, assault/homicide, 
intentional self-harm/suicide, and chronic lower respiratory 
disease.\5\ Native American women are 4.5 times more likely than non-
Hispanic white women to die during pregnancy.\6\ The CDC also found 
that, between 2005 and 2014, every racial group experienced a decline 
in infant mortality except for Native Americans \7\ who had infant 
mortality rates 1.6 times higher than non-Hispanic whites and 1.3 times 
the National average.\8\ Native Americans are also more likely than 
people in other U.S. demographics to experience trauma, physical abuse, 
neglect, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\9\ Additionally, Native 
Americans experience some of the highest rates of psychological and 
behavioral health issues as compared to other racial and ethnic groups 
\10\ which have been attributed, in part, to the ongoing impacts of 
historical trauma.\11\ The chronic underfunding of the IHS is one 
significant contributing factor to this disparities.

          the resources provided to the indian health service
    Although annual appropriations for IHS have increased significantly 
since 2009, after adjusting for inflation and population growth, the 
IHS budget has remained static in recent decades.\12\ In December 2018, 
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights' Broken Promises report found that 
Tribal nations face an ongoing funding crisis that is a direct result 
of the United States' chronic underfunding of Indian health care for 
decades, which contributes to vast health disparities between Native 
Americans and other U.S. population groups.\13\ We saw this crisis 
manifest in the worst way possible during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
now we see it in the data.

    Supplemental appropriations enacted during the pandemic were 
historic investments for Indian Country. It cannot be lost to history 
that Congress' swift action saved lives, democracy saved lives, but it 
must also be clear that the IHS is so disproportionately underfunded by 
Congress that a historic investment in response to a global virus still 
provided less resources than the estimate of annual obligations for IHS 
services--an amount collaboratively developed each year by the IHS 
National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup.
    According to IHS data from April 2022, actual IHS spending per user 
remains less than half of Medicaid spending per enrollee, less than 
half of Veterans medical spending per patient, and less than one-third 
of Medicare spending per beneficiary--even after including 3rd party 
revenue received by IHS.\14\ The Federal Disparity Index Benchmark, 
which assumes IHS users are provided services similar to those 
available to the U.S. population, recommends more than twice the 
investment per user than IHS receives \15\--an estimate that excludes 
approximately two-thirds of the population that could be served by an 
appropriately funded IHS.\16\

of January 2020 at 2.56 million; The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the 
AI/AN population as of July 2021 at 7.2 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Congress provides more than $1 trillion in resources for Federal 
health care each year, it just disproportionately under funds IHS. When 
comparing FY 2023 omnibus spending for IHS to other Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) spending, only 0.66 percent of the 
total funding is provided to IHS. While this analysis of HHS spending 
includes spending from other Appropriations subcommittee jurisdictions, 
it underscores the purposeful inequity that continues to result in AI/
ANs with some of the worst health statistics. Surely, this cannot be 
the highest possible health status promised by the United States in the 
Indian Health Care Improvement Act.
  just like our life expectancy--u.s. spending policy is stuck in the 
                            termination era
    Regardless of the Fund source or authorizing provision, Congress is 
making an annual budget policy decision much like the dark Termination 
Era policy that we pretend is behind us. Tribes and their citizens 
originally had a system of health care delivery imposed on them. 
Meanwhile, States and local governments violated Tribes' tax 
jurisdiction, effectively rendering Tribal nations without a way to 
fund basic infrastructure and governance in often isolated and 
drastically reduced or wholly taken lands. As part of this imposed 
system, the resources provided to the IHS have been chronically 
underfunded and measurably unequal compared to investments in other 
U.S. populations. We see this systematic isolation, sovereign 
infringement, forced dependence, assimilation, and termination in the 
annual appropriations process each year. We feel it in our communities, 
and the outcomes and data have been placed before us. We cannot expect 
Tribal communities' health to improve when they are consistently 
starved for resources. Too often, Tribal nations are trapped in a 
Federal funding structure operating on the assumption that only State 
governments are worthy of base funding, essentially, assuming that we 
do not exist as jurisdictional sovereigns.
               full funding for the indian health service
    Since 2003, Tribal leaders, technical advisors, and other policy 
advisors have met during the annual national Tribal Budget Formulation 
work session to collaboratively develop an estimate for full IHS 
funding. The IHS need-based funding aggregate cost estimate for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2024 is approximately $51.4 billion, and the cost estimate 
for FY 2025 is $53.8 billion.\17\ For FY 2024 and 2025, the Workgroup 
continues to request the Hospitals & Health Clinics ($13.6 billion for 
FY 2025) and Purchased/Referred Care ($9.1 billion for FY 2025) IHS 
line items receive the largest increase. The Workgroup also continues 
to request the Alcohol and Substance Abuse ($4.8 billion for FY 2025), 
Mental Health ($4.5 billion for FY 2025), Indian Health Care 
Improvement Fund ($3.7 billion for FY 2025), and Healthcare Facilities 
Construction ($2.5 billion for FY 2025) line items receive the next 
largest increases for IHS. The annual Workgroup request includes a 
detailed justification for spending by IHS account or budget policy 
issue and NIHB supports the Tribally-driven, data-based cost estimates 
and justifications of the National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup 
for the IHS.\18\

            mandatory funding for the indian health service
    IHS spending should be provided through mandatory direct 
appropriations with adjustments for inflation and population growth in 
an allocation mutually agreed to by Tribal governments. NIHB supports 
Tribes in their call for a direct appropriation codified in statute. 
Additionally, and as this subcommittee has reported for years, certain 
IHS account payments, such as Contract Support Costs and Payments for 
Tribal Leases, fulfill obligations that are typically addressed through 
mandatory spending. Inclusion of accounts that are mandatory in nature 
under discretionary spending caps has resulted in a net reduction on 
the amount of funding provided for Tribal programs and, by extension, 
the ability of the Federal Government to fulfill its promises to Tribal 
nations.
             expand and sustain ihs advance appropriations
    Until such time that IHS is provided mandatory direct 
appropriations, advance appropriations for the IHS are consistent with 
the trust and treaty obligations reaffirmed by the United States in the 
Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The advance appropriation enacted 
in the FY 2023 omnibus excluded certain accounts in the IHS budget and 
flat-funded the IHS accounts that it did include. While historic in its 
inclusion, a flat-funded IHS needs FY 2024 adjustments, at a minimum, 
for fixed costs and staffing for newly completed facilities and should 
also include the amounts requested by the IHS National Tribal Budget 
Formulation Workgroup. As the process begins to normalize, both IHS and 
Tribes have the collaborative tools to produce reliable advance 
appropriation requests. For this appropriations cycle, Tribes have 
already provided official input on the FY 2025 budget to IHS with 
representatives of the Office of Management and Budget in attendance.
hold the indian health service harmless in any spending cuts or control 
                                measures
    The IHS budget remains so small in comparison to the National 
budget that spending cuts or budget control measures would not result 
in any meaningful savings in the National debt, but it would devastate 
Tribal nations and their citizens. As Congress considers funding 
reductions in FY 2024, IHS must be held harmless. As we saw in FY 2013 
poor legislative drafting subjected our tiny, life-sustaining, IHS 
budget to a significant loss of base resources. Congress must ensure 
that any budget cuts--whether automatic or explicit--hold IHS and our 
people harmless. We cannot balance the budget on the backs of the First 
Americans.
                               conclusion
    This subcommittee can break the cycle of inequity. You can each 
stop terminating our people. Tribal nations seek no more than the duty 
affirmed and reaffirmed by the U.S. Constitution, treaties, statutes, 
court decisions, and Federal administrative law. The Budget Committee 
and Appropriations Committee must put the spending caps in place to 
achieve Tribal health spending equity, and this subcommittee must 
prioritize IHS funding within its jurisdiction. We thank you, again, 
for the opportunity to provide testimony and look forward to working 
with you for the betterment of the American people. Again, we encourage 
you to review in detail the Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup's 
request for IHS, which is available on NIHB's website.

                                 ______
                                 
     Prepared Statement of National Parks Conservation Association
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on 
behalf of National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). Founded in 
1919, NPCA is the leading national, independent voice for protecting 
and enhancing America's National Park System for present and future 
generations. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our views 
regarding the National Park Service (NPS) FY24 budget and provide 
commentary on related agencies supporting park wildlife and resources.
    We fear the impact an impending budget deal could have on the 
National Park Service in FY24 and even beyond. Ten years ago, the 
failure of the Budget Control Act of 2011 to prevent a budgetary 
sequester led to a six percent cut to NPS that was deeply damaging. NPS 
lost 1,900 permanent and seasonal staff while superintendents were 
forced to close facilities, reduce park or facility opening hours, 
eliminate visitor programs or otherwise make hard decisions that 
threatened resource protection and undermined visitor access. Our 
parks-and the countless gateway economies and American families that 
depend on them-cannot afford to again fall to the cutting room floor. 
The FY24 budget and appropriations process should instead allow for a 
needed increase for NPS.
 our highest priority: support for the operation of the national park 
                             system (onps)
    We commend the committee for increases to the ONPS account in 
recent years, in particular the significant $153 million increase in 
FY23. These funds were direly needed to help address the challenges 
resulting from years of losing ground. The increase is providing for 
nearly 500 staff (in FTEs) that can return to parks and supporting 
offices to address their many urgent needs. We urge the committee to 
build on this increase to continue restoring staffing and provide other 
resources to operate our parks.
    We request a $266 million increase for ONPS above FY23 levels, 
which is equivalent to the president's FY24 request. There is much 
justification for this level of an increase. We respect, however, that 
this will likely be a difficult year with a constrained allocation. In 
this event, we urge the committee to-at a minimum-meet NPS' $125 
million in fixed costs. These fixed costs are significant because NPS 
is a personnel-heavy agency, which requires annual Cost of Living 
Adjustments, merit increases, insurance rate increases and other costs. 
With inflation and materials costs on the rise, superintendents also 
have increased costs like fuels, contracting with the private sector, 
and procurement. Providing for these uncontrollable costs would at 
least allow NPS to stay level in real terms because flat funding in 
reality would mean that superintendents would have to make cuts.
    Unfortunately, NPS is still struggling with basic operating needs 
due to the impact of these uncontrollable fixed costs and the long-term 
erosion of staffing levels that preceded last year's increase. This 
understaffing is being compounded by record visitation increases. 
Between 2012 and 2022, NPS gradually lost 13% of its staff capacity, or 
nearly 3,000 FTEs. Meanwhile, visits to NPS sites grew by 10 percent. 
Even after the FY23 increase, NPS is still more than 2,600 FTEs below 
staffing levels in FY12.
    High visitation and related needs further accentuate the need for a 
sizable ONPS increase: It would be difficult to overstate the impact of 
park superintendents' reduced spending power and inability to refill 
lapsed positions, particularly in the context of increased visitation 
and the challenge of adapting our parks to a rapidly changing climate. 
Because of insufficient personnel, sometimes compounded by the need to 
divert staff to high visitation, staff commonly cover multiple 
collateral duties. It is not uncommon to have, for example, 
interpretive staff addressing increased restroom use or law enforcement 
assisting with cars in parking lots. As a result, other needs go 
unaddressed and morale sinks. Natural and cultural resource protection, 
research and monitoring, programming, and other services central to 
parks meeting their mission go unaddressed or delayed indefinitely.
    ONPS funding must include personnel to implement management changes 
including visitation planning processes needed in numerous parks. Parks 
have many different tools and techniques that can help protect 
resources and ensure a quality visitor experience, but they all require 
additional resources to research and implement. NPS should have the 
capacity to systematically study outcomes to adapt and improve plans 
and ensure they provide fair and equitable access for currently 
underrepresented communities. Funding should also provide for 
maintenance staff dedicated to visitor facilities and for project 
compliance and oversight. These challenges are discussed more below.
    ONPS support for cultural resources is needed: We commend the 
increases appropriators have been providing for the Historic 
Preservation Fund. However, despite these and other investments in 
cultural and historic resources, the ability for NPS to staff its 
cultural resource operations has fallen disproportionately. Inventory 
and monitoring, climate-related needs, museum collections and more are 
all overdue for added investments through ONPS. FY24 is an opportunity 
to help meet these needs and highlight the importance of NPS' world-
class, nationally significant cultural and historic resources through 
an enhanced investment in cultural resource stewardship. A significant 
shortfall in cultural resources funding has undermined the agency's 
ability to plan and manage the resources in their care. It is difficult 
to impossible to care for these resources when NPS has not been able to 
even properly inventory the resources they are tasked with stewarding. 
Given the threat of climate change to cultural resources under the care 
of NPS, we commend the president's proposed investment in Cultural 
Resources Climate Assessment Teams. More must be done in the coming 
fiscal years to bring the budgetary attention to cultural resources 
more on par with natural resource stewardship.
    NPS Housing: Unfortunately, the lack of affordable housing facing 
countless Americans has been taking a toll on NPS' capacity to house 
its employees. Rent and home sale prices have increased prohibitively 
so that as staff who have long served parks retire, new incoming staff 
cannot afford to live near parks. In absence of housing within a 
reasonable commuting distance and with limited housing stock in parks, 
prospective park employees turn down jobs and superintendents struggle 
to fill positions even when funds are available. We commend the 
committee for its increase in FY23 for the NPS housing program and the 
president's requested FY24 increases. We ask the committee to continue 
investing in this program through multiple accounts to help address 
this issue.
    Management Planning: We are concerned that planning is not 
happening at the pace needed to guide park decision-making, especially 
when considering the dual and intersecting challenges of climate change 
and skyrocketing visitation at may parks. NPS must be equipped to 
successfully respond to rapidly evolving and increasing visitor use to 
meet one of its major challenges. We urge investments to conduct 
research and prepare and implement visitor use management plans. 
Visitor experience and impacts to resources are key considerations. 
There are many visitors, some of whom are relative newcomers to outdoor 
recreation, whose behaviors can threaten not only their safety and that 
of search and rescue crews, but also resources, some of which are 
vulnerable to climate change. Concerns include disturbance to 
vegetation and soils, wildlife, and aquatic systems; impacts to 
cultural resources; human waste impacts; introduction of non-native 
species; and impacts to natural sounds. NPS needs support to determine 
carrying capacities that consider higher temperatures, fire, drought, 
flooding, and other climate change impacts that may compound visitation 
challenges.
    NPS should be equipped to provide staff and resources to collect 
baseline data on visitation and resource conditions to inform visitor 
use management planning processes; enhance NPS' capacity for social 
science to guide visitor use management planning and adaptive 
management; study the application of recreation ecology science in 
visitor use management planning; and support coordinated regional 
visitor use management planning with gateway communities and other 
agencies. With careful planning, visitor use management tools can also 
help ensure fair and equitable access for young and more diverse 
audiences to discover their parks. NPS can also improve its 
communications systems to reach new and underrepresented communities.
    Investing in park operations can assist NPS with needs related to 
climate change adaptation, resiliency and mitigation. Disaster relief 
funding is also critical. Our national parks are on the front lines of 
climate change, between storm surges, wildfire risks, and threatened 
wildlife habitat and irreplaceable cultural sites. Helping our parks 
adapt to a changing climate requires funding. These investments can be 
made across diverse subaccounts within park operations, including 
Cultural and Natural Resource Stewardship. The president's FY24 budget 
contains many needed investments that we support.
    Among other climate-related needs, funding is vital to relocate 
facilities threatened by erosion and storm surges, combat invasive 
species, address catastrophic wildfires, provide critical air and water 
quality monitoring and otherwise inventory and monitor cultural and 
natural resources to identify threats and develop adaptive management 
strategies. Management planning is needed in many areas including 
related to climate and increased visitation.
    Catastrophic weather events increasingly related to climate 
continue to cause massive harm to park communities and infrastructure. 
We commend the committee for its $1.5 billion investment in NPS 
disaster relief last year, which will go a long way to address the 
damage that was caused to numerous parks. We hope that this year will 
be a less damaging one for parks and communities. However, when 
disasters strike, we urge the committee to respond with needed 
investments for our parks whether through supplementals or annual 
appropriations bills.
    We encourage continuing support for the Heritage Partnership 
Program. This program supports National Heritage Areas (NHAs) in dozens 
of communities throughout the country. NHAs are strong examples of 
truly effective public-private partnerships established in support of 
conservation and preservation values. Heritage areas allow local 
experts to better protect and interpret stories and resources that are 
both regionally distinct and nationally significant. The Federal 
funding NHAs receive must be matched dollar for dollar with money from 
a non-federal source. We applaud the committee's $2 million increase 
for this important program in FY23 and request continuing increases, in 
particular now that the NHA system has been formalized through 
legislation at the end of the last Congress.
    Support for new park designations and other efforts related to 
diversity, accessibility and inclusion are needed. We applaud the 
president's proposed investment in Racial Justice and Equity for 
Underserved Communities Initiative to increase representation in parks 
and other public lands. We are particularly heartened by the funding 
for new parks. We ask the committee to continue its support for sites 
including Amache and Freedom Riders and urge that support to be 
extended to Blackwell Schools and other new and emerging NPS 
designations. They are important to broaden the stories NPS preserves 
and interprets and makes NPS more inclusive, relevant and attractive to 
diverse audiences while more completely preserving our history. We also 
applaud the committee's support for DOI's efforts towards diversity, 
equity, accessibility and inclusion in FY23; we encourage support in 
FY24 for the president's budget's targeted investments seeking to make 
NPS a more inclusive agency.
    Great American Outdoors Act: We applaud the committee's support for 
this important law and the oversight it has shown over its successful 
implementation. Give the continuing backlog, we hope members of this 
subcommittee will support eventual legislation we hope will be 
introduced to extend the law's Legacy Restoration Fund with at least an 
additional 5 years of funding.
    Investments are needed for related agencies supporting the health 
of park resources and communities. We commend the committee's work to 
better invest in the many agencies and programs that support the 
wildlife, clean air and water in our parks and help understand and 
address climate change. Park wildlife, for example, benefit from US 
Fish and Wildlife Service funding. We urge the committee to make 
significant investments in the protection and recovery of our most 
vulnerable species, including the more than 600 threatened and 
endangered plants and animals in our National parks. The US Fish and 
Wildlife Service needs robust funding for Endangered Species Act 
programs. Investments in EPA's Geographic Programs are also critical 
for restoring and maintaining the health of the Great Lakes, Chesapeake 
Bay and other waterways and ecosystems in and surrounding units of the 
National Park System. There are many important investments the 
committee can continue to make that helps our parks adapt to climate 
change. For example, USGS Climate Adaptation Science Centers are 
critical to support climate science that benefits our National parks 
and their ecosystems. We applaud the support in FY23 and recommend 
continuing added investments for scientific support.
    On behalf of NPCA and our millions of members and supporters, thank 
you again for your investments in our parks and consideration of the 
needs facing the National Park Service and related agencies and 
programs that protect and support our Nation's cultural and natural 
treasures.

   Prepared Statement of the National Trust for Historic Preservation
    Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the 
subcommittee:
    I appreciate the opportunity to present the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation's recommendations for FY 2024 appropriations. My 
name is Shaw Sprague, and I am the Vice President of Government 
Relations. The National Trust is a privately funded nonprofit chartered 
by Congress in 1949. We work to save America's historic places to 
enrich our future.
    We offer our deep gratitude for the robust funding this 
subcommittee provided for all historic preservation priorities during 
the FY 2023 cycle. Thank you for considering recommendations made by 
the National Trust. We look forward to continuing our work with this 
subcommittee as you address the ongoing need for investments to sustain 
our Nation's rich heritage of cultural and historic resources that also 
generate lasting economic and civic vitality for communities throughout 
the Nation.
    For the fifth year in a row, we have also produced ``The 
Preservation Budget: Select Preservation Priorities for FY 2024 
Appropriations,'' \1\ which includes more information on the programs 
identified below, including funding levels over time and many 
remarkable examples of program successes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://forum.savingplaces.org/viewdocument/the-preservation-
budget-fy2024
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    National Park Service: Historic Preservation Fund. The Historic 
Preservation Fund (HPF) is the principal source of funding to implement 
the Nation's preservation programs. The National Trust is enormously 
appreciative of the six successive historic funding levels the 
subcommittee has provided to the HPF, including the FY 2023 enacted 
level of $204.515 million, the highest appropriated amount in the 
program's history. While increased investment in the HPF has 
facilitated innovative and impactful historic preservation work across 
the country, additional appropriations are needed to ensure a more 
complete historic narrative is preserved for future generations and 
lesser-known places of historic and cultural significance may continue 
to enrich our communities.
    HPF funding supports fundamental preservation activities such as 
surveying, nomination of properties to the National Register of 
Historic Places, public education, and project reviews required for 
Federal Historic Tax Credit (HTC) projects. Among many highlights, we 
would like to emphasize the subcommittee's sustained support for the 
African American Civil Rights grants program to preserve and highlight 
sites and stories associated with securing civil rights for All 
Americans. We would also like to highlight the extraordinary impact 
Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization Grants have in fostering economic 
development in our Nation's rural communities. The competitive grant 
programs within the HPF are having a transformative impact in 
communities throughout the country and these investments are helping 
preserve a broader historic narrative while revitalizing communities 
and creating local jobs.
    State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs and THPOs) 
are at the forefront of protecting our Nation's historic and cultural 
resources and are consistently asked to do more with less funding. The 
National Trust strongly supports addressing this unmet financial need. 
As Congress contemplates changes to the Federal permitting process, we 
urge you to consider the impact limited review times to conduct 
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) oversight will have on SHPO 
offices. We support efforts to identify efficiencies in Federal 
permitting and believe that adequate funding for SHPO offices is 
critical to achieving permitting reform objectives while adequately 
safeguarding our historic and cultural resources.

    We respectfully request that Congress provide a total FY 2024 HPF 
appropriation of $225 million. Within that funding, we recommend:

  --$70 million for State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs)

  --$34 million for Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs)

  --$28 million for competitive grants to preserve the sites and 
        stories of efforts to advance African American Civil Rights

  --$7 million for the History of Equal Rights Grants program to 
        preserve the sites and stories associated with securing civil 
        rights for All Americans, including women, American Latino, 
        Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and LGBTQ 
        Americans

  --$13 million for grants to Historically Black Colleges and 
        Universities to preserve and rehabilitate historic buildings

  --$40 million for Save America's Treasures grants

  --$17 million for Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization grants

  --$5 million for Underrepresented Community grants

  --$11 million for Semiquincentennial Grants program

    National Park Service: Operation of the National Park System. Over 
the past 25 years, more than 50 park units have been added to the 
System, many of which preserve historic places and themes that have 
been previously underrepresented. We encourage the subcommittee to 
provide funding of $3.26 billion to maintain NPS operations, ensure 
stewardship of historic and cultural resources and prevent reductions 
in visitor services at a time when our National parks are more popular 
than ever. Within this funding, we recommend robust funding for 
Resource Stewardship, the National Underground Railroad Network to 
Freedom, the African American Civil Rights Network, the Reconstruction 
Era National Historic Network, and the Japanese American World War II 
History Network.
    National Park Service: Deferred Maintenance. The NPS is responsible 
for maintaining a system comprised of more than 85 million acres that 
tell the stories of remarkable people and events in our country's 
history. Unfortunately, after over 100 years of operation and 
inconsistent public funding, the NPS faces a multi-million-dollar 
deferred maintenance backlog. Deferred maintenance in our National 
parks puts historic and cultural sites at risk of permanent damage or 
loss, and in the absence of funding, the condition of these assets will 
continue to deteriorate and become more expensive to repair and 
preserve in the future. We also recommend sustained increases for 
specific line items to ensure the maintenance backlog continues to 
decrease.

  --Construction. We recommend $145 million in funding for Line-Item 
        Construction projects that address the deferred maintenance for 
        the NPS' highest priority non- transportation assets with 
        project costs greater than $1 million.

  --Repair and Rehabilitation; Cyclic Maintenance. We recommend 
        additional increases for Repair and Rehabilitation at $150 
        million and $205 million for Cyclic Maintenance to ensure 
        routine and emerging needs are met.

    National Park Service: Cultural Programs. Within its cultural 
programs, the NPS manages many critical historic preservation 
activities, including management of the National Register of Historic 
Places and the National Historic Landmarks Program, certification of 
Federal HTC projects, coordination of Federal archaeology programs, and 
the administration of invaluable and targeted grant funding. These 
grant programs include the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act Grants, Japanese American Confinement Sites Grants, 
American Battlefield Protection Program Assistance Grants, and many 
more. We also urge the subcommittee to support funding for the newly 
authorized African American Burial Grounds Preservation Program.
    In total, the National Trust recommends $46 million for Cultural 
Programs for FY 2024, which includes $3 million for the African 
American Burial Grounds Preservation Program. Additional increases in 
this account will enhance modernization of the National Register and 
support sustained demands to review and approve Federal HTC projects.
    National Park Service: National Heritage Areas. We recommend $34 
million for the Heritage Partnership Program and National Heritage 
Areas (NHAs). This level would provide funding for each of the 62 
individual NHAs in 35 States, as well as NPS administrative support for 
coordination, guidance, assistance, and training.
    Bureau of Land Management: Cultural Resources Management. The 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees the largest, most diverse, and 
scientifically important collection of historic and cultural resources 
on our Nation's public lands, as well as the museum collections and 
data associated with them. The National Trust recommends $25 million to 
bolster this program.
    The cultural resources program also supports Section 106 review of 
land-use proposals, Section 110 inventory and protection of cultural 
resources, compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act, and consultation with Tribes and Alaska Native 
Governments. Moving forward, we recommend $1 million in dedicated funds 
for the agency to enhance its National Cultural Resources Information 
Management System (NCRIMS). This collaboration with state historic 
preservation offices is one of the Nation's most innovative programs to 
support predictive modeling and data analysis to enhance planning for 
large-scale, cross-jurisdictional land-use projects.
    Bureau of Land Management: National Landscape Conservation System. 
The BLM's National Landscape Conservation System (National Conservation 
Lands) includes approximately 37 million acres of congressionally and 
presidentially designated lands, including National Monuments, National 
Conservation Areas, Wilderness, Wilderness Study Areas, National Scenic 
and Historic Trails, and Wild and Scenic Rivers.
    We encourage the subcommittee to provide at least $78 million to 
the base program for the National Landscape Conservation System. An 
increase in funding will allow for greater inventory and monitoring of 
cultural resources in this growing system, prevent damage to the 
resources found in these areas, ensure proper management, and provide 
for a quality visitor experience.
    Independent Agencies: National Endowments for the Arts and for the 
Humanities. We urge the subcommittee to provide no less than $211 
million each for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and National 
Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). NEA and NEH funding is critical to 
communities around the country and strengthens our Nation by promoting 
the 'lessons of history' to all Americans. This funding has also 
supported efforts by the National Trust's Historic Sites and others to 
tell a fuller American story and engage visitors in compelling ways.
    Independent Agencies: Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. We 
recommend $10.5 million for the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation (ACHP). This increase would enhance the ACHP's ability to 
perform its essential role in ensuring the Nation's historic and 
cultural resources are protected while also advancing timely delivery 
of major infrastructure projects and improving consultation with Indian 
Tribes. The increase would also support the ACHPs efforts to promote 
enhanced mapping and digitization of cultural resources.
    We stand ready to assist the subcommittee in support of our 
recommendations.

    Sincerely,
    <GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

                                 ______
                                 
       Prepared Statement of National Wildlife Refuge Association
    I am pleased to submit testimony on behalf of the National Wildlife 
Refuge Association. The Refuge Association and its coalition of 
representatives from Refuge Friends organizations and concerned 
citizens thank you for your support for the National Wildlife Refuge 
System. We request an increase in funding for the Operations and 
Maintenance budget of the National Wildlife Refuge System to $1.5 
billion. This includes $560 million to address the growing staffing 
shortage across the Refuge System, as well as accounts for the addition 
of new refuge units, increased programmatic needs and visitation 
levels, and rising inflation since FY 2010. We also request $20 million 
in LWCF funding for the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge, 
$50 million for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, and $75 million for 
the Partners For Fish And Wildlife Program.
    The National Wildlife Refuge System is the Nation's only set of 
Federal lands dedicated to the conservation and management of America's 
native wildlife. It is the largest and most diverse network of 
conservation lands and waters in the world, encompassing more than 850 
million land and marine acres across dozens of unique habitat types. 
Our national wildlife refuges are essential for protecting biodiversity 
and climate resilient habitats, providing community-driven 
conservation, and expanding wildlife dependent recreational 
opportunities nationwide. However, increased funding needs paired with 
an insufficient budget has led to a Refuge System that is quickly 
eroding in habitat management and an ability to even keep refuges open.
    Wildlife refuges are economic engines for their communities. Over 
64 million people annually visit the Nation's 568 refuges, which are 
found in every State and territory, whether for hunting, fishing, 
wildlife watching, education, recreation, or photography. This 
generates over 41,000 jobs and provides more than $3.2 billion in 
economic output each year. For every dollar appropriated to the Refuge 
System, an average of nearly five dollars is returned to local 
economies.
    Despite these incredible benefits to communities across the 
country, the biggest challenge facing the Refuge System today is a lack 
of funding. The $503 million appropriated to the Refuge System in 
FY2010 is worth approximately $689 million today (as of November 2022), 
yet actual funding sits at $541 million-a mere 64 per acre, or $5.46 
per land acre. The failure to offset the impacts of inflation has 
resulted in a Refuge System long strained under the weight of 
critically low staffing levels and lost capacity. In this age of 
rapidly worsening biodiversity and climate crises, we must invest as 
much funding as possible today so these protected areas are available 
tomorrow for shifting conservation needs.
    While the Refuge System has faced declining budgets over the last 
13 years due to inflation, the Refuge System has still continued to 
grow, adding 14 new refuge units and hundreds of millions of acres of 
marine national monuments. It has also added new services, such as the 
Urban Wildlife Conservation Program launched in 2012 that seeks to 
address inequalities in recreational access and conservation 
participation. This program has dramatically changed the way 
conservation is delivered to communities, and visitor numbers have 
grown to over 67 million visitors a year in FY2022--an increase of 34% 
since FY2010. While the additional acreage, the creation of the urban 
program, and the increased visitors have enhanced the Refuge System and 
benefited the communities around these refuges, this growth has also 
put more pressure on the already stressed and underfunded System. These 
reductions have been so severe that most refuges can no longer operate 
effectively, efficiently, or, at times, safely. Additionally, more and 
more units are facing the reality of having no staff to conduct even 
the most basic management and public use activities.
    Over 800 permanent positions have been lost since FY2011--an 
enormous 25% loss in capacity. Several much-needed positions are 
eliminated every year due to lack of funding. No refuges are fully 
staffed, and more than half of refuges have zero staff on site. Many 
refuges are closed to the public and are completely unmanaged. Today, 
the Refuge System is staffed by approximately 2,400 permanent staff 
while the actual need is estimated to be 7,300. An additional $560 
million is estimated to be needed to hire enough staff to reach full 
staffing capacity. As an example of these dire staffing challenges, 
there are currently 214 law enforcement officers patrolling 850 million 
acres of land and water. Excluding the water acres, that's an average 
of 440,000 acres per officer, leaving much of the Refuge System 
virtually unprotected. In many cases, one officer alone is responsible 
for an entire state, with their refuge units hours away from each 
other. Similar examples can be made of impacts from the loss of 
biological, maintenance, and visitor services staff. Many volunteer 
programs-critical for the operation of individual refuges-have been cut 
back or completely eliminated due to lack of supervision from 
professional full-time staff.
    Funding for planning has also largely been eliminated due to budget 
cuts. By law, the Refuge System must update their Comprehensive 
Conservation Planning (CCP) every 15 years. Up-to-date management plans 
ensure that each wildlife refuge can be adaptable to present and 
upcoming needs, from a changing climate and extreme weather events like 
wildfires, to rising recreational visitors and commercial uses. 
However, lack of funding has resulted in more than 40% of refuges with 
no current CCP. Either an existing CCP is older than the recommended 15 
years or there is no plan. Not only do some wildlife refuges not have 
the staff or capacity to carry out a new CCP process, but some simply 
do not have the resources to renew these important plans. With an 
increased planning budget, the Refuge System could modernize and update 
these important management plans that help them reach their 
conservation goals.
    The common denominator to all these challenges is a lack of 
funding. Adequate staffing and funding are critical to the maintenance 
of healthy wildlife populations and access for recreational users to 
healthy ecosystems. Increasing funding for the System will empower and 
enable individual refuge units to deliver on-the-ground conservation 
that benefits not only wildlife and recreation, but also local 
communities across the Nation.
     everglades headwaters nwr-the land and water conservation fund
    EHWNR goals include the protection of 100,000 acres with 
conservation easements, which protect the land from development and 
conserve its wildlife and water values while keeping the land in 
private ownership, privately managed (which reduces public costs), and 
on the tax rolls. An additional 50,000 acres will become (if protected) 
public conservation lands open to public recreational access, supported 
by the sportsmen's community.
    EHWNR has 38 federally listed endangered species and is one of 
those rare refuges that can hit all of these refuge priorities: 
conserves or protects against threats to resources, protects ESA 
habitat, ecosystems, water, biodiversity, and cultural and historic 
resources, strengthens resilience to climate change impacts, has 
recreational access, benefits underserved or at-risk communities, and 
demonstrates strong local partner engagement and support.
    The National Wildlife Refuge Association requests $20 million in 
LWCF funding for the Everglades Headwaters NWR in FY2024.
                              refuge fund
    The Refuge System uses net income derived from permits and timber 
harvests to make payments to local communities to offset property tax 
revenue lost when the federally-acquired lands are removed from local 
tax rolls. The System relies on Congressional appropriations to the 
Refuge Fund to compensate for the shortfall between revenues and tax 
replacement obligations. However, declining revenues and lack of 
appropriations have resulted in the Service paying less than 50% of its 
tax-offset obligations since 2001.
    Reduced funding threatens the partnerships that are so important 
for successful conservation, and the negative impact on local 
communities is felt even more starkly in difficult economic times. We 
also ask that this Committee consider converting or rolling the Refuge 
Fund into the PILT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) program. Some refuge 
lands are included in PILT and others are included in the Refuge Fund. 
One funding mechanism for all refuge lands makes sense and would 
streamline the process of returning funds to local communities.
    The Refuge Association requests $50 million for the National 
Wildlife Refuge Fund in FY2024.
          partnerships--partners for fish and wildlife program
    With 75% of all fish and wildlife species dependent upon private 
lands for their survival, the Partners Program is one of the most 
powerful tools for protecting wildlife where it lives. By building 
effective partnerships between public agencies and private landowners 
to conserve America's expansive working landscapes, the Partners 
Program has implemented nearly 29,000 restoration projects in the past 
twenty-five years, restoring over one million acres of wetlands, three 
million acres of uplands, and 11,000 miles of streams. The Partners 
Program leverages Federal dollars, generating nearly $16 in economic 
return for every $1 appropriated for projects. The Refuge Association 
requests $75 million for the Partners For Fish And Wildlife Program in 
FY2024. Such a funding level would result in an additional $400 million 
worth of conservation across the Nation.
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the FY 2024 
Senate Interior Appropriations bill. We look forward to working with 
you to fund these important programs, and to bring the Refuge System 
back to a place where it can protect and grow our natural heritage for 
the 21st century. Please feel free to contact me at 
lmarking@refugeassociation.org for any questions.

                                 ______
                                 
         Prepared Statement of National Wildlife Refuge System
    On behalf of the undersigned hunting and fishing organizations, 
thank you for your ongoing work to enhance our Nation's prized public 
lands. Without a supportive budget or your efforts to maintain it, we 
would be unable to properly steward our waters and lands, nor could we 
safely fish or hunt on them. We were especially pleased to see the 
budget increase in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 to $541 million for the U.S 
National Wildlife Refuge System (the System) and we are extremely 
appreciative of the President's proposed budget of $624 million for the 
System. Both these actions are strong, necessary steps to enhance this 
vital public land system.
    We are writing today to express our support for continued funding 
increases to the System. As you begin work on the FY24 Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, we urge you to 
provide the System with an even more robust funding to correct both 
historic underfunding and meet the growing needs of the System.
    Hunting and fishing are fundamentally linked to the System, and 
trace back to earliest days of the refuge System. With the passage of 
the Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1997, Congress recognized 
wildlife-dependent recreational uses--which includes hunting and 
fishing--as priority uses in refuge planning and management. Therefore, 
ensuring accessible opportunities to fish and hunt on wildlife refuges 
continue to grow remains critically important for our organizations. We 
applaud the Biden Administration decision to open over 2 million acres 
in the System to angling and hunting, and deeply appreciated the Trump 
Administration actions to open 2.3 million acres. These activities 
provide the opportunity for more citizens to safely enjoy wildlife 
refuges with their families and bolster the strong contributions 
outdoor recreation provides for our economy and local communities.
    Despite its many benefits for hunters and anglers, the System is at 
risk. Since 2010, visitation to the System has increased 38 percent, 
now hosting over 65 million annual visitors. At the same time, the 
System's budget has remained generally stagnant, not growing alongside 
the System's expanding needs. This funding crisis has led to a loss of 
over 800 full time employees throughout the System, including law 
enforcement officers who serve to maintain visitor and community safety 
on refuge lands. On some refuges, lack of funding means, there are no 
full-time, on-site staff. The funding shortfalls hamper the System's 
ability to uphold its conservation mission--many wildlife refuges have 
been unable to keep management plans current. Over 40 percent of these 
plans, known as Comprehensive Conservation Plans, are outdated despite 
their requirement by law to be revised every 15 years. As such, refuge 
management is not keeping pace with today's challenges and 
opportunities.
    Since its establishment in 1903, the System has been our best 
example of how to balance conservation and recreation on Federal public 
lands. To date, there are 567 wildlife refuges that manage 760 million 
marine acres and 95 million land acres. With its primary mission of 
conservation, the System helps conserve 2,000 different species, 
including 1,000 species of fish, 700 species of birds, 250 species of 
reptiles and amphibians, and 220 species of mammals. Currently, 75 
percent of wildlife refuges are open to the public, with 376 open to 
angling, 427 open to hunting, and 101 urban refuges.
    As stewards who care about the wellbeing of our wildlife, fish, 
lands, and waters, it is critical that opportunities to hunt and fish 
on responsibly managed refuges continue to grow. With a significant 
increase in appropriations to the System, vacant positions can be 
filled, conservation goals can be reached, management plans can be 
updated, and more people can enjoy all these prized waters and lands 
have to offer.
    Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look forward 
to continued collaboration honoring this System.

         Prepared Statement of National Wildlife Refuge System
    Federal public lands make up thirty percent of Montana. While 
public lands provide invaluable hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation 
opportunities and contribute to local economies, these lands are not 
part of the tax base, impacting county budgets and the ability to 
provide essential services for our citizens. With a supportive Federal 
budget that includes Federal land payments and funding for proper land 
management, we can both enjoy the benefits of public lands and receive 
much-needed revenue for essential services like schools and roads. We 
appreciate the work you have done to steward these lands and waters.
    Fulfilling its role as a good neighbor, the Federal Government 
provides annual payments to counties and local governments for their 
tax-exempt lands. Within the U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System, this 
payment program is called the Refuge Revenue Sharing Fund (RRS), which 
compliments other programs like Payments in Lieu of Taxes. We are 
writing to express our support for increasing appropriations to RRS for 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 while opening a dialogue on how to permanently 
improve this program. As you develop appropriations bills, we hope you 
will provide RRS with additional funds.
    In Montana, we have 20 Wildlife Refuges which account for 1.15 
million acres of land in the state. On them, we find respite and make 
memories on pristine landscapes brimming with wildlife and fish. Our 
Wildlife Refuges are hidden gems of recreation where we can still enjoy 
wild places. In 1935, when the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act became law, 
Wildlife Refuges became more than a place to enjoy--they became an 
integral part of our communities. Annual RRS payments help fund public 
needs such as schools, roads, social services, police departments, and 
fire departments. Of Montana's fifty-six counties, thirty receive RRS 
payments. However, a lack of appropriations from Congress and 
resistance to reforming RRS means that annual payments have fallen 
short.
    RRS is funded through commercial net receipts from Wildlife Refuges 
and Congressional appropriations when collected fees fall short. In 
FY21, counties were authorized to receive $80 million in RRS funds, but 
net receipts only totaled $4.3 million, and Congress appropriated $13.2 
million. Thus, in FY21, RRS only provided $17.5 million in funding, 
21.9% of the authorized amount. Every year since 2014, despite net 
receipts and allowed amounts that generally increased, Congress has 
only appropriated $13.2 million. Since 2003, less than 50% of the 
authorized amount has been paid to counties.
    While some densely populated Wildlife Refuge communities may be 
able to make up for this difference through visitor expenditures, rural 
Wildlife Refuge communities cannot. The impact of these lost funds 
hurts our ability to provide public services. Congress should enact 
long-term solutions to this issue, namely reforming the RRS formula, 
which will provide fair and predictable funding. However, these 
legislative efforts require significant time to see through to fruition 
and the lack of funds is felt now. For example, Beaverhead County in 
2022, where the Red Rocks National Wildlife Refuge is located, should 
have received $194,059, 60% of which is allocated for the Lima Public 
School District. However, due to the RRS being underfunded, Beaverhead 
County received only $41,913, leaving the Lima Public School District 
with only $25,147. This insufficiency creates problems for the school 
district in the County. Increasing RRS funding for FY24 and the 
following years will immediately improve community health while we 
collaborate with leaders like you on long-term solutions.
    Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look forward 
to continued coordination.

Sincerely,

    Beaverhead County Commission

     Prepared Statement of the Natural Science Collections Alliance
    The Natural Science Collections Alliance appreciates the 
opportunity to provide testimony in support of fiscal year (FY) 2024 
appropriations for the Smithsonian Institution and the Department of 
the Interior. We encourage Congress to make new investments that 
address agency backlogs and secure future efforts for the preservation, 
curation, growth and study of scientific and cultural collections 
within the Department of the Interior and the Smithsonian Institution. 
We request that Congress provide the National Museum of Natural History 
with at least $60 million in FY 2024, with new funding to correct for a 
lack of adequate increases in recent years. Please provide the United 
States Geological Survey (USGS) with at least $1.85 billion in FY 2024, 
with increased support for collections related activities.
    The Natural Science Collections Alliance is a non-profit 
association that supports natural science collections, their human 
resources, the institutions that house them, and their research 
activities for the benefit of science and society. Our membership 
consists of institutions that are part of an international network of 
museums, botanical gardens, herbaria, universities, and other 
institutions that contain natural science collections and use them in 
research, exhibitions, academic and informal science education, and 
outreach activities.
    Scientific collections, and the collections professionals and 
scientists who make, care for, and study these resources, are a vital 
component of our Nation's research infrastructure. These collections 
and their associated experts contribute to the expansion of our 
bioeconomy. Whether held at a museum, government managed laboratory or 
archive, or in a university science department, these scientific 
resources form a coordinated network of specimens, samples, and data 
(for example, genetic, tissue, organism, and environmental) that are a 
unique and irreplaceable foundation from which scientists are studying 
and explaining past and present life on earth.
    Preservation of specimens and the strategic growth of these 
collections are in the best interest of science and the best interest 
of taxpayers. Existing scientific collections that are properly cared 
for and accessible are a critical component of the US science 
infrastructure and are readily integrated into new research on 
significant questions. Specimens that were collected decades or 
centuries ago are now routinely used in research in diverse fields 
related to genomics, human health, biodiversity sciences, informatics, 
environmental quality, and agriculture.
    According to the U.S. Interagency Working Group on Scientific 
Collections (IWGSC), ``scientific collections are essential to 
supporting agency missions and are thus vital to supporting the global 
research enterprise.'' A 2020 report by the IWGSC highlights the long-
term benefits of scientific collections and presents a framework for 
estimating and documenting these benefits, both monetary and non-
monetary, generated by Federal institutional collections. Additional 
recent reports have highlighted the value of mobilizing biodiversity 
specimens and data in spurring new scientific discoveries that grow our 
economy, improve our public health and wellbeing, and increase our 
National security.
    In 2019, the Biodiversity Collections Network (BCoN) issued a 
community informed call for the development of an Extended Specimen 
Network. The report, Extending U.S. Biodiversity Collections to Promote 
Research and Education, outlined a national agenda that leverages 
digital data in biodiversity collections for new uses and called for 
building an Extended Specimen Network: ``Science and industry rely on 
physical specimens housed in U.S. biodiversity collections,'' the 
report suggests. ``Rapid advances in data generation and analysis have 
transformed understanding of biodiversity collections from singular 
physical specimens, to dynamic suites of interconnected resources 
enriched through study over time. The concept of the 'extended 
specimen' conveys the current perspective of the biodiversity specimen 
as extending beyond the singular physical object, to potentially 
limitless additional physical preparations and digital resources.'' 
This endeavor requires robust investments in our Nation's scientific 
collections, whether they are owned by a Federal or state agency or are 
part of an educational institution or free-standing natural history 
museum or other types of research or educational centers.
    A 2020 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and 
Medicine (NASEM), Biological Collections: Ensuring Critical Research 
and Education for the 21st Century, provided guidance to the NSF 
regarding the sustainability of living stock and natural history 
collections. It argued that collections are a critical part of our 
Nation's science and innovation infrastructure and a fundamental 
resource for understanding the natural world. The report's 
recommendations for establishing an action center for biological 
collections and requiring specimen management plans for research 
proposals generating new specimens underscore the importance of 
biodiversity specimen collections and have been supported by the CHIPS 
and Science Act. Such a center will provide leadership, support, and 
coordination for federal, non-federal, and private collections and 
encourage transformative research to address persistent grand-challenge 
questions in human health, bioeconomy, climate change, and 
pharmaceutical discovery.
    The NASEM, BCoN, and IWGSC reports articulate a common vision of 
the future of biological collections and define a need to broaden and 
deepen the collections and associated data to realize the potential for 
biodiversity collections to inform 21st century science. Collections 
are a critical resource for advancing the knowledge needed to address 
current global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, 
and pandemics. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated how humans are 
inextricably part of the natural world. Biological collections, their 
extended data, and the experts that build and study them are globally 
important for understanding where viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 exist in 
nature or when they cross from their current hosts to humans.
    The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History 
(NMNH) is the central Federal partner in the curation and research on 
scientific specimens. Scientists at the NMNH care for 146 million 
specimens and ensure that the institution remains a global leader in 
scientific research and public engagement. To increase the availability 
of these scientific resources to researchers, educators, other Federal 
agencies, and the public, NMNH is working on a multi-year effort to 
digitize its collections. Funding is required to ensure this work is 
completed.
    The National Museum of Natural History is also working to 
strengthen curatorial and research staffing and to backfill positions 
left open by retirements and budget constraints. The current staffing 
level is insufficient to provide optimal care for the collections. 
Future curatorial and collections management staffing levels may be 
further jeopardized given insufficient funding increases in recent 
years. This lack of funding for collections care jeopardizes our 
bioeconomy at a time when critical investments are needed to leverage 
our network of collections to address the myriad issues facing the 
country.
    Interior is an important caretaker of museum collections as well; 
the Department and its bureaus collectively manage an estimated 206 
million museum specimens. Although many of the department's collections 
are located in bureau facilities, numerous artifacts and specimens are 
cared for in non-governmental facilities, such as museums and 
universities. The Interior Museum Program supports these collections by 
providing oversight, policy development, advocacy, technical 
assistance, training, and data management support.
    In addition, the USGS furthers the preservation, inventory, and 
digitization of geological scientific collections, such as rock and ice 
cores, fossils, and samples of oil, gas, and water. The National 
Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation program helps States with 
collections management, improves accessibility of collections data, and 
expands digitization of specimens to ensure their broader use. One 
example of the returns from this program is the potash mineral deposit 
discovered in Michigan that is valued at an estimated $65 billion. Rock 
samples from Michigan were entered into a national database, where 
private companies discovered the deposit's existence and are now 
assessing the potential for mining.
    USGS supports the documentation and conservation of native 
pollinators through its Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab (BIML). 
Pollinators, such as bees, are critical components of ecosystems and 
play an integral role in wildlife and habitat management and 
restoration. Three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about 35 
percent of the world's food crops rely on pollinators to reproduce. 
Given that pollinator populations are in decline globally, BIML's work 
in developing a nationwide method to inventory and monitor bee 
population trends on public lands is crucial.
    USGS has more than a million specimens of birds, mammals, 
amphibians, and reptiles that are housed at the Smithsonian's National 
Museum of Natural History. The Biological Survey Unit (BSU) consisted 
of USGS scientists stationed at the NMNH, where they conducted research 
on USGS-specimens of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals that are 
curated at the NMNH. This arrangement went back to 1889. These 
specimens, data, and the research they enable are required to inform 
Department of the Interior land and natural resource management 
decisions, and often also support decision-making by State and Tribal 
governments. With the BSU eliminated, the Smithsonian has taken over 
care of these collections. The work that BSU supported and conducted at 
the NMNH was important and in the National interest.
    The Bureau of Land Management manages nearly 4 million museum 
objects and archives and has a large backlog of cultural resources to 
inventory on public lands. Currently, only about 11 percent of public 
lands have been assessed for heritage resources. Such assessments need 
to be conducted before unique resources are lost to looting, vandalism, 
fire, or environmental change.
    The National Park Service must continue its investments in 
scientific collections into the future in order to monitor the Nation's 
protected natural heritage, which means cataloging millions of museum 
objects and connecting the resulting databases to national and global 
data portals to monitor changes through time. The National Park Service 
curates a wide range of specimens and artifacts, from historical and 
cultural items to preserved tissues from protected species and living 
microorganisms collected in our National Parks. Several parks have made 
progress on addressing planning, environmental, storage, security, and 
fire protection deficiencies in museum collections, but much work 
remains, and present and future collections will be fundamental for 
effective management efforts.
                               conclusion
    Scientific collections are critical research infrastructure that 
help support the Nation's bioeconomy. Research specimens connect us to 
the past and are used to document and solve current problems. They 
allow us to predict threats to human health, find successful methods 
for ensuring food security, and address the impact of future 
environmental changes. Sustained investments in scientific collections 
are in our National interest. We also see these investments as critical 
for our efforts to grow diversity and inclusion in the scientific 
workforce.
    The budget for NMNH has not seen adequate increases in recent 
years. We urge Congress to provide NMNH with at least $60 million in FY 
2024 to allow the museum to undertake critical collections care, make 
needed technology upgrades, and conduct cutting edge research. Please 
support adequate funding for programs within Interior bureaus that 
support the preservation and use of scientific collections--a truly 
irreplaceable resource. We urge Congress to provide the USGS with at 
least $1.85 billion in FY 2024, with increased support for collections.
    Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this request.

                                 ______
                                 
              Prepared Statement of the Nature Conservancy
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit recommendations 
for fiscal year 2024 (FY24) appropriations. The Nature Conservancy 
(TNC) is a nonprofit conservation organization working around the world 
to protect ecologically important lands and waters for people and 
nature. TNC appreciates Congress's work to pass the bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 and the Inflation 
Reduction Act in 2022. These investments in our natural systems will 
help bolster resiliency, respond to climate change, and, if equitably 
implemented, aid socially and economically disadvantaged communities. 
These investments complement but do not supplant the need for ongoing 
program funding through the appropriations process. Indeed, a robust 
appropriations package will serve as the foundation for implementing 
these bills and ensuring long-term success for critical programs under 
the subcommittee's jurisdiction.
    Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Passage of the Great 
American Outdoors Act and the dedicated funding of LWCF positions the 
program to provide more support for landscape-level conservation, 
working forests and ranchlands, access to the outdoors for underserved 
communities, climate resilience, conservation of historical and 
cultural sites, and advancing the America the Beautiful initiative. 
However, project demand in every State and county continues to far 
outstrip the $900 million a year in available funding for the program. 
TNC appreciates the continued support from Congress to improve the 
appraisal process and real estate policies of the agencies delivering 
the LWCF programs. While there is more to do, the organization is 
grateful for the subcommittee's efforts to lay the foundation for 
ongoing work with the agencies.
    Forest Restoration and Fire. TNC also recommends funding for U.S. 
Forest Service (USFS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) programs 
that address catastrophic megafires, pests and drought--all impacts 
exacerbated by climate change--in our forests. TNC supports substantial 
reinvestments in programs that increase forest resilience, specifically 
those that support collaboratively developed, science-based, climate-
informed and ecologically focused activities across all forests. These 
programs not only contribute to forest resilience but also create jobs, 
support local economies and reduce wildfire risk to communities, among 
other benefits.
    TNC's funding recommendations for the USFS are based on the modern 
budgeting practices undertaken by USFS. The organization also 
recommends increased salaries and expenses proportional to any program 
increases, as well as directing the USFS and DOI to identify and 
prioritize projects based on best-available climate vulnerability, 
watershed conditions, and fire risk assessments.
    Investing in Wildfire Resilience. Congress took a major step toward 
stabilizing the USFS and DOI budgets with the 2018 ``fire fix,'' for 
which TNC continues to be thankful. The organization urges Congress to 
ensure the fire fix remains durable and comprehensive. An estimated 50 
million acres are in critical need of wildfire resilience treatments 
across all forests due to the impacts of these challenges. A TNC report 
recommends an investment surge of $5-6 billion per year over the next 
10 years for the highest-priority work of increasing wildfire 
resilience and providing communities with much-needed resources for 
infrastructure and adaptation.
    TNC recommends investing in the USFS's Hazardous Fuels Program at 
$323 million and DOI's Fuels Management Program at $293 million. In 
addition, TNC urges the subcommittee to repeat its FY21 instructions 
for allocating funds to priority landscapes in both wildland-urban 
interface and wildland settings for prescribed burning. TNC also 
supports fully funding the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration 
Program at $80 million, and State Fire Assistance at a minimum of $76 
million. TNC appreciates the critical investment in Burned Area 
Rehabilitation in the IIJA supporting forest recovery. This is a 
significant management need and has been historically overlooked. TNC 
supports sufficient funding for post-fire restoration for Burned Area 
Rehabilitation activities in FY24.
    Investing in Ecosystem Restoration, Reforestation and Planting. TNC 
supports sufficient funding for programs that enhance water quality, 
biodiversity, and forest health. TNC additionally recommends funding 
the Urban and Community Forestry program at a minimum of $40 million to 
support the increase in tree cover in urban landscapes to improve air 
quality, reduce electricity, and help cities mitigate stormwater and 
floodwater.
    Research and Planning. TNC recommends sufficiently funding research 
programs to include the USFS Research and Development Program (with 
carve-outs for climate research and climate hubs), Forest Inventory and 
Analysis (FIA), and Joint Fire Science for USFS and DOI. The Research 
and Development Program offers a vital scientific basis for policies 
that improve the health and quality of urban and rural communities. 
Advances in FIA technology in measuring and monitoring are critical for 
public and private forest carbon management. Investments in the Joint 
Fire Science programs would provide competitive and focused applied 
science solutions to improve the management of forests and watersheds 
while protecting communities, water and air through interagency 
partnerships. TNC also recommends sufficiently investing in land 
management planning, inventory, and monitoring. USFS must update many 
outdated forest plans and increase its efforts to appropriately 
incorporate climate change into land management planning and project-
level documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act.
    Endangered Species. TNC supports continuing funding of at least $60 
million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. This 
funding supports critical matching grants to States and territories for 
conservation and species recovery efforts on non-federal lands. TNC 
requests the subcommittee's continued support for Habitat Conservation 
Plan (HCP) funding and HCP Land Acquisition Grants.
    State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. Substantial Federal investments 
are essential to support strategic actions by State, Tribal and Federal 
agencies, and the conservation community, to protect wildlife and their 
habitats. TNC appreciates the continued support from members of this 
subcommittee to address these significant funding needs through its 
work to pass the bipartisan Recovering America's Wildlife Act (S. 
1149).
    Wildlife Conservation Programs. TNC urges the subcommittee to 
continue funding for North American Wetlands Conservation Act grants, 
the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, Migratory Bird Joint 
Ventures, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Migratory Bird 
Management Programs and FWS Coastal Program at no less than the FY23 
funding levels. Likewise, TNC supports continued strong funding for the 
Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, the Cooperative Landscape 
Conservation and Adaptive Science programs and the National Fish 
Habitat Initiative.
    International Programs. The international conservation programs 
appropriated annually within DOI and the USFS encompass DOI's Office of 
International Affairs, FWS Multinational Species Conservation Funds, 
FWS Wildlife Without Borders regional and global programs, the National 
Park Service's International Program and the USFS International 
Program. TNC requests increases over FY23 funding levels for these 
programs and for implementation of the Lacey Act to manifest U.S. 
leadership in addressing the dual crises of biodiversity loss and 
climate change globally.
    National Wildlife Refuge System. Found in every State and 
territory, national wildlife refuges conserve the diversity of 
America's environmentally sensitive and economically vital ecosystems, 
including oceans, coasts, wetlands, deserts, tundra, prairies and 
forests. TNC supports increased funding for the system's operations and 
maintenance accounts to meet the well-documented needs of the National 
wildlife refuge system. At a minimum, funding for the program should be 
maintained at FY23 enacted levels.
    Sage Grouse Conservation. TNC requests $85 million to support the 
implementation of the Greater Sage-grouse Conservation Strategy (BLM: 
$75 million, FWS: $5 million, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS): $5 
million). These resources are needed to implement on-the-ground 
projects and monitor habitat treatments, address rangeland fire and 
noxious and invasive grasses, fund suppression and restoration efforts 
and facilitate the partnership and science necessary for effective 
conservation in western States. TNC continues to request the removal of 
language that would bar FWS from proposing a rule to list the Greater 
Sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act from the FY24 bill.
    BLM Land Management and Renewable Energy Development. TNC supports 
ongoing work to expedite renewable energy development, including 
funding to operationalize the Renewable Energy Coordination Offices and 
regional clean energy plans. TNC recommends robust funding to support 
BLM's thoughtful planning and management of public lands. This includes 
the National Landscape Conservation System (no less than FY23 level of 
$62 million), the Resource Management Planning (no less than FY23 level 
of $69 million), the consolidated Wildlife and Aquatic Habitat 
Management budget line ($150 million) and the Renewable Energy 
Development program ($35 million).
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Geographic Programs. 
TNC urges the subcommittee to continue robust funding for EPA's 
geographic programs, including the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
and the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, Long Island Sound and Gulf of 
Mexico programs, to make significant contributions to protecting 
habitat, improving water quality and enhancing resilience in the large 
landscapes they encompass.
    Colorado River Basin Recovery Programs. The Upper Colorado River 
Endangered Fish Recovery Program and San Juan River Basin Recovery 
Implementation Program take a balanced approach to the recovery of four 
threatened and endangered fish species in the upper Colorado River 
basin. The FWS budget includes approximately $1.5 million to support 
these programs as well as fish hatchery needs associated with the 
recovery plans. TNC requests the subcommittee maintain this funding in 
FY24.
    Restoring Rivers and Streams. Removing problematic dams and 
upgrading culverts can improve public safety and provide environmental 
and social benefits. TNC recommends at least level funding at $35 
million for the FWS National Fish Passage Program and robust funding to 
support the USFS restoration of streams by removing and restoring dam 
and culvert barriers through programs including the Legacy Roads and 
Trails program, State and Private Forestry programs and National Forest 
System programs such as Vegetation and Watershed Management. Demand for 
aquatic connectivity funds far exceeds the amount of funding available 
as demonstrated by applicants in one region alone of FWS requested $110 
million this year for the Investment in Infrastructure and Jobs Act-
funded portion of the National Fish Passage Program.
    Federal Priority Streamgage (FPS) Network. USGS operates the FPS 
Network to provide continuous streamflow information at over 8,400 
locations nationwide. TNC supports $32 million for the FPS Network to 
maintain existing gages. TNC also requests $68 million in Cooperative 
Matching Funds (CMF) for streamgaging and protecting the approximately 
5,275 CMF-supported streamgages already in place and functioning 
nationwide. Lastly, TNC supports $35 million for the Next Generation 
Water Observation System to expand this program and allow USGS to 
modernize water data delivery systems across the United States.
    3D Elevation Program (3DEP): 3DEP sponsors satellite topographical 
mapping that provides communities with high-quality elevation mapping. 
This mapping provides critical information that communities need to 
assess and develop strategies to abate various challenges such as flood 
risk, drought, coastal and riverbank erosion, and inform investments in 
infrastructure and water resource management and protection, and much 
more. In addition, 3DEP provides USGS and other Federal agencies with 
the best scientific information to prepare for threats from natural 
hazards. Knowledge of flood risks and natural hazards can help prevent 
communities from developing in unsafe areas and allow risk mitigation 
in developed areas. TNC supports continued funding of $42.9 million in 
FY24 for 3DEP to promote resilient communities and environments.
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit TNC's recommendations for 
the FY24 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations 
Bill.

      Prepared Statement of Navajo Agricultural Products Industry
    On behalf of the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry (NAPI) 
please find below our requests for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.
    As you know, NAPI is an agricultural enterprise wholly owned by the 
Navajo Nation that manages over 70,000 acres of farmland. We employ 300 
people annually and an additional 350-375 seasonal workers during 
harvest. NAPI's crops include potatoes, wheat, beans, alfalfa, chili, 
organic watermelon, organic squash, sumac, and corn.
    In 1962, Public Law 87-483 authorized the development of 110,630 
acres of farmland and an annual diversion of 508,000 acre-feet of water 
from the Navajo Reservoir to Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP) 
lands in exchange for the diversion of 100,000 acre-feet of water from 
the Navajo Nation's claim in the San Juan Basin to the Rio Grande 
Basin. In 1970, the Navajo Nation established the Navajo Agricultural 
Products Industry (NAPI) to operate the NIIP and manage the Nation's 
industrial agri-business to build a profitable commercial enterprise, 
provide jobs and training for Navajo people, and to expand markets for 
NAPI's products.
    Approximately 35,000 of the 110,630 acres of farmland authorized 
for construction under Public Law 87-483 (also referred to as the NIIP 
Act) remain undeveloped. Funding to build out the NIIP and increase 
farming capacity is critically needed. Appraisal level costs provided 
by the US Bureau of Reclamation estimated $985 million to complete the 
project in 2019 costs. It should be noted that the basis of the 
estimate for the CCE (Construction Cost Estimates) assumed an estimated 
$35 million in yearly appropriations with an estimated completion date 
of 2059. Additionally, under an existing Indian Self- Determination and 
Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) contract, the Federal Government is 
obligated to cover the NIIP's operations and maintenance (O&M) 
expenses. However, the BIA has failed to keep pace with increasing O&M 
expenses for the NIIP and other Indian Irrigation Projects, thus 
failing in its trust responsibility. The NIIP Condition Assessment, 
which was conducted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 2016, estimates 
over $175 million in remediation costs resulting from an extensive 
deferred maintenance backlog. Increased funding is desperately needed 
to ensure the NIIP remains operating at necessary levels.
    NAPI respectfully requests that the subcommittees ensure the 
Federal Government upholds its trust responsibility to the Navajo 
Nation with increased funding to the three programs below in the FY 
2024 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill:

1.  Full funding of the NIIP O&M expenses in FY 2024. Due to a 
        continued lack of past necessary funding, total funding needs 
        for NIIP's O&M will be $8.1 million in FY 2024. We therefore 
        request the Natural Resources Management, Irrigation Operations 
        & Maintenance funding be increased to $25.5 million total in FY 
        2024. This increase will ensure that the NIIP receives enough 
        funding to continue to operate at maximum levels.

2.  Increased funding for the WIIN Act, Public Law 114-322, Title III, 
        Subtitle B, Irrigation Rehabilitation and Renovation for Indian 
        Tribal Governments and their Economies from $10 million 
        annually to $35 million annually. These provisions of the WIIN 
        Act provide Indian Irrigation Projects with funding to address 
        deferred maintenance.

3.  NAPI is ready to complete Block 9 stage 2 and 3 of the NIIP but 
        lacks obligated funding from the Federal Government to do so. 
        We respectfully request that the Resources Management 
        Construction fund be increased to $110 million in FY 2024 and 
        that the NIIP be funded at a minimum of $12 million from this 
        fund.

    The Navajo Nation has not received all of what it was guaranteed in 
the NIIP Act or in our ISDEAA contract with the Federal Government. As 
a result, we are leaving valuable land unfarmed and Navajo Nation water 
rights entitlements unused. In addition, NAPI is forced to cover the 
government's O&M funding shortfalls. NAPI is requesting what was 
promised over 60 years ago.
    All three of these requests are important to the continued 
operation and expansion of the NIIP and the Navajo Nation's farm 
system. Thank you for your consideration of our requests.

Officer Navajo, Agricultural Products Industry.]

                                 ______
                                 
               Prepared Statement of the Nez Perce Tribe
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony on behalf 
of the Nez Perce Tribe (Tribe) as the Committee evaluates and 
prioritizes FY 2024 appropriations. This testimony covers funding for 
the needs of Tribal Nations regarding the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(BIA), Indian Health Service (IHS), Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), Forest Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).
    The Nimiipuu people want to acknowledge and thank this subcommittee 
for your efforts, on a longstanding, bipartisan basis, to understand 
the needs of Indian Country and advocate for increased appropriations 
to the many programs in your jurisdiction that benefit our citizens, 
our Tribal government, and all members of our communities. We are 
deeply grateful that the many funding increases to Tribal programs in 
the final FY 2023 appropriations build on the increases Congress 
provided in FY 2022.
    Like any government, the Tribe performs a wide array of work and 
provides a multitude of services to its Tribal membership as well as 
the community at large. The Tribe has a health clinic; a Tribal police 
force; a social services department; and a comprehensive natural 
resources program that does work related to forestry, wildlife 
management, land services and land management, habitat restoration, air 
quality and smoke management, water quality, and sewer service. The 
Tribe also operates one of the largest fisheries departments of any 
Tribe in the Nation working on the recovery of listed species under the 
Endangered Species Act. Each of these programs is necessary and vital 
for the Tribe as a sovereign nation that preserves and protects the 
Treaty rights of the Nez Perce People and provides day-to-day 
governmental services to our members and surrounding communities.
    The Tribe has long been a proponent of self-determination for 
Tribes and believes our primary obligation is to protect the Treaty-
reserved rights of the Tribe and our members. All the Tribe's work is 
guided by this principle. The Tribe works extensively with many Federal 
agencies and proper funding for those agencies and their work with, 
for, and through Tribes is of vital importance. To accomplish this 
work, as members of this subcommittee frequently note, the U.S. must 
affirm its trust responsibility to Indian Tribes by properly funding 
programs. The impact of such underfunding was documented in the 2018 
report of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Broken Promises. This 
report was updated in 2020 to show how this chronic underfunding 
exacerbated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indian Country.
                        bureau of indian affairs
    The Tribe requests that overall funding of $3.8 billion for the BIA 
and Bureau of Indian Education in FY 2023 be maintained in FY 2024. The 
Tribe also supports the indefinite appropriation for contract support 
costs at $328 million for BIA in FY 2024. The Tribe also recommends 
that these costs should be reclassified from discretionary to 
mandatory.
    In relation to the BIA Public Safety and Justice account, the Tribe 
advocates for maintaining funding for law enforcement that was enacted 
for that account in FY 2023. The Nez Perce Reservation spans 1,200 
square miles, covering five counties, and has a mixture of Tribal and 
non-Tribal residents. The Tribe provides a full-service law and justice 
program and recently completed construction of a jail facility. The 
Tribe has a fully trained and staffed police force, a fully staffed 
Tribal court, a prosecutor, a public defender, and other personnel that 
perform related administrative functions. The Tribe received just over 
$1,382,595 in BIA base funding and $990,238 in BIA direct Contract 
Support Cost funds. Currently, the Tribe contributes $1,179,941 to 
cover the shortfall in BIA funding for the Tribe's law enforcement and 
corrections, $745,624 for judicial services/probation, $480,040 for 
prosecutorial services, $318,057 for public defender services, and 
$486,046 for prisoner boarding. This supplemental funding is derived 
from Tribal taxes on goods and fuel and Tribal gaming revenues that 
would otherwise be used for Tribal governmental services. Funding for 
these programs, including additional funding to operate the new jail 
facility, needs to be maintained and ultimately increased to account 
for shortfalls in funding the Tribe must absorb to continue the 
operation of these important services on the Reservation.
    The Tribe also relies on the BIA for funding for our work related 
to endangered species and protection of the Tribe's Treaty resources, 
including Chinook and steelhead salmon. The funding is used to 
supplement research efforts of the Tribe relative to other sensitive 
species. The Tribe recommends a $1 million increase for the BIA 
Endangered Species Program. This account provides the Nez Perce Tribe 
with technical and financial assistance to protect endangered species 
on trust lands. Also, the Tribe recommends an increase of $2.8 million 
for BIA Natural Resource Tribal Priority Allocations which will help 
increase Tribal land and management capabilities.
    In addition, the funding provided under the BIA Rights Protection 
Implementation account is critical to support the exercise of treaty-
reserved, off-reservation hunting and fishing for Tribes. The Tribe 
supports, at a minimum, the $49.2 million in funding provided in FY 
2023. These funds provide the foundation for core program 
administration and treaty rights protection activities, such as harvest 
monitoring. These efforts are central to the Tribe's fisheries 
management responsibilities as established by the Nez Perce Treaties of 
1855 and 1863 and further delineated in court decisions regarding 
implementation of hunting and fishing Treaty rights. It is also 
important to understand that this funding is used for job creation.
    The Tribe supports maintaining the FY 2023 funding for the BIA 
Fish, Wildlife and Parks account. The Tribe, through our fisheries 
programs, has invested a significant amount of personnel and resources 
into the restoration of salmon. The States of Oregon, Washington, and 
Idaho, as well as sports fisheries, directly benefit from this work. 
These programs have been successful with funding under the Tribal 
Management and Development Program which is critical for the Tribe's 
management of fish and wildlife. We recommend funding a $4 million 
increase over FY 2023 funding for the Tribal Management and Development 
Program.
    The Tribe recommends continued funding for the Columbia River In-
Lieu Treaty Sites by supplementing the $4.5 million provided in FY 2023 
to implement the Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites 
Improvement Act
                         indian health service
    The Tribe operates Nimiipuu Health, a healthcare clinic on the Nez 
Perce Reservation in Lapwai, Idaho, and its satellite facility located 
65 miles away in Kamiah, Idaho. Nimiipuu Health provides services to 
approximately 4,000 patients each year. Annually, this computes to at 
least 40,000 medical/dental provider visits which does not include 
pharmacy or laboratory visits.
    The Tribe applauds the $7 billion provided for FY 2023 and the 
advanced appropriations for FY 2024 of $5 billion. We recommend 
maintaining these levels going forward, but it must be noted that this 
funding amount will not cover the costs the Nez Perce and other Tribes 
have in order to maintain current services because we also have to 
ensure that programs and facilities keep pace with medical and non-
medical inflation and with population growth. Recommendations of 
substantially increasing this funding to as high as $9 billion has been 
supported by the Tribe.
    The Tribe also supports an increase in funding for purchased/
referred care (P/RC) since this funding has not adjusted with 
inflation. The Tribe recommends that this $996.7 million allocation be 
substantially increased to continue to meet the P/RC spending needs of 
Tribal health facilities caused by medical inflation.
    The Tribe supports the funding for contract support costs for FY 
2023 of $969 million. However, this change in funding should not be 
accomplished or be offset by reducing other funding for these agencies 
that would adversely affect services or programs. This funding should 
not be reduced by excessive set-asides for administration.
    The Tribe recommends permanent, mandatory funding of the Special 
Diabetes Program at no less than $150 million per fiscal year. In that 
regard, similar levels of funding are recommended for mental health and 
substance abuse treatment. The current annual allocation for mental 
health and substance abuse, while very important, falls well below the 
financial needs to provide adequate care and treatment on reservations.
    Finally, the Tribe would like to express our support for the budget 
recommendations of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board 
including, but not limited to recommendations on increases to the $111 
million provided in FY 2023 for 105(l) lease costs and to make the 
funding mandatory.
                     u.s. fish and wildlife service
    The Tribe relies heavily on funding sources within the USFWS. 
First, the operations of Kooskia National Fish Hatchery are funded by 
the USFWS. The Tribe manages the hatchery pursuant to the terms of the 
Snake River Water Rights Act of 2004 (Act). The hatchery is in dire 
need of a new water supply to reduce the extraordinary amount of 
sediment that accumulates in the current water at the facility so the 
Tribe can continue to meet its production goals. The USFWS should be 
allocated adequate funding for the operations of this important 
facility to ensure the United States meets its obligations under the 
act.
    Second, the USFWS-administered State and Tribal Wildlife Grants 
program is an important and cost-effective expenditure for the Federal 
Government and is one of the few sources of funds Tribes can tap into 
for wildlife research. Over the last several years, the Tribe has 
received grants funding for work on diverse issues such as rare plant 
conservation and Condor habitat research. Continued funding for the 
State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program will allow recipient Tribes to 
build capacity and maintain involvement in key conservation issues. The 
Tribe strongly urges this subcommittee to not reduce, but instead 
increase, funding for these competitive grants to $75 million and 
increase the Tribal share to $6.5 million.
                    environmental protection agency
    The Tribe works closely with EPA on many programs that are 
essential to the health and safety of the 18,000 Tribal and non-Tribal 
citizens residing within the Nez Perce Reservation. These programs also 
protect the Treaty-reserved resources of the Tribe that the United 
States has a trust obligation to preserve. These programs include: the 
Clean Water Act 106 Program; the Clean Water Act 319 Nonpoint Source 
(NPS) Pollution Prevention Program; the Indian General Assistance 
Program; the Tribal Brownfields Response Program; the Underground 
Storage Tank Program; the Delegation of Nez Perce Federal 
Implementation Plan; the Clean Air Act 103 Grant-Nez Perce Tribe Air 
Quality Project; and the EPA Region 10 Pesticide Circuit Rider Program.
    The Tribe recommends that the Indian General Assistance Program be 
funded at $75 million; the Tribal allocation under the Clean Water Act 
106 program be increased by 20 percent; Tribal Air Quality Management 
be funded at $16 million; the Brownfields Program be maintained at $100 
million; and a funding amount be specifically allocated in lieu of the 
percent cap on Tribal funding for NPS pollution control.
    The Tribe requests the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, 
authorized under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation 
Act of 2016, be funded at no less than the $3 million provided to EPA 
in FY 2023 but recommends that number be substantially increased.
                             forest service
    The Tribe does a tremendous amount of work with the Forest Service 
including landscape restoration and resource management. The Tribe 
entered into a Good Neighbor Authority agreement with the Forest 
Service in 2022 that will allow more collaboration on work that will 
help protect Treaty-reserved resources on forest system land. It is 
important that these programs receive stable and consistent funding to 
allow this work to continue.
    As you can see, the Tribe does a tremendous amount of work in a 
variety of areas. It is important that the United States continue to 
fund this work and uphold and honor its trust obligations to Tribes. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.

Summary of Budget Requests:

 I.  Bureau of Indian Affairs--Increase funding for Western Washington 
        Program

 II. Bureau of Indian Affairs--Increase funding for Tribal Climate 
        Resilience Program

 III. Environmental Protection Agency--Increase funding for Puget Sound

        6PPD Quinone
                      introduction and background
    Greetings Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Honorable 
Members of the subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies. My name is William Frank III and I have the honor of serving 
as Chairman of the Nisqually Indian Tribe (``Tribe''). Thank you for 
the opportunity to provide written testimony regarding the Tribe's 
funding priorities within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. It is also 
an honor to continue my father, Billy Frank, Jr's, lifetime commitment 
and fight to protect our salmon, water, and environment.
    The Nisqually Indian Tribe has treaty reserved rights enshrined in 
the Treaty of Medicine Creek of 1854 and upheld by Federal courts in 
U.S. vs Washington, also known as the Boldt Decision, in 1974 and in 
numerous decisions in the intervening 48 years. These rights include, 
at their most fundamental of understanding, the ability to continue to 
exist as the Nisqually Indian Tribe in return for allowing the peaceful 
settlement of Americans in our region. The Tribal leaders that were 
signatory to the Treaty envisioned perpetual survival of our people, 
our traditions and cultures, our use of our homelands, and the access 
and use of the natural resources that have been central to our 
existence since time immemorial.
    Access and use of our treaty secured natural resources has been 
diminished significantly over time. Specifically, the salmon of the 
Nisqually River have decreased in numbers over the past 25 years to the 
point where there are two species listed as threatened under the 
Endangered Species Act (``ESA''), the Fall Chinook salmon and the 
steelhead trout; and there are two more candidates for future listing 
considerations, the unique Nisqually late chum and the coho salmon.
    As recently as the 1980's, and throughout time, Nisqually Tribal 
members regularly fished 8 months a year on the river that bears our 
name. By 2015, fishing time has been constrained to a mere 8 days to 
conserve the diminishing resource for future generations. Eight days is 
not using our homelands and waters as promised; 8 days is not 
practicing our cultures and traditions; and 8 days is not honoring the 
promises contained in the Treaty of Medicine Creek.
  bureau of indian affairs: rights protection implementation-western 
                      washington (boldt decision)
    The Boldt Decision reaffirmed our Tribe's right to co-manage 
fishery resources with the State of Washington. To honor this Federal 
decision and many other court decisions upholding Tribal rights, the 
Department of the Interior provides Tribal funding under the Rights 
Protection Implementation (``RPI'') Program. Particularly, the Western 
Washington Program provides specific Federal funding to meet its treaty 
obligations to Western Washington Tribes, including the Nisqually 
Indian Tribe.
    The Nisqually Indian Tribe has utilized this vital Federal funding 
to revive our precious fish resources and to build a strong and 
dedicated Natural Resources Program. The Tribe has over 40 staff in 
eight different programs that utilize science-based management of our 
fisheries. These eight different programs include shellfish management, 
environmental management, salmon hatchery operations, salmon recovery, 
Geographic and Information Services, and salmon restoration and 
research. The Tribe is putting all its efforts into the survival of our 
fisheries and trust resources, stretching every dollar. Our obligations 
to manage under the Boldt Decision and the ESA are growing more 
complicated as our world continues to change.
    Despite the effectiveness of RPI, the funding levels are simply 
insufficient. The Tribe has never received dedicated environmental 
staffing support to deal with climate change and impacts from growth. 
Unfortunately, the fiscal resources have failed to keep up with 
economic challenges and competition for staff fully support the proper 
management of our trust resources and treaty protected rights.
    The Tribe appreciates the Administration's proposal to increase 
funding for Rights Protection Implementation by $342 thousand over the 
previously enacted level. This includes an increase of $86 thousand for 
the Western Washington Program. We urge the subcommittee follow suit 
and increase RPI funding to ensure that the Federal Government meets 
its treaty obligations.
      bureau of indian affairs: tribal climate resilience program
    Climate change is real and is having dramatic and significant 
impacts on our people and the resources we depend upon. As a result of 
rising sea levels, we are seeing changes to the Nisqually Delta habitat 
in ways that are impacting salmon survival. The culturally important 
plant species that we use for our food, medicine, and crafts are 
becoming scarcer as their range is being reduced with rising 
temperatures and changes in the timing and magnitude of rainfall.
    We have invested a tremendous amount of time and resources to 
protect and restore our watershed while increasing resiliency, but the 
changes are occurring at a pace that is challenging to match with our 
efforts alone. We need to increase the pace and magnitude of our 
efforts while working on solutions to the climate change that imperils 
the very resources that we all care for and are dependent on for our 
very survival.
    With Western Washington Tribes being on the frontlines of climate 
change, we are encouraged by the Biden Administration's proposal to 
increase funding for the Tribal Climate Resilience Program (``TCRP'') 
by $13 million over the previously enacted level. The TCRP is 
instrumental in assisting Tribal governments with climate adaptation 
and preparedness, implementing strategies for resilient communities, 
and encouraging cooperative solutions. The Nisqually Indian Tribe 
requests that the subcommittee provide substantial increases in funding 
for the Tribal Climate Resilience Program.
          environmental protection agency: puget sound program
    There are many issues challenging our salmon's very survival in the 
Nisqually River and throughout Puget Sound. The Puget Sound is our 
regional icon and it has been designated as an estuary of National 
Significance under the Clean Water Act. The Puget Sound represents the 
promise of a clean, healthy, and vital environment that is central to 
our lives in Western Washington. It is as important to our region as 
the Great Lakes and the Everglades are to those living in those 
watersheds.
    The plight of the salmon is also the plight of our people. Losing 
our promised and generational connection to the salmon and the river 
and our traditional practices has long lasting impacts on our 
communities. When we have salmon, when we have time on our river, when 
we eat our traditional foods and practice our culture, we are healthy. 
When these things are lacking, we too are at risk. Our physical, 
emotional, and spiritual health is directly and permanently connected 
to our river and our salmon. Saving salmon is saving our people.
    We are not alone feeling the impact of disappearing salmon runs. 
Our brothers the Orca of Puget Sound are also struggling. The Southern 
Resident Killer Whales, salmon eaters like us, are now listed as 
threatened under the ESA and are slowly slipping away into extinction. 
We all watched helplessly in shock and horror the vision of the mother 
Orca carrying her dead baby for 18 days in Puget Sound in 2018. As go 
the salmon, goes the Orca and the Nisqually People.
    Under the EPA's Puget Sound Program, the Nisqually Indian Tribe 
receives important funding to conduct research and implement programing 
to revitalize the salmon population. Compared to other nearby bodies of 
water, salmon in the Puget Sound have a much lower survival rate. 
Federal funding allows our researchers to understand why this is 
happening in the Puget Sound. Once we understand the cause, we can 
provide the best measures to protect the salmon. The Nisqually Indian 
Tribe requests that the subcommittee increases funding EPA's Puget 
Sound Program to further assist us in tackling the complicated issues 
in the Puget Sound.
  environmental protection agency: funding to address impacts of 6ppd 
                           quinone on salmon
    The Nisqually Tribe has grave concerns regarding the deadly threat 
that 6PPD Quinone is having on our salmon and treaty protected 
resources. The Tribe needs the EPA to provide the critical leadership 
and sense of urgency needed to immediately solve this problem. This is 
a crucial issue for the Tribe and all Tribes that depend upon salmon. 
We have seen our salmon populations decline dramatically over the past 
30 years and the negative impacts that has had on our treaty rights, 
our culture and traditions, and the health of our communities. 6PPD is 
killing our fish every time it rains.
    We assert that there needs to be two pathways that are fully 
supported for success. The first is source removal and we request that 
the pertinent regulatory agencies be fully funded to expedite their 
involvement. The previous administration gutted key programs within the 
EPA and NOAA, resulting in the Federal Government likely being the 
weakest link in approving a safe alternative for time manufacturing and 
future monitoring and research.
    The second pathway must be a commitment to treating stormwater for 
6PPD-Q, and other numerous toxics coming off our roadway with each 
rain, in the Pacific Northwest while we deal with the legacy of 6PPD in 
current tires. The Nisqually Indian Tribe has led an effort to find an 
affordable and scale-able treatment system for roadway runoff with a 
specific focus on 6PPD. Our pilot project is proving successful and 
could be used region wide. Funding for installation and monitoring and 
maintenance is lacking to address the problem at the magnitude of the 
challenge. The Tribe urges the subcommittee to provide funding that 
will address the deadly impacts that 6PPD Quinone is having on the 
salmon population.
                               conclusion
    The Nisqually Indian Tribe appreciates the opportunity to share our 
Fiscal Year 2024 funding priorities with the subcommittee.

      Prepared Statement of Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Honorable Members of 
the Subcommittee, for the record my name is Ed Johnstone, and I am 
Chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC). The NWIFC 
is composed of the twenty tribes in western Washington that are party 
to United States v. Washington, which upheld the tribes' treaty-
reserved right to harvest and manage natural resources on and off-
reservation, including salmon and shellfish. On behalf of the NWIFC, we 
are providing testimony for the record on our natural resource 
management and environmental program funding requests for the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA), Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) and Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations. These programs 
support tribes to carry out their natural resource management 
responsibilities including the management of Pacific salmon fisheries, 
which contribute to a robust natural resource-based economy and the 
exercise of our treaty rights.

Summary of Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Appropriations Requests

Bureau of Indian Affairs

    --Provide $66.0 million for Rights Protection Implementation 
        (collective request)

    --Provide $17.146 million for Western Washington Fisheries 
        Management

    --Provide $3.748 million for Washington State Timber-Fish-Wildlife

    --Provide $7.42 million for U.S./Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty

    --Provide $2.4 million for Salmon Marking

  --Provide $15.0 million for Fish, Wildlife & Parks Projects (non-TPA)

                       justification of requests
Bureau of Indian Affairs

  --Provide $66.0 million for BIA Rights Protection Implementation 
        Subactivity

    The 41 tribes in the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest with similar 
treaty-reserved rights have collectively identified that no less than 
$66.0 million for the Rights Protection Implementation (RPI) 
subactivity is necessary to support essential tribal treaty-reserved 
resource management. This request is a $16.8 million increase over the 
FY23 enacted level of $49.2 million. The large disparity between our 
collective request and the enacted level demonstrates that the basic 
natural resource management functions of the treaty tribes continue to 
be underfunded. Faced with the difficult combination of increasing 
natural resource scarcity and cumulative environmental stressors, 
tribal natural resource management has become more complex and resource 
intensive. Considering this challenge, additional capacity is needed to 
manage treaty-reserved resources and protect tribal rights. 
Unfortunately, most of the programs under RPI, such as Western 
Washington Fisheries Management, have not received a meaningful 
increase since FY18. A summary of the subaccounts of importance to us 
within RPI are identified below.

  --Provide $17.146 million for BIA Western Washington Fisheries 
        Management

    We respectfully request $17.146 million, an increase of $5.543 
million over the FY23 enacted level of $11.603 million. Funding for 
this program supports the tribes to co-manage their treaty-reserved 
resources with the state of Washington, and to continue to meet court 
mandates and legal responsibilities. For example, funding supports 
harvest planning, population assessments, data gathering for finfish, 
shellfish and groundfish, and other natural resource management needs. 
This funding is critical to support the day-to-day operations of 
essential fishery management. Reduced abundance and increased 
regulatory scrutiny of fisheries, coupled with ongoing salmon habitat 
loss, increased recreational pressures and climate change are greatly 
increasing the difficulty (and cost) of co-managing salmon and other 
resources.

  --Provide $3.748 million for BIA Washington State Timber-Fish-
        Wildlife (TFW)

    We respectfully request $3.748 million, which is $28,000 above the 
FY23 enacted level of $3.72 million. Funding for this program is 
provided to improve forest practices on state and private lands, while 
providing protection for fish, wildlife and water quality. This funding 
supports the tribes' participation in the TFW Agreement--a 
collaborative intergovernmental and stakeholder process between the 
state, industry and tribes.

  --Provide $7.42 million for BIA U.S./Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty

    We respectfully request $7.42 million, an increase of $628,000 
above the FY23 enacted level of $6.792 million. This request is 
consistent with that of the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) and is 
necessary to implement the Annex chapters of the Pacific Salmon Treaty 
(PST). Tribes assist the U.S. government in meeting its obligations to 
implement the treaty by participating in fisheries management 
exercises, cooperative research and data gathering activities. This 
funding also supports participation in the PST process.

  --Provide $2.4 million for BIA Salmon Marking

    We respectfully request $2.4 million, an increase of $948,000 over 
the FY23 enacted level of $1.452 million. This request would support 
ongoing coded wire tagging and adipose fin clipping (marking) 
operations at tribal hatcheries. Marking is used to differentiate 
hatchery-origin salmon from natural spawning ones. Since 2003, Congress 
has required that all salmon released from federally funded hatcheries 
are marked for conservation management purposes. Coded Wire Tags are 
used to provide a unique identifier to a particular hatchery stock, 
which is then used in salmonid abundance assessments and catch rates. 
The NWIFC uses automated trailers to provide efficient centralized 
tagging and marking services to our 20-member tribes. This state-of-
the-art equipment is very complex and requires expert technicians to 
operate and maintain. The operations and maintenance of the trailers, 
coupled with an increasing demand for these important services, 
continues to increase our costs to carry out this Federal directive.

  --Provide $15.0 million for BIA Fish, Wildlife & Parks Projects (Non-
        TPA) for Hatchery Operations and Maintenance

    We respectfully request $15.0 million for Hatchery Operations and 
Maintenance within the Fish, Wildlife and Parks Projects account, an 
increase of $2.055 million over the FY23 enacted level of $12.945 
million. More specifically, we request $8.0 million for Hatchery 
Operations and $7.0 million for Hatchery Maintenance. This funding is 
provided to tribal hatcheries to support the rearing and releasing of 
salmon and steelhead for harvest by Indian and non-Indian fisheries in 
the U.S. and Canada. Without hatcheries, tribes would lose their most 
basic ceremonial and subsistence fisheries that are central to our 
tribal culture. We currently estimate that more than 80% of the salmon 
harvested are hatchery-origin fish. Yet despite the central importance 
of these facilities, tribes face millions of dollars in deferred 
maintenance costs and significant funding shortfalls in operations.

  --Provide $1.109 million for BIA Salmon and Steelhead Habitat 
        Inventory and Assessment Program (SSHIAP) (within the Tribal 
        Management/Development Program)

    We respectfully request $1.109 million, an increase of $206,000 
above the FY23 enacted level of $903,000 for SSHIAP within the Tribal 
Management/Development Program subactivity. SSHIAP is vital to the 
western Washington tribes because it provides essential environmental 
data management, analysis, sharing and reporting to support tribal 
natural resource management. It also supports our tribes' ability to 
adequately participate in watershed resource assessments and salmon 
recovery work.

  --Fully Fund BIA Contract Support Costs

    We respectfully request that Congress fully fund Contract Support 
Costs (CSC) and reclassify CSC as mandatory. Funding for CSC ensures 
tribes and tribal organizations have the capacity to manage Federal 
programs under self-determination contracts and self-governance 
compacts.

  --Provide $2.0 million for Western Washington Treaty Tribes' Wildlife 
        Management

    We respectfully request $2.0 million for western Washington treaty 
tribes' wildlife management programs from an account within the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs Trust--Natural Resources Management Activity. The 
member tribes reserved the right to fish, hunt and gather natural 
resources throughout their ceded territories. Part and parcel with the 
tribes' reserved right to hunt and gather outside of their reservation 
boundaries is the need to co-manage wildlife resources with the State 
of Washington. Requested funding will provide capacity to participate 
in state-tribal co-management forums, develop wildlife management 
plans, develop and enhance tribal hunting codes, and design and 
implement applied research projects. These capabilities are fundamental 
to the protection of our tribes' treaty rights and there is currently 
no dedicated account or funding to directly support this critical work.

  --Provide $48.04 million for BIA Tribal Climate Resilience

    We request $48.04 million for Tribal Climate Resilience 
subactivity, an increase of $13.049 million over the FY23 enacted level 
of $34.991. Climate change is one of the largest threats to tribal 
rights and resources. Funding from this competitive grant program will 
support tribal participation in critical issues that impact treaty-
reserved resources, adaptation and promote climate resiliency.
                        fish & wildlife service
  --Provide $8.0 million for FWS Tribal Wildlife Grants

    We respectfully request $8.0 million for the nationwide Tribal 
Wildlife Grants program, an increase of $1.8 million over the FY23 
enacted level of $6.2 million. Funding from this competitive grant 
program supports the conservation of wildlife and their habitat, 
including species that are culturally or traditionally important to 
tribes.
                    environmental protection agency
  --Provide $96.4 million for EPA General Assistance Program (GAP)

    We request $96.4 million for the nationwide GAP, an increase of 
$21.65 million over the FY23 enacted level of $74.75. We also 
respectfully request bill or report language that would improve 
flexibility in the GAP to ensure individual tribal priorities and 
implementation activities would be eligible and that newly proposed 
allocations will not result in a decreased proportion of funds for EPA 
Region 10 tribes and consortia. The GAP builds essential tribal program 
capacity to address environmental issues that impact tribes' health, 
safety and treaty-reserved resources. The GAP also provides critical 
funding to tribal consortia to support intertribal coordination on 
environmental issues.

  --Provide $54.0 million for EPA Puget Sound Geographic Program

    We request $54.0 million for Puget Sound consistent with the FY23 
enacted level. This Geographic Program provides essential funding that 
will help protect and restore Puget Sound--an estuary of national 
significance. Funding for this program supports tribal participation in 
a broad range of collaborative Puget Sound recovery work, including 
scientific research, resource recovery planning and policy discussions 
that affect our treaty rights.
                               conclusion
    We respectfully request the subcommittee's support for these 
requests. We greatly appreciate your attention to these matters and 
thank you for your continued commitment to the tribes.

   Prepared Statement of Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board
    Greetings Chairman Merkley and Ranking Member Murkowski, and 
Members of the subcommittee. My name is Nickolaus Lewis, and I serve on 
the Lummi Indian Business Council, and as Chair of the Northwest 
Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB or Board). I thank the 
subcommittee for the opportunity to provide testimony on the FY 2024 
Indian Health Service (IHS) budget and for their continual support for 
increased funding for IHS every year.
    NPAIHB was established in 1972 and is a Tribal organization under 
the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 
Public Law 93-638, that advocates on behalf of the 43 federally-
recognized Indian Tribes in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington on specific 
health care issues. The Board's mission is to eliminate health 
disparities and improve the quality of life of American Indians and 
Alaska Natives (AI/AN) by supporting Northwest Tribes in the delivery 
of culturally appropriate, high quality health programs and services. 
``Wellness for the seventh generation'' is the Board's vision. In order 
to achieve this vision, I respectfully ask that this subcommittee 
consider Tribal sovereignty, traditional knowledge, and culture in all 
policy initiatives and funding opportunities.

    I provide the following testimony to address our long-standing 
needs in the Northwest:

    Health Equity. AI/ANs in the Northwest face high health disparities 
compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW). AI/AN people in the Northwest 
have a life expectancy that is about 7 years lower than that of NHW 
people in the region. Data from the Northwest show that AI/AN people 
experience disparities at all stages of life, and are particularly 
vulnerable to chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, 
injuries, substance misuse and overdoses, and violence. In the past 
year, there has been an alarming increase in Fentanyl overdoses in 
Northwest Tribal communities. AI/AN people in the Northwest are less 
likely to have health care coverage and access compared to their NHW 
counterparts.
    These disparities are the consequence of centuries of neglect and 
broken promises by the Federal Government to adequately fund 
healthcare. IHS is chronically underfunded with the overall budget 
covering only a fraction of the healthcare needs of AI/AN people.\1\ 
Year after year, Northwest Tribes have unmet healthcare needs due to 
the chronic underfunding and any budget cut to the IHS will result in 
further barriers to accessing health services in the Northwest.

FEDERAL FUNDING SHORTFALL FOR NATIVE AMERICANS AT 19 (2018) available 
at https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2018/12-20-Broken-Promises.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Provide Advance Appropriations for IHS. We thank Members of the 
subcommittee for their support in upholding the Federal Government's 
obligations to provide health services to AI/AN by authorizing advance 
appropriations in FY 2024. Previous government shutdowns have caused 
undue hardship to Northwest Tribes--from Federal employees not 
receiving a paycheck to clinics cutting down their hours. Advance 
appropriations provide predictable funding to enable IHS, Tribes, and 
urban Indian organization leaders to effectively manage budgets, 
coordinate care, and improve outcomes for AI/ANs without any service 
interruptions. For this reason, NPAIHB requests the subcommittee 
continues to provide advance appropriations for FY 2025.
    Provide Mandatory Appropriation for ISDEAA Section 105(l) Leases 
and Contract Support Costs (CSC). Although we are appreciative of the 
subcommittee's support in securing an indefinite appropriation for 
105(l) leases and CSC, we need 105(l) leases and CSC to be moved to 
mandatory appropriations. This will ensure that these appropriations 
are funded year after year without impacting annual programmatic 
increases to IHS and Tribal health facilities.
    1. The Tribes in the Northwest have been relentless advocates for 
Tribal Self-Determination and Self-Governance which is one of the most 
successful programs funded by the Indian Health Service. However, the 
Cook Inlet decision is destabilizing on our Tribal health program 
operations and threaten our indirect cost recovery to support Northwest 
Tribal health program operations. We urgently request the subcommittee 
to support a legislative fix to the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act to restore the longstanding interpretation of 
the act.
    Provide Full, Mandatory Funding for IHS. We are concerned on the 
minimal increase of $327 million to the IHS in the FY 2023 Omnibus 
Appropriations Act. This increase does not support President Biden's 
historic request for an increase of $2.2 billion for the IHS in FY 
2023. The Northwest Tribes will never be able to adequately address 
their chronic health disparities without substantial increased funding 
for the IHS. The National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup 
recommended, and our Area supports, the request of $51 billion in FY 
2024 to fully fund the IHS.\2\ Although we support the Biden 
Administration putting forward a historical request for mandatory 
funding, we request that the IHS and the subcommittee works and 
supports the Portland Area Tribes to develop a legislative proposal for 
mandatory funding for IHS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fund Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) Expansion. Tribal Leaders 
in the Portland Area support long term sustainable solutions that build 
up our communities, create opportunities for our youth and Tribal 
citizens, educate our healers and train the next generation of work 
force. The CHAP is vital not only to expanding access to care in our 
Tribal communities but tackling important social determinants of 
health. CHAP builds an accessible education ladder into the health care 
professions, increases access to culturally relevsant, trauma informed 
primary care, and creates professional wage jobs in our communities. 
However, the IHS has not provided adequate funding to expand CHAP in 
the Portland Area to support education programs and member Tribes to 
integrate CHAP providers into their health programs. For FY 2024, we 
request $60 million for continuation of the National expansion of CHAP 
with $10 million for Portland Area. We request $5 million to build 
clinical classrooms to train community health aide providers in the 
Portland Area.
    In FY 2021, 2022 and 2023, $2 million was allocated for dental 
health therapy education programs educating students in Washington, 
Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska. But, the IHS has not provided any of this 
funding to the Portland Area and will not unless there is an 
appropriation increase. For FY 2024, we request $4.2 million for the 
Dental therapy education programs with a $1.7 million earmark to 
Portland Area and $2.5 million to support Alaska.
    Fund Purchased and Referred Care (PRC) at $8 billion. The FY 2023 
Omnibus Appropriations Act included a 1% increase to PRC-a nominal 
increase that does not even cover inflation and population growth 
costs. Our Area has to purchase all specialty and inpatient care 
because there is no IHS hospital in the Portland Area. The PRC program 
makes up over one-third of the Portland Area budget. When there is no 
increase or consideration of population growth and medical inflation, 
Northwest Tribes are forced to cut health services. Areas with IHS 
hospitals can absorb these costs more easily because of their 
infrastructure and large staffing packages.
    When there are increases to the PRC budget, the Portland Area 
Tribes receive additional funding to account for the lack of an IHS/
Tribal hospital in the Area, often referred to as the access to care 
factor. However, the IHS has only ever funded this access to care 
factor three times in the past 13 years-in FY 2010, 2012, and 2014. 
Without year to year increases to PRC to fund the access to care 
factor, inpatient care for Portland Area Tribes goes severely 
underfunded. For FY 2024, our Area requests that PRC is funded at $8 
billion. And, PRC should be the second highest budget line item 
increase to conform with the National Tribal Budget Formulation 
Workgroup's Recommendations.
    Fund Mental Health and Substance Abuse at $3.5 billion. In our Area 
and nationwide, there are high rates of depression, anxiety, and 
relapses because of isolation during the pandemic. Our Tribes need 
funds to support mental health provider shortages, expansion of 
services, and training. NPAIHB is particularly concerned about our AI/
AN adolescents and young adults. Suicide is the second leading cause of 
death for AI/AN adolescents and young adults. AI/AN suicide mortality 
in this age group (10-29) is 2-3 greater, and in some communities 10 
times greater, than that for non-Hispanic whites.
    Mental Health and Substance Use programs could be expanded by 
funding programs authorized but never funded under the Indian Health 
Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), including Sections 702, 704, 705 and 715. 
These programs would increase prevention and treatment services, 
community mental health workers and behavioral health research. In 
order to address anticipated needs and to fund much needed programs in 
FY 2024, NPAIHB recommends funding Mental Health and Substance Abuse at 
$3.5 billion.
    In addition, we recommend that all IHS Behavioral Health 
Initiatives provide an option for Tribes to receive funds through 
ISDEAA Title I and Title V compacts and contracts. These programs 
include the Tribes know how to manage and maximize funds to best meet 
the behavioral health needs of their patients. These programs include 
the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program, the Domestic 
Violence Prevention Program, the Zero Suicide Initiative, and may 
include the recently established Special Behavioral Health Program 
(opioid program).
    Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI). We request permanent 
reauthorization of SDPI at $250 million per year with medical inflation 
rate increases annually. We also request that an option be created for 
Tribes to receive SDPI funds through Title 1 or Title V compacts or 
contracts. Specifically, we recommend that 42. U.S.C. Sec. 254c-3(c) be 
amended with the addition of the following language: ''(2) 
APPROPRIATIONS.--On request from an Indian Tribe or Tribal 
organization, the Secretary shall award diabetes program funds made 
available to the requesting Tribe or Tribal organization under this 
section as amounts provided under Subsections 106(a)(1) and Subsection 
508(c) of the Indian Self-Determination Act, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5325(a)(1) 
and Sec. 5388(c), as appropriate.''
    Increase Indian Health Professions Funding by $25 million. COVID-19 
has exacerbated the recruitment and retention issues our Northwest 
Tribal communities face with health care providers. In order to address 
these provider shortages, NPAIHB supports an increase for Indian Health 
Professions to fully fund scholarships for all qualified applicants to 
the IHS Scholarship Program and to support the Loan Repayment Program 
to fund all physicians, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, 
nurses and other direct care practitioners.\3\ For FY 2024, we request 
the subcommittee to increase the Indian Health Professions program by 
$25 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ NPAIHB Resolution18-03-07.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Increase Funding for Small Ambulatory Program, Joint Venture 
Construction Project and New Innovative Approaches for Health Care 
Facilities Construction by $21 billion. No funds have been allocated to 
Portland Area Tribes for new facility construction for at least 20 
years. For this reason, Portland Area Tribes only support funding for 
specific construction programs and new innovative approaches for health 
care facility construction. We request a program increase of $21 
billion in FY 2024 to support the Small Ambulatory Program (SAP) with 
funding for staffing packages, the Joint Venture Construction Program 
(JVCP), and funding for innovative approaches to address unmet 
construction needs for health care facilities construction under 25 
U.S.C. Sec. 1631(f).
    Portland Area Regional Specialty Referral Center. The FY 2023 
President's Budget Request includes $165 million in nonrecurring 
expense funds for the Portland Area's regional specialty referral 
center. This center is a priority of the Northwest Tribes to address 
the continual barriers AI/AN face in accessing specialty care in the 
Northwest. We look forward to partnering with IHS to develop the 
center. We request that the subcommittee considers additional funding 
to construct the two other facilities in the Portland Area.
    Make Information Technology Modernization Funding Available to 
Tribes. Health IT modernization must be a priority of the IHS with an 
expedited implementation over the next three to 5 years. Resource and 
Patient Management System (RPMS) cannot meet the evolving healthcare 
delivery needs of our Tribes without substantial investment in IT 
infrastructure and software. Tribes in the Northwest have had to invest 
significant amount of their own funds to modernize their Health 
Information Technology. Yet, none of the funds appropriated for HIT 
modernization has been distributed to Tribes. We request that funding 
is provided to our Tribes to reimburse and provide on-going financial 
support for Tribal facilities that have purchased and implemented 
commercial off the shelf systems. For FY 2024, NPAIHB recommends 
funding at $356 million for planning and phased-in replacement of RPMS 
with $22 million for Portland Area Tribes for reimbursement of their 
health IT modernization efforts.
    Fund HIV at $60 million and HCV at $600 million. From 2013 through 
2017 rates of new diagnosis of HIV for AI/AN people increased to 7.8 
per 100,000--although rates of new HIV diagnosis decreased or stayed 
stable for all other racial and ethnic groups. We thank the Committee 
for the $5 million for HIV and Hepatitis C initiatives in FY 2021. For 
FY 2024, NPAIHB requests funding of $60 million for HIV to support 
Ending the HIV Epidemic. According to the IHS National Data Warehouse, 
it is estimated that there are at least 40,000 AI/AN people with a 
current HCV infection being served by IHS, Tribal and urban Indian 
facilities. For FY 2024, $600 million is needed for IHS to provide the 
life-saving HCV treatment to the 40,000 AI/ANs with HCV.
    Thank you for this opportunity to provide recommendations on the FY 
2024 IHS budget. I invite you to visit Portland Area Tribes to learn 
more about the utilization of IHS funding and health care needs in our 
Area. I look forward to working with the subcommittee on our 
requests.\4\

         Prepared Statement of Norton Sound Health Corporation
    The requests of the Norton Sound Health Corporation (NSHC) for the 
FY 2024 Indian Health Service (IHS) budget are as follows:

  --Recognize Alaska Native communities as Native communities in the 
        IHS Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS), eliminating the notion 
        of ineligible costs for sanitation projects.

  --Recommend IHS create and fund the operation and maintenance (O&M) 
        of sanitation infrastructure.

  --Fund construction of employee housing quarters.

  --Fund construction of patient lodging to support expansion of 
        medical and behavioral health care services.

  --Support funding opportunities for Tribal Health to construct day 
        care facilities.

  --Increase funding for behavioral health social detoxification 
        programs through the Preventing Alcohol Related Deaths (PARD) 
        program under the Snyder Act or through the creation of a 
        Special Behavioral Health Program for Indians, similar to the 
        Special Diabetes Program for Indians.

  --Ensure mandatory funding for Contract Support Costs and 105(l) 
        lease payments and clarify CSC provisions.

    Headquartered in Nome, Alaska, Norton Sound Health Corporation is 
owned and managed by the 20 federally recognized Tribes of the Bering 
Strait region. Our Tribal system includes a regional hospital, nursing 
home, and 15 village-based clinics, which we operate under an Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) agreement\1\. 
Our rural and remote Arctic region remains unconnected by roads, and we 
are 500 air miles from Alaska's economic hub of Anchorage. Our service 
area encompasses 44,000 square miles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ We serve the communities of: Brevig Mission, Council, Diomede, 
Elim, Gambell, Golovin, King Island, Koyuk, Mary's Igloo, Nome, St. 
Michael, Savoonga, Shaktoolik, Shishmaref, Solomon, Stebbins, Teller, 
Unalakleet, Wales, and White Mountain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Funding for Water & Sewer Projects and Operation and Maintenance:
    Recognize Alaska Native communities as Native communities in the 
IHS Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS), eliminating the notion of 
ineligible costs for sanitation projects. In the Bering Strait region, 
we face a $261 million sanitation need. Five communities in our region, 
Diomede, Wales, Shishmaref, Stebbins, and Teller, remain completely 
unconnected to running water and sewer. The community of Gambell is 70% 
served, with 43 homes in the village remaining unconnected to water and 
sewer. Ongoing sewer and water upgrades and maintenance backlogs remain 
concerns in seven communities. An estimated 520 homes in the Bering 
Strait region have no running water, nor flush toilets.
    The health impacts of a lack of sanitation and clean water 
infrastructure, in combination with a shortage of housing in our 
communities, remain an ongoing public health crisis. The CDC has noted 
that one in three infants from communities without running water is 
hospitalized for respiratory infections. The communities of Diomede, 
Unalakleet & Wales are on the Environmental Protection Agency's EET 
list of water systems out of compliance with Federal regulations for 
arsenic, uranium, and/or THMs (probable human carcinogen), with levels 
over what EPA has deemed safe for human consumption in the long-term.
    In the authorizing statute (Indian Health Care Improvement Act) for 
the IHS, Congress reaffirmed the Indian Health Service as the agency 
with ``primary responsibility and authority to provide necessary 
sanitation facilities,'' and furthermore, ``it is in the interest of 
the United States and it is the policy of the United States, that all 
Indian communities and Indian homes, new and existing, be provided with 
safe and adequate water supply systems and sanitary sewage waste 
disposal systems as soon as possible'' (25 USC 1632). These services to 
Norton Sound communities cannot come soon enough. Basic human needs 
that most Americans take for granted do not exist in many of our 
communities.
    We are opposed to the decision of the IHS to implement in the 
FY2018 Sanitation Facilities Construction appropriation using a 
methodology to serve Alaska Native homes. This methodology is based on 
the premise that our Alaska Native villages are 'non-Indian'. Our 
unserved communities on average are over 90% Alaska Native. The SDS 
policy places Indian communities in the same category as ``non-Indian'' 
communities, requiring that Tribes find contributions for ineligible 
buildings such as public schools, clinics, Tribal buildings, and 
teacher housing. All community buildings are for the benefit of the 
Native community, including schools, which serve in some cases as the 
community's evacuation center and primary gathering place for healthy 
community activities. Schools and teacher homes are also often the only 
facilities connected to sewer and water, creating significant 
sanitation inequities in a community.
    However, in order to fully address the sanitation crisis in our 
communities, we urge that Congress formally remove the regulatory 
barriers to our unserved and underserved communities and allow 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds to cover the 
ineligible costs as requested in the FY22 Tribal consultation.
    Recommend IHS create and fund the operation and maintenance (O&M) 
of sanitation infrastructure. The National Congress of American Indians 
passed Resolution ANC-22-041, that recommends IHS fund the operation 
and maintenance (O&M) of sanitation infrastructure as authorized in 25 
USC 1632 (b). A request for O&M funding was also included in the FY 
2024 Tribal Budget Recommendations put forward by the National Tribal 
Budget Formulation Workgroup. In addition, the unprecedented amount of 
funding provided by Congress for construction and repair of sanitation 
facilities through the IIJA underscores the need to protect the Federal 
investment and ensure the maximum life cycle and sustainable operation 
of these sanitation systems for as long as possible. O&M costs should 
also be used for existing systems to keep projects that are already 
complete off the SDS list in the future. Congress has provided IHS 
funding to train operators, but not a designated O&M fund. IHS must 
request appropriations in the FY 2024 budget for the operation and 
maintenance of sanitation facilities systems, and further such funding 
should be made available through ISDEAA self-governance agreement.
    Funding for employee housing quarters. Since NSHC opened its new 
hospital facility in 2013, the workforce living in both Nome and the 
villages has increased by 12 percent and 23 percent respectively. 
Unfortunately, when the facility was constructed, housing quarters were 
not included with the construction project. NSHC owns 29 apartment 
units in Nome, but still leases over 70 apartment units from various 
landlords in an attempt to meet the needs for adequate housing for new 
hires, locum physicians, nurses, clinicians, health aides in training, 
and students. NSHC's usage of such a large portion of currently 
available Nome housing has created a significant housing shortage for 
Nome. This housing shortage has held NSHC back from filling critical 
health care positions and has created further impediments to hiring a 
permanent local workforce. Typhoon Merbok exasperated the already 
limited housing situation in Nome when the flood destroyed housing 
units and the subsequent fire destroyed a local hotel, which was 
housing homeless individuals and families.
    The approved Port Project for the City of Nome, will require an 
influx of people to the community and vacant housing is non-existent. 
NSHC proposes to construct three, 20-unit apartment buildings, this 
would adequately meet its growing Nome workforce needs. By owning its 
own housing, NSHC would be able to release 70 apartment units which 
could be consumed by Nome Port Project laborers, teachers, and homeless 
individuals and families. NSHC received $5M from the FY23 Omnibus Bill 
to support patient and employee housing construction; the total cost 
for three 20-unit apartment buildings is $30.75M.
    In the surrounding villages, the ability to recruit and retain a 
permanent provider to work at the local clinic and live in the 
community is contingent on housing. There is also a lack of housing for 
local employees. While NSHC has received some funding to construct 
housing in some of its villages, other communities are still challenged 
with inadequate housing: Gambell, Stebbins, Teller, White Mountain, 
Brevig Mission, Shaktoolik, and Elim. The cost to build a total of two 
duplexes in both the communities of Gambell and Stebbins is $26M.
    Funding for the construction of patient lodging to support 
expansion of medical and behavioral health care services. Over the past 
10 years, in-region healthcare services have expanded, and the volume 
of visits has nearly doubled. NSHC's Nome-based Patient Hostel, which 
opened in 2008, is often fully occupied. To meet patient care needs, 
NSHC must locate overflow patient lodging which is rarely available at 
local hotels due to an influx in tourism after COVID-19 restrictions 
lifted and the aftermath of Typhoon Merbok, (which took another local 
hotel out of operation.) The new Wellness and Training Center opened in 
June 2020. The clinical infrastructure is available to provide 
intensive outpatient and partial hospitalization services. In order for 
outlying village residents to benefit from this treatment, additional 
housing is necessary. The infrastructure is now available to support 
substance abuse treatment for the region, but housing is needed. In the 
short-term, NSHC will be converting the former Community Health 
Services building into overflow patient lodging. In the long-term, more 
patient lodging needs to be constructed, which is collocated next to 
the Norton Sound Regional Hospital. The number of housing units needed 
in total is estimated at 50 at a total cost of $15M. NSHC received $5M 
from the FY23 Omnibus Bill to apply to patient & employee housing.
    Funding for Tribal Health to construct day care facilities. There 
is a lack of childcare providers in the Bering Strait region. Childcare 
is a basic need that hinders recruitment and retention. NSHC is 
planning to address its workforce childcare needs through a Nome-based 
facility that is in the conceptual design phase for a 7,460 square foot 
building. The facility would be available to employees and patients for 
drop-in appointments and for village-based health aides during training 
sessions. The project is estimated at $10.35 M. NSHC received $2.5M 
from the FY23 Omnibus Bill to support this project.
    Recommend the IHS increase funding for behavioral health social 
detoxification programs through the Preventing Alcohol Related Deaths 
(PARD) program under the Snyder Act or through the creation of a 
Special Behavioral Health Program for Indians, similar to the Special 
Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI). As the alcohol and opioid abuse 
problem intensifies with the wider availability of heroin, oxycodone, 
and often-lethal synthetics such as fentanyl, the need for treatment 
services has grown exponentially. As a result, national and State 
entities and governments have openly recognized and called for the need 
to arm providers with more resources and funding; however, despite the 
evidence of rampant substance use concerns, back-logged psychiatric 
facilities, and reimbursements inadequate to meet the expenses of 
providing services, there is an imbalance between the magnitude of the 
problem and appropriate funding. For the Bering Strait region, the 
substance abuse/misuse data for 2021 is staggering:

  --918 unique individuals across 1,469 encounters presented at Norton 
        Sound Regional Hospital's emergency department under the 
        influence of substances. Of those, 565 had a primary diagnosis 
        of Alcohol Abuse; an additional 100 had a secondary substance 
        diagnosis, and 72 had a tertiary.

  --The Nome Volunteer Ambulance Department's 7 primary volunteers 
        responded to 424 substance-related calls accounting for an 
        astounding 68.8% of all calls totaling 27,984 hours of response 
        time.

  --The Nome Police Department were dispatched for 3,394 substance-
        related calls in 2021, 73% of all arrests were substance-
        related. There were 10 officers available to respond to these 
        calls.

  --90% of inmates served time for substance-related crimes at Nome's 
        Community Residential Center (CRC) and Anvil Mountain 
        Correctional Center (AMCC). With 128 beds at AMCC at $168.74 
        per inmate per day, and 50 beds at the CRC at $117.00 a day, 
        the cost of substance-related incarceration was $9,004,587. 
        Imprisoning someone is far more expensive than funding 
        prevention, diversionary, and treatment services.

    Because our region is in remote Alaska, resources with which to 
work are fewer than those in urban areas; this often results in sending 
our people hundreds of miles away to Anchorage or Fairbanks for higher 
levels of care.
    Mandatory Funding for Contract Support Costs and 105(l) lease 
payments. We appreciate the subcommittee's commitment to ensuring that 
Contract Support Costs (CSC) and 105(l) lease costs are fully funded by 
including an indefinite discretionary appropriation in FY 2024 for both 
of these accounts. This change would bring appropriations process into 
line with the clear legal requirements of the authorizing statute.
    Amend Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to 
Clarify CSC provisions. We also request that the committee consider 
amending the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
(ISDEAA) to clarify that when agency funding paid to a Tribe for 
program operations is insufficient for contract and compact 
administration, contract support costs will remain available to cover 
the difference in response to a recent court decision.\2\

    Outdoor Alliance is a coalition of 10 member-based organizations 
representing the human powered outdoor recreation community. The 
coalition includes Access Fund, American Canoe Association, American 
Whitewater, International Mountain Bicycling Association, Winter 
Wildlands Alliance, The Mountaineers, the American Alpine Club, the 
Mazamas, Colorado Mountain Club, and Surfrider Foundation and 
represents the interests of the millions of Americans who climb, 
paddle, mountain bike, backcountry ski and snowshoe, and enjoy coastal 
recreation on our Nation's public lands, waters, and snowscapes.
    National public lands provide outstanding opportunities for outdoor 
recreation, including at some of the world's most iconic recreation 
destinations. These opportunities, as well as the irreplaceable 
cultural, ecological, and scenic values found across public lands, in 
turn support the growing outdoor recreation economy, which accounted 
for $862 billion in gross economic output, 1.9 percent of U.S. gross 
domestic product, and 4.5 million jobs in 2021.\2\

    Due to decades of underinvestment, Federal land management agencies 
face staffing and resource challenges that have left them unable to 
meet modern needs related to recreation access, conservation, and 
sustainability. In recent years, Congress has provided significant 
funding for these agencies through the Great American Outdoors Act 
(GAOA), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and the 
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, robust baseline budgets remain 
necessary to ensure that land managers can meet the growing needs of 
the American public, adapt to the climate crisis and other challenges, 
and to achieve the maximum return on investment for GAOA, IIJA, and IRA 
dollars.
    In particular, we see a need to increase staffing levels and staff 
retention across all Federal land management agencies, particularly at 
the Forest Service and BLM. As frequent visitors to public lands, the 
outdoor recreation community regularly sees the consequences of 
inadequate staffing to manage current levels of recreational use and to 
plan and implement recreation infrastructure and restoration projects. 
Investments in staffing are essential for ensuring that agencies have 
the capacity to plan effectively and efficiently and advance projects-
supported by the IRA and IIJA-in a manner that maximizes impact, 
including for co-benefits like outdoor recreation.
                          usda forest service
    Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness: $94.367M. Outdoor Alliance 
strongly supports the agency's FY24 request for Recreation, Heritage, 
and Wilderness-the agency's primary account for providing sustainable 
recreation opportunities to the American public. National Forests have 
seen a steady increase in recreational visits over the past decade.\3\ 
However, from 2002-2020 the Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness 
program saw a 48% decrease in staffing and a 27% decrease in 
appropriations adjusted for inflation.\4\ Providing $94.367M will help 
the agency proactively manage recreational use and deliver the 
opportunities that support local economies.

Funding Crisis, Conservation Economics Institute (2022), at 16.

justifications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Land Management Planning/Assessment/Monitoring: $26.429M. Forest 
plans form the foundation for sustainable recreation opportunities and 
restoration activities across our National Forests. Currently, 99 out 
of 128 Forest Service land management plans are outdated. Outdoor 
Alliance supports the agency's efforts to increase the pace and scale 
of forest plan revisions through a new national initiative called the 
Planning Service Organization, which will help initiate more than 30 
plan revisions over the next 4 years, including seven beginning in 
2024.
    Capital Improvements and Maintenance, Trails: $27.857M. The Forest 
Service manages more than 160,000 miles of trails, which provide access 
to extraordinary scenic, cultural, and ecological resources across the 
National Forest system. Increasing trails funding will help the agency 
maintain its trail system, expand it where appropriate, and strengthen 
trails partnerships.
    Capital Improvements and Maintenance, Roads: $109.64M. Forest 
Service roads, bridges, and parking lots are critical access points for 
outdoor recreationists. Significantly increased resources are needed to 
help the agency improve recreation access and increase the resilience 
of the extensive Forest Service road system to high use levels and 
extreme weather events.
    Legacy Roads and Trails: $100M. Outdoor Alliance supports the 
Washington Watershed Restoration Initiative's request for $100M for 
Legacy Roads and Trails. Although Congress permanently authorized this 
program in the IIJA at $50M per year, this number does not meet the 
existing need for road and trail repair, road decommissioning, and 
other needs. The IIJA investments should be augmented with an 
additional $100M to help prevent adverse impacts to water quality, 
sensitive species, and outdoor recreation from Forest Service roads.
    Forest and Rangeland Research: $413.369M. Forest Service research 
is critical to understanding our natural world. This research is more 
important than ever in a changing climate and with novel pressures 
facing our forests and grasslands. Increasing research funding will 
help address pressing ecological questions and develop new techniques 
for forest and rangeland management.
                       bureau of land management
    Recreation Resources Management: $93.398M. BLM manages innumerable 
important recreation resources but needs additional capacity to manage 
the challenges (and opportunities) of increased visitation. BLM plans 
to launch a new ``21st Century Recreation Strategy'' in FY24 to 
modernize the agency's approach to managing sustainable recreation. 
Increased funds are needed to implement the new strategy, to address 
ongoing capacity issues for BLM recreation staff, and to account for an 
increase in the quantity and diversity of recreational use across BLM 
lands.
    Resource Protection and Maintenance-Resource Management Planning: 
$97.759M. Outdoor Alliance strongly supports the agency's request for 
$97.759M for Resource Management Planning. BLM planning ensures the 
best use of BLM lands, including balancing recreation with other 
multiple use values. Approximately 134 of the BLM's 169 Resource 
Management Plans are outdated, and additional plans need to be 
completed for new National Monuments.
    National Conservation Lands: $78M. Outdoor Alliance is grateful for 
the increase in funding provided for National Conservation Lands in 
FY23. The National Conservation Lands system includes some of our 
country's marquee destinations for outdoor recreation. Investing in 
these lands is critical for their long-term protection and their 
ability to deliver economic benefits to local communities. Despite the 
recent increase, the budget for the National Conservation Lands has 
decreased over the past 20 years accounting for inflation while the 
number of acres covered by the system has more than doubled. 
Appropriations are needed to account for the increase in acres 
protected, and to address the backlog of management plans for recently 
protected areas.
    Wilderness Management: $25.701M. Outdoor Alliance strongly supports 
the agency's FY24 request for $25.701M for Wilderness Management. BLM 
Wilderness lands, which include a network of 263 Wilderness areas and 
487 Wilderness Study Areas totaling more than 21 million acres, provide 
some of the Nation's best opportunities for backcountry recreation. 
Increased appropriations are needed to help maintain these areas' 
Wilderness character, while sustaining the ecological and cultural 
resources that these areas provide.
                         national park service
    National Recreation and Preservation: $118.465M, including $17.09M 
for the Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance program. NPS 
requires additional resources to meet the challenges of increased 
visitation, climate, and other stressors. Additionally, RTCA is a 
critically important program for helping local communities realize 
their visions for improved recreation resources.
                    other appropriations priorities
    American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas: $25.5M. Outdoor 
Alliance strongly supports the administration's request for $25.5M for 
the U.S. Geological Survey for the creation of the American 
Conservation and Stewardship Atlas. The Atlas will establish a baseline 
of protected areas in the U.S., and will help prioritize restoration 
and conservation actions. Appropriations are needed to develop a 
robust, scientifically-informed Atlas that will guide effective 
conservation actions that support benefits including increased access 
for outdoor recreation.
    Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF): $1.35B, including $135M 
for the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership. Congress guaranteed 
permanent dedicated funding of $900M per year to the LWCF through the 
GAOA. While significant, this funding is intended as a baseline for 
LWCF, and the number of time-sensitive projects seeking funding far 
surpasses $900M.
    National Trails System: We support an increase in appropriations 
for the National Trails System across agencies, including $20.964M at 
NPS, $13.75M at BLM, and $11.957M at USFS. This funding will ensure 
that Federal agencies and stewardship partners can keep these iconic 
trails accessible, maintained, and sustainable.
    Hardrock Abandoned Mine Lands: $287M. The outdoor recreation 
community is profoundly affected by legacy mining pollution, which 
poses an ongoing safety and public health hazard across affected 
watersheds in the western U.S. Congress established a new abandoned 
hardrock mine cleanup program through Section 40704 of the IIJA. 
Providing $287 million in FY24 will enable BLM to inventory abandoned 
mine lands and accelerate remediation efforts.

     Prepared Statement of Office of Navajo Hopi Indian Relocation
                              introduction
    In 1974, Congress passed the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act \1\-an 
Act which led to the largest forced relocation of American citizens 
since the Japanese Internment Camps of World War II.\2\ To carry out 
the forced relocation, Congress created the Office of Navajo Hopi 
Indian Relocation (ONHIR, formerly known as the Navajo Hopi Relocation 
Commission),\3\ an independent Federal agency. Specifically, the act

    In its report on the act, the Senate stated that ``because of the 
Federal Government's repeated failure to resolve the land disputes, the 
major costs of resolution should be properly borne by the United 
States.'' \5\ Nonetheless, the government's failures have continued and 
the Navajo people have suffered greatly for it. Therefore, we write to 
you once more requesting that you properly bear the costs for the harms 
the United States has wrought.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ S. Rep. No. 93-1177, at 20 (1974).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Navajo Nation has always objected strongly to the forced 
relocation of thousands of its people. The initial relocation was to be 
completed within 5 years through a ``generous relocation program to 
minimize the adverse social, economic, and cultural impacts of 
relocation on affected Tribal members,'' \6\ however, nearly 50 years 
have passed and the relocation has not been completed and the process 
has never been generous. The relocations that have occurred were done 
in such haphazard and shoddy fashion that they destroyed traditional 
lifeways, undercut spiritual practices, and created a range of social 
ills that have had terrible spiritual, physical, and economic 
consequences on the Navajo people.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ S. Rep. No. 93-1177, at 19-20.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The harms caused by the relocation have been further exacerbated by 
ONHIR's inability to act and the federally-imposed development freezes 
that were in place for decades. ONHIR has not had a presidentially 
appointed Commissioner since 1994 and has been chronically underfunded. 
The Commissioner role is essential for ONHIR to carry out its statutory 
obligations, including working directly with Navajo political 
leadership, as well as to provide oversight and accountability for the 
relocation program.
    The initial funding for ONHIR was allocated with the anticipation 
that roughly 1,000 Navajo people would be relocated, but the actual 
number-so far-is over 15,000 Navajo people.\7\ In addition to the lack 
of funding for the relocation, many of the ``host communities'' for the 
relocation were ill-equipped-and not separately funded-to receive such 
large influxes to their populations. As a result, areas such as the 
Dzil Yijiin region have been overly burdened and suffered impacts to 
their housing, infrastructure, grazing capacity, and other aspects of 
community life.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ See Fast Facts, GAO-18-266, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY 
OFFICE (Apr. 24, 2018), https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-266.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Navajo Nation near northeast Arizona has suffered two federal-
imposed development freezes. The first impacted what is now known as 
the Navajo Partitioned Lands (NPL) and lasted from 1958-1979. This 
freeze was a construction freeze on the joint use area (JUA) and was 
only resolved with the partitioning of those lands into the Hopi 
Partitioned Lands (HPL) and NPL respectively. The impacts of this 
freeze have not been addressed by Congress and, as a result, many 
homes, Chapter Houses, senior centers, in need of dire repair and, in 
some cases, replacement. Many of these locations lack access to usable 
roads, and to basic necessities such as water, sewer, electricity, and 
communication services. On average, residents of the NPL must travel 
over 50 miles for hospital services, and police assistance is located 
more than 40 miles away.
    The second major freeze was the ``Bennett Freeze'' from 1966 to 
2009, a development freeze that left 1.6 million-acres-comprised of 
nine Navajo Chapter communities along the western part of the Navajo 
Nation-ineligible for any Federal aid or Tribal aid, including aid for 
poverty, economic development, construction and infrastructure, as well 
as for programs designed specifically for Indians. The Bennett Freeze 
was initially enacted by then-Commissioner of Indian Affairs who 
believed that it could be used to ease centuries-long land disputes 
between the Navajo and Hopi Tribes by requiring both Tribes-who had 
just engaged in contentious litigation over the land \8\-to consent to 
any improvements made to the disputed land. In 1980 \9\ and 1988
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\  the Settlement Act was amended to include the Bennett Freeze. 
All in all, the Bennett Freeze was in place for 43 years and severely 
stunted and harmed the people on these lands. Critical and immediate 
investment is needed to address the lack of housing, safe drinking 
water, electricity, emergency services, communications, and more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The harms caused by the United States' forced relocation of Navajo 
citizens and its decades-long development freezes must be resolved. 
Therefore, we call on Congress to begin the final resolution through 
appropriations that address its outstanding obligations to the Navajo 
people.
                          summary of requests
    1. Immediate transfer of not less than $15 million in ``excess'' 
funds held by ONHIR to the Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund (NRTF) to 
address current needs of relocatees and relocation communities.\11\ 
ONHIR States that it has more funds than it needs to complete its 
mission, which it has narrowly defined. The Navajo Nation disagrees and 
believes that these ``excess'' funds should be transferred to the NRTF, 
which was established pursuant to the Relocation Act and whose monies 
are ``solely for purposes which will contribute to the continuing 
rehabilitation and improvement of the economic, educational, and social 
condition of families, and Navajo communities, that have been affected 
by'' the Relocation.\12\ Transferred funds should not be subject to any 
repayment obligation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ Proposed legislative language: ``Not less than $15,000,000 of 
the unobligated balances of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian 
Relocation shall be transferred to the Navajo Rehabilitation Trust 
Fund; however, such funds shall not be subject to the reimbursement 
obligations of Pub. L. 93-531, Sec. 32(e), as amended by Pub. L. 100-
666, Sec. 7.''
    \12\ Pub. L. 93-531, Sec. 32(d), as added by Pub. L. 100-666, 
Sec. 7, previously codified at 25 U.S.C. Sec. 640d-30(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2. ONHIR should be funded for a period of 10 years to oversee a 
multi-agency program to redress adverse impacts of relocation. There 
should also be a program to rehabilitate areas where development has 
been frozen for many years.\13\ The Relocation Plan reflects the intent 
and mandate of the Relocation Act both to provide for relocation and 
``to rehabilitate an area in which development has been frozen for many 
years.'' In support of that mandate, the Relocation Act authorizes 
ONHIR to ``call upon any department or agency of the United States to 
assist . . . in implementing the relocation plan'' and mandates that 
any such agency called upon ``shall provide reasonable assistance so 
requested.'' \14\ ONHIR, along with the Navajo Nation and the following 
Federal agencies should develop a multi-agency rehabilitation plan to 
benefit the relocatees: Interior, HUD, Agriculture, Transportation; EPA 
and Commerce.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ This multi-agency initiative should also apply to the former 
Bennett Freeze area. Notably, the FBFA was a part of the relocation 
law. See Pub. L. 96-305, Sec. 3, 94 Stat. 929, 930 (1980) (adding 
Relocation Act Sec. 9(f)), repealed by Pub. L. 111-18, 123 Stat. 1611 
(2009).
    \14\ Pub. L. 93-531, Sec. 12(e), as amended, previously codified at 
25 U.S.C. Sec. 640d-11(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3. Forgiveness of Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund Loan. The NRTF 
provided resources to the Navajo Nation to address ``the rehabilitation 
and improvement of the economic, educational, and social condition of 
families and Navajo communities that have been affected by'' the 
relocation law. The legislative history makes clear that the NRTF was 
designed to ensure that the infrastructure promises made in the 
Settlement Act were fulfilled. When the Trust Fund was added to the law 
the idea was that the United States would front the fund to begin 
infrastructure development and the Nation would repay those funds out 
of revenue generated from lands selected in New Mexico. However, the 
New Mexico lands have never been developed and so this 25+ year old 
debt, on obligations the United States should have undertaken anyway, 
has not been reimbursed. The NRTF was authorized to $60 million in 
1995, only $16 million of which was appropriated. The Navajo Nation 
respectfully requests that the full amount of allocations be 
reauthorized, and that past and future appropriations be forgiven, as 
the costs of addressing the impacts of the relocation are more properly 
borne by the Federal Government.
    4. Expansion of Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation 
Authority. Authorizes the Commissioner to carry out a rehabilitation in 
the Former Bennet Freeze Area for housing construction and renovation, 
and initiatives for infrastructure improvements and economic 
development. The bill would require the Commissioner issue implementing 
regulations and enter into self-determination contracts to carry out 
this work upon request by the Navajo Nation or Hopi Tribe.
    5. Funding for Navajo Thaw Initiative and Former Bennett Freeze 
Area Rehabilitation Trust Fund. The Navajo Thaw initiative was created 
by the Navajo Nation government to provide comprehensive planning for 
the recovery of these areas. The Navajo Thaw initiative requires 
funding so it can carry out its duties regarding the planning for and 
recovery of affected areas. A trust fund in the U.S. Treasury for 
disbursement to the Navajo Nation for efforts to immediately 
rehabilitate the economic, housing, infrastructure, health, 
educational, and social conditions in Navajo communities affected by 
the Former Bennett Freeze. The fund shall continue until, upon petition 
by the Navajo Nation, the Secretary of Interior acting as trustee of 
the fund determines that its purposes have been fulfilled.
    6. Funding of a Navajo Partitioned Lands Rehabilitation Trust Fund. 
To be used by the Navajo Nation to immediately provide rehabilitation 
to the Navajo Partitioned Lands, for not less than $20 million per 
annum until its purposes have been fulfilled
    7. Funding for studies, analyses, and reports concerning the Navajo 
relocation and construction/development freezes. These studies will be 
used to analyze the impact of the relocation and development freezes on 
multiple generations of Navajo families, economic development, 
infrastructure, traditional lifeways, the Navajo aquifer, and other 
areas as determined through coordination with the Navajo Nation.
    8. Support for the Navajo Technical Amendments. This legislation 
that has been introduced for several Congresses that would implement or 
advance many of the items identified above. Although this is not a 
matter for appropriations, it is something that we hope members of the 
subcommittee will support.

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and 
                              Enforcement
    Compact Commission (IMCC). My address is 437 Carlisle Drive, Suite 
A, Herndon, VA 20190. My phone number is 703 709 8654. My email is 
tclarke@imcc.isa.us. We request that $69.89 million be provided in the 
budget of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 
(OSMRE) of the Department of the Interior for State and Tribal 
regulatory grants under Title V of the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024. We also 
request that a significantly increased amount, at least $65 million, be 
appropriated for the hardrock abandoned mine lands program authorized 
by section 40704 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 
in FY 2024.
    I appreciate the opportunity to present this statement conveying 
the views of IMCC's 26 member States on the FY 2024 budget for OSMRE. 
The Compact is comprised of 26 States that together produce over 98% of 
the Nation's coal, as well as other important minerals. Among the 
Compact's purposes are to advance the protection and restoration of 
land, water and other resources affected by mining through the 
encouragement of programs in each of the party States that will achieve 
comparable results in protecting, conserving and improving the 
usefulness of natural resources.
    States are given exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the 
environmental impacts of coal mining under Title V of SMCRA. This means 
that the core regulatory functions under this Federal law are being 
carried out at the state level by IMCC member States. Primacy States 
perform all the duties mandated by SMCRA, including inspection and 
enforcement, ensuring that timely reclamation occurs following mining, 
designating lands as unsuitable for mining and permitting. In addition 
to performing the regulatory work Congress required in SMCRA, States 
pay a significant portion of the cost of meeting this mandate. Half of 
the cost of regulation on non-federal lands is borne by the States. In 
the aggregate, the States are paying approximately 46% of the total 
cost of SMCRA regulation (all of the cost of regulation on Federal 
lands is borne by the Federal Government). In addition to the fact that 
States bear a large part of the cost of regulation, another feature of 
state regulation that makes it cost-effective is lower personnel cost. 
The biggest single category of program expense is payroll and state pay 
scales are, for the most part, lower than those of the Federal 
Government. Accordingly, fulfilling the Federal mandate for effective 
environmental regulation of coal mining impacts comes at a bargain to 
the Federal Government.
    It is no secret that coal production in America has declined. 
Instead of simplifying the regulatory challenge for States, the effect 
of this decline has been the opposite. The challenge of effectively 
regulating the environmental impacts of an industry in decline is much 
greater than when its markets were robust. Not only do States have the 
challenge of gaining compliance from mine operators who face declining 
cash flow, they also have the challenge of navigating their way through 
complex, high-stakes bankruptcies. Meanwhile, the number of permits 
that States must inspect has not declined at anywhere close to the 
falling rate of coal production. Adequate funding for protection of 
people and the environment from the adverse impacts of coal mining is 
more important than ever. Continued appropriation of adequate funding 
for State regulatory programs is essential if these programs are to 
achieve the objectives Congress established for them.
    Congress has appropriated $68.59 million in Federal funding for 
State and Tribal SMCRA Title V regulatory programs in five of the last 
seven fiscal years.\1\ This has been done in the face of proposed 
budgets in recent years that would have gutted appropriations for State 
regulatory programs, cutting them by as much as $25 million per year 
(proposed budget FY 2021). Congress has wisely rejected these proposed 
reductions and continued a much-needed trend of appropriating an amount 
for State regulatory grants that aligns closely with the States 
demonstrated needs. The States are grateful for this. Against this 
amount, consider that the total grant requests for all State and Tribal 
Title V regulatory programs combined have consistently exceeded $70 
million. For the last five fiscal years, the total of State and Tribal 
Title V budget requests has ranged from $70 to $76 million. These 
requests represent the amounts the States believe they will need from 
the Federal Government to operate their regulatory programs for the 
year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Grant funding for the Tribes' regulatory effort also comes from 
this appropriation. As appropriate in context, references herein to 
``States'' should be read to include the Tribes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The amount the States have been able to actually spend for 
operation of these regulatory programs has averaged $63 million per 
year. Importantly, the gap between actual expenditures and the States' 
projected funding needs has been closing. The States' actual 
expenditures are on an upward trend. A variety of factors have 
prevented the States from spending all of their budgeted funds. These 
generally include the time it takes to fill vacancies under state 
personnel procedures, State-wide hiring and/or spending freezes imposed 
when States face budgetary issues and state revenue shortages that 
affect a State's ability to match Federal dollars for program 
operation. State primacy under the SMCRA regulatory program dates to 
the early 1980's. As this regulatory program reached maturity in recent 
years, employees who began their employment when the State programs 
began have reached retirement age and moved on. When these senior 
employees have retired, they have often been replaced from within by a 
less senior employee. Less senior employees have often been replaced by 
junior employees, who have been replaced by new hires. It is not 
unusual for a State to go through the hiring process three times to 
eliminate the vacancy caused by a single retirement. During the time 
such vacancies persist, the money budgeted for the positions 
necessarily is not being spent. Because personnel costs are the biggest 
single cost driver for most State programs, vacancies are among the 
biggest of the challenges that a State program faces in operating 
according to budget. As the declining gap between budget needs and 
actual expenditures may demonstrate, the States are nearly past this 
wave of retirements and the multiple vacancies that can result from 
them. Multiple vacancies should pose less of a budgetary challenge in 
the future, so the States' future needs from the Federal Government 
should be closer to what they have budgeted.
    With many States now in a position to utilize more of their full 
grant amount, it is imperative that funding be maintained at a level 
that meets the estimates of program needs the States made in their 
budget requests. Those requests reflect the ongoing work associated 
with state program implementation including permit reviews, inspections 
and enforcement at all inspectable units. Even with reduced coal 
production, the States' workload has not correspondingly decreased--and 
in many cases has increased given the tenuous financial condition of 
some coal companies. Higher levels of vigilance are necessary to ensure 
contemporaneous reclamation and abatement of violations.
    This calls for vigilance by Congress. Inflation and other costs 
beyond the control of the States cannot be allowed to undermine State 
efforts to realize needed program improvements and enhancements or, 
more importantly, to jeopardize their efforts to minimize the potential 
adverse impacts of coal extraction operations on people and the 
environment. Our analysis of state program funding needs for FY 2024 
based on recent estimates indicate that a full Federal appropriation of 
$68.59 million will be required for the existing State and Tribal 
programs. This represents a good middle ground figure that balances the 
need to assure that adequate funds will be available to enable the 
States to perform this vital work with the recognition that factors 
beyond state control may continue to have some effect on States' 
ability to spend the entirety of their projected regulatory budgets. In 
addition, sufficient funds need to be provided for the new state 
program in Tennessee. Tennessee has been pursuing primacy. If it 
attains primacy, this will add $1.3 million to existing Title V State 
grant needs.\2\ Therefore, we urge appropriation of $69.89 million for 
State Title V grants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ While money for the Tennessee program might be an increase in 
the appropriation for State grants under SMCRA, it should be noted that 
it is merely a shift in existing SMCRA funding. OSMRE currently bears 
the entire cost of operating the Tennessee program from funds it 
receives for operation of Federal regulatory programs. When Tennessee 
attains primacy, the State will begin to bear half of the cost of the 
program there, with the other half coming from OSMRE's funds for state 
program grants. We urge you to consult OSMRE regarding the fiscal 
impact of Tennessee primacy on OSMRE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Clear indications from Congress that reliable, consistent funding 
will continue into the future has done much to stimulate support for 
these programs by State legislatures and budget officers who, in the 
face of difficult fiscal climates and constraints, have had to deal 
with the challenge of matching Federal grant dollars with state funds. 
This is particularly true for those States whose match is partially 
based on fees from the mining industry, where significant reductions in 
mining and permitting activity translate to lower revenue, but not 
necessarily a corresponding reduction in the volume of regulatory work 
for State agencies. Be aware that any cut in Federal funding generally 
translates to an additional cut of an equal amount for overall program 
funding for States, especially those without Federal lands, because, as 
a general matter, these States can only match the grant funds they 
receive from the Federal Government.
    A forward-looking observation that should be made concerns the 
potential impact of actions to eliminate emissions of greenhouse 
gasses. A foreseeable collateral impact of greenhouse gas regulation 
may be reduction or elimination of the revenue from the coal industry 
many States have been using to pay for their state share of the cost of 
SMCRA Title V regulatory programs. If this happens, the States are 
likely to need a significant increase in the Federal Government's share 
of regulatory program funding to make up the difference. In the 
aftermath of any significant new regulation of greenhouse gas 
emissions, well-funded State regulatory programs will be essential to 
the effort to effectively address the environmental impacts of existing 
mines.
    For all the above reasons, we urge Congress to approve not less 
than $69.89 million for State and Tribal Title V regulatory grants in 
FY 2024, the same amount enacted by Congress in most of the recent 
fiscal years, plus an additional $1.3 million to cover the grant needs 
of the State of Tennessee in its efforts to attain primacy. In doing 
so, Congress will continue its commitment to ensuring the States have 
the resources they need to continue their work on the forefront of 
environmental protection and preservation of public health and safety.
    In addition to State regulatory grants, the States have a great 
degree of interest in the appropriations for OSMRE's National Technical 
Training Program (NTTP) and Technical Information and Professional 
Service (TIPS). The States rely heavily on the NTTP and TIPS training 
classes for their new employees and for refresher courses for more 
seasoned employees. These training programs are especially important as 
States find themselves at a point where many of their employees are 
finishing careers and must be replaced with less experienced people. 
Any adjustments to these two programs should involve the States working 
through the NTTP/TIPS Steering Committee.
    With regard to funding for State Title IV Abandoned Mine Land (AML) 
program grants, in FY 2024, the States and Tribes should receive the 
mandatory appropriation (before sequestration) under the pre-existing 
AML Title IV program as well as grant amounts set under Section 40701 
of the IIJA. We also support appropriation of $135 million for the AML 
economic revitalization (AMLER) program for economic and community 
development goals. IMCC also supports a continuation of funding for 
watershed cooperative agreements at $1.5 million. Much valuable work 
has been accomplished through this program, especially given the 
matching funds that come from other sources besides OSMRE's share for 
these worthwhile projects.
    Section 40704 of the IIJA authorized a multi-year $3 billion 
hardrock AML program that would provide badly needed grants to States 
and Tribes to address the legacy hazards of non-coal mining. 
Unfortunately, the appropriation necessary to make this program a 
reality was omitted from the IIJA. Appropriations for FY 2022 and 2023 
have only supplied $5 million per year for the program, with only $1.7 
million per year targeted to State grants. We appreciate that demands 
for Federal funding are great, but much more is needed to enable this 
program to make meaningful progress in eliminating legacy mining 
hazards. The amounts in the Administration's proposed budgets for FY 
2022 and 2023, $65 million per year, would be a good start. We urge you 
to appropriate at least $65 million for the IIJA Section 40704 hardrock 
AML program in FY 2024 and to consider increasing this amount in future 
years.
    We appreciate the opportunity to submit this statement on OSMRE's 
budget for FY 2024. We also endorse the statement of the National 
Association of Abandoned Mine Land Programs (NAAMLP), which goes into 
greater detail regarding the implications of OSMRE's funding for the 
States and Tribes related to the AML program, as well as hardrock AML 
funding needs. We would be happy to answer any questions.

         Prepared Statement of Oregon Water Resources Congress
    fisheries restoration irrigation mitigation act (frima) program
    The Oregon Water Resources Congress (OWRC) is writing to express 
its strong support for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) 
Fisheries Restoration Irrigation Mitigation Act (FRIMA) program and is 
requesting $15 million in FY2024, which is the previously authorized 
amount. The FRIMA program is an essential cost-share funding program 
that helps water users and fishery agencies better protect sensitive, 
threatened, and endangered fish species while ensuring water supply 
delivery to farms and communities.
    OWRC was established in 1912 as a trade association to support the 
protection of water rights and promote the wise stewardship of water 
resources statewide. OWRC members are local governmental entities, 
which include irrigation districts, water control districts, drainage 
districts, water improvement districts, and other agricultural water 
suppliers that deliver water to roughly 1/3 of all irrigated land in 
Oregon. These water stewards operate complex water management systems, 
including water supply reservoirs, canals, pipelines, fish screens and 
fish passage, and hydropower facilities.
                         fy2024 appropriations
    The FRIMA program meets a critical need in fishery protection and 
restoration, complimenting other programs through USFWS. Fish passage 
and fish screen installations are a vital component to fishery 
protection with several benefits:

  --Keep sensitive, threatened and endangered fish out of canals and 
        water delivery systems

  --Allow fish to be safely bypassed around reservoirs and other 
        infrastructure

  --Reduce water quality risks to fish species

    There are over one hundred irrigation districts and other special 
districts in Oregon that provide water supplies to over one million 
acres of irrigated cropland in the state. Almost all these districts 
are affected by either State or Federal Endangered Species Act listings 
of salmon, steelhead, bull trout or other sensitive, threatened or 
endangered species. The design and installation of fish screens and 
fish passage facilities to protect the myriad of fish species is often 
cost-prohibitive for individual districts to implement without outside 
funding sources.
    The cost of addressing fish screening and fish passage needs in 
Oregon far outweighs current appropriations or the program 
authorization as a whole. Oregon irrigation districts anticipate at 
least $25 million in funding is needed to meet current fish passage and 
fish screen needs in our state alone. Limited cost-share funds are 
available from the Oregon Watershed Enhanced Board (OWEB), but the 
primary cost-share for fish screen and fish passage projects has been 
provided by the districts and their water users. Projects include 
construction of new fish screens and fish passage facilities as well as 
significant upgrades of existing facilities to meet new requirements 
(new species or science) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service and the USFWS. Upgrades are 
often needed to modernize facilities with new technologies that provide 
better protection for fish species as well as reduced maintenance and 
increased lifespan for the operator.
   background of the fisheries restoration irrigation mitigation act 
                            (frima) program
    FRIMA, originally enacted in November 2000, created a Federal 
partnership program incentivizing voluntary fish screen and fish 
passage improvements for water withdrawal projects in Idaho, Oregon, 
Washington and western Montana. The funding went to local governments 
for construction of fish screens and fish passage facilities and is 
matched with non-federal funding. Irrigation districts and other local 
governments that divert water for irrigation accessed the funding 
directly, while individual irrigators accessed funding through their 
local Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), which are local 
governments affiliated with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS).
    The original legislation in 2000 (PL.106-502) was supported and 
requested by the Pacific Northwest Partnership, a coalition of local 
governmental entities in the four Northwest States, including OWRC. The 
FRIMA legislation authorized $25 million annually, to be divided 
equally among the four States from 2001 to 2012, which was when the 
original authorization expired. The actual funding appropriated to the 
FRIMA program (through Congressional write-ins) ranged from $1 million 
to $8 million, well short of the $25 million originally authorized and 
far short of what is needed to address fish passage and screening needs 
across the region. However, that small amount of funding was used to 
leverage other funds and assisted the region in making measurable 
progress towards installing fish screens and fish passage critical to 
protecting and restoring populations of sensitive, threatened, and 
endangered fish species.
    FRIMA funding was channeled through USFWS to state fishery agencies 
in the four States, and distributed using an application and approval 
process based on a ranking system implemented uniformly among the 
States, including the following criteria: Fish restoration benefits, 
cost effectiveness, and feasibility of planned structure. All projects 
provided improved fish passage or fish protection at water diversion 
structures and benefitted native fish species in the area, including 
several state or federally listed species. Projects were also subject 
to applicable State and Federal requirements for project construction 
and operation.
    FRIMA was reauthorized as part of the Water Infrastructure 
Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) of 2016. However, a fifth state, 
California, was also added as an eligible FRIMA cost-share recipient 
and the program was only reauthorized for $15 million, well short of 
the estimated $500 million in fish screening and passage needs in the 
Pacific Northwest alone. Now that the program has been reauthorized, it 
is imperative the program receive appropriations so all five States can 
better leverage State and local funding to meet their fish passage and 
screening needs.
                            program benefits
    FRIMA projects provide immediate protection for fish and fills a 
large unmet need in the Western United States for cost-share assistance 
with fish screening and fish passage installation and improvements. 
Compared to other recovery strategies, installation of fish screens and 
fish passage has the highest assurance for increasing populations of 
sensitive, threatened, and endangered fish species in the Pacific 
Northwest. Furthermore, the construction of these facilities have 
minimal impact on water delivery operations, and projects are done 
cooperatively using methods well accepted by landowners and rural 
communities.
    Funding of the FRIMA program has catalyzed cooperative partnerships 
and innovative projects that provide immediate and long-term benefits 
to irrigators, fishery agencies, and local communities throughout the 
Pacific Northwest. This program is also a wise investment, with past 
projects contributing more than the required match and leveraging on 
average over one dollar for each Federal dollar invested. FRIMA 
provides for a maximum Federal cost-share of 65%, with the applicant's 
cost-share at 35% along with on-going maintenance and support of the 
structure for passage or screening purposes. Applicants operate the 
facilities and State agencies review and monitor the projects.
                       oregon projects & benefits
    Twenty-six fish screen or fish passage projects in Oregon were 
previously funded using FRIMA for part of the project financing. These 
projects have led to:

  --Installation of screens at 17 diversions or irrigation pumps

  --Removal or modification of 12 fish passage barriers

  --Three-hundred sixty-five miles of surface waters re-opened to safe 
        fish passage

    In addition, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has 
used some of the FRIMA funding to develop an inventory of needed fish 
screens and passages in the state. Grants ranged from just under $6,000 
to $400,000 in size with a local match averaging 64% of the project 
costs, well over the amount required under the act (35%). In other 
words, each Federal dollar invested in the FRIMA program generates a 
local investment of just over one dollar for the protection of fish 
species in the Pacific Northwest.
    The following are examples of how Oregon has effectively utilized 
FRIMA money. Additional examples of projects in other States are 
available from USFWS at: https://www.fws.gov/pacific/Fisheries/
reportpub/Documents/FRIMA%20Accomplishments%20Report%202002-2012.pdf
    Santiam Water Control District: Fish screen project on a large 1050 
cubic feet per second (cfs) multipurpose water diversion project on the 
Santiam River (Willamette Basin) near Stayton, Oregon. Partners are the 
Santiam Water Control District, ODFW, Marion Soil and Water 
Conservation District, and the City of Stayton. Approved FRIMA funding 
of $400,000 leveraged a $1,200,000 total project cost. Species 
benefited included winter steelhead, spring Chinook, rainbow trout, and 
cutthroat trout.
    South Fork Little Butte Creek: Fish screen and fish passage project 
on a 65 cfs irrigation water diversion in the Rogue River Basin near 
Medford, Oregon. Partners are the Medford Irrigation District and ODFW. 
Approved FRIMA funding of $372,000 leveraged a $580,000 total project 
cost. Species benefited included listed summer and winter steelhead, 
Coho salmon, and cutthroat trout.
    Running Y (Geary Diversion): Fish screen project on a 60 cfs 
irrigation water diversion in the upper Klamath Basin near Klamath 
Falls, Oregon. Partners are the Wocus Drainage District, ODFW, and 
Jeld-Wen Ranches. Approved FRIMA funding of $44,727 leveraged a total 
project cost of $149,000. Species benefited included listed red-band 
trout and short-nosed sucker.
    Lakeshore Gardens: Fish screen project on a 2 cfs irrigation water 
diversion in the upper Klamath Basin near Klamath Falls, Oregon. 
Partners are the Lakeshore Gardens Drainage District and ODFW. Approved 
FRIMA funding of $5,691 leveraged a total project cost of $18,970. 
Species benefited included red-band trout, short-nosed sucker and Lost 
River sucker.
                               conclusion
    Providing funding for the FRIMA program fills a vital funding gap 
for fish screens and fish passage projects that are needed to protect 
and restore sensitive, threatened, and endangered fish species, which 
in turn benefits the economy, local communities, and the environment. 
Eligible FRIMA funded projects are ready for construction and will 
provide immediate habitat benefits for fish as well as jobs and 
economic revitalization for local communities. Dollar-for-dollar, 
providing screening and fish passage at diversions is one of the most 
cost-effective uses of restoration dollars, creating fishery protection 
at relative low cost, with low risk and significant benefits.
    The return of a robustly funded FRIMA program will once again 
catalyze cooperative partnerships and innovative projects that provide 
immediate and long-term benefits to irrigators, fishery agencies, and 
local communities throughout the Pacific Northwest. We respectfully 
request an appropriation of $15 million for U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's Fisheries Restoration Irrigation Mitigation Act program for 
FY2024.

         Prepared Statement of Oregon Water Resources Congress
             clean water state revolving fund loan program
    The Oregon Water Resources Congress (OWRC) is highly supportive of 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water State 
Revolving Fund Loan Program (CWSRF). OWRC respectfully requests FY2024 
appropriations for this program be increased to at least $3 billion, as 
proposed in the President's Budget and included additional authorized 
funding found in the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Bill (BIL). The CWSRF 
is an effective loan program that addresses critical water 
infrastructure needs while benefiting the environment, local 
communities, and the economy. As an existing and proven program, it is 
a perfect fit for increased investment during a time of need for 
climate and environmentally friendly infrastructure.
    OWRC was established in 1912 as a trade association to support the 
protection of water rights and promote the wise stewardship of water 
resources statewide. OWRC members are local governmental entities, 
which include irrigation districts, water control districts, drainage 
districts, water improvement districts, and other agricultural water 
suppliers that deliver water to roughly 1/3 of all irrigated land in 
Oregon. These water stewards operate complex water management systems, 
including water supply reservoirs, canals, pipelines, fish screens and 
fish passage, and hydropower production facilities.
                         fy2024 appropriations
    We recognize our country must make strategic investments with 
scarce resources, particularly as our economy recovers from pandemic-
related impacts and inflation. The CWSRF is a perfect example of the 
type of program that should have funding increased because it creates 
jobs while benefiting the environment and is an efficient return on 
taxpayer investment. CWSRF projects provide much needed construction 
and professional services jobs, particularly in rural areas facing 
economic hardship. Moreover, as a loan program, it is a wise investment 
that allows local communities to leverage their limited resources and 
address critical infrastructure needs that would otherwise be unmet.
    In Oregon, the CWSRF is administered by the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ), which has updated its rules implementing 
the program to reflect new criteria enacted under the BIL. DEQ 
responsibly maintains the program through repaid loans, interest, fees, 
and available Federal capitalization grants. According to EPA, for 
every $1 of Federal capitalization funding, $3 worth of assistance is 
provided, leveraging available funds to maximize benefits for local 
communities, the environment, and the economy. Unfortunately, available 
funding for water infrastructure projects continues to be woefully 
insufficient to meet the growing water infrastructure funding needs in 
Oregon and nationwide. Appropriations for the CWSRF needs to be 
increased in FY2024, as authorized in the BIL, to support water 
infrastructure projects that are addressing these critical needs.
        background of cwsrf usage by oregon irrigation districts
    During the program's thirty-plus year history in Oregon, numerous 
OWRC member districts have successfully used CWSRF for projects that 
improve water quality and water conservation associated with water 
delivery diversions, canals, and pipelines throughout the state. OWRC 
and our members are highly supportive of the CWSRF, including promoting 
the program to our members, hosting workshops with agency staff, and 
annually submitting Federal appropriations testimony in support of 
increased funding for the CWSRF. We believe it is an important funding 
tool for irrigation districts and other water suppliers that are using 
it for innovative piping projects that provide multiple environmental 
and economic benefits.
    Numerous irrigation districts and other water suppliers need to 
pipe currently open canals, which significantly reduces sediment, 
improves water temperature, and provides other water quality benefits 
to rivers and streams. Piping immediately improves the efficiency of 
the water delivery system and helps increase available water supplies 
for aquatic life and irrigators alike. These projects also decrease 
energy consumption (from reduced pumping), and have opportunities for 
generating renewable energy, primarily through in-conduit hydropower. 
CWSRF is often an integral part of an overall package of local, State, 
and Federal funding sources necessitating a higher level of Federal 
loan funding availability for planned water infrastructure projects. 
Reductions in CWSRF appropriations could lead to loss of matching grant 
funding and delay or derail beneficial projects irrigation districts 
have been developing for years.
    The success Oregon districts have experienced using the loan 
program to design and implement multi-beneficial projects has led to 
increased applications to the CWSRF. Irrigation districts are once 
again eligible for a key funding element, principal forgiveness, up to 
50% and capped at $500,000 for projects in a distressed community or 
eligible for the Green Project Reserve designation. As a result, we 
expect to see even more interest in the program. OWRC is hopeful there 
will be enough funding available to complete projects that will not 
only benefit the environment and the patrons served by the water 
delivery system, but also benefit the rural economy.
                         cwsrf needs in oregon
    The appropriations for the CWSRF program prior to the BIL had 
fallen far short of what is needed to address critical water 
infrastructure needs in Oregon and across the Nation. This has led to 
fewer water infrastructure projects, and therefore a reduction in 
improvements to water quality and water conservation. However, OWRC is 
pleased with the 5-year commitment to increased funding authorized in 
the BIL. This Federal commitment is important as infrastructure needs 
have become more expensive and even more time critical.
    The most recent Intended Use Plan (IUP), updated on January 6, 
2023, includes 22 loan applications for a total of $174,783,989 in 
requested funding. Currently, the loan program has $312,610,437 net 
available to lend for state FY2023. DEQ can award a maximum individual 
loan amount of $46,891,566. The following irrigation district projects 
are included in the current FY2023 IUP. Increased funding will help 
catalyze many more projects like the ones below in Oregon and 
throughout the Nation:
                      oregon projects on fy23 iup
    Owyhee Irrigation District (Malheur County)--$500,000. 
Construction--Kingman Lateral First Mile Piping Project. Owyhee 
Irrigation District will construct 5,800 feet of piping of the Kingman 
Lateral canal to address embankment instability caused by seepage. The 
piping will prevent sediment loading and other water quality issues in 
the Owyhee River basin caused by seepage and/or catastrophic failure of 
this canal section. The project includes installation of pipe between 
the lateral headgate and a tunnel at the end of the worst problem 
section.
    Rogue River Valley Irrigation District and Medford Irrigation 
District (Jackson County)--$24,334,500. Design and Construction--Joint 
System Canal Piping Project. Rogue River Valley Irrigation District and 
Medford Irrigation District jointly use the Joint System Canal to serve 
several thousand customers with crop irrigation. Seepage and 
evaporation are occurring along the canal, which is resulting in lost 
water and ultimately less water flowing through the canal downstream to 
other water bodies. The proposed project includes design and 
construction of piping up to 4.4 miles of canal and diversions, 
replacement of siphons, improvements to water diversion structures, and 
fish passage. The project will address water quantity and quality 
downstream, including South Fork Little Butte Creek, which experiences 
low flow in some seasons. The project focuses on best management 
practices for irrigation to improve water quality from non-point 
sources and is consistent with the 2014 Nonpoint Source Management 
Program Plan sections 3.6.1 Watershed Approach Basin Reports and 6.1 
Clean Water State Revolving Fund.
    North Unit Irrigation District (Deschutes County) $8,150,000--Sec. 
319, Design and Construction: Lateral 43 and Juniper Butte Piping 
Project. The District's System Improvement Plan (2017) proposes to pipe 
the district's open canal network, including the addition of pressure 
reducing stations, reuse/retention reservoirs, and metered turnouts for 
every water user. The current project proposes to start in one portion 
of the district by piping laterals 31, 32, 34 and 43, which represents 
a total of 8.2 miles of leaky canal and serves over 9,800 acres of 
agricultural land. The project will improve water quality in the lower 
Crooked River, Lake Billy Chinook, and the lower Deschutes River by 
removing canal seepage and minimizing and eliminating return flow from 
agricultural lands. Piping of the laterals will also encourage on-farm 
efficiency by providing pressurized water, which enables the switch 
from furrow irrigation to sprinkler irrigation, reducing excessive 
seepage and agricultural runoff from fields. The project is consistent 
with Section 3.6.1 of the 2014 Nonpoint Source Management Plan and 
Section 6.1 of the CWSRF.
              examples of green project reserves in oregon
    Oregon irrigation districts and other water suppliers are on the 
forefront of innovative piping projects that provide and leverage 
multiple benefits, including ``green'' infrastructure projects. 
Otherwise known as Green Project Reserve (GPR), DEQ is required to use 
at least 10 percent of annual Federal capitalization grants on projects 
that promote water and energy efficiency, are environmentally 
innovative, or include green infrastructure.
    East Fork Irrigation District (Hood River County) $4,000,000--
Design and Construction--EFID Canal and Pipe Improvements. The proposed 
loan will support several water quality/water conservation projects 
that have been identified as high priority actions in recent East Fork 
Irrigation District planning studies. The primary projects will replace 
open canals or non-pressure rated pipe with pressure-rated pipe and 
pressure reducing stations. Additional potential projects would reduce 
warm water return flows; reduce sediment and chemical inputs to the 
Hood River; reduce water loss and remove sediment from the system; 
reduce operation and maintenance costs; and improve fish screening and 
increase instream flow. The proposed projects will meet multiple water 
quality improvement objectives including: 1) Decrease stream 
temperatures in the East Fork and mainstem Hood River (both reaches are 
covered by the Columbia-Hood River TMDL); and 2) Reduce sediment, 
pesticide, fertilizer, and other chemical inputs to the East Fork Hood 
River, Neal Creek, and the mainstem Hood River, all of which have water 
quality 303(d) listings.
    Arnold Irrigation District (Deschutes County) $8,699,900--Design 
and Construction--Infrastructure Resiliency and Modernization Project. 
The Arnold Irrigation District Infrastructure Resiliency and 
Modernization Project will enclose 11.9 miles (62,868 length-feet) of 
open porous canal into leak-free piping resulting in the conservation 
of 11,083 acre-feet (AF) of water per year. Piping the canals has two 
immediate outcomes: (1) a substantial reduction in water quantity 
diverted; and (2) substantial increase of water quantity remaining 
instream. These outcomes have an immediate benefit to improving 
streamflow that will result in improvements to water quality, habitat, 
and habitat availability in the Deschutes River downstream from Wickiup 
Reservoir.
    Providing increased appropriations for the CWSRF program will help 
implement additional innovative and multi-benefit projects like these 
in Oregon and across the Nation.
                               conclusion
    In conclusion, OWRC is strongly supportive of increased 
appropriations to the CWSRF program, allowing Oregon's DEQ to continue 
making targeted loans that address Clean Water Act issues and improve 
water quality while incentivizing innovative water management solutions 
that benefit local communities, agricultural economies, and the 
environment. This voluntary approach creates and promotes cooperation 
and collaborative solutions to complex water resources challenges. We 
respectfully request an appropriation of at least $3 billion as 
authorized in the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Bill for the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund 
for FY2024.

                                 ______
                                 
          Prepared Statement of the Pacific Salmon Commission
    Mister Chair, and Honorable Members of the Committee, in March 1985 
the United States and Canada agreed to cooperate in the management, 
research and enhancement of Pacific salmon stocks of mutual concern by 
ratifying the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST). I am Ron Allen, the Tribal 
Commissioner and Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee for 
the U.S. Section of the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC). The U.S. 
Section prepares an annual budget for implementation of the Pacific 
Salmon Treaty. The United States and Canada completed revisions of five 
of the Annex Chapters to the PST in 2019. The Annex Chapters contain 
the details for operations of fisheries under the Treaty and will be in 
operation for the next 10 years.
    Funding to implement the PST comes from the Departments of 
Interior, Commerce, and State. The integrated budget details program 
needs and costs for Tribal, Federal, and State agencies involved in the 
Treaty. Tribal participation in the Treaty process is funded within the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget as a line item within Rights 
Protection Implementation.

                In order to meet the increased obligations under the 
                Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement, the 25 affected Tribes 
                identified costs at $7,420,000 for Tribal research and 
                monitoring projects and participation in the U.S.-
                Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty process. This represents a 
                9.3% increase from FY 2023 levels. The funding for 
                Tribal participation in the Pacific Salmon Treaty is a 
                line item in the BIA's budget under Rights Protection 
                Implementation.

    Under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service programs, the U.S. Section 
identified funding needs as follows:

                USFWS participation in the Treaty process is currently 
                funded at $372,362. In addition, the Pacific States 
                Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) Regional Mark 
                Center receives support from the USFWS to provide data 
                services to the PSC process at $236,189 annually. The 
                U.S. Section recommends increasing the funding for 
                PSMFC by $150,000. The recommended total for the two 
                programs for FY 2024 is $758,551. The USFWS also 
                received an additional $4,700,000 for Pacific Salmon 
                Treaty Implementation in the Hatchery Operations 
                account starting in FY 2020. The USFWS uses these funds 
                to work with State agencies and Tribes to implement 
                projects on anadromous salmonids subject to the PST. 
                For FY 2023 the USFWS plans to transfer $400,000 of the 
                additional funds to the BIA to support Tribal 
                implementation of the PST. The U.S. Section recommends 
                maintaining that level of funding for FY 2024.

    The base funding for the USFWS supports critically important on-
going work and participation in the process. The funding for Pacific 
States Marine Fisheries Commission's Regional Mark Processing Center is 
utilized to meet Treaty requirements concerning data exchange with 
Canada. These program recommendations are integrated with those of 
participating State and Federal agencies to avoid duplication of effort 
and provide for the most efficient expenditure of limited funds.
    The U.S. Section of the PSC and the Treaty Tribes appreciate the 
increases in funding for the Tribes to implement the revised chapters 
of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. Tribal programs are essential for the 
United States to meet its international obligations. Tribal programs 
have taken on additional management responsibilities over time. The 
revised Chinook Chapter includes a new metric for evaluating terminal 
area fisheries. The CYER (Calendar Year Exploitation Rate) metric 
requires additional data collection and data management by the affected 
Tribes. All participating agencies need to be adequately supported to 
achieve a comprehensive U.S. effort to implement the Treaty. The U.S. 
Section of the PSC recommends the proposed increase in funding to 
support the work carried out by the twenty-five Treaty Tribes' 
participating in implementation of the Treaty. Programs carried out by 
the Tribes are closely coordinated with those of participating State 
and Federal agencies.
    The USFWS activities are essential, so the U.S. can maintain the 
coded wire tag database necessary to implement the Treaty. The work of 
the Regional Mark Processing Center includes maintaining and updating a 
coastwide computerized information management system for salmon harvest 
data as required by the Treaty. This work has become even more 
important to monitor the success of management actions aimed at 
reducing impacts on ESA-listed salmon populations. Canada has a 
counterpart database. The U.S. database will continue to be housed at 
the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. The U.S. Section 
appreciates the $4,700,000 in the Hatchery Operations account of the 
USFWS budget to work with State agencies and Tribes on producing 
hatchery fish to mitigate for catch reductions in the revised Chinook 
Chapter and for additional Tribal support. The U.S. Section recommends 
maintaining that funding for FY 2024.
    Funding to support activities under the Pacific Salmon Commission 
comes from the Departments of Interior, State, and Commerce. The U.S. 
Section can provide a cross-cut budget summary to the Committee. 
Adequate funding from all three Departments is necessary for the U.S. 
to meet its Treaty obligations. All the funds are needed for critical 
data collection and research activities directly related to the 
implementation and are used in cooperative programs involving Federal, 
State, and Tribal fishery agencies and the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans in Canada. The commitment of the United States is matched by the 
commitment of the Government of Canada.
    Mister Chair, the United States and Canada established the Pacific 
Salmon Commission, under the Pacific Salmon Treaty of 1985, to conserve 
salmon stocks, provide for optimum production of salmon, and to control 
salmon interceptions. After thirty-eight years, the work of the Pacific 
Salmon Commission continues to be essential for the wise management of 
salmon in the Pacific Northwest, British Columbia, and Alaska. For 
example, upriver bright fall Chinook salmon from the Hanford Reach of 
the Columbia River are caught in large numbers in Alaskan and Canadian 
waters. Tribal and non-Tribal fishers harvest sockeye salmon from 
Canada's Fraser River in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and in Puget Sound. 
Canadian trollers off the west coast of Vancouver Island catch 
Washington coastal Coho salmon and Puget Sound Chinook salmon. In the 
Northern Boundary area between Canada and Alaska, fish from both 
countries are intercepted by the other country in large numbers.
    The Pacific Salmon Commission provides a forum to ensure 
cooperative management of salmon populations. The United States and 
Canada reached agreements for revised Annex Chapters for management of 
Chinook, Coho, Chum, Fraser River Sockeye and Pink, and transboundary 
salmon populations for the next 10 years. It is critically important to 
have adequate resources for U.S. participants to implement the revised 
agreements and protect our Tribal Treaty resources.
    Before the Pacific Salmon Treaty, fish wars often erupted with one 
or both countries overharvesting fish that were returning to the other 
country, to the detriment of the resource. At the time the Treaty was 
signed, Chinook salmon were in a severely depressed state because of 
overharvest in the ocean as well as environmental degradation in the 
spawning rivers. Under the Treaty, both countries committed to rebuild 
the depressed runs of Chinook stocks and recommitted to that goal in 
1999 when adopting a coastwide abundance-based approach to harvest 
management. Under this approach, harvest management has complemented 
habitat conservation and restoration activities undertaken by the 
States, Tribes, and other stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest to 
address the needs of salmon listed for protection under the Endangered 
Species Act. The updated Annex Chapters continue these commitments. The 
combination of these efforts is integral to achieving success in 
rebuilding and restoring healthy, sustainable salmon populations.
    Finally, you should consider that the value of the commercial 
harvest of salmon subject to the Treaty, managed at productive levels 
under the Treaty, supports the infrastructure of many coastal and 
inland communities. The value of the commercial, recreational 
fisheries, and the economic diversity they provide for local economies 
throughout the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, is immense. The Commission 
funded an economic study of the fisheries and determined that this 
resource creates thousands of jobs and is a multi-billion dollar 
industry. The value of these fish to the twenty-four Treaty Tribes in 
Washington, Oregon, and Idaho goes far beyond their monetary value, to 
the cultural and religious lives of Indian people.
    The Commission funded a study to capture the socioeconomic value of 
the fisheries to U.S. Tribes and Canadian First Nations. A significant 
monetary investment is focused on salmon due to the listings of Pacific 
Northwest salmon populations under the Endangered Species Act. Given 
these resources, we continue to utilize the Pacific Salmon Commission 
to develop recommendations that help with the development and 
implementation of solutions to minimizing impacts on listed stocks. We 
continue to work towards the true intent of the Treaty, and with your 
support, we will manage this shared resource for mutual enhancements 
and benefits.
    Mister Chair, that concludes my written testimony submitted for 
consideration by your Committee. I want to thank the Committee for the 
support that it has given the U.S. Section in the past. Please feel 
free to contact me, or other members of the U.S. Section to answer any 
questions you or Committee members may have regarding the U.S. Section 
of the Pacific Salmon Commission budget.

and Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee.]
              Prepared Statement of Pinon Community School
    Pinon Community School is located on the Navajo Nation Reservation 
in Pinon, Arizona. We serve as a 1st-12th grade residential community 
for students who attend school at the Pinon Unified School District 
throughout the School Year. We also operate a kindergarten day school 
on our campus. We are a community grant school, funded by the Bureau of 
Indian Education (BIE) and operated pursuant to the Tribally Controlled 
Schools Act (Public Law 100-297). At Pinon Community School, we strive 
to be a resource for our students, their parents, and the greater 
community. Our Navajo language, culture, and values are at the heart of 
what we do. Pinon Community School is also a Member of the Dine Bi Olta 
School Board Association (DBOSBA), which represents all of the locally-
elected school boards within the Navajo Nation. We would like to 
associate ourselves with DBOSBA's FY 2024 appropriations testimony and 
tell our school's story to provide context for these priorities. Our 
testimony highlights the following FY 2024 priorities for the Bureau of 
Indian Education budget:

  --Increases for School Facility Construction and School Replacement 
        Construction (BIE);

  --Full and Forward Funding for School Facilities Operations and 
        Maintenance (BIE);

  --COVID-19 Relief Funds Expeditiously Distributed for Ventilation 
        Repairs (BIE);

  --50% Increase for ISEP Formula Funds (BIE);

  --Full Funding for Teacher and Counselor Pay Parity (BIE); and

  --Ensuring that employees of all BIE-funded schools are eligible to 
        participate in the Federal Employee Retirement System (BIE).

    School Facilities Improvement & Repair and School Replacement 
Construction funding in the BIE's Education Construction budget not 
only impacts the health and safety of our students and staff, it 
impacts the useful life of our buildings. Our school was built in 1995 
and is already facing significant facilities challenges: the buildings' 
foundations are shifting, there are critical piping issues with our 
hydraulic line, we lack a functioning HVAC system, our boiler needs 
parts replaced, our alarm system is not fully functional, and various 
other building renovations are needed. We have diligently logged these 
pressing concerns in the MAXIMO system; hired engineers and contractors 
with relevant experience to provide site assessments, designs, and 
proposals; contacted the BIE; and contacted the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs Division of Facilities Management and Construction (DFMC), all 
to little avail. Many of these issues could have been avoided if 
corners had not been cut when our school buildings were replaced in 
1995 and in the following years the BIE and DFMC had properly 
maintained these buildings. The DFMC when pressed, offers small, 
nominal fixes for discrete building problems when comprehensive 
solutions are needed. While the BIE owns the buildings we use, the BIE 
and DMFC have not taken the necessary actions to properly repair and 
maintain them.
    School Facilities Operations and Maintenance funds also play a 
pivotal role in the health and safety of our students and staff. More 
funding is needed to address the BIE system-wide maintenance backlog, 
to hire staff with sufficient repair and maintenance expertise, to 
ensure schools have enough funding to adequately heat and cool our 
buildings with adequate air circulation to reduce the risk of 
coronavirus transmission, and to ensure that safety inspections are 
completed and provided to schools in a timely fashion (we are still 
waiting for the results of our most recent safety inspection). We also 
encourage Congress to shift these two accounts to the forward funded 
portion of the BIE's budget to help further insulate schools from the 
disruptive uncertainties of continuing resolutions and government 
shutdowns.
    COVID-19 Relief Funds Must Be Expeditiously Distributed for 
Ventilation Repairs. Our HVAC system is a fundamental, pressing 
concern. Since 2017, Pinon Community School has requested assistance 
from the BIE and DFMC for HVAC improvements to address excessive heat. 
Currently on our campus, the dormitories, recreational building, 
kindergarten classrooms, and cafeteria building are without HVAC units, 
which provide critical ventilation and air conditioning. The Navajo 
Nation is requiring all schools to conduct a walkthrough of school 
facilities to assess and document findings that may impede students 
from safely returning to school. Unfortunately, we have been unable to 
complete the walk through due to our lack of ventilation. An improved 
HVAC system is not only a critical safety measure, it is critical to 
our ability to bring our students back for in-person services. A safe 
and healthy in-person living and residential environment is crucial to 
the well-being of our students and community. We have worked diligently 
to take steps to improve the HVAC system. Recently, the DFMC began 
construction on a portion of the project; however, the project is very 
limited in scope and will not permit proper ventilation for the 
entirety of the school campus, including the kindergarten classroom. 
Despite this, we have secured design plans and estimates for what it 
would take fully repair and replace the HVAC and associated hydraulic 
cooling system. We have also selected contractors who are licensed to 
perform this work. The estimate we were provided is roughly $4 
million--far more than Pinion Community School has been allocated in 
emergency COVID-19 relief funds. The DFMC's tinkering around the edges 
of this problem is not acceptable, particularly when COVID-19 relief 
funds have been allocated by the BIE to help schools repair, replace 
and upgrade our HVAC systems.
    We would like to sincerely thank Congress, and specifically these 
subcommittees, for appropriating several rounds of urgently needed 
COVID-19 relief funds to the BIE school system. Your support helped our 
students, teachers and schools weather the worst of the pandemic and we 
could not have come this far without these emergency funds. The delays 
on the BIE and DFMC's implementation, however, have frustrated our 
attempts to make the critical improvements to our facilities, which are 
needed to safely welcome back our students.
    Given the urgency of our School's needs and Congress' intent to 
rapidly deploy COVID-19 relief funds, we find BIE and DFMC 
implementation delays particularly troubling. We note that from the 
three rounds of COVID-19 relief funds Congress appropriated ``for 
programs operated or funded by the BIE'', 10 percent or $125.9 million 
was set-aside for the BIE's ``national-level support/administrative 
reserve.'' The BIE in subsequent webinars, communications to schools 
and press releases specified that the ``national-level support/
administrative reserve'' funds are focused on the following: mental 
health services; learning management system investments; HVAC & indoor 
air quality improvements; emergency management and coordination; 
communications outreach; system enhancements (NASIS); oversight and 
records support; and ``other priorities''. Further, BIE specified that 
schools wishing to access these funds should enter this into MAXIMO, 
and contact the BIE and the DFMC, which we have done. While some of the 
BIE's other identified uses of the ``national-level support/
administrative reserve'' funds appear to have, at best, only a 
tangential impact on keeping our students and staff safe, ``HVAC & 
indoor air quality improvements'' are fundamental to their health and 
safety. We urgently need $4 million for our HVAC repair and replacement 
project and we urge the DFMC to provide this funding without further 
delay.
    ISEP Formula Funds are our core operating account. This account 
funds everything from classroom instruction materials and teacher 
salaries to gifted and talented programs, summer programs, and food 
services. Increases in ISEP Formula Funds directly benefit students and 
help attract and retain the quality teachers vital to our students' 
academic success, but this account is severely underfunded and the 
nominal increases each year have very seriously lagged behind inflation 
year over year. Further, while the $40.8 million increase to ISEP 
Formula Funds between FY 2022 to FY 2023 is indeed one of the most 
significant increases this budget category has seen in some years, it 
was spread across the 183 schools in the BIE system, resulting in only 
an average increase of $223,234 per school. BIE-funded schools across 
the Nation are facing a significant teacher shortage, but that shortage 
is particularly acute here on the Navajo Nation, where many schools 
operate in remote locations and because the surrounding public schools 
in New Mexico and Arizona have responded to the teacher shortage by 
substantially increasing teacher pay. We are currently working to 
increase enrollment but the state of our facilities and our 
difficulties attracting and retaining teachers and staff is holding us 
back from fully realizing our potential as a school and as a resource 
for our community. For example, we are exploring the concept of 
offering vocational education options for our high school students but 
more funding would be needed to develop that curriculum and hire the 
teachers and staff to run it. Having the resources to attract and 
retain quality teachers and counselors is a significant challenge for 
us. A 50% increase to ISEP would help us regain some the ground we have 
lost to decades of negative inflation-adjusted budget growth.
    Full Funding for Teacher and Counselor Pay Parity is a critical 
tool for attracting and retaining quality teachers. Federal law 
requires the BIE to provide funding so that teachers and counselors in 
the BIE-funded school system may be paid equivalent salaries to their 
counterparts in the Department of Defense Education Activity. Federal 
law also provides that, at the discretion of the local school board, a 
BIE-operated school may pay salaries consistent with those paid by 
public schools in the state where the BIE school is located.
    We would like to thank the subcommittees for the FY 2021 House 
Report 116-448 and the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the 
2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act which direct the BIE to ``clearly 
display funding amounts required to comply with Defense Department-
equivalent pay rates as part of future budget justifications and to 
include sufficient funding in its budget request to fully fund these 
requirements''. We ask the subcommittees to continue to hold the BIE 
accountable for quantifying and requesting the correct amount for 
teacher and counselor pay parity and ensuring that the amounts provided 
are sufficient to match the increases provided by the Defense 
Department schools or are consistent with the rate of pay of public 
schools in the States where our BIE-operated and tribally controlled 
schools are located, whichever of these rates are higher. Given the 
acute teacher shortages, this parity is essential to our school's 
ability to recruit and retain qualified teachers and counselors.
    Ensuring that employees of all BIE-funded schools are eligible to 
participate in the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) would 
significantly bolster the ability of grant schools in the BIE school 
system to attract and retain quality teachers. Congress recently 
extended grant schools the opportunity to offer their employees 
insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and 
Federal Employee Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) programs. Also, in House 
Report 117-400 accompanying the FY2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
Congress directed Indian Affairs to ``study the systems, processes, and 
authorizations necessary to extend FERS benefits to police officers 
employed under a Public Law 93-638 contract or compact.'' Pinon 
Community School is seeking similar language for teachers and staff 
employed by Bureau of Indian Education-funded, Tribally Controlled 
Schools operated under Public Law 100-297 grants or Public Law 93-638 
contracts.
    Thank you. We would like to thank the subcommittees for your 
support and partnership throughout the pandemic. The resources you 
allocated for BIE system schools helped keep our students and teachers 
safe and connected. We also deeply the appreciate the recent increases 
provided to the key BIE accounts we depend on and for your ongoing 
oversight of the BIE. We consider you our partners in this important 
endeavor of preparing our students for a bright future. Thank you for 
the opportunity to provide this testimony. Please consider us a 
resource if you have any questions.

                                 ______
                                 
               Prepared Statement of Preservation Action
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski and Members of the 
subcommittee, on behalf of Preservation Action's thousands of members 
and supporters--representing nearly every State--we appreciate the 
opportunity to present written testimony on the Department of 
Interior's FY 2024 Appropriations for the National Park Service and its 
historic preservation programs. Founded in 1974, Preservation Action is 
a 501(c)4 nonprofit organization created to serve as the National 
grassroots advocacy organization for historic preservation. We 
represent an active and engaged grassroots constituency from across the 
country, and this testimony reflects their priorities.
    First, we would like to thank the subcommittee for their strong 
support of historic preservation programs and priorities in the past 
several Interior Appropriations bills--especially for the FY23 Interior 
Appropriations bill, which funded the Historic Preservation Fund at 
$204.515 million. This marked the eighth consecutive year of record 
funding for the program--again exceeding the program's outdated $150 
million authorized level--reflecting the growing need of State and 
Tribal Historic Preservation Offices and the impactful work the HPF 
makes possible through competitive grant programs. Thanks to your 
support, all Americans continue to benefit from programs that have a 
proven track record of saving places Americans value, revitalizing 
communities, combating climate change by reusing infrastructure, and 
creating jobs.
    Preservation Action's mission is to demonstrate that historic 
preservation is a national priority. For 49 years we've advocated for 
sound preservation policy, including two of the most important tools 
for historic preservation: the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) and the 
Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit (HTC).
           national park service: historic preservation fund
    The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) is the principal source of 
funding to implement the Nation's historic preservation programs. Since 
1976 the HPF has helped to recognize, save, revitalize, and protect 
America's historic resources.
    HPF funding is critical to ensure State and Tribal Historic 
Preservation Offices (SHPOs/THPOs), whose job it is to administer 
Federal historic preservation program, have the staffing capacity 
needed for the timely review of infrastructure and other Federal 
projects per requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act.
    HPF funding also supports critically important competitive grant 
programs. The Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization Grant Program is 
helping to foster economic development in rural communities through 
subgrants, like the Oregon Historic Theaters Subgrant Program that has 
revitalized historic theaters in small towns across Oregon or a program 
to rehabilitate National Register properties in Sitka, Alaska. While 
programs like the African American Civil Rights Grant Program, the 
History of Equal Rights grant program, the Underrepresented Communities 
Grant Program, and others are helping to tell a more diverse and 
inclusive American story.
    Preservation Action recognizes the strong support Congress, 
especially this Committee, has shown for the HPF in recent years. But 
more is needed, especially as SHPOs and THPOs face increased workloads 
as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is implemented.

  --Preservation Action recommends this subcommittee to continue their 
        strong support of historic preservation by appropriating $225 
        million in funding for the Historic Preservation Fund in FY24's 
        Department of Interior budget, including funding at the 
        following levels:

  --$70 million for State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs). SHPOs 
        carry out the primary functions of the National Historic 
        Preservation Act: finding and documenting America's historic 
        places, nominating places to the National Register, aiding 
        rehabilitation tax credit projects, reviewing impacts of 
        Federal projects, working with local governments, and 
        conducting preservation education and planning. Due to 2023 
        changes to SHPO apportionments, 23 States did not receive an 
        increase in funding from 2022 to 2023.

  --$40 million for Save America's Treasures Program. The Save 
        America's Treasures grants program helps preserve nationally 
        significant historic properties and collections that convey our 
        Nation's rich heritage to future generations of Americans.

  --$34 million for Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs). 
        THPOs are designated by federally recognized Tribal governments 
        and assume the Federal compliance role of the SHPO on their 
        respective Tribal lands. Tribal historic preservation plans are 
        based on traditional knowledge and cultural values, and may 
        involve projects to improve Indian schools, roads, health 
        clinics and housing. THPOs are chronically underfunded. Funding 
        levels have not kept pace with the growing number of Indian 
        Tribes with THPO programs, resulting in a lower average 
        apportionments per tribe.

  --$28 million for the African American Civil Rights Initiative 
        Grants. A competitive grant program to preserve the sites and 
        stories of the African American struggle to gain equal rights.

  --$13 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
        (HBCUs). Funding provides grants to HBCUs to preserve and 
        repair historic buildings on their campuses.

  --$17 million for Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization Subgrants. 
        Supports the rehabilitation of historic properties and fosters 
        economic development of rural communities through subgrants.

  --$11 million for the Semiquincentennial Grants. Competitive grant 
        program that preserves publicly-owned historic sites 
        commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S.

  --$7 million for the History of Equal Rights Grant Program. A 
        competitive grant program to preserve sites and stories related 
        to the struggle of all Americans to achieve equal rights.

  --$5 million for the Under-Represented Communities Grant Program. 
        These competitive grants support the survey and nomination of 
        properties to the National Register of Historic Places 
        associated with currently under-represented communities.

Total FY 2024 Historic Preservation Fund Request: $225 million

  --Preservation Action also encourages support for the Historic 
        Preservation Reauthorization Act (H.R. 3350). This bill would 
        reauthorize the Historic Preservation Fund for 10 years and 
        increases the authorized level to $250 million. The HPF's 
        authorization has not been increased since the program's 
        inception in 1976 and the program's current authorization is 
        set to expire in September of this year. This would provide 
        much needed certainty to the States, Tribes, and local 
        communities that rely on this funding to carry out their 
        critical preservation work.
   national park service: federal historic rehabilitation tax credit
    The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit (HTC), administered by 
SHPOs, THPOs, and the National Park Service is the most significant 
Federal investment in historic preservation. The HTC has supported 
historic rehabilitation projects across the country, like the 
renovation of the 1928 New Redmond Hotel in Redmond, OR or the 
rehabilitation of the historic McKinley Tower Apartments in Anchorage, 
AK. The HTC has been a catalyst for development and job creation, and 
is responsible for:

  --Rehabilitating more than 48,000 historic buildings across the 
        Nation.

  --Leveraging over $199 billion in private investment.

  --Creating more than 3 million jobs since its inception.

  --Producing over 185,000 affordable housing units.

  --Rehabilitating buildings and revitalizing communities in all 50 
        States.

  --Returning more to the Treasury than the cost of the program.

    Preservation Action supports the bipartisan Historic Tax Credit 
Growth and Opportunity Act (S. 639), which would increase the value of 
the HTC, improve access to the credit, and make the credit more 
appealing for smaller projects.

  --Preservation Action urges the Committee to continue to support the 
        Historic Tax Credit by sufficiently funding SHPOs, THPOs and 
        the National Park Service who administer the program.
  national park service: african-american burial grounds preservation 
                                program
  --Preservation Action supports $3 million in funding for the newly 
        authorized, African-American Burial Grounds Preservation 
        Program.

    This program was established by Congress as part of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and was included in the 
President's budget request. This program will identify, document, 
preserve, research, and interpret these historic and sacred burial 
sites whose protection and documentation has too often been neglected 
or forgotten.
             national park service: national heritage areas
  --We express our support for $33.5 million for the Heritage 
        Partnership Program, which supports National Heritage Areas 
        (NHAs) nationwide.

    Designated by Congress, NHAs are community-driven sites that weave 
cultural, natural, and historic resources together to tell nationally-
significant stories. NHAs rely on public-private funding where every 
Federal dollar allocated is matched with an average of $5.50 in public 
and private funds. We appreciate the passage of the bipartisan National 
Heritage Area Act, which established standardized criteria of NHAs and 
ensures long-term sustainability. $33.5 million keeps all NHAs at their 
existing funding levels while funding newly authorized NHAs.
     independent agency: advisory council on historic preservation
    The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) is an 
independent Federal agency that promotes the preservation, enhancement, 
and sustainable use of the Nation's diverse historic resources, and 
advises the President and Congress on national historic preservation 
policy. We appreciate the continued support of this important agency.

  --Preservation Action recommends the Committee support $10.5 million 
        for the ACHP in the FY 2023 Interior Appropriations Bill. An 
        increase in funding will enhance the critical functions of the 
        agency: ensuring the Nation's historic and cultural resources 
        are protected, advancing Tribal consultation, and finding 
        efficiencies to deliver timely Federal review of major 
        infrastructure projects.
                               conclusion
    Preservation Action appreciates the opportunity to provide our 
views on the FY24 Department of Interior budget. We work closely with a 
broad cross-section of preservation professionals from the State and 
local level and are pleased to add their perspective via our testimony.
    Preservation Action continues to value the dedicated work of 
National Park Service employees, partnership with the Advisory Council 
on Historic Preservation, and the instrumental work of SHPOs and THPOs 
in preserving America's cultural heritage.
    Thank you for valuing the input of the preservation community as 
you consider the FY24 Department of Interior budget and your past 
support of vital historic preservation programs. We look forward to 
working with the committee and are happy to answer any questions.

I. Safeguard Tribal Cultural Patrimony

    1. $1.5 Million for Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) Enforcement. The provision of dedicated 
NAGPRA enforcement funding has supported the creation of a new FTE 
position committed to the protection of Tribal patrimony, as well as 
Bureau-wide trainings on the law and the harmful consequences that can 
ensue when it is violated. This is contributing directly to the 
development of a more culturally competent understanding of the 
importance of Tribal patrimony to Native peoples for improved law 
enforcement activities. We ask that this funding be maintained in FY 
2024 and beyond.

    2. $3 Million for Funding Implementation of the Safeguard Tribal 
Objects of Patrimony (STOP). Act. This law, passed in the last 
Congress, will assure the protection of many sensitive Tribal items 
from illegal export. It is important to put in place the necessary 
resources in the Federal Government to enable this law to be 
implemented. We request that at least $1 million be allocated for FY 
2024 for the purposes of implementation and enforcement of this law.
    3. $20 Million for Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs). 
The preservation of Tribal sacred and cultural sites is a priority for 
all Indian Country. Damage of these sites is often irreversible, 
forever altering the way in which we can express ourselves as 
indigenous people. More Tribes are establishing THPOs under the 
National Historic Preservation Act to protect this heritage, yet 
Federal funding has not kept pace with this expansion. It is thus 
difficult for Tribal governments to meet their preservation compliance 
duties and responsibilities, which include working with other 
governments on site identification, conducting surveys, compiling data 
and samples, documenting best practices, and assisting in museums and 
research centers that preserve and share Tribal material culture. We 
request $20 million for THPO support in FY 2024.

    4. Maintain the Funding Moratorium Related to Energy Leasing in the 
Greater Chaco Region. We request that Congress maintain the moratorium 
on oil and gas leasing on Federal land in the withdrawal area of the 
Greater Chaco Region. We request this moratorium span the lifetime of 
the legislation rather than becoming ineffective upon completion of the 
ongoing Tribally-led cultural resource studies. However, if a temporal 
limit must be included, we ask the moratorium stay in place until 
completion of the studies and the Resource Management Plan Amendment.

    5. Increase Funding for All Public Lands Conservation Program 
Accounts. Acoma's religious, cultural, social, and ancestral identity 
is rooted in the land of Bears Ears, Mount Taylor, and Chaco Canyon-
among countless other sacred landscapes in the region. Any reductions 
in the Federal protections accorded to these lands per their status as 
National Monuments, Forests, Parks, or Wilderness Areas necessarily 
impacts our cultural and spiritual interests. The failure to provide 
minimum appropriations to carry out Federal public lands management 
responsibilities impairs the ability of Interior agencies to fulfill 
trust obligations and places invaluable Tribal resources at risk. We 
urge Congress to provide increased funding for public lands 
conservation programs across the Department of Interior, including the 
NPS, USFS, USFWS, BIA, and BLM.

II. Promote the Health and Well-Being of Indian Country

    6. Provide Permanent Advance Appropriations for the Indian Health 
System. We ask for full funding for the IHS on a permanent 2-year 
advance appropriations cycle to fulfill the United States' obligation 
to provide for Indian health. This advance appropriation has occurred 
for FY 2024 but needs to be made permanent. We strongly support the IHS 
Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup's recommendation for $49.8 billion 
to fully fund the Indian health system budget. It is vital that this 
funding be consistently provided on an advance appropriations basis to 
promote greater stability in services, medical personnel recruitment 
and retention, and facilities management. Indian health should not be 
subject to the uncertainties of the annual budgeting process with its 
risk of continuing resolutions and government shutdowns. Critically, 
advance appropriations would align Federal funding with trust and 
treaty obligations. It would also provide the IHS long overdue parity 
with the Veterans Health Administration.

    7. Mandatory Funding for Contract Support Costs (CSC) and Section 
105(l) Lease Payments. We appreciate this subcommittee's commitment to 
ensuring that CSC and Section 105(l) lease costs are fully funded by 
including an indefinite discretionary appropriation in past years. We 
ask that Congress build on this important work in FY 2024 by 
designating these accounts as mandatory funding. CSC and Section 105(l) 
lease funds are already an entitlement under the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act. Changing the appropriation 
of these accounts from discretionary to mandatory would bring Federal 
funding into line with the clear legal requirements of the authorizing 
statute.

    8. $250 Million with Self-Governance Funding Mechanism Option for 
the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI). Indian Country has 
seen dramatic improvements in the prevention and treatment of diabetes 
and diabetes-related conditions under SDPI. Yet, the program has been 
flat funded at $150 million since FY 2004. For program stability and 
expansion, we seek an increase in mandatory funding to $250 million 
with automatic annual adjustments for medical inflation. We also ask 
that Congress authorize the use of either a grant (as currently used) 
or Public Law 93-638 funding mechanisms for SDPI participants 
consistent with our Tribal sovereignty.

    9. Increase Funding for Preventive Health Services. Acoma's 
experience with the Acoma-Canon cito-Laguna Hospital crisis and the 
vulnerabilities in the Indian health system revealed by the pandemic 
has taught us the critical value of preventive health. Such services 
are a cost-effective use of resources the reduce future incidence rates 
of chronic illness, acute conditions, and associated medical costs. We 
urge an increase in funding for IHS Preventive Health Services as an 
investment in future Indian health.

III. Construct Safe Tribal Communities and Infrastructure

    10. Support Funding for Indian Water Rights Settlements. The Pueblo 
of Acoma, along with other parties, has negotiated a water rights 
settlement with the United States and the State of New Mexico (Rio San 
Jose Water Settlement) that has just been introduced in the House and 
Senate. We ask that the Congress support full funding for Indian water 
rights and would like to note that the President's FY 2024 budget 
proposal includes funding to ``build on investments provided in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $2.8 billion in 
mandatory funding to the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion 
Fund, with $2.5 billion to cover the costs of enacted and future water 
rights settlements and $340 million for operations and maintenance 
costs associated with enacted water settlements.''

    11. Not Less Than $90 Million for the BIA Road Maintenance Program. 
Funding for the BIA Road Maintenance program has been chronically below 
the level of demonstrated need. In FY 2021, the BIA received only 
$36.79 million to address a nationwide deferred maintenance backlog of 
almost $300 million-an equivalent to only 12% of documented need. It 
costs our Pueblo alone over $650,000 to maintain the 363.8 miles 
included on the BIA road inventory within our exterior boundaries (a 
further 298.2 miles are not on the inventory). We receive insufficient 
funding to cover these costs and are, thus, forced to use our limited 
Tribal funds to maintain Federal roads. Congress must start to 
alleviate this heavy financial burden by providing not less than $90 
million for BIA Roads Maintenance in FY 2024.

    12. $59 Million for Community Economic Development Projects. We 
seek $59 million in targeted funding to support the development of 
shovel-ready community economic projects that would greatly benefit our 
Tribe and our citizens. Specifically, these are (1) full reconstruction 
of the fifty-year old Haaku Road that has structural failures 
throughout its length, contributing directly to dozens of vehicle 
crashes over the years ($25 million request), and (2) development of 
the Acoma Business Park corridor that is planned to include a business 
incubator, retail and service enterprises, post office, and new housing 
to create jobs and generate revenue ($34 million request).

    13. $40 Million for Mesa Hill Bridge Project under BIA Tribal 
Transportation Account. Acoma is bisected by a major transcontinental 
railway that is level with the existing roadway with minimal safety 
features. The flat terrain, lack of a fixed schedule for freight 
trains, and misjudgments on train speed and distance pose a significant 
public safety risk to motorists and pedestrians. Distressingly, there 
is no way to avoid the danger. Our healthcare and businesses are 
located on the north side of the tracks, while our community service 
facilities-such as Head Start, residential areas, and government 
buildings-are in the south. Our people must face the daily challenge of 
traversing the tracks to bring their children to school or attend 
medical appointments without the safety of an elevated crossing. 
Despite the clear threat to public safety posed by this situation, we 
have faced repeated barriers in accessing the necessary funds to 
construct the Mesa Hill Bridge. We urge Congress to provide $40 million 
in targeted funding under the BIA Tribal Transportation Program to 
construct the Mesa Hill Bridge at Acoma Pueblo.

    14. Increase BIA Irrigation Infrastructure Funding. Congress 
enacted the Pueblo Irrigation Infrastructure Act as Section 9106 of the 
Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. This Act directs the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the irrigation 
infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos, including Acoma. It also 
authorizes funding to address deficiencies identified by that study. 
The implementation of this act will favorably impact Pueblo traditional 
lifestyle and culture, which has been based on agriculture and 
irrigated lands for hundreds of years. We urge Congress to increase 
support for BIA irrigation projects on all New Mexico Pueblos in FY 
2024.

    15. Establish Regional BIE Tele-Education Learning Centers. 
Broadband is an essential service rapidly changing the educational 
landscape in rural communities. Acoma, however, continues to face 
significant challenges in this area stemming, in part, from a woefully 
inadequate municipal infrastructure and limited economic and 
educational resources. Rural education does not and should not mean 
limited opportunities for growth and development. We seek to expand 
Acoma's horizons by connecting Pueblo members with previously unheard-
of access to local teleeducational resources. We ask for targeted 
funding for regional BIE tele-education learning facilities with an 
initial allocation of $15 million to establish the account.

IV. Protect Wildlife and Natural Resources

    16. Not Less Than $8 Million for the BIA Endangered Species 
Program. The effective management and conservation of our natural 
resources is not limited to the waters, soil, and trees that form the 
rich landscape of Pueblo Country. We must also account and 
appropriately care for the diversity of wildlife that is meaningful to 
our culture and essential to maintaining our ecosystems' equilibrium. 
The BIA Endangered Species Program provides Tribal nations with the 
technical assistance and financial resources to protect endangered 
species on Tribal lands through natural resources restoration and 
management, as well as economic development. We recommend Congress 
provide at least $8 million for the BIA Endangered Species Program.

    17. $42 Million for the Tribal Climate Resilience Program and 
Adequately Fund Cooperative Landscape Conservation Programs. Across 
America, communities are facing mounting challenges related to our 
progressively unstable natural environment. Invasive species, 
disappearing tree lines, and accelerated rates of erosion are also 
taking an increasing toll on our agricultural and natural resources. 
These two Interior programs equip Tribal nations with the tools to 
manage resource stressors, develop adaptive management plans, and 
engage in intergovernmental coordination. We request Congress 
appropriate $42 million for the BIA Tribal Climate Resilience Program 
and restore adequate funding for Department-wide Cooperative Landscape 
Conservation programs.

    Introduction. Thank you, Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, 
and subcommittee Members for the opportunity to share our funding 
priorities for the FY 2024 Federal budget. My name is J. Michael 
Chavarria and I am the Governor of the Pueblo of Santa Clara in New 
Mexico. I offer the following recommendations for your consideration 
for FY 2024 and urge the Committee to remember that increases must be 
significantly greater than the rate of inflation for these programs to 
even tread water, when they need to be expanded.
    Provide Full and Advance Appropriations for the Indian Health 
System. The Indian health system faces annually compounding challenges 
related to supplies, staffing levels, infrastructure and facilities, 
and high rates of negative health outcomes among AI/ANs as a result of 
the chronic failure to fully fund trust and treaty obligations in 
Indian health. Until this year, IHS was funded on an annual, 
discretionary basis, but at least for the next year it has been 
provided with advance appropriations. Santa Clara urges the Committee 
to support making advance appropriations permanent on at least a 2-year 
cycle, and to support a multi-billion dollar increase to achieve full 
funding in FY 2024.
    $250 Million with a Self-Governance Funding Mechanism Option for 
the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI). For program stability 
and expansion, we advocate for an increase in mandatory funding to $250 
million with automatic annual adjustments for medical inflation. We 
also ask that Congress authorize the use of either a grant (as 
currently used) or Public Law 93-638 funding mechanisms for SDPI 
participants consistent with Tribal sovereignty.
    Maintain the Funding Moratorium Related to Energy Leasing in the 
Greater Chaco Region. We request that Congress maintain the moratorium 
on oil and gas leasing on Federal land in the withdrawal area of the 
Greater Chaco Region. We request this moratorium span the lifetime of 
the legislation rather than becoming ineffective upon completion of the 
ongoing Tribally-led cultural resource studies. However, if a temporal 
limit must be included, we ask the moratorium stay in place until 
completion of the studies as well as the Resource Management Plan 
Amendment.
    $20 Million to Support the Vital Work of Tribal Historic 
Preservation Offices (THPOs). The preservation of Tribal sacred and 
cultural sites is a priority for all Indian Country. Damage of these 
sites is often irreversible. More Tribes are establishing THPOs under 
the National Historic Preservation Act to protect this heritage. Our 
expert officers identify sites and coordinate with appropriate 
officials and third parties on their protection, as well as support the 
work of museum and research centers that house Tribal material culture 
and repatriated items. We request $20 million for THPO support in FY 
2024.
    $1.5 Million for Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act (NAGPRA) Enforcement. The provision of dedicated NAGPRA enforcement 
funding has contributed directly to the development of a more 
culturally competent understanding of the importance of Tribal 
patrimony to Native peoples for improved law enforcement activities. We 
ask that this funding be maintained in FY 2024 and beyond.
    $1 Million for Funding Implementation of the Safeguard Tribal 
Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act. This law, passed in the last Congress, 
will assure the protection of many sensitive Tribal items from illegal 
export. It is important to put in place the necessary resources in the 
Federal Government to enable this law to be implemented. We request 
that at least $1 million be allocated for FY 2024 for the purposes of 
implementation and enforcement of this law.
    $300 Million for BIA Criminal Investigations and Police Services. 
Tribal law enforcement and emergency services personnel strive to 
provide high-quality and responsive public safety services. They must 
often do this notwithstanding the effects of serious understaffing and 
insufficient resources. We urge a minimum of $300 million for BIA 
Criminal Investigations and Police Services to effectively serve and 
protect our community, including additional resources for officer 
equipment, training, and innovation.
    $50 Million for Tribal Courts on a Permanent Ongoing Basis. Our 
Tribal Court requires additional resources to continue functioning 
efficiently and to address challenges related to resources, facilities, 
and court administration. To strengthen our court system, we encourage 
the subcommittee to maintain its commitment to public safety and 
justice on Tribal lands and ask for at least $50 million for Tribal 
Courts (TPA).
    Increased Detention Services Funding and $620,000 for Juvenile 
Detention Center Education. Public safety facilities and housing 
construction programs have been critically needed for many years. In 
the southwest the situation is particularly acute owing to the lack of 
any integrated substance abuse behavioral modification detention 
program since the closure of the Turning Point Program in Yuma, 
Arizona, in 2017. We need culturally-responsive detention services to 
improve recidivism rates and support long-term rehabilitation. We 
request increased funding for BIA detention services and at least 
$620,000 for juvenile detention center education.
    Increase Funding for BIA Disaster Recovery and Prevention Programs. 
The stewardship of natural resources is key to both the economic and 
cultural well-being of Pueblo people, particularly in this era of 
increasing climate uncertainty. Santa Clara has been devastated by 
three catastrophic wildfires with the threat of new fires and floods 
always on the horizon. We have invested heavily in the development of 
fire preparedness and suppression resources to protect life and 
property. We understand the fundamental importance of beneficial 
partnerships with the BIA and other agencies in this effort. Because of 
this work, we are proud to say that Santa Clara is home to award-
winning Tribal forestry and land management departments. Expanding 
access to BIA disaster programs and deepening the resources available 
is critical. We ask for an increase across all these line items.
    $15 Million to Establish a BIA Emergency Response Fund. Many Tribal 
governments are hindered by the upfront investment costs and cost-
sharing requirements of certain Federal emergency response programs. 
When coupled with bureaucratic delays in distributing funds, it often 
takes an unacceptable amount of time to receive disaster relief 
precisely when time is of the essence. We anticipate the need for these 
resources will only continue to grow and with quick access to funding 
becoming a top response need. We recommend an initial amount of $15 
million be allocated to establish a BIA Emergency Response Fund within 
the Office of Trust Services.
    $42 Million for the Tribal Climate Resilience Program and Restore 
Cooperative Landscape Conservation Programs. Across America, 
communities are facing mounting challenges related to our progressively 
unstable natural environment. Invasive species, disappearing tree 
lines, and accelerated rates of erosion are also taking an increasing 
toll on our agricultural and natural resources. These two Interior 
programs equip Tribes with the tools to manage resource stressors, 
develop adaptive management plans, and engage in intergovernmental 
coordination. We request Congress appropriate $42 million for the BIA 
Tribal Climate Resilience Program and restore adequate funding for 
Department-wide Cooperative Landscape Conservation programs.
    $100 Million Minimum for the EPA Indian General Assistance Program. 
EPA resources enable our Pueblo to establish and maintain technical 
ability to support an array of projects that protect human health and 
the environment for our people and safeguard the natural resources that 
provide us with physical and spiritual sustenance. Without these funds, 
we would face tremendous hurdles in developing and maintaining 
environmental programs such as water quality monitoring and hazardous 
waste management. EPA Tribal GAP is an essential program assisting 
Tribes in developing the internal capacity to manage their own 
environmental protection programs. We request Congress provide at least 
$100 million for EPA Tribal GAP funding to advance sustainable 
environmental protection measures in Indian Country.
    $15 Million in Priority Funding for Tribal Forest Protection Act 
(TFPA) Implementation. The TFPA (Pub. L. 108-278) authorizes the 
Interior Secretary to give special consideration to Tribally proposed 
Stewardship Contracting or other projects on Forest Service or BLM land 
bordering or adjacent to Tribal lands to protect trust and Federal 
resources from fire, disease, and other threats. This is a smart 
policy. Stewardship agreements are an important tool for fighting the 
ever-growing threat of wildfires that have devastated the west in 
recent years. TFPA was authorized, however, without a designated 
funding mechanism. As a result, efforts to the implement its beneficial 
provisions have been impeded. We request report language encouraging 
agencies to prioritize TFPA implementation to the greatest extent 
possible with at least $15 million in dedicated funding.
    Increase Funding for BIE Tribal Education Department (TED) and 
Sovereignty in Education Grants. These funds support the development of 
TEDs to improve educational outcomes for students and efficiencies and 
effectiveness in the operation of BIE-funded schools. The goal of the 
grants is to promote Tribal educational capacity building, which it has 
achieved in our community through our Department of Youth and Learning 
and Pueblo-operated Kha'p'o Community School. To strengthen the 
exercise of sovereignty in Tribal education additional funding is 
needed for these grants, particularly as the TED line item has been 
flat funded for several appropriations cycles.
    $200 Million for BIE Facilities Operations and $900 Million for BIE 
Facilities Maintenance and Construction. To flourish academically and 
personally, we must provide our children with safe and vibrant 
classrooms and engaging areas to play, as well as with after-hours 
wraparound services, but too many Tribal school facilities are in 
various States of disrepair. The backlog of unmet needs for these 
accounts has grown exponentially with Interior leadership testifying in 
July 2019 to a total identified deferred need of $725 million, but 
increased costs since then justify $900 million. We urge full funding 
of this unmet need for BIE Facilities Maintenance and for Operations.
    $600 Million for the Indian School Equalization Program (ISEP). 
These funds provide the core budget account for BIE-funded schools by 
covering teacher salaries, aides, principals, and other personnel. ISEP 
funds are often reallocated to cover the program cuts in other areas of 
education. ISEP must have adequate funding to ensure all program needs 
are fulfilled and must not be reduced to provide funds for new 
initiatives that have not been vetted by Tribes. We strongly support an 
influx of investment in the ISEP in FY 2024 to at least $475 million.
    Report Language to Encourage Waiver of Cost Match Requirements. 
There are many Federal programs that require a Tribal cost match, 
frequently in an amount that is beyond the means of many Tribes, 
resulting in Tribes not being able to take advantage of a particular 
program or source of funding. Santa Clara urges the Committee to 
include report language that encourages Federal agencies to provide the 
maximum waiver possible for cost matches applicable to Tribes and 
Pueblos.
    Implementation of the Rio Grande Pueblos Irrigation Infrastructure 
Act. In 2009, the United States Congress passed the Omnibus and Public 
Lands Act authorizing planning and implementation of improvements to 
irrigation infrastructure for the 18 Pueblos in the Rio Grande Valley 
in New Mexico. In February 2022, an amended report was released setting 
forth many of the needed improvements. Santa Clara urges this committee 
to fund these identified improvement needs.

            Prepared Statement of Ramah Navajo School Board
    Honorable Chair, Ranking and subcommittee Members, Ya'at'eeh. My 
name is Martha Garcia, President of the Ramah Navajo School Board, Inc. 
Board of Trustees, joined by Ms. Carolyn Coho, Board member, and Mr. 
David Nez, Pine Hill School Superintendent. On behalf of the Ramah 
Navajo people, we are grateful to all the members of the U.S. House and 
Senate Appropriations subcommittees on Interior, Environment and 
Related Agencies for the opportunity to share our testimony. We are 
here today to respectfully inform you of our most pressing priorities 
for funding, all of which address our current challenges and are 
essential for continuing the vital programs and services that will move 
our community forward. These priorities are:

  --Increased Funds for Our Community Services (BIA, BIE)

    --BIA Human Services (Social Services, Welfare Assistance, Housing 
            Program);

    --BIA Community and Economic Development (Job Placement and 
            Training);

    --BIA Tribal Government (Aid to Tribal Government);

    --BIE Elementary and Secondary Programs (Johnson-O'Malley 
            Assistance Grants); and

    --BIE Post Secondary Programs (Scholarships & Adult Education)

  --Increased Funds for Our School Operations (BIE)

    --BIE Elementary and Secondary Programs Forward Funded (ISEP 
            Formula Funds, Student Transportation); and

    --BIE Elementary and Secondary Programs (Facilities Operations & 
            Maintenance)

  --Increased Funds for Our Health Services (IHS)

    --IHS Services (Hospitals & Health Clinics, Dental Health, Mental 
            Health)

  --Funds for RNSB Infrastructure Upgrades and New Energy Efficient 
        Buildings

  --Funds for Ramah Trading Post Renovation
         increased funds for our community services (bia, bie)
    Funding to support the community programs in our two Master 
Contracts is based on annual Congressional appropriations for key sub-
activities in the BIA budget (Social Services, Welfare Assistance, 
Housing Program, Job Placement and Training, Aid to Tribal Government) 
and the BIE budget (Johnson-O'Malley Assistance Grants, Scholarships & 
Adult Education). Over the years, there have been no substantive 
increases in these contracts for RNSB. We respectfully request a 
significant increase in these budget sub-activities so that we can 
fully develop the programs and services that will help our community 
thrive. Because the annual funding for these mature contracts has 
remained static and largely unchanged since the days of Federal 
sequestration several Administrations ago, staff salaries have remained 
frozen and program costs have not been aligned with the increases that 
have occurred in inflation and the cost of living.
            increased funds for our school operations (bie)
    Our core BIE account, ISEP Formula Funds, supports our school's 
operations. ISEP funding increases are vital to enhancing learning 
opportunities for all of our students through the training, development 
and retention of excellent teachers. Schools across the Nation are 
facing a significant teacher shortage and that shortage is particularly 
acute in more remote communities like ours on the Navajo Nation. New 
Mexico has responded to this nationwide teacher shortage by 
significantly increasing teacher pay. RNSB does not have the budget to 
compete with the salaries offered by the public schools in New Mexico. 
In order to effectively address this problem, we need increases in ISEP 
funds, paired with Full Funding for Teacher and Counselor Pay Parity, 
and opportunities to expand the benefits package that we offer our 
teachers and staff, including the opportunity to participate in the 
Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS). RNSB is also greatly 
concerned by the increased costs for student transportation and the 
deteriorating conditions of the roads serving our community. RNSB has 
been troubled by the BIE's outdated and incomplete student 
transportation funding formula, which currently underestimates Student 
Transportation needs. Most BIE-funded grant schools on the Navajo 
Nation exhaust their student transportation allocation by February of 
each school year. Additionally, full funding and forward funding for 
Facilities Operations & Facilities Maintenance (O&M) are urgently 
needed to cover the actual costs of repairing and maintaining all our 
buildings and facilities. Our current O&M funds only take care of 51% 
of the costs of operating and maintaining our buildings. In addition, 
that 51% of O&M costs must also include all the utilities costs. So, in 
the end, once the utilities are paid for, only 30 cents of every dollar 
needed to keep our buildings functioning properly is left. Further 
complicating matters, the Facilities Operations & Facilities 
Maintenance sub-activities are not forward funded, while most of the 
other accounts we need to operate our school are. This means that, if 
there are government shutdowns or continuing resolutions, we sometimes 
do not receive our limited O&M funds until the end of the school year!
             increased funds for our health services (ihs)
    The Pine Hill Health Center serves three counties in New Mexico and 
one county in Arizona: Cibola, McKinley, Catron, and Apache. Services 
are provided to the 19,023 residents of the four counties from the IHS 
Hospitals & Health Clinics budget activity. The Pine Hill Health Center 
has 6,462 active charts--5,252 are Native Americans and 1,210 are non-
Native Americans. But our current funding, which is for 2,619 Native 
Americans, is wholly inadequate. With sufficient funding, the Pine Hill 
Health Center could provide services to 10,000 Native Americans and 
others, resulting in savings to the Federal Government. This high 
quality care is projected to cost $5,000 per capita, annually. Our 
Behavioral Health program, funded by the IHS Mental Health budget 
activity needs to double its staff to accommodate a care team panel 
size of 2,626 clients. Nationwide, 50% of all healthcare patients have 
mental health issues, and we only have one care team available. In 
addition, our dental program, funded by the IHS Dental Health budget 
activity, currently has only one dentist on staff and a panel size of 
1,600 patients. We need four dentists to accommodate 5,252 patients, 
and the funds to recruit and hire them.
    funds for rnsb infrastructure upgrades and new energy efficient 
                               buildings
    In order to provide quality services and programs, we must have 
high quality, modern infrastructure in place to support what we do. We 
need good roads, as well as upgraded and expanded water and wastewater 
systems, electrical lines, utilities lines and access to broadband. We 
also need new buildings for our programs. Most of RNSB infrastructure 
was built in the 1970s and early 1980s. Through natural wear and tear 
and despite having done due diligence in operations and maintenance, 
much of our infrastructure is in dire need of repair or replacement. 
The Federal funds we receive are primarily for providing direct 
services to the community and not for infrastructure repairs and 
replacement.
    Thanks to recent infusions of Federal infrastructure and safety 
funding--some of which was from the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan 
Act (ARPA), we have successfully upgraded our dilapidated and dangerous 
high-voltage electrical system at Pine Hill. Additionally, we are in 
the planning phase with the BIA Division of Facilities Management and 
Construction for a new gymnasium and the renovation of our school 
buildings. While it has been both challenging and rewarding to be able 
to modernize some of our critical infrastructure with recent funding, 
much more needs to be done, which is described below.
    energy transition  strategic planning for rnsb and ramah navajo 
                               community
    Energy costs continue to climb higher and higher for our old 
buildings and much of the infrastructure in these buildings, such as 
the HVAC systems, are inefficient or are no longer repairable. Looking 
towards the necessity of living in a changing climate and world, we 
want our buildings and work spaces to be safe and healthy, as well as 
climate-resilient and self-reliant. With designs that incorporate into 
these buildings our Dine teachings and Indigenous knowledge and 
technologies, we will be contributing to addressing the issues of 
climate change, such as the extreme weather and drought conditions that 
we face today, in a forward-looking manner. Key to this would be the 
development of a comprehensive strategic plan for energy transition as 
a first step. Such a plan would serve as a blueprint, outlining the 
goals for energy use, transition and resilience; completing energy 
audits at RNSB and in-community for all sectors of energy use (i.e., 
RNSB and community facilities, water/wastewater, residential housing, 
transportation, communications, safety, etc.); exploring the 
feasibility of retrofitting current RNSB and community facilities and 
energy usage sectors for energy production and efficiency, as well as 
opportunities for designing and creating new, sustainable and resilient 
energy-efficient systems (e.g., solar electricity, heat pumps, micro-
grids) for RNSB facilities and in-community, thereby reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and the overall costs of energy usage over 
time while increasing local energy sovereignty and resilience; and 
determining priorities for on-the-ground energy transition projects, 
their financing and timeframe. In order to initiate and complete this 
energy transition strategic plan, RNSB will need additional funding to 
hire experienced and highly qualified staff and consultants to assist 
in this critically important undertaking. We need Congress to consider 
these systemic challenges and opportunities that we face and to 
appropriate funding accordingly.
     new energy efficient rnsb facilities needed  plan design build
    A number of our federally funded programs at RNSB, such as 
administrative services, finance, social services, adult/continuing 
education and RNSB archives, are housed in temporary portable BIA 
buildings that date back almost a half century. Other programs, like 
KTDB community radio station, are in facilities that have been damaged 
by moisture and mold, which have compromised the integrity of the space 
as well as the health of our staff, or have outgrown their space, such 
as the Pine Hill Health Center and Behavioral Health program. All of 
these buildings are now beyond routine maintenance and repair and are 
in desperate need of replacement with permanent facilities. These new 
facilities are envisioned to be 21st century work spaces, equipped with 
state-of-the-art energy-efficient and water conservation systems, while 
integrating design elements that reflect Ramah Navajo history, culture 
and lifeways. Ensuring that our staff have culturally-sensitive, safe, 
healthy and inviting work environments that are also accessible to the 
public will require additional funding to begin the process of 
planning--designing--building these urgently needed new, permanent 
facilities. Unfortunately, there appears to be no budget line item to 
fund the replacement of the very buildings that we use to operate and 
carry out these vital, federally-funded programs. We need Congress to 
change this.
                funds for ramah trading post renovation
    The Ramah Trading Post served as an economic and social hub for 
Ramah Navajo families up until the 1980s. Not only does the trading 
post mark a particular historical and economic period for the Ramah 
Navajo people, its greatest significance comes from its location on 
Ramah Navajo ancestral lands, not far from the original ancestral home 
of our people in the Zuni Mountains. Funds are needed to plan for the 
usage and restoration of this historic trading post and the adjacent 
structures and land surrounding it (7 acres). And, once given a new 
Indigenous life, it is envisioned that the Ramah Trading Post will be 
more than just a place of memories and stories, but a place where the 
rich and complex history of the Ramah Navajo people resonates--a 
history that underscores our enduring strength and resilience through 
periods of encroachment, terror and imprisonment during the Long Walk, 
settler colonialism and the return to self-determination-a place that 
will evolve to serve our people and the global community in new and 
vibrant ways into the future.
    In closing, we appreciate your kind consideration and support of 
these priorities and look forward to working closely with you and your 
staff to address these priorities. Ahehee'  thank you!

              Prepared Statement of the Recording Academy
    As the only trade association in Washington representing all music 
creators--songwriters, performers, and studio professionals-the 
Recording Academy is pleased to offer testimony to the Senate Committee 
on Appropriations subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies in support of a continued increased funding for the National 
Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in Fiscal Year 2024 of no less than the 
$211 million. The Recording Academy is proud to support the NEA and its 
initiatives to enrich American music and culture.
    The NEA brings music and the arts to communities across the 
country, and its mission has never been more important. The agency is 
an indispensable part of the Nation's $867 billion creative economy and 
is well-positioned to invest in local arts sectors in all 50 States. As 
such, the Recording Academy supports increasing funding of the NEA for 
the coming fiscal year.
    Through supporting music and the arts, the NEA empowers local 
communities, improves student development, and advances cultural 
achievements. Considering that NEA grants yield more than $500 million 
in matching support-leveraging outside funds at a ratio of 9:1-it is 
financially one of the smartest investments the government can commit 
to. In the music industry, the NEA supports more than $50 million in 
music related direct grants each year-bringing music, and matching 
investments, to your States. From Eugene Concert Choir in Oregon 
($10,000, in 2023) to the Juneau Jazz & Classics in Alaska ($10,000, 
2023); and from Seattle Pro Musica in Washington ($15,000, 2023) to the 
Bowdoin International Music Festival in Maine ($10,000 in 2023), the 
NEA has proven to support and foster local music communities and 
opportunities.
    The Recording Academy applauds Congress's bipartisan and bicameral 
willingness to support the NEA during recent appropriations processes, 
but the Agency remains in need of additional funding in order to fulfil 
its mission of expanding access to and participation in the arts. 
Robust funding for the NEA will ensure the agency can provide grants 
across all 50 States, while promoting more equitable access and 
reaching more diverse audiences.
    As you finalize appropriations for FY24, please make a strong 
commitment to the arts and music with robust funding for the NEA.

Prepared Statement of Self-Governance Communication & Education Tribal 
                               Consortium
    On behalf of SGCETC, I am submitting this written statement 
regarding funding priorities for the FY 2024 budgets for the 
Departments of the Interior's (DOI) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), 
Health and Human Services' (HHS) Indian Health Service (IHS) and 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    The fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to Tribal 
Nations arise from commitments made in treaties and agreements, in 
exchange for which Indians relinquished vast tracks of homelands and 
resources.\1\ More than 380 Tribal Nations have entered into Self-
Governance agreements with the DOI and/or IHS to transfer Federal 
resources and programs from Federal to Tribal administration to better 
serve the needs of their citizens and communities. Tribal Nations that 
elect to administer Federal programs through Self-Governance agreements 
know that increased Tribal control and decision-making authority 
results in improved social and economic well-being at the local level.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Pub. L. No. 114-178, Sec. 101, 130 Stat. 432 (2016) (codified 
at 25 USC Sec. 5601).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Tribal Nations assuming administration over programs once 
administered by Federal agencies, do so knowing that this does not 
abrogate the Federal Government's treaty and trust obligations. It 
empowers Tribal governments as sovereign nations to best determine the 
needs of their citizens and communities while bolstering Tribal 
economies and job creation for Indian country and surrounding non-
Native communities. As such, we offer the following recommendations:
  increase base budgets and recurring funding for indian programs and 
                    reduce reliance on grant funding
    Across the board, Federal Indian programs are significantly 
underfunded. The lack of adequate funding puts the lives of Tribal 
citizens at risk and limits the services provided by Tribal 
governments. Increases in base budgets for Indian programs will allow 
Tribes to fund core Tribal government programs and will provide an 
opportunity for additional Tribal Nations to participate in Self-
Governance.
    SGCETC supports the growing sentiment expressed by Tribal Nations 
that we do not want our funding sources to be increasingly supplemented 
by grants. Short-term competitive grants hinder Self-Governance because 
it creates uncertainty in planning, imposes extensive regulations and 
reporting requirements, and restricts the use of indirect costs. Tribal 
Nations are not non-profit organizations and should not be treated as 
such. The signers of the over 400 treaties between Tribal Nations and 
the United States did not sign with the intent of being dependent on 
grants. Lives were not lost, nor land ceded for our needs to be 
dependent on the review of a grant application package.
         reclassify section 105(l) costs as mandatory spending
    Pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act (ISDEAA), most Tribal Nations now administer programs that were 
previously administered by the Federal Government, which results in the 
need for Tribal facilities to house these programs. Section 105(l) of 
the ISDEAA, 25 USC Sec. 5324(l), provides that the Secretaries of DOI 
and HHS must enter into leases with an Indian Tribe or Tribal 
organization for the administration and delivery of services under the 
ISDEAA. Section 105(l) requires both Secretaries to compensate each 
Indian Tribe or Tribal organization for infrastructure costs, including 
rent, depreciation, operation and maintenance, and other reasonable 
expenses. Tribal Nations across the country are successfully entering 
into Section 105(l) agreements with both DOI and HHS to be compensated 
for the use of Tribal facilities that are needed to fulfill Federal 
responsibilities.
    Tribal Nations commend Congress in recognizing the Federal 
Government's obligation to fully fund 105(l) leases. The next step in 
fostering this progress is by reclassifying Section 105(l) lease 
funding from discretionary to mandatory spending.
     reclassify contract support costs (csc) as mandatory spending
    ISDEAA obligates the Federal Government to provide Tribal Nations 
with the necessary funding to ensure that a Tribal Nation has the 
resources to contract or compact Federal programs. In 2005 and 2012, 
the Supreme Court confirmed that the ISDEAA requires full payment of 
CSC to each contractor even when Congress caps CSC appropriations at a 
level insufficient to fully pay all contractors.\2\ Despite the 
progress realized, Congress still funds CSC as an indefinite 
discretionary appropriation which creates an environment of competition 
with other programs funded in the agencies' discretionary budget. 
Additional progress cannot be achieved, in this matter, until CSC is 
not required to compete against funding for Indian programs. The way to 
remove this element of competition is to appropriate CSC on a mandatory 
basis.

v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 US 182 (2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        advance appropriations for tribal programs and services
    We are grateful that Congress enacted Advanced Appropriations for 
the Indian Health Service for FY2024; however, we now urge Congress to 
extend advanced appropriations to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the 
Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). Providing appropriations 1 year in 
advance for the BIA and BIE will mitigate the adverse financial effects 
of Federal budgetary uncertainties and allow Tribal Nations to engage 
in more effective strategic planning, spend funds more efficiently, 
grow our Tribal economies and businesses and increase the quality of 
care and well-being of our Tribal citizens and communities.
    support the expansion of tribal self-governance authority in epa
    Tribal Nations have proven their ability and effectiveness 
administering Federal programs that provide services to their citizens 
and communities. Now is the time to support expansion of this 
successful approach for the delivery of Federal programs, services, 
functions, activities, and resources to Tribal communities beyond just 
the DOI, HHS, and Department of Transportation. We request that the 
Committee includes funding for a Tribal-Federal workgroup on the 
feasibility of expanding Self-Governance to EPA and how such authority 
would be implemented, possibly as demonstration projects.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share our recommendations with the 
subcommittee.

       Prepared Statement of the Society for American Archaeology
    The Society for American Archaeology (SAA) once again appreciates 
this opportunity to present its recommendations for fiscal year 2024 
cultural resources program appropriations for the Department of the 
Interior. I am Dr. Daniel H. Sandweiss, president of the SAA.
    The SAA is an international organization that, since its founding 
in 1934, has been dedicated to research about and interpretation and 
protection of the archaeological heritage of the Americas. With more 
than 5,500 members, the SAA represents professional and avocational 
archaeologists, archaeology students in colleges and universities, and 
archaeologists working at Tribal agencies, museums, government 
agencies, and the private sector. The SAA has members throughout the 
United States, as well as in many nations around the world.
    The members of the SAA thank the subcommittee for supporting an 
increase in funding for Federal and federally funded historic and 
cultural preservation programs in FY 2023. These programs, created 
under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other preservation statutes and 
funded through annual appropriations, constitute the foundation of 
these activities in the United States. These activities comprise the 
principal means of preserving and protecting our Nation's irreplaceable 
historic, archaeological, and cultural treasures. In addition to 
ensuring that all Americans can learn about and enjoy the artifacts and 
knowledge of America's history, funding Federal archaeology programs 
facilitates economic growth and infrastructure project delivery.
    Given the above, our testimony for FY 2024 appropriations continues 
to emphasize the message that we have expounded on for the past 3 
years-protecting our irreplaceable historic and cultural legacy 
requires the necessary staffing and resources, especially for State 
Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO) and Tribal Historic Preservation 
Offices (THPO), and in Federal archaeologist staff levels. Some 
progress was made during FY 2023, but to maintain the momentum, we urge 
increased allocations for FY 2024.
  department of the interior-increase archaeologist staff: $10 million
    Federal archaeologists perform a huge number of important tasks. 
Recent fiscal years saw an increase in the number of Federal 
archaeologists. In FY 2020, there were 1,371 archaeologists government-
wide. Federal archaeologists increased by 37 in FY 2021, and by 70 in 
FY 2022, for a total of 1,478 (1,377 were permanent Federal employees, 
and 101 were term or seasonal appointments). Of that number, 572 
currently work in the Department of the Interior. This represents some 
progress in the government's ability to meet the increase of projects 
authorized under recent legislation including the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Great 
American Outdoors Act. Nevertheless, the scale of the work is immense. 
The following table shows the number of acres overseen by the top land-
managing agencies and the number of archaeologists each agency employs 
to carry out reviews under Section 106 of the NHPA for federally funded 
projects, projects requiring a Federal permit, or projects on Federal 
lands; conducting surveys for historic and cultural resources under 
Section 110 of the NHPA; protection of archaeological sites and 
materials and investigating instances of looting of sites under the 
Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA); preservation and 
repatriation of highly sensitive cultural and spiritual Tribal objects 
under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act 
(NAGPRA); consultation with Indigenous and descendant communities on 
the effects of Federal actions on their cultural resources; addressing 
cultural resources in NEPA documents; development of contracts and 
cooperative agreements between Federal agencies and private firms or 
universities; technical assistance on archaeological matters; 
coordination and management of volunteers helping to preserve cultural 
sites; and curation of Federal archaeological collections.

*Domestic acreage only

    If the Section 106 process is to function effectively, and 
federally sponsored undertakings are to be delivered in a timely 
manner, the NPS, BLM, other DOI agencies need still more archaeologists 
to satisfy the statutorily required and program responsibilities.
  national park service-national recreation and preservation cultural 
                        programs: $44.1 million
    The overwhelming majority of our Nation's parks contain historical 
and cultural sites, including sacred lands of deep meaning and critical 
importance to Indigenous Americans and places that tell the story of 
America's history and development. NPS National Recreation and 
Preservation Cultural Programs provide vital technical assistance and 
other support for resource protection within National Parks and for 
other Federal agencies. The archaeological component identifies, 
documents, and inventories archaeological resources in parks; produces 
archaeological technical and programmatic publications; implements 
regulations for protecting archaeological resources; and assists other 
agencies through program development and training. The SAA greatly 
appreciates the $39.3 million allocation in the final FY 2023 bill and 
supports the administration's request for $44.1 million for FY 2024. $3 
million of the requested increase for FY 2024 should go to fund the new 
African American Burial Ground Network program. Other priorities that 
the subcommittee should support include:

  --Establishing baseline data-baseline information about 
        archaeological sites (their types, locations, and condition) is 
        vital for meeting resource management objectives and in 
        complying with statutes that protect our Nation's cultural 
        heritage. Accurate baseline data expedites NHPA Section 106 
        compliance in particular, especially related to infrastructure. 
        Some NPS units still have inadequate baseline inventory data.

  --Digital data management-the NPS manages over 80,000 archaeological 
        sites. There is a ``Cultural Resources Inventory System'' 
        (CRIS) that contains information about archaeological sites, 
        cultural landscapes, historic structures, and ethnographic 
        resources. Many fields within the database remain unpopulated, 
        however, and more information is needed that would aid park 
        planning efforts, make data accessible during emergencies, and 
        support geospatial modeling to facilitate identification of 
        resources most vulnerable to climate change or looting. 
        Improving the CRIS database would greatly improve access to 
        data about archaeological sites and improve planning and 
        management.

  --Digitizing the permitting process-the NPS is exploring the 
        feasibility of creating a web-based process for ARPA and 
        Antiquities Act permitting, which would reduce review workloads 
        and approval time frames for program staff. A more efficient 
        process is now critical, as more infrastructure and renewable 
        energy projects that require NHPA Section 106 compliance are 
        proposed for NPS lands. This model could also be applied by 
        other agencies.

    In addition to the administration's request, Congress should 
explore applying funding under the IRA to the above initiatives.
     national park service-historic preservation fund: $225 million
    The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides crucial support to 
SHPOs and THPOs and matching grants to nonprofits and local governments 
to preserve and document historic resources. The HPF (among other 
programs) plays a crucial role in the ability of States and local 
municipalities to comply with the preservation system established by 
the NHPA-particularly with regard to Section 106 consultations. SHPOs 
and THPOs constitute the ``front line'' in the effort to preserve our 
cultural heritage. With the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, their workloads continue to 
expand. In addition to compliance with Section 106, communities rely on 
HPF grants to attract tourism, retain a unique sense of place, and 
promote economic development.
    The increases for the HPF in the omnibus FY 2023 appropriations 
legislation were badly needed. THPOs in particular faced-and continue 
to face-a difficult situation. There are 215 offices, and more are 
added each year, but even with the current year increase of $7 million 
(to $23 million), the average THPO receives just $107,000. Though an 
improvement over earlier allocations, this remains an inadequate amount 
for the tasks that they continue to face, including engagement on a 
government-to-government basis with Federal agencies on many 
undertakings. Unfortunately, the president's request of $177.9 million 
for the HPF, which would represent an overall decrease of $26.6 million 
from FY 2023 enacted levels, is wholly inadequate, even though SHPO and 
THPO funding would remain the same. The SAA strongly endorses the 
recommendations put forward by the preservation community in February 
for a total of $225 million for the HPF in FY 2024, of which $70 
million would go to SHPOs and $34 million to THPOs.
    Bureau of Land Management-Cultural Resources Management: $25 
million
    The BLM manages 245 million acres, which makes the agency the 
largest land manager in the United States. These lands contain an 
enormous number of known and as-yet-undiscovered cultural resources, 
many of which are in remote locations, and some are in areas with high 
visitation rates. Many sites on BLM lands are subject to looting, 
particularly in the Southwest. Patrol, inventory, and monitoring of 
cultural heritage sites is essential to their protection, and the 217 
archaeologists on staff, along with the small number of other cultural 
resources specialists and law enforcement officers, is simply not 
enough to accomplish the mission. BLM lands also contain sites and 
areas, such Bears Ears, that many Tribes consider sacred. The low 
staffing levels make liaising with Tribal officers during project 
planning very difficult, especially with respect to sacred sites and 
areas. The BLM needs additional funding to support more staff to do its 
work around protecting, inventorying, and monitoring cultural 
resources, in addition to providing effective Tribal consultation. The 
administration's requested increase is insufficient. We urge Congress 
to allocate $25 million to this important program.
bureau of land management-national landscape conservation system: $72.9 
                                million
    The National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS), first 
established in 2000 and authorized by Congress in 2009, contains more 
than 35 million acres of National Monuments, Wilderness Areas, Wild and 
Scenic Rivers, and other sensitive lands. This land also includes an 
extensive and diverse array of the Nation's archaeological and cultural 
resources. We thank the subcommittee for supporting the $12.3 million 
increase in the FY 2023 omnibus appropriations bill for this account, 
thus restoring the NLCS to its FY 2006 funding level of $65.1 million. 
In order to secure the gains made to stewardship of these lands and the 
cultural resources they contain, we support the administration's 
request of $72.9 million for FY 2024, an increase of $11.3 million. 
More than $5 million of this increase will go toward much-needed 
management changes, and $3 million for the Increasing Representation in 
Our Public Lands initiative, which expands preservation of the historic 
and cultural sites important to traditionally underrepresented groups.
  native american graves protection and repatriation act grants: $3.4 
                                million
    The NAGPRA Grants Program is the primary means of restoring 
culturally affiliated human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, 
and objects of cultural patrimony to their Native American Tribes and 
Native Hawaiian organizations. These ancestors and sacred items 
represent critical heritage for their traditional beliefs and 
practices. The program fills a key role in facilitating cooperation 
between Tribes and museums to document covered items and realize their 
repatriation under NAGPRA. Although the law was passed in 1990, over 30 
years ago, many museums, universities, and Federal agencies have not 
completed their mandated inventories, let alone repatriated remains. In 
FY 2022 a total of $2.15 million was allocated to grant recipients for 
consultation between Tribes and repositories, documentation of items in 
covered collections, and repatriation of claimed objects to affiliated 
Tribes and lineal descendants. Nevertheless, FY 2022 saw 17 grant 
applications go unfunded. In fact, in most years since the program's FY 
1994 inception, the number of requests exceeded the amount of available 
funding. We congratulate the subcommittee for agreeing to a FY 2023 
allocation of $3.4 million. This substantial increase will go a long 
way toward eliminating the backlog of unfunded requests. In order to 
ensure that this trend continues, and that sensitive objects of 
cultural patrimony are returned to the affiliated Tribes as the law 
intended, we ask that the panel approve another $3.4 million for the 
NAGPRA Grants Program for FY 2024, no change from the current fiscal 
year.
                  implementing the stop act-$3 million
    Late last year the president signed the Safeguard Tribal Objects of 
Patrimony Act into law. The SAA applauds this important measure that 
will create an explicit prohibition on the export of items obtained in 
violation of NAGPRA or ARPA, make it easier for Native American Tribes 
to access other countries' law enforcement mechanisms to regain their 
stolen property, increase penalties for violations of NAGPRA, 
facilitate coordination between the government and Tribes to protect 
Tribes' cultural heritage and enable its return, establish an export 
certification system to allow for transactions of legally acquired 
materials, and establish a Federal framework to support voluntary 
returns from private collections. The act authorized $3 million in FY 
2024 for its implementation. We ask that the FY 2024 appropriations 
legislation include this funding so that the work of carrying out the 
STOP Act can begin.
    The SAA greatly appreciates your time and consideration of these 
important issues. Please contact us if you have any questions or 
concerns.

        Prepared Statement of the Society of American Foresters
    The Society of American Foresters (SAF) appreciates the opportunity 
to submit written public testimony to the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations, subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies regarding fiscal year (FY) 2024 appropriations. SAF 
recommendations focus on supporting programs at the USDA Forest Service 
(USFS) and the Department of the Interior (DOI), including the Bureau 
of Land Management (BLM).
                saf's top federal priorities for fy 2024
(1) Continued investment in the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis 
        (FIA) program at no less than $32.2 million in program dollars 
        and $54.9 million allocated from Forest and Rangeland Research 
        Salaries and Expenses.

(2) Increased investment in the USFS Research and Development programs 
        to $80 million and continued support for the Joint Fire Science 
        program.

(3) Increased investment in the Forest Products program to $47 million 
        and the Roads program under Capital Improvement and Maintenance 
        to $86 million to better support National Forest System lands 
        and rural economies.

(4) Fully funding the Landscape Scale Restoration program at $20 
        million and increased investment in the Forest Stewardship 
        program to $22 million.

(5) Permanently authorizing BLM's Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery 
        Fund.

    Founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900, SAF is the premier scientific 
and educational organization in the United States advancing and 
promoting science-based, sustainable management and stewardship of the 
Nation's public and private forests. SAF has over 9,000 members 
including public and private sector natural resource professionals, 
researchers, CEOs, administrators, investment advisors, educators, and 
students. As the professionals who study, manage, and care for our 
Nation's forest resources, we have a vested interest in ensuring their 
long-term health and sustainability.
    Americans rely on the 751 million acres of public and private 
forests in the US to provide clean and abundant air and water, forest 
products, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, carbon 
sequestration and storage, forage and range resources, energy, and 
scenic beauty.
    Continuing to sustainably manage our forests for these diverse 
benefits has become increasingly challenging due to unprecedented 
environmental threats. In particular, the climate change and 
biodiversity crises illustrate the need for continued investment in the 
forest sector.
    While wildfires and carbon storage are likely the most topical 
issues in the public discourse surrounding forests today, a myriad of 
challenges faced by forestry professionals are intensifying under 
changes in climate (e.g., invasive pests, disease, species migration, 
water availability). In the face of these challenges, forestry 
professionals continue to create an adaptive suite of forest management 
solutions that balance resilience, ecological integrity, and natural 
resource economies. Implementing these solutions and ensuring the 
sustainability of our forests requires continued investment in our 
forestry professionals.
    Healthy, viable forests are long-term investments. Funding for 
research, science, and technology is essential to building effective 
programming with sufficient workforce capacity to protect our forests 
for the future.\1\ Furthermore, breaking the pattern of unresolved 
funding bills and continuing resolutions would be of tremendous help to 
our land managers. A commitment to consistent and timely budget and 
appropriations cycles from Congress and the Administration provides the 
certainty required for resource managers to plan for the upcoming field 
season and consider future years as well. This certainty will dictate 
management activities and allow managers to provide direction and 
instruction on deployment of resources to address critical needs.

    Advances in research have highlighted the instrumental role that 
forests continue to play in mitigating the effects of climate change. 
For example, US forests and associated harvested wood products 
sequester nearly 16% of economy-wide CO2 emissions each year and store 
more than three decades of CO2 emitted from fossil fuels.\2\ USFS 
Forest and Rangeland Research is one of the critical bodies ensuring 
the longevity and resilience of our forests by advancing climate-smart,

                     forest and rangeland research
                     forest inventory and analysis
    Forestry professionals and a diverse array of stakeholders rely on 
the inventory data and analysis of America's forests provided by the 
Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. This critical information 
is needed to support sound policy and forest management decisions 
across all landscapes and is increasingly important for decisions 
regarding carbon stocks, sustainability, and existing and expanding 
markets. We thank you for the additional $10 million in programmatic 
funding provided in FY23. This investment will enable the Forest 
Service to deliver on stakeholder priorities, including funding States 
and cooperators that help deliver the program at the current costs of 
doing business, fully funding plot collection in interior Alaska, 
bolstering Timber Products Output (TPO) data collection, expanding 
analysis of forest carbon, growing remote sensing partnerships with 
NASA, and developing new partnerships in urban forest inventory. SAF 
recommends at least $32.2 million in program funding for FIA in FY 
2024. Additionally, of the amount allocated for Salaries and Expenses 
(S&E) in Forest and Rangeland Research, we urge Congress to direct 
$54.9 million for the FIA program. Fully operationalizing significant 
program expansion as envisioned in the FY23 omnibus necessitates both 
programmatic and S&E increases. These two pots of money are used in 
tandem by the Forest Service in program delivery.
                        research and development
    Investments in forestry research are essential for the future 
health and sustainability of the Nation's forests. Research conducted 
at the five USFS research stations, the International Institute of 
Tropical Forestry, and in the Forest Products Laboratory is crucial to: 
(1) developing new products and practical innovation; (2) identifying 
forest ecosystem disturbance responses and forest resilience; (3) 
responding to shifting social demands and demographic changes; (4) and 
quantifying the contributions of forests to air and water quality. 
Without USFS leadership, investigation of these critical research needs 
would largely be left unfulfilled. Using Federal investments that are 
leveraged in partnership with universities and private-public 
consortiums, important research questions, emerging threats, and 
potential opportunities are thoroughly researched and vetted. SAF 
recommends $80 million for the Research and Development program in FY 
2024.
                           joint fire science
    SAF appreciates this subcommittee's commitment to continuing the 
important work of the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP). SAF recommends 
funding for the JFSP at or above FY 2023 levels and asks the 
subcommittee to encourage active participation by DOI and USFS in 
prioritizing investment in fire research and decision support.
                  capital improvement and maintenance
                                 roads
    Roads on National Forest System lands are vital infrastructure 
facilitating the use, enjoyment, protection, and long-term health of 
Federal lands. Properly maintained roads enable the agency to meet 
critical natural resource needs and provide safe access to public 
lands. Unfortunately, with annual appropriations not nearly matching 
the need, properly maintaining this vital infrastructure has become 
increasingly challenging. Deteriorating roads reduce access for 
recreation, firefighting, and resource management. Investments in these 
critical assets will create jobs in rural communities while also 
improving wildlife habitat, hunting and fishing opportunities, public 
safety, and resource management. Conversely, a lack of investment in 
this program directly impacts fuels reduction work, watershed health, 
and other Bipartisan Infrastructure Law projects. SAF recommends $86 
million for the Roads program in FY 2024.
                         national forest system
                            forest products
    The Forest Products program supports the agency's goals to foster 
resilient ecosystems, mitigate climate change and wildfire risks, and 
strengthen rural communities through timber sales and other removals of 
forest products. Increased investment would not only support a 
sustainable flow of wood fiber to markets but also launch more projects 
focused on removing small diameter, low-value material, and understory 
trees that are not commercially viable but need to be removed to reduce 
the risk of wildfire or improve forest health conditions. SAF 
recommends $47 million for the Forest Products program in FY 2024.
                       state and private forestry
                      landscape scale restoration
    Landscape Scale Restoration (LSR) projects are key tools for 
States, in collaboration with the USDA Forest Service and other 
partners, to address the most critical forest priorities identified in 
each State's Forest Action Plan. The competitive grant process ensures 
innovative approaches to restoration work are proposed and priority is 
given to projects that further the advancement of State Forest Action 
Plans. Therefore, LSR contributes to achieving results across the 
landscape and making meaningful local, regional, and national impacts. 
SAF recommends full funding for the Landscape Scale Restoration program 
at $20 million in FY 2024.
                           forest stewardship
    The Forest Stewardship Program (FSP) equips private forest 
landowners with the unbiased, science-based information they need to 
sustainably manage their forests now and into the future, helping to 
keep forests as forests. On average, state forestry agencies and other 
partners match Federal investments 2:1, which means the impact of 
Federal dollars delivered through the FSP have amplified on-the-ground 
impacts. Increased Federal funding for FSP will allow state forestry 
agencies and forestry professionals to ramp up outreach efforts and 
provide additional technical assistance to landowners to ensure that 
private forestland acres are maintained and continue to provide a 
myriad of public benefits. SAF recommends $22 million for the Forest 
Stewardship program in FY 2024.
          department of the interior-bureau of land management
               forest ecosystem health and recovery fund
    Managing BLM forestlands is an important element of maintaining and 
improving the health and productivity of our Nation's public lands. The 
Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund (referred to as the 5900 
Account by BLM) was originally established in 1993 to help BLM rapidly 
respond to forestlands damaged by wildfire, insects, and disease. Over 
the years, the authorization has expanded to include a wide range of 
proactive forest health treatments to reduce the risk of future damage 
as well as a variety of recovery activities including salvage and 
replanting.
    The Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund is self-funded with 
receipts generated from the sale of forest products resulting from 
projects planned and executed to meet the purposes of the fund. Since 
its creation, the fund has provided an additional $4-10 million 
annually to improve forest health and resilience on BLM forestlands.
    SAF believes that the justification for this fund is stronger than 
ever. Given hotter and drier summers, our forests are subjected to 
increased insect and disease damage and longer and more extreme 
wildfire seasons. Public land managers-including BLM foresters-need 
proper resources to manage forests to reduce fuel loads, salvage 
damaged timber, and make forests more resilient to disturbances. SAF 
requests that the subcommittee consider permanent authorization for the 
Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund (PL 102-381).

                                 ______
                                 
   Prepared Statement of the Southeastern Wood Producers Association
    The Southeastern Wood Producers Association, Inc. represents the 
loggers of Florida and Georgia. We are strong supporters of the Forest 
Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program funded by the USDA Forest Service 
(Forest Service). We rely on the inventory, data, and analysis provided 
by the program, which make up the backbone of scientific knowledge on 
the current state of the Nation's forests. This critical information is 
needed to support sound policy and forest management decisions across 
all land ownerships and is increasingly important for decisions 
existing and expanding markets.
    We thank you for the additional $10 million in FIA programmatic 
funding provided in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and look forward to working 
with you to further improve FIA's capabilities in FY24. The FY23 
funding increase will enable the Forest Service to deliver on many of 
our priorities, including funding States and cooperators that help 
deliver the program at the current costs of doing business, fully 
funding plot collection in interior Alaska, bolstering Timber Products 
Output (TPO) data collection, expanding analysis of forest carbon, 
growing remote sensing partnerships with NASA, and developing new 
partnerships in urban forest inventory.
    We urge Congress to continue to support FIA with no less than $32.2 
million in program dollars for FY24. Additionally, of the amount 
allocated for Salaries and Expenses (S&E) in Forest and Rangeland 
Research, we urge Congress to direct $54.9 million for the FIA program. 
Fully operationalizing significant program expansion as envisioned in 
the FY23 omnibus necessitates both programmatic and S&E increases. 
These two pots of money are used in tandem by the Forest Service in 
program delivery.
    Unfortunately, since USFS budget modernization in FY21, Congress 
has lost the ability to directly prescribe how much S&E funding is 
devoted to FIA. We respectfully ask that Congress reinstate that 
authority in its FY24 appropriations bill. By explicitly outlining the 
amount directed toward FIA program S&E, Congress can help improve 
transparency for all stakeholders.
    Programmatic funding increases with commensurate increases to S&E 
are critical to fully delivering on Congressional priorities outlined 
in the FIA Strategic Plan.\1\ This plan includes improved carbon and 
biomass estimates, enhanced timber products monitoring, enhanced 
landowner studies, research into land cover and land use change, and 
urban forest inventory. All these items add immense value to the 
understanding of our Nation's forests but are not possible at current 
funding levels and are critical, given the increasing demand for FIA 
data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additionally, budget modernization has made it difficult for 
external stakeholders to determine what budget resources FIA devotes to 
its various programmatic areas and what budget resources are necessary 
for FIA to meet its mission. To further improve transparency, we urge 
Congress to direct FIA to annually publish its programmatic cost 
elements and prioritization in its annual budget justification and 
business report.
    Looking forward, we would like to draw attention to the growing 
importance of moving to a nationwide 5-year data collection cycle. 
Currently, funding allows the eastern United States to be measured 
every 7 years, while the west is on a ten-year remeasurement cycle. 
Considering increasing frequency and severity of forest disturbances 
such as wildfires and hurricanes, the current cycles are inadequate to 
capture our rapidly changing forest landscapes.
    Given the increasing pressures facing our forests-climate impacts, 
wildfire, insects and disease, and development-the FIA program is more 
important now than ever before. We look forward to working with 
Congress and the Forest Service to continue sustainably growing this 
program and ensuring accurate and timely inventory of America's 
forests.

       Prepared Statement of the Squaxin Island Tribal Leadership
    On behalf of the Squaxin Island Tribal Leadership and citizens, it 
is an honor to provide our priority funding requests and 
recommendations for the FY 2024 Budgets for the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and Indian Health 
Service (IHS) and related agencies. We applaud the Committees' work to 
include advance appropriations for the IHS in the FY 2023 omnibus 
spending package and we hope that this will remain for each fiscal 
year. Squaxin Island is continuing to work to also include the BIA and 
BIE funding in advance appropriations to prevent funding lapses and 
other unintended consequences associated with short-term funding 
measures from disrupting critical services to American Indians and 
Alaska Natives provided by the Federal Government. We will also 
continue to advocate and urge Congress to shift funding for all Tribal 
programs to mandatory direct appropriations with the hope that Tribal 
program funding throughout the Federal Government will be exempt from 
sequestrations, rescissions, and disproportionate cuts.

                    squaxin island tribe background
    We are native people of South Puget Sound and descendants of the 
maritime people who lived and prospered along these shores for untold 
centuries. We are known as the People of the Water because of our 
strong cultural connection to the natural beauty and bounty of Puget 
Sound going back hundreds of years. The Squaxin Island Indian 
Reservation is in southeastern Mason County, Washington and the Tribe 
is a signatory to the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty. Our treaty-designated 
reservation, Squaxin Island, is approximately 2.2 square miles of 
uninhabited forested land, surrounded by the bays and inlets of 
southern Puget Sound. Because the Island lacks fresh water, the Tribe 
has built its community on roughly 26 acres at Kamilche, Washington 
purchased and placed into trust. The Tribe also owns 6 acres across 
Pickering Passage from Squaxin Island and a plot of 36 acres on 
Harstine Island, across Peale Passage. The total land area including 
off-reservation trust lands is 1,715.46 acres. In addition, the Tribe 
manages roughly five hundred acres of Puget Sound tidelands.
    Our Tribal governance combines our sovereign powers as well as U.S. 
Congressional acts related to treaties, statutes, and public law. 
Squaxin Island is one of the first 30 Federally recognized Tribes to 
enter a Compact of Self-Governance with the United States in both the 
Departments of the Interior and Health and Human Services. Prior to 
COVID-19, the Tribal government and our economic enterprises 
constituted the largest employer in Mason County with over 1,250 
employees. We continue to require the assistance of Congress to 
mitigate the amplified health inequities in Tribal communities because 
of underfunded and under-resourced health systems, limited access to 
health services, poor infrastructure, and underlying health 
disparities. The Tribe has a current enrollment of 1,123 and an on-
reservation population of 426 living in 141 homes. Squaxin has an 
estimated service area population of 2,747; a growth rate of about 10%, 
and an unemployment rate of about 30%. We appreciate the support we 
have received so far.
         squaxin island tribe specific requests/justifications
1. +$13 million--Design and Construct New Squaxin Island Health 
Center--IHS Division of Facilities Planning and Construction

    In 1995, under a Self-Governance compact with the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services' Indian Health Service, the Squaxin Island 
Tribe began construction of the Tribally owned Sally Selvedge Memorial 
Health Center (the Center). The original 8,000 square foot facility 
housed the primary care, dental, mental health, contract health 
services and community health and served an estimated 770 users. The 
Center consolidated health programs into one facility and expanded new 
services not previously available due to the lack of space and 
resources. We remain proud of this accomplishment and what we were able 
to offer our citizens using and leveraging funds as we saw fit to meet 
our local needs.
    On June 17, 2021, IHS testified before the House Committee on 
Natural Resources on the status of IHS and Tribal facilities, 
``Disparities in the health status of American Indians and Alaska 
Natives are directly affected by access to health care services. Health 
care services are constrained by the limited capacities of existing 
Indian Health Service and Tribal health care facilities. There is a 
significant need for expansion, renovation, or replacement of many 
buildings.''\1\ This remains true today within the network of over 687 
Federal and Tribal health facilities and 41 Urban Indian Organizations 
(UIOs) that are located across 37 States providing health care services 
to approximately 2.7 million American Indian and Alaska Native people.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asl/testimony/2021/06/17/
examining-federal-facilities-indian-country.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thirty years after the Center was built, the Squaxin Island Health 
and Human Services (HHS), located in the Center now provides 9,000 
patient/clinic visits with over 17,000 pharmacy encounters taking place 
each year to 905 AI/AN patients as well as other family members of 
those patients. We can no longer accommodate all of our mental health 
and substance use disorder programs in the same facility. Our Health 
Promotion/Disease Prevention and HIT programs are also located in 
another site. Medical services have outgrown our existing space and our 
ability to address the public health emergency because our facility was 
unable to accommodate any increases to medical or administrative staff. 
The Tribe bills Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers but the 
buying power we once had to build a new health center in 1995 has 
diminished in 2023, even more so because of inflation caused by the 
pandemic. Our American Indian/Alaska Native patient population has 
increased over 25% since 2012. Current medical, dental, and behavioral 
services are insufficient for our current population. Laboratory and 
lab services are severely under built and would not be able to meet 
accreditation standards. The recent pandemic spotlighted our need for 
basic health care delivery infrastructure improvements, in both 
staffing and buildings, required to address communicable viruses. The 
potential consequences on our Tribal members and families with 
underlying health conditions remains a concern for us. We can no longer 
continue to provide the level of care that we strive to achieve in 
facilities that have met their maximum remodeling capacity. Squaxin 
Island Tribe is in desperate need of Congressional appropriations to 
construct a new facility.
    Since 1993 and continues today, the Healthcare Facilities 
Construction Priority System (HFCPS) is the methodology that the IHS 
uses to identify and prioritize the need for IHS and Tribal healthcare 
facilities. Prior to Squaxin Island building the Center, the IHS, in 
collaboration with Tribal representatives, used the HFCPS to prioritize 
major health facilities' needs. The IHS projects were ranked based on 
the population served, the condition of health care facilities, 
remoteness, and barriers to care. The overall health care facility 
construction need grew from $14.5 billion in 2016 to $23 billion in 
2021 due to expanded programs and better reporting. The IHS facilities 
construction appropriations have only averaged $194 million annually 
since the last report was submitted to Congress.
    In March 2020, pre-pandemic, we were in the process of rolling out 
the Squaxin Island Tribe Strategic Health Plan; a robust health program 
plan which includes all the details about a new facility and expanded 
services. Today there is approximately 12,000 square feet that houses 
the entire HHS department. Using estimates of current building sizes, 
or comps, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation 
recently built a 64,000 square foot health center with a user 
population of 3,331. Medical facilities average $500 per square foot. 
Squaxin Island's user population is approximately 28% the size of 
Umatilla. We estimate we need a minimum of 25,000 square feet based on 
the Indian Health Care Services' Healthcare Systems Planning tool, 
which calculates the current user population and projections of growth 
out to 2034.

Estimated total cost for the design and construction of the Squaxin 
Island Health Center is $13,000,000.

2. + $1.750 Million Increase for Northwest Indian Treatment Center 
(NWITC) Residential Program--IHS--H"D3WXbi Palil'' meaning ``Returning 
from the Dark, Deep Waters to the Light"

    The Squaxin Island Tribe's Northwest Indian Treatment Center, D3f 
bi Pa lil, is a residential treatment facility that serves Native 
Americans with chronic substance abuse patterns related to unresolved 
grief and complex trauma, including generational trauma. The Center is 
Commission on Accreditation of Facilities accredited and a recognized 
national model of treatment for treating trauma in the presence of 
addiction, uniquely integrating the Best Practice of Dialectical 
Behavioral Therapy (DBT) with Plant Medicines. This culturally infused 
use of a Best Practice, based on this NWITC program, has been adapted 
in many Tribal communities since its development. DBT is a model of 
treatment with good research results for the treatment of substance 
above and mental health conditions.
    In recognition of NWITC's unique model of treatment, the State of 
Washington Health Care Authority has requested NWITC to create a video-
documentary describing the key elements. They have provided over 
$82,000 to fund this video-documentary which can be used as a model by 
other Tribes to help understand the benefits and requirements of the 
facility. NWITC has these urgent needs:

A.  Medicine Building--this project is shovel ready cost estimated at 
        +$1.5 million--This building will support and expand the reach 
        of the activities of the DBT/Plant Medicine program. It will be 
        a place of medicine making, but also have video capacity 
        linking this program to other Tribal medicine programs and 
        creating a library available to Tribal behavioral health 
        programs and NWITC alumni. The result will be better support 
        for alumni, but also will help build capacity in Tribal 
        communities in the Northwest.

B.  NWITC Recovery Support Team and Outreach--+$250,000--The pandemic 
        has attributed to a high relapse rate in Tribal communities 
        served by NWITC. To better support NWITC alumni, it is 
        necessary to provide more support. Even though the NWITC has a 
        Recovery Support Team who actively supports alumni for 1-year 
        post treatment, in the current environment this is 
        insufficient. NWITC requires a staff position to provide the 
        DBT/Plant Medicine training/coaching in the Tribal communities 
        in which alumni live. Costs include a position to implement 
        this, plus expenses of alumni to participate, including hotel, 
        food, etc. In past events NWITC has verified this as the most 
        successful approach for teaching/coaching alumni.

3. +$900,000--Shellfish Management--BIA

    The Squaxin Island Tribe faces an ongoing budget deficit to 
maintain and operate the shellfish program at its current level of 
operation-a level that leaves 20% of treaty-designated state lands and 
80-90% of private tidelands unharvested due to lack of funding. To 
address this shortfall and enable effective growth and development of 
the program, an annual minimum increase of $900,000 is requested. 
Shellfish have been a mainstay for the Squaxin Island people for 
thousands of years and are important today for subsistence, economic 
and ceremonial purposes. The Tribe's right to harvest shellfish is 
guaranteed by the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty. Today, we are unable to 
fully exercise our treaty rights due to lack of Federal support for our 
shellfish management program.
    Thank you for considering these FY 2024 funding priorities for the 
Squaxin Island Tribe.

                                 ______
                                 
  Prepared Statement of United States Environmental Protection Agency
    We, the undersigned fifty-six education, health, environment, and 
children's health groups from coast to coast, are writing to urge the 
Committee to include $100 million for the US Environmental Protection 
Agency's (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation/Indoor Environments Division 
(OAR/IED) to protect school children and personnel from unhealthy 
environments in schools and childcare facilities. We also request that 
you include an additional $10 million for EPA's Office of Children's 
Health Protection to increase public health research and services to 
improve children's environmental health.
    EPA/OAR/IED needs $100 million to lead a national educational 
campaign, backed by expanded national and regional grants, direct 
technical assistance, and must prepare guidance for school facilities 
to help them stay open or reopen quickly after severe disasters. Indoor 
air quality is critical. It takes months or years to fix or rebuild a 
school; the Nation's schools need to be able to stay open longer or to 
reopen safely and quickly after a disaster.
    Indoor air pollution is a serious threat and hard to address: it 
takes longer to identify sources and prioritize repairs than other EPA 
concerns such as lead in drinking water, PCBs, asbestos, or hazardous 
waste. Indoor air pollution can arise from everything that goes right 
and wrong with a facility, thus, indoor air quality (IAQ) assessments 
begin outside the building, then move to find indoor environment 
sources. Pollutants can come from poor construction and siting near 
hazardous facilities; leaky roofs and growing molds; chemical spills 
and odors from science labs; kitchen, locker room, and or lavatory 
stench; carbon dioxide accumulations; lack of incoming fresh air; 
carbon monoxide leaks; cleaning and disinfecting products; and pests 
and pesticides, or from occupants themselves and the processes and 
products used in classes. It is complicated; school leaders and 
communities need education, guidance, and support.
    In addition, EPA needs $10 million annually provided to the Office 
of Children's Health Protection. This funding is needed to restore 
investments in research and outreach programs for children's 
environmental health shared with the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), the National Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences (NIEHS), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry (ATSDR). This funding will also help EPA in its role as co-
chair of the multi-agency President's Task Force on risks to children's 
environmental health (under Executive Order 13045), and to elevate its 
critical role in a new interagency group on schools facilities that 
includes EPA, ED, DoE, plus offices in the White House, including the 
Council on Environmental Quality and Domestic Policy Council.
    Why school environmental health and the impact on children are 
urgent issues. Education is a social determinant of health. During the 
school year, about fifty million children in the US spend the majority 
of their waking hours when not at home in public schools. Numerous 
studies have documented that school conditions such as polluted IAQ, 
mold, dust and debris, high heat, poor siting, proximity to hazards, 
noise, and poor lighting and sanitation, damage children's ``health, 
thinking, and learning'' (Harvard SPH 2017; NRC 2006). Today, some 40% 
of school age children have at least one existing chronic health issues 
(CDC), including asthma, which affects 1 in 13 school-aged children and 
remains the leading cause of school absenteeism due to chronic illness.
    Also, US schools are not climate-ready- suggesting more long-term 
school closures ahead in many parts of the country--and not epidemic-
ready, again suggesting more frustrating closures and hybrid learning 
schemes ahead that will increase persistent learning losses in the next 
generation of adults.

  --School attendance is mandatory in all States, and 98% of US 
        children are in school every day.

  --Schools are more densely occupied than nursing homes and less well 
        maintained.

  --Nearly half of all public-school students are children and youth of 
        color.

  --Schools have an exceptionally long history of poor indoor air/
        environmental quality worsened by decades of funding shortages, 
        neglect, and a lack of knowledge on how to address problems 
        effectively.

  --The poorest communities hardest hit by COVID, and climate change 
        are also the communities where children's health and learning 
        are impacted by the worst conditions.

  --An estimated 50 percent of public schools have outdated heating and 
        ventilation systems, and thousands of schools likely contain 
        PCBs and asbestos, among other risks posed by poorly managed 
        chemicals and pesticides used in and near school buildings.

  --Further, the Nation's 100,000 public schools today contain over 8 
        billion square feet of learning space valued at over $3 
        trillion, which means more frequent long-term school closures 
        ahead if they are not physically resilient. Investments in 
        electric buses and energy retrofits are deeply appreciated and 
        welcome, but those steps will not guarantee that a facility 
        will survive the next super storm.

    This is the Congress' moment to put the EPA's 30 years of expertise 
in indoor air and indoor environments to work to improve school 
buildings and grounds, and thus health and learning outcomes for 
children, especially for those most disadvantaged, including children 
with disabilities.
    We appreciate the funding for school infrastructure through the 
various COVID programs, ARPA, BIL, and IRA, however EPA gets a scant 
$50 million over 10 years from IRA to address indoor air. While the 
Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Education (ED), and CDC have 
far larger programs, none match EPA's knowledge and experience on the 
physical environment of schools and its impact on children. In fact, 
neither ED nor CDC have authorizations or in-house expertise on school 
facilities. To date, EPA's level of funding is embarrassingly small, 
considering the documented environmental problems in schools, and the 
lack of knowledge in communities and among education leaders on how to 
address those issues effectively.
    Of the $100 million annual funding that we recommend for EPA's 
indoor air program to improve school indoor air and related issues, we 
urge that half be provided through cooperative agreements to States, 
Tribes, cities, and nongovernmental organizations to provide ``hands-
on'' technical assistance to schools, training, educational outreach, 
and programs to monitor and assess school environmental health 
conditions. State capacity to help schools varies significantly, and 
EPA funding and guidance can help States track and improve conditions 
for schools nationwide, with special attention to schools in poor and 
disadvantaged districts and communities of color, as well as rural-
remote schools.
    This is your moment to make a big difference in children's lives. 
Put US EPA's proven expertise to work to improve health and learning 
outcomes for all children, especially those most disadvantaged or with 
disabilities. A nation that wants to stay competitive must invest in 
the next generation, its children.

    Thank you for your consideration of our request.

                                 ______
                                 
        Prepared Statement of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
    The undersigned organizations write to request your support for 
full funding of $15 million annually through Fiscal Year 2025 for the 
``Grant Program for Losses of Livestock Due to Depredation by Federally 
Protected Species (Grant Program)'' (7 USC Sec. 8355). We find common 
ground in our work to reduce human-wildlife conflict and its impacts 
while supporting working landscapes that underpin rural economies and 
provide crucial wildlife habitat. We envision landscapes where people, 
livestock, and wildlife all thrive, where effective management 
practices reduce conflicts and economic solutions support resilient, 
biodiverse working lands.
    Given the expanding range of many large carnivores, including 
reintroduction efforts throughout their historic range, the need for 
additional wildlife-livestock conflict prevention work and livestock 
depredation compensation support for producers is rapidly increasing. 
At the same time, Federal funding to support non-lethal conflict 
prevention work and supplement State-level livestock depredation 
compensation funds has remained relatively flat, and nowhere near 
enough to meet the demand. This is evident in the Wolf Livestock Loss 
Demonstration Project Grant Program administered by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS) authorized in 2009, which continues to receive 
only $1 million annually in funding. This program provides grants to 
State agencies to administer non-lethal conflict prevention techniques, 
and supplement existing State programs that compensate producers for 
livestock loss, but is often nearly fully expended in only a handful of 
western States. Recognizing that this annual appropriation falls well 
short of the need, Congress authorized the Grant Program in the 
America's Conservation Enhancement Act of 2020.
    Working lands are where people and nature come together. Durable 
conservation requires wildlife management strategies that are informed 
by and supported by those living in wild and working landscapes. 
Building that support requires funding on the ground, and it also 
requires capacity in State and Federal agencies. Added capacity 
provided through the Grant Program to implement non-lethal conflict 
reduction methods will benefit both rural communities and wildlife, 
bringing us closer to our vision of healthy, connected landscapes 
through support for land stewards.

            Prepared Statement of the WateReuse Association
    Thank you for the opportunity to present our FY 2024 funding 
requests for programs administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). The WateReuse Association (WateReuse) urges you to meet 
the President's FY 2024 Budget Request of $25 million for the Pilot 
Program for Alternative Water Source Grants (33 U.S.C. 1300).
    WateReuse is a not-for-profit trade association for water 
utilities, businesses, industrial and commercial enterprises, non-
profit organizations, and research entities that engage in and on water 
reuse. WateReuse and its state and regional sections represent more 
than 200 water utilities serving over 60 million customers, and over 
300 businesses and organizations across the country. Our mission is to 
advance safe and sustainable water supplies, to promote acceptance and 
support of recycled water, and to advocate for policies and funding 
that increase water reuse.
    According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), 40 U.S. States are experiencing moderate drought or worse. 
Droughts have brought severe conditions including wildfires, heat 
waves, severely depleted water sources, and reduced crop production. 
Despite recent rain events, in the West, conditions are at their driest 
point in 1,200 years and are worsening. In parts of Pennsylvania, 
Illinois, New England, and other regions across the country, 
communities are facing significant and even extreme drought conditions.
    As water supply and water quality challenges intensify, the Nation 
must invest in water recycling to build resilience, manage energy 
demands, support public and environmental health, and ensure America's 
economic prosperity. Investments in water recycling ensure reliable and 
resilient community water supplies, support sustainable economic 
development, and help protect our rivers, lakes, streams, aquifers and 
wetlands.
    Water reuse is a long-standing practice in supply-constrained areas 
in the West. However, water reuse is also now common practice in other 
parts of the country, where communities are turning to reuse to 
recharge strained aquifers and meet other needs. The drivers for water 
reuse are many, including stringent discharge regulations and a need to 
reduce pollutant loads to receiving waters. Communities are also 
turning to reuse to manage a range of stormwater challenges.
    To help communities build resilient supplies and protect water 
quality, Congress authorized the Pilot Program for Alternative Water 
Source Grants as part of the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act of 2021. Through the program, EPA will make competitive 
grants to state, interstate, and intrastate water resource development 
agencies to engineer, design, construct, and test alternative water 
source systems, including water reuse systems.
    By investing in the Pilot Program for Alternative Water Source 
Grants, Congress can begin to give communities in all 50 States plus 
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico the tools and resources they 
need to protect public health and the environment, support economic 
development, and create long-term solutions for future generations.
          examples of water recycling from around the country
    In Virginia's tidewater region, Hampton Roads Sanitation District 
is pursuing a multi-benefit water reuse program called the Sustainable 
Water Initiative for Tomorrow (SWIFT). HRSD's SWIFT project treats 
wastewater effluent to drinking water standards and reuses it to 
recharge the regional aquifer. The investment of $1.1 billion in 
capital outlays provides critical public health, environmental and 
economic benefits by replenishing the overdrawn Potomac Aquifer, 
recharging 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of fresh water at full 
implementation, providing a reliable safe water supply to support the 
region's population and the Nation's critical military assets, and 
generating nutrient credits that HRSD can trade--providing an estimated 
savings of $1.5 billion for 11 counties across the region.
    In Florida's Tampa Bay Region, Hillsborough County's Saltwater 
Intrusion and Aquifer Recharge Program (SHARP) is creating a hydraulic 
barrier to saltwater intrusion between the Bay and the region's 
drinking water aquifer. At a cost of $20 million, SHARP is yielding 
significant climate-resiliency benefits by protecting the region's 
freshwater aquifer from sea level rise and saltwater intrusion, 
reducing pumping costs and energy use by raising groundwater levels and 
increasing pressure in the potable freshwater aquifer, generating water 
supply credits that offset the project's cost, and supporting seagrass 
and fishery recovery efforts by reducing nutrient and other effluent 
loadings.
    In Texas, El Paso Water is using water recycling and saline 
groundwater desalination to produce a drought-resilient, cost-
effective, and reliable water supply to support a vibrant local 
economy. Compared to the next best alternative (importing groundwater), 
El Paso's water reuse program is reducing energy use by 3.6 million MWH 
over the planning period and addressing affordability challenges 
related to imported water by saving more than $1.2 billion, or 74 
percent.
    In California's Chino Basin, local leaders developed the Optimum 
Basin Management Program (OBMP) to address the region's water 
challenges. The OBMP generates energy savings in excess of 5.8 Billion 
kWh over 30 years by relying on local resources rather than energy 
intensive water imports, saves ratepayers an estimated $2.4 billion in 
water supply costs, and restores instream flows and water quality in 
the Santa Ana River, returning a surface water supply and replenishing 
and improving water quality in the Chino Groundwater Basin.

        Prepared Statement of the Western Governors' Association
    Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the 
subcommittee, the Western Governors' Association (WGA) appreciates the 
opportunity to provide written testimony on the appropriations and 
activities of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), U.S. Forest 
Service (USFS) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). WGA is an 
independent organization representing the Governors of the 22 
westernmost States and territories. The Association is an instrument of 
the Governors for bipartisan policy development, information sharing 
and collective action on issues of critical importance to the western 
United States.
    The agencies within the subcommittee's jurisdiction wield 
significant influence over vast areas of the American West. Ninety-four 
percent of all Federal lands are located in the western States, and the 
Federal Government owns over 46 percent of the land within active WGA 
States. The work of this subcommittee is of vital importance to Western 
Governors, as it affects public lands management and Federal agency 
interaction with other levels of government and the public.
    There is a natural tension between State and Federal Governments 
that is embedded in the fabric of the U.S. Constitution. These 
sovereign governments must have a close and productive working 
relationship to promote efficiency and maximize returns on taxpayer 
investments. Improving the partnership between States and the Federal 
Government is central to the mission of WGA and is reflected in WGA 
Policy Resolution 2021-01, Strengthening the State-Federal 
Relationship.
    In last year's House committee report accompanying the Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 appropriations 
bill (H. Rpt. 117-400), the Federal agencies funded by the Interior 
bill were directed to provide appropriate feedback and decision 
rationale related to Tribal input received by agencies through 
meaningful consultation in their decision-making processes. Similar 
direction to Federal agencies for government-to-government consultation 
with States, which is required pursuant to Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, would improve the co-sovereign relationship between States 
and the Federal Government.
    Federal agencies should provide state, territorial, local, and 
Tribal government officials with accessible and clear information on 
available Federal resources and programs and the most effective 
utilization of those resources in disaster recovery. WGA has worked 
with Federal partners to improve interagency coordination on post-
wildfire restoration work, including a roadmap of assistance available 
to communities affected by wildfire and identification of 
``navigators'' to help communities prioritize post-wildfire restoration 
needs. Western Governors urge the Federal Government to prioritize the 
funding of these important needs, as they should have a positive effect 
on maximizing the value of restoration work and, more importantly, 
addressing the needs of communities affected by wildfire.
    Reducing wildfire risk also requires conducting active forest 
management at an unprecedented pace and scale. This, in turn, relies on 
a handful on enabling factors including a qualified land management 
workforce and infrastructure to transport and capitalize on the value 
of extracted biomass. Western Governors support certain findings within 
the USFS' 2022 Wildfire Crisis Strategy Roundtables Synthesis Report, 
including that subsidies are needed along with 10- to 20-year 
agreements for forest products in order to expand existing forest 
product infrastructure and markets. Western Governors laud the USFS' 
investments in forest health as part of their ten-year strategy to 
confront the wildfire crisis, and request continued funding for all 
aspects of wildfire risk reduction.
    Responsible land management can only occur when federal, State and 
local stakeholders collaborate to improve the health and resilience of 
our lands. Likewise, proactive fish and wildlife conservation is most 
effective when leveraging the cooperative efforts of State and Federal 
officials across multiple disciplines. To this end, Western Governors 
support funding for reasonable proactive management efforts to conserve 
species, including engaging stakeholders to implement early, voluntary 
conservation measures. WGA also believes Federal agencies should 
explore expanded use of detail positions and shared staff between State 
and Federal agencies to increase interagency coordination.
    States possess primary management authority over fish and wildlife 
within their borders, and they receive economic benefits associated 
with healthy species and ecosystems. At the same time, species listings 
can dramatically affect the efforts of western States to promote 
economic development, accommodate population growth, and maintain and 
expand infrastructure. Western Governors believe that States should be 
full partners in listing, critical habitat designations, recovery 
planning, recovery efforts, and delisting decisions. State agencies 
often have the best available science, expertise and other scientific 
and institutional resources such as mapping capabilities, biological 
inventories, biological management goals, state wildlife action plans 
and other important data. All listing, recovery and delisting decisions 
made by the Federal Government should recognize, consult, and employ 
these vast state resources and utilize objective, peer-reviewed 
scientific literature and scientific observations.
    Fish and wildlife migration corridors and habitat are necessary to 
maintain healthy populations of species in the West. Western Governors 
applaud the past funding for Federal agencies to advance state-
supported programs and projects promoting voluntary migration corridor 
and habitat conservation and request that the subcommittee continue to 
appropriate these funds. Western Governors note that any Federal 
efforts to identify, regulate or conserve wildlife migration corridors 
through administrative or legislative action must involve coordination 
and consultation with States and should advance collaborative, locally 
driven initiatives to conserve key wildlife corridors and habitat.
    WGA applauds the full funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes 
(PILT) program administered by the Department of the Interior for FY23 
and recommends the enactment of a permanent and stable funding 
mechanism for the program. PILT funding does not represent a gift to 
local jurisdictions; rather, it provides important compensation for the 
presence of non-taxable Federal lands in the West. Similarly, payments 
under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act 
(SRS) compensate communities whose timber industries have been 
negatively affected by actions and acquisitions of the Federal 
Government. Western Governors request that the subcommittee continue to 
appropriate full funding annually for both PILT and SRS in the future.
    Western Governors continue to be concerned about the number of wild 
horses and burros on BLM lands. This number is presently estimated to 
be more than triple the current Appropriate Management Level (AML). 
Overpopulation has resulted in the degradation of rangeland, negatively 
affecting wildlife and domestic livestock as well as the habitat of 
threatened and endangered species. WGA supports a process to establish, 
monitor and adjust AMLs for wild horses and burros that is transparent 
to stakeholders, supported by scientific information (including state 
data), and amenable to adaptation with new information and 
environmental and social change. Western Governors recognize BLM's 2019 
Path Forward for Management of BLM's Wild Horses and Burros and 2020 
Analysis of Achieving a Sustainable Wild Horse and Burro Program as 
examples of sensible alternatives to current wild horse and burro 
management practices. Western Governors encourage the subcommittee to 
continue funding BLM's implementation of the recommendations contained 
in these proposals.
    WGA remains concerned about the spread of invasive quagga and zebra 
mussels in the West, which continue to be a major threat to western 
water resources. Western Governors commend the inclusion of additional 
funding to address this ongoing threat in the FY23 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act and Inflation Reduction Act. Western Governors 
request that the BLM, FWS and NPS continue to be provided with the 
resources necessary to implement mandatory inspection of all high-risk 
watercraft and decontamination of watercraft infested with quagga and 
zebra mussels leaving waterbodies under their jurisdiction. Relevant to 
this matter, Western Governors acknowledge the addition of the BLM and 
NPS to the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF), and support 
funding to enable the ANSTF to carry out the report required in Sec. 
11327 of H.R. 7776, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Pub. L. 117-263). That report seeks to 
clarify Federal authority to manage and control aquatic invasive 
species on lands and waters under their jurisdiction.
    Western Governors applaud NPS for its efforts to preserve iconic 
landscapes, habitats and cultural resources. Western Governors are 
concerned, however, about the significant maintenance backlog affecting 
National Parks. Western Governors appreciate the funding authorized by 
the Great American Outdoors Act for priority deferred maintenance 
projects administered by Federal land management agencies and support 
ongoing NPS operations to address critical infrastructure needs and 
restore staff capacity.
    Data for water management and drought response planning is critical 
to western States. Western Governors appreciate the increased FY23 
funding for the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program 
administered by the U.S. Geological Survey and request continued 
funding for the program. The data generated by the program is integral 
to water supply management decisions of States, utilities, reservoir 
operators, and farmers. It is also essential for risk management, 
disaster mitigation, and drought and flood forecasting throughout the 
West.
    Infrastructure management is another crucial element of drought 
response, and Federal investments in our Nation's aging water and 
wastewater facilities are essential to our Nation's continued economic 
prosperity and environmental protection. EPA's Clean Water and Drinking 
Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) provide necessary support for 
communities to maintain and enhance their water infrastructure. Western 
Governors' Policy Resolution 2021-10, Water Quality in the West, 
encourages adequate funding for SRFs. Western Governors appreciate the 
SRF appropriations and authorizations included in the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act and FY23 Consolidated Appropriations Act, and 
encourage the subcommittee to continue supporting these programs. 
Western Governors similarly support the funding of Federal programs 
that promote non-federal water infrastructure investment, such as the 
Water Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act program. This important 
program provides flexible long-term, low-cost supplemental credit 
assistance for projects of national and regional significance.
    States have exclusive authority over the allocation and 
administration of rights to groundwater located within their borders 
and are primarily responsible for protecting, managing, and otherwise 
controlling the resource. The regulatory reach of the Federal 
Government was not intended to, and should not, be applied to the 
management and control of groundwater resources. Western Governors 
encourage Congress to include express and unambiguous language 
protecting States' authority over groundwater resources in any water-
related legislation, as well as clear direction to administrative 
agencies to respect such authority. Federal agencies should also work 
within existing State authorities to address their groundwater-related 
needs and concerns. Western Governors urge the subcommittee to ensure 
that Federal efforts involving groundwater recognize and respect state 
primacy and comply with all statutory authorities.
    States also possess delegated authority from EPA to manage air 
quality within their borders. Congress and EPA should recognize state 
authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and accord States sufficient 
flexibility to create air quality and emissions programs tailored to 
individual state needs, industries and economies. State CAA programs 
require financial support from Congress, yet funding has declined since 
the CAA's enactment. In addition, given the unique character of the 
West and the region's attainment challenges, funding should be 
appropriated for EPA to assist western States in research on 
background, interstate, and transported ozone. This is especially 
important as smoke from an increasing number of wildfires causes air 
qualities to exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for 
particulate matter and ozone, affecting public health, safety, and 
transportation. Western Governors' support full and consistent funding 
for Federal and State land managers for prescribed fires when weather 
and site conditions are appropriate and public health is protected.
    Western Governors and Federal land management agencies deal with a 
complex web of interrelated natural resource issues. It is an enormous 
challenge to judiciously balance competing needs in this environment, 
and Western Governors appreciate the difficulty of the decisions this 
subcommittee must make. The foregoing recommendations are offered in a 
spirit of cooperation and respect, and WGA is prepared to assist the 
subcommittee in discharging these critical and challenging 
responsibilities.

         Prepared Statement of the Western Landowners Alliance
    The Western Landowners Alliance (WLA) appreciates the opportunity 
to provide testimony regarding Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) appropriations 
for the Department of Interior. The following programs advance WLA's 
mission of sustaining working lands, connected landscapes and native 
species, and will bring increased support to the landowners, farmers 
and ranchers that form the foundation of rural communities and 
ecosystems in the West. Working lands are the future of conservation in 
the West. They are the last best pieces of intact, fertile, habitable 
open lands. They are the cornerstones of both human communities and the 
ecosystems we all depend on. And they are disappearing. The following 
investments, along with other additional forms of support across all 
levels of government and the private sector, are a necessary down 
payment on our shared economic and ecological future.
                     u.s. fish and wildlife service
    Candidate Conservation: In FY23 Omnibus, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (FWS) received $15,037,000 for conservation and restoration 
activities under the Candidate Conservation budget line item. We 
appreciate Congress recognizing the importance of collaborative, 
partnership-driven and proactive species conservation long before the 
point of a potential Endangered Species Act (ESA) listing. This work 
has been historically underfunded and has often been funneled into 
other listing and consultation work. In explicitly protecting and 
providing these funds for the purpose of proactive work with States, 
private landowners and other partners, Congress has taken a prudent 
step toward addressing the ``emergency room'' type approach that often 
defines conservation under the ESA.
    In the President's FY24 Budget Request, the FWS notes that ``The 
Service will focus on increasing our capacity to work with landowners 
to develop conservation agreements... Additional capacity would allow 
the Service to stand up a specialized team that would simplify and 
accelerate the process for getting Section 10 permits and associated 
candidate conservation plans in place and functioning for working 
lands.'' We support this proposal. ESA Regulatory assurance agreements 
are a critical tool to ensure that landowners are not inadvertently 
burdened with additional regulations or restrictions as a result of 
conducting proactive conservation and habitat restoration efforts. At 
the same time, they are often incredibly complex, time consuming, and 
expensive to develop, putting this tool largely out of reach to the 
majority of landowners.
    At a minimum, maintaining FY23 funding levels for the Candidate 
Conservation line will allow the FWS to continue to work in partnership 
with landowners to improve both the function and accessibility of these 
agreements.
    Livestock Loss Compensation and Non-lethal Conflict Reduction: 
Through the America's Conservation Enhancement Act of 2020 (ACE Act), 
Congress authorized $15 million annually through FY25 for the ``Grant 
Program for Losses of Livestock Due to Depredation by Federally 
Protected Species (Grant Program)'' (7 USC Sec. 8355). The Grant 
Program would provide $10 million annually in grant funding to eligible 
State agencies for the purpose of supplementing existing State 
livestock depredation compensation funding, and $5 million annually for 
the purpose of implementing non-lethal wildlife-livestock conflict 
prevention practices in partnership with producers.
    Given the expanding range of many large carnivores, including 
reintroduction efforts throughout their historic range, the need for 
additional wildlife-livestock conflict prevention work and livestock 
depredation compensation support for producers is rapidly increasing. 
At the same time, Federal funding through the FWS to support this work 
has remained relatively flat ($1 million annually since 2009) and 
nowhere near enough to meet the demand. Recognizing this, Congress 
authorized the Grant Program through the ACE Act.
    This program is bipartisan, widely supported by livestock producers 
and conservation organizations, and much needed in the face of 
expanding conflicts between wildlife and livestock west-wide. With this 
in mind, please see the attached letter addressed to leadership of the 
House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressing support for full 
funding of the Grant Program.
                               conclusion
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on these programs 
that, if funded, will recognize and expand the many societal and 
ecological contributions of working lands stewardship in the West. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.

              Prepared Statement of the Wilderness Society
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony regarding the 
FY24 Senate Interior Appropriations bill and process. On behalf of our 
one million members and supporters, The Wilderness Society (TWS) 
respectfully urges Congress to sufficiently increase funding for the 
Department of the Interior (DOI) and the US Forest Service (USFS). When 
adequately funded, these agencies create jobs, foster climate 
resilience, and manage public lands and natural resources. Funding 
conservation priorities pays environmental and social dividends now and 
for future generations. Investing in these programs, without short-
sighted corner cutting, saves taxpayer money and mitigates costly 
future harms. Proposed caps on discretionary spending at FY22 levels 
would have very real and damaging impacts on Federal agencies, the 
American people, and vital environmental work. Non-defense 
discretionary programs would face cuts of 22%, reducing DOI's budget to 
below FY16 levels.
    Congress should prioritize the following priorities to address 
critical programmatic funding needs in any appropriations package/
legislation:
                    department of the interior (doi)
Abandoned Mine Lands FY24 Request: at least $287 million

    Authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we request at 
least $287 million for the new hardrock Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) 
program. Between FY17-FY21, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
estimated public lands agencies annually spent an average of $24 
million restoring hardrock mining-impacted lands and communities. The 
real funding needs of the program are estimated to be in the billions.
                     bureau of indian affairs (bia)
Tribal Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) FY24 Request: $12 
million

    Tribal Nations and communities continue to highlight barriers to 
accessing LWCF funding for conservation and recreation LWCF projects 
with the existing program requirements to partner with or apply through 
States. To strengthen Tribal land management, the FY24 President's 
Budget requested $12 million in discretionary unobligated LWCF funds 
for BIA to create a new Tribal LWCF land acquisition program. The new 
program would protect and conserve natural resource areas of cultural 
importance or that have significant recreational benefits for Tribal 
Nations and communities. This program would support Tribal sovereignty 
and self-determination and support Tribal co-stewardship.
                    bureau of land management (blm)
Cultural Resources Account FY24 Request: at least $25 million

    We urge the subcommittee to provide at least $25 million (and 
increase of $4.9 million from FY23) for BLM's cultural resources 
management account to help BLM inventory and protect cultural 
resources, manage paleontological resources, and improve government-to-
government consultation with Tribes. We also request the subcommittee 
include $1 million specifically for the National Cultural Resources 
Information Management System (NCRIMS) to support the ongoing 
collaboration with Western state historic preservation officers to 
standardize and integrate cultural resources data for BLM land. 
Finally, we encourage addressing the long-standing vacancies in key 
cultural resources positions stipulated in the BLM Tribal Relations 
Manual, including the National Curator/NAGPRA Coordinator, National 
Tribal Coordinator, and 10 of the 12 State office Tribal Coordinator 
positions.

National Conservation Lands FY24 Request: at least $78 million

    The National Conservation Lands encompass more than 37 million 
acres of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas (NCAs), and 
similar designations, as well as Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas 
(WSAs). While we are grateful for the funding increase from the FY23 
Interior Appropriations bill, further investment is necessary to ensure 
BLM can properly manage this system of critical landscapes, complete 
and implement resource management plans, and rebuild staffing needed to 
do this work. We also recommend robust funding for National Scenic and 
Historic Trails, National Wild and Scenic Rivers, and wilderness areas 
that are part of the National Conservation Lands and funded through 
this account and other areas of the BLM's budget.

Oil and Gas Management and Oversight FY24 Request: $174.5 million, 
including inspection fees

    We support the Administration's request of $174.5 million to 
enhance capacity, perform inspections, and implement the reforms 
enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act while enabling the continued 
permitting of renewable energy rights-of-way. We particularly support 
the agency's proposal to implement inspection fees pursuant to language 
proposed in the FY23 appropriations bill to cover the costs of BLM's 
inspection activities--including approximately 5,800 production 
inspections, 15,000 environmental inspections, and review of financial 
assurances. This would better align the onshore program with the 
offshore program and shift the cost burden of these critical 
inspections from communities to industry.

Renewable Energy Management Program FY24 Request: $72.5 million

    Renewable energy proposals on public lands have increased 
dramatically in recent years. In 2022, BLM established 5 Renewable 
Energy Coordination Offices (RECOs) to process the increasing number of 
wind, solar, and geothermal applications. BLM anticipates a substantial 
need for construction and monitoring of RECOs permitting support 
through 2030 and beyond.
    BLM is working to increase staffing and capacity to prioritize and 
improve permitting coordination on many large-scale renewable energy 
projects. BLM's Renewable Energy Program is critical to advancing the 
Administration's goal to achieve 25 gigawatts of renewable energy on 
public lands by 2025, and the goal of a carbon pollution-free power 
sector by 2035.
                    fish and wildlife service (fws)
National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) FY24 Request: $1.5 
billion for Operations and Maintenance (O&M); $42 million for the 
Conservation Planning Line Item

    The Refuge System is the largest network of public lands and waters 
dedicated to wildlife conservation in the world. However, current 
funding levels are insufficient to hire new biologists, visitor 
services staff, planning staff, law enforcement, and maintenance staff. 
After a decade of underinvestment, inflation, and soaring visitation, 
$1.5 billion is needed for Operations and Maintenance. Within that, we 
request $42 million for the Refuge System Conservation Planning line 
item. In FY23, this line item was only funded at $3.7 million even 
though 40% of refuges lack a current Comprehensive Conservation Plan 
(CCP). CCPs are crucial to achieving the conservation mission of the 
Refuge System, ensuring good governance, and fulfilling the purposes of 
each refuge unit.
                      national park service (nps)
African American Burial Grounds Preservation Program FY24 Request: $3 
million

    Authorized in FY23, the African American Burial Grounds 
Preservation Program provides critical assistance to assistance to 
local partners to identify and preserve historic burial grounds. These 
segregated burial sites often failed to receive the type of maintenance 
and record-keeping that predominantly white burial grounds enjoyed, 
leaving many in a State of disrepair or inaccessibility.

Every Kid Outdoors FY24 Request: $25 million

    Every Kid Outdoors (EKO) provides fourth graders and their families 
with free access to any national park for an entire year, helping 
millions of children build lifelong relationships with their public 
lands. However, the EKO program has never been funded by Congress, 
leaving EKO unable to reach its full potential of reaching all 
families.

Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) Program FY24 Request: $130 
million

    Established by Congress in 2014 and funded through LWCF's State and 
Local Assistance Program, ORLP is a national competitive grant program 
that provides funding to urban communities to create new outdoor 
recreation spaces, reinvigorate existing parks, and forge connections 
between people and the outdoors in economically underserved 
communities.

    Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance (RTCA) Program FY 24 
Request: $15 million
    The RTCA program helps local communities and public land managers 
develop or restore parks, conservation areas, rivers, and wildlife 
habitats. The program bolsters community-led conservation and 
sustainable outdoor recreation projects. Through these projects, NPS 
has collaborated with more than 20,000 partners to create 1.3 million 
acres of parks, build 40,200 miles of trails, and conserve 22,400 miles 
of rivers in all 50 States and territories.

US Forest Service (USFS)

    Capital Improvement and Maintenance--Trails FY24 request: $23 
million
    Recreational trails are the gateway to a wide range of activities 
in the National Forests. Trail use in the National Forests continues to 
grow, and with this growth comes an increase in trail maintenance 
needs. Funding the trails program at this requested level will help to 
address the agency's significant trial maintenance backlog.

    Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) FY24 
request: $80 million

    The CFLRP prioritizes holistic restoration at the landscape scale 
and has a track record of success. Congress should fully fund and 
expand the CFLRP to increase essential science-based forest restoration 
projects on public lands.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) FY24 request: $32.4 million for 
program; $52.9 million for salary and expenses

    The FIA makes up the backbone of scientific knowledge on the 
current state of the Nation's forests. This information is critical to 
support sound policy and forest management decisions, and this 
requested increase reflects the many demands currently being placed on 
the program, despite inadequate resources for implementation.

Joint Fire Sciences Program (JFSP) FY24 request: $50 million

    The JFSP is unique among Federal research programs in its focus on 
applied fire science through interagency partnerships. Fire and land 
managers from the Administration identify, with community and 
collaborator input, the most urgent research needs around fire 
management. The JFSP then competitively solicits the best proposals, 
and research findings are delivered to fire and land managers and 
practitioners through the JFSP-funded Fire Science Exchange Network. 
The JFSP, with only a modest budget, is highly efficient and effective 
at meeting the needs of fire practitioners.

Land Management Planning, Assessment, and Monitoring FY24 request: $50 
million

    About one-third of management plans are over 20 years old and 
cannot provide adequate guidance in the era of climate change and 
unprecedented biodiversity loss. The 2012 planning rule was meant to 
speed up planning, engage communities, provide land designation 
opportunities, promote species recovery, and establish robust 
monitoring programs. Monitoring is essential to enable adaptive 
management in the face of changing conditions, but the National Forests 
System rarely has the funds needed to conduct adequate monitoring. We 
ask Congress to include report language that ensures 25% of planning 
funds is devoted to monitoring.

Legacy Roads and Trails FY24 request: $100 million, including salaries 
and expenses

    The Legacy Roads and Trails program primarily addresses water 
quality problems caused by USFS' extensive road and trail network, 
particularly old logging roads. Decommissioning unneeded roads, 
restoring fish passage, and providing critically needed maintenance to 
system roads and trails is essential to protecting water quality, 
recreational opportunities, and economic benefits in our National 
forests and adjacent communities. Congress should increase funding for 
ecologically beneficial road improvements and decommissioning.

Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness FY24 request: $94.367 million

    National Forests and Grasslands provide a great diversity of 
recreation opportunities, connecting the American public with nature in 
an unmatched variety of settings and activities. Funding at this level 
will give the agency the resources needed to continue providing these 
opportunities.

Research and Development (R&D) Programs FY24 request: $80 million

    Restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems across National Forest 
System lands depends on robust R&D to generate knowledge and 
technologies that will help protect habitat and recover at-risk 
species. We ask that the subcommittee also include report language to 
encourage some of this funding to focus on science foundational to 
strategies to enhance the resilience of old-growth and mature forests 
to climate-induced changes in fire behavior.

Watershed Restoration Action Plans (WRAPs) FY24 request: $50 million

    The Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) identifies and restores 
priority watersheds across National Forest System lands. Congress 
should provide robust funding for the implementation of WRAPs, which 
detail the specific activities needed to improve watershed health and 
drinking water quality as part of the WCF. Increased funding for WRAPs 
would allow watersheds that are degraded or at-risk to be returned to a 
properly functioning condition, while also creating well-paying rural 
jobs.

Water Source Protection Plans (WSPP) FY24 request: $50 million

    The WSPP encourages watershed restoration partnerships between the 
Forest Service and downstream water users. National forests are the 
sources of clean drinking water for one in five Americans, yet the 
Forest Service lacks funding to work effectively with willing partners 
such as water utilities to fund and implement projects that protect 
people's water supplies.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementation

    We ask the Appropriations Committee to provide funding to ensure 
all agencies adequate capacity to conduct environmental reviews under 
NEPA. We know that, despite widespread claims, NEPA is not the reason 
for permitting delays, and a more inclusive and meaningful 
environmental review process can save time, money, and lead to better 
decisions. It is therefore critical that agencies receive adequate 
resources to staff the positions responsible for shepherding the 
environmental review process.
                               conclusion
    TWS thanks the subcommittee for the opportunity to submit comments 
on the FY24 Senate Interior Appropriations bill. We ask the 
subcommittee to sufficiently fund these agencies and exclude anti-
environmental riders in any FY24 appropriations bills.

Sincerely,

Lydia Weiss

        Prepared Statement of the Wildlife Conservation Society
    The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) would like to thank 
Chairman Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, and the members of the 
subcommittee for providing this opportunity to submit testimony in 
support of funding in the FY24 Interior, Environment and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act for the Multinational Species Conservation 
Fund (MSCF), Office of International Affairs (IA), Office of Law 
Enforcement (OLE), and Endangered Species Recovery Grants Program 
accounts at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the International 
Forestry program at the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and the Climate 
Adaptation Science Centers at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
    WCS was founded with the help of Theodore Roosevelt in 1895 with 
the mission of saving wildlife and wild places worldwide. Today, WCS 
manages the largest network of urban wildlife parks in the United 
States, led by our flagship, the Bronx Zoo. Globally, our goal is to 
conserve the world's most important wild places, focusing on 14 
priority regions that are home to more than 50% of the world's 
biodiversity. We have offices and field programs in more than 60 
countries and work with our partners to manage more than 200 million 
acres of protected areas around the world, employing more than 4,000 
staff including about 200 Ph.D. scientists and 100 veterinarians.
    The world faces three existential crises, all caused by humankind: 
a pandemic of zoonotic origin, the loss of biodiversity, climate 
change. These crises are interrelated, with many of the same causes and 
solutions. We know that pandemics of zoonotic origin (passed between 
animals and people) such as COVID-19 are directly tied to wildlife 
trade and the breaching of the human-wildlife interface through 
deforestation and forest degradation. We also know that deforestation 
and forest degradation are major causes of carbon emissions, and that 
more than a third of the answer to climate mitigation can come from 
nature-based solutions. Protected and conserved areas are at the heart: 
they protect biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and prevent future 
pandemics of zoonotic origin. Ecologically intact areas in and between 
protected areas support the well-being of millions, including 
Indigenous Peoples, and are critical to achieving the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals. Additional funding in the FY24 Interior 
appropriations bill for international conservation programs will be 
critical to address these crises and continue U.S. leadership in the 
world.
    FWS-Multinational Species Conservation Fund-$30 Million: Global 
priority species, such as tigers, rhinos, African and Asian elephants, 
great apes, turtles, and tortoises, face constant danger from poaching 
(particularly for illegal trade purposes), habitat loss and 
degradation, and other serious threats. MSCF programs have helped to 
sustain and recover wildlife populations by combating poaching and 
trafficking, reducing human-wildlife conflict, and protecting essential 
habitat-all while promoting U.S. economic and security interests across 
the globe. These programs efficiently use taxpayer dollars, resulting 
in an outsized impact because they consistently leverage two to four 
times as much in matching funds from organizations like WCS, foreign 
governments, local NGOs, and private foundations.
    Funding from the MSCF provides front-line protection against 
zoonotic disease by supporting projects that prevent or reverse the 
conditions that lead to pathogen spillover events. These events 
increase when humans come into closer contact with wildlife through the 
destruction and degradation of wildlife habitats, particularly forests, 
or at live wildlife markets where animals are crowded for sale and 
slaughter. In both situations, wildlife is likely to be severely 
stressed, which further increases the potential for pathogen spillover 
to occur and for human disease outbreaks. Biodiversity loss, in itself, 
can also contribute to zoonotic disease spillover by removing buffer 
species that protect against diseases jumping into human populations.
    WCS has had great success on projects using funds from the MSCF. In 
one ongoing project supported with funding from the Turtle Conservation 
Fund, WCS is working with several partners to restore habitat in 
Indonesia for the Rote Island snake-necked turtle, which is extinct in 
the wild. With this support from FWS, WCS's Bronx Zoo recently sent 36 
zoo-bred to the Singapore Zoo as a major step toward the species' 
reintroduction into the wild.
    FWS-International Affairs-$5.1 Million Increase: The FWS IA program 
supports efforts to conserve our planet's rich wildlife diversity by 
protecting habitat and species, combating illegal wildlife trade, and 
building capacity for landscape-level wildlife conservation. The 
program provides oversight of domestic laws and international treaties 
that promote the conservation of plant and animal species by ensuring 
that international trade and other activities do not threaten their 
survival in the wild. Within IA, the FWS Regional Programs for Africa, 
Eurasia, and the Western Hemisphere seek to address grassroots wildlife 
conservation problems from a broad, landscape perspective, building 
regional expertise and capacity while strengthening local institutions. 
The IA program works with the MSCF, supporting the conservation of 
species that are not specifically addressed by the Fund and funding 
conservation of entire habitats, even in cases where they cross 
political boundaries.
    The President's budget proposes transferring the ePermitting 
program and the requisite funding of $7.5 million from IA, where it is 
currently managed, to its own line in the FWS budget. Because of this, 
the President's request for IA, $26.7 million, represents an actual net 
increase of $5.1 million above FY23. WCS asks that the subcommittee 
support this increase for the program so that IA can continue its 
efforts to conserve landscapes and vulnerable species and better 
address the crises facing the planet.
    In 2022, FWS IA launched the Species Conservation Catalyst Fund 
(SCCF), to serve as a 'conservation accelerator,' focusing on select 
species to fully map and understand threats along the wildlife 
trafficking chain and identify strategic points of intervention. 
Increased appropriations will support this fund to allow FWS IA to 
respond to evolving threats, identify species of greatest concern, and 
launch targeted, high impact projects to reverse the trajectory of 
population declines. The initial round of funding focused on saiga 
antelope and cheetah-two species highly vulnerable to overexploitation 
from illegal wildlife trade. The list of vulnerable species is ever 
increasing, and additional funding is critical for the SCCF to be 
nimble and responsive by adding new species and programs annually.
    The final bills for the last several years included report language 
directing the Department of the Interior to develop policies and 
procedures for the execution and oversight of international 
conservation programs to ensure that grant recipients have policies in 
place that safeguard the rights of Indigenous peoples and the human 
rights of individuals and communities in and around protected areas 
supported by grant monies. WCS worked with the Department and FWS on 
the development of these guidelines and urges the Committee to include 
funding to support their continued implementation and enforcement.
    FWS-Office of Law Enforcement-$104.4 Million: The U.S. remains one 
of the world's largest markets for wildlife and wildlife products, both 
legal and illegal. A small group of dedicated officers at OLE are 
tasked with protecting fish, wildlife, and plant resources by 
investigating wildlife crimes-including commercial exploitation, 
habitat destruction, and industrial hazards-and monitoring 
international trade to intercept illegal products like wildlife and 
timber and facilitate legal commerce. As the United States developed 
and implemented a comprehensive strategy to combat the growing crisis 
of wildlife trafficking over the last several years, most of the new 
responsibilities placed on FWS are enforced by OLE, and WCS supports 
increasing funding to $104.4 million for the agency per the President's 
request. A primary need for additional funding is to strengthen OLE's 
presence at the U.S. border to protect against the importation of 
wildlife that may serve as a host of pathogens that could cause 
dangerous diseases of zoonotic origin.
    Recent increases in the OLE budget have enabled the agency to 
deploy 12 FWS attaches in targeted U.S. embassies overseas in countries 
including Tanzania, Gabon, Peru, China, and Thailand, where wildlife 
trafficking has proven to be a serious problem. Law enforcement 
attaches are experienced criminal investigators who specialize in 
wildlife and natural resource investigations and have provided 
extensive support to local authorities engaged in wildlife trafficking 
investigations. Several investigations of transnational organized crime 
networks involved in the trafficking of elephant ivory, rhino horn, 
reptiles, and other wildlife and wildlife parts between Africa and Asia 
have been initiated as a direct result of attache intervention, and 
attaches have assisted extensively in fostering intelligence sharing 
and investigative support between affected countries.
    FWS-Endangered Species Recovery Challenge Grants-$15 Million: 
Funding provided to the USFWS for recovery efforts of endangered 
species has been limited for decades. And although the Service has 
accomplished some great successes-recovery of the bald eagle and the 
brown pelican, for example-hundreds of species are in desperate need of 
help to prevent extinction. The Recovery Challenge Grants program 
provides matched funds from USFWS to support projects conducted by 
outside partners like zoos and aquariums accredited by the Association 
of Zoos and Aquariums to develop and implement recovery plans and high 
priority recovery actions for endangered species. With limited funding 
for recovery, it is more important than ever to invest Federal funding 
in programs that leverage the significant resources and expertise of 
outside partners to help the USFWS accomplish its objectives in the 
most effective way. Increasing funding for endangered species through 
the Recovery account and the Recovery Challenge Grant program 
specifically would recognize the positive impact this funding has had 
on recovery goals and encourage the continued prioritization of these 
important functions.
    USFS-International Forestry-$22 Million: WCS supports the 
President's request for $22 million for the International Forestry 
program (FS-IP). With estimates ranging broadly from $51 billion to 
$150 billion, the trade in illegal timber threatens the world's 
forests, reduces biodiversity, and severely affects countless local 
communities that rely on forests for food, employment, and wealth. The 
trade also affects the U.S. economy, which has lost approximately $1 
billion per year and over 200,000 jobs due to illegal logging. FS-IP 
works to level the playing field by reducing illegal logging and 
improving the sustainability and legality of timber management 
overseas, translating to less underpriced timber undercutting U.S. 
producers. Through partnerships with USAID and the Department of State, 
FS-IP helps to improve resource management in countries of strategic 
importance to U.S. economic and national security. This work maintains 
biodiversity in important natural strongholds and helps some of the 
world's last intact forests continue to play a key role in sequestering 
carbon, reducing the effects of climate change.
    With technical and financial support from FS-IP, WCS has been 
conserving the biologically rich Southern Forest Complex in the 
southern part of Myanmar. The region comprises tropical rain forests 
inhabiting globally endangered species like Indochinese tiger, Asian 
elephant, and Malayan tapir. Furthermore, about 600 kilometers of 
coastline edged with mangrove forests allows for a considerable variety 
of biodiversity, including marine species such as sea turtles and 
cetacean species such as whales and dugong. In this landscape, WCS 
promotes a participatory approach to landscape level land-use planning 
advocating for the establishment of a Community Based Conservation 
Corridor along the Myintmoletkhet range, supporting local communities 
to conduct biological monitoring surveys within their traditional 
village boundaries, within or around protected areas.
    USGS-Climate Adaptation Science Centers-$87.3 Million: The USGS 
Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs) collaborate with cultural 
and natural resource managers and other stakeholders of public lands to 
develop research, data, and scientific resources to respond to the 
effects of climate variability and change on fish, wildlife, 
ecosystems, and the communities they support. The National CASC manages 
nine Regional CASCs, which serve every State in the Nation and connect 
decision makers to science by educating and conducting actionable 
research to answer common concerns about how climate extremes and 
trends affect human populations, wildlife, forests, grasslands, rivers, 
coastlines, and other natural resources.
    Sea-level rise, changing stream and ocean water temperatures, and 
extreme weather events are causing Federal, State, and local 
governments, businesses, and Indigenous peoples to face new damages and 
incur new costs to prepare for new conditions. As the challenges faced 
by these entities worsen, CASCs are deploying their research, 
education, and outreach capacities to provide science and data to make 
strong decisions. But given accelerating demands, additional resources 
are required to provide the assistance to anticipate and adapt to these 
changing circumstances. Looking to the future, there are opportunities 
for CASCs to: expand strategic partnerships with other government 
offices and agencies, private-sector partners, and community groups to 
increase understanding and implementation of new practices informed by 
sound science; expand CASCs role in generating knowledge and the future 
workforce to build the capacity of DOI managers, and their partners, to 
access and apply climate science; increase development of data and 
research that addresses the increasing informational needs of natural 
and cultural resource managers; and better inform the DOI strategic 
priorities and mission areas with their supporting goals.
    WCS appreciates the opportunity to share its perspective and to 
make a case for modest increases in Federal investments in conservation 
in the FY24 Interior, the Environment and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act. Conservation of public lands is an American 
tradition and, as far back as 1909, Theodore Roosevelt recognized that 
the management of our natural resources requires coordination between 
all nations. Continued investment in conservation will reaffirm our 
global position as a conservation leader, while improving national and 
global security and building capacity and good governance in developing 
countries.

               Prepared Statement of the Wildlife Society
    The Wildlife Society (TWS; wildlife.org) appreciates the 
opportunity to provide testimony concerning the FY 2024 budgets for the 
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), 
and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (USFS). Founded in 1937, TWS 
represents approximately 15,000 wildlife professionals, including 
research scientists, biologists, managers, and students, with a mission 
to inspire, empower, and enable professionals to sustain wildlife 
populations and habitat through science-based management and 
conservation.
    Appropriations for the following programs within the jurisdiction 
of the subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies will 
affect the current and future status of wildlife and wildlife 
professionals in North America. To enable the appropriate use of 
science within these programs and beyond, TWS respectfully requests the 
following programmatic funding in FY 2024.

no-year funding request appropriated until expended

                     u.s. geological survey (usgs)
    Within the Ecosystems Mission Area, the Climate Adaptation Science 
Centers program responds to regional wildlife, ecosystems, and 
community-based stakeholder needs in the face of a changing climate. 
Minor funding increases in recent fiscal years have allowed for 
increased program responsiveness and additional capacity to ensure 
Tribes have proactive opportunities to shape projects and distribution 
of resources. However, funding has not kept pace with identified needs, 
particularly in ensuring USGS has the resources to communicate 
scientific outputs to stakeholders to act on project findings. In FY 
2024, we recommend full implementation of the Administration's 
proposal, with a goal of reaching no less than $87.3 million.
    The Survey-wide National Wildlife Health Center located in Madison, 
WI is the Nation's only Federal BSL-3 facility exclusively dedicated to 
scientific investigation and research on wildlife diseases that 
threaten human, animal, and environmental health. TWS thanks Congress 
for providing $55 million in funding for phase one improvements to the 
National Wildlife Health Center in FY 2021. However, an estimated $135 
million in no-year funding is still required for project completion. 
The Center is making progress on the modernization plans and has 
awarded contracts for the building design and environmental assessment. 
The design is expected to be completed by October 2024, making FY 2024 
appropriations especially timely. Securing the remaining funding in FY 
2024 would be least disruptive option and would minimize the risk of 
rising costs due to inflation. TWS requests the remaining $135 million 
in funding, appropriated until expended, to complete these much-needed 
infrastructure improvements.
    The USGS Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Units (CRUs), which 
fosters federal, state, NGO, and academic partnerships to provide 
actionable science tailored to the needs of natural resource managers, 
plays a pivotal role in the implementation of State and Federal 
management decisions. The support of many State agencies, universities, 
and non-government organizations has allowed the program to be a model 
for cooperative natural resource science programming and leverage an 
average of three dollars in outside funds for every Federal dollar 
invested. The Wildlife Society thanks appropriators for their 
understanding of this need and the associated funding increases 
provided in FY 2023. In the past year, the program was able to 
establish a new unit in the State of Michigan and onboard 37 new unit 
scientists. Additional States have discussed the opportunity to host 
units responsive to their scientific needs, but have been limited by 
available Federal funding. The Wildlife Society requests an increase in 
funding to $34 million in FY 2024, which will allow the CRUs to build 
on these new partnerships and establish units in States that have long 
requested them.
                 u.s. fish and wildlife service (usfws)
    With 850 million acres of lands and waters in every U.S. state and 
territory, the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) plays a key role 
in the conservation of native species and connects Americans to 
recreation opportunities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, and 
environmental education. Unfortunately, the current NWRS Operations and 
Maintenance (O&M) budget is nowhere close to meeting the needs of 
native species and the American public. In order to effectively 
conserve species on NWRS lands and align with the multiuse goals of the 
Refuge System, significant investments in O&M programming are required. 
Conservation planning, a core O&M subactivity that deals with the 
creation of multi-stakeholder Comprehensive Conservation Plans for 
refuge system units, has been chronically underfunded. As a result, 40 
percent of these congressionally mandated plans are either out of date 
or do not exist. In addition to inadequate funding for long-term 
planning, the NWRS has lacked funding to meet their own identified 
needs in bringing diverse audiences into USFWS programming. The Urban 
Wildlife Program, housed under NWRS O&M, seeks to target USFWS 
investments to underserved communities to bolster recreational access 
and conservation outreach. Through the Urban Wildlife Program, and the 
more than 100 refuges located less than 25 miles from a city center, 
NWRS is well-positioned to engage diverse constituencies in the 
conservation of our native species. Unfortunately, NWRS is not able to 
meet these needs given currently available funding. TWS urges Congress 
to consider the significant shortcomings of the operations and 
maintenance accounts of the National Wildlife Refuge System in FY 2024, 
and provide at least $712 million in funding to begin making inroads on 
adequate visitor services, habitat management activities, and long term 
conservation planning.
    The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants Program (STWG) is the Nation's 
only program that encourages development and implementation of State 
Wildlife Action Plans. Collectively, STWG funds support strong 
partnerships among federal, state, Tribal, private, and nonprofit 
entities that enable wildlife professionals to implement on-the-ground 
conservation activities that benefit over 12,000 at-risk species, with 
the goal of eliminating the need to list them under the Endangered 
Species Act. In FY 2010, appropriations were at $90 million for the 
program--allowing States to complete more of the projects deemed 
necessary for monitoring and management of at-risk species. Subsequent 
budget reductions in STWG, however, have not allowed this highly 
successful program to reach its full potential. TWS requests that 
Congress once again work to increase funding for the program to at 
least $100 million annually.
    Through the Ecological Services Program (ESP), USFWS works with 
diverse public and private partners to help identify species facing 
extinction, reduce threats to their populations, and return species 
back to the public trust responsibilities of States and Tribes. 
Wildlife professionals in USFWS are working on new strategies to 
increase efficacy of ESP, though the primary impediment to 
effectiveness remains inadequate funding. To effectively move species 
through all components of the ESA listing and delisting process, TWS 
requests full implementation of the Administration's FY 2024 request of 
no less than $384.5 million for all subactivities.
    States and territories are critical partners in the recovery of 
species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Cooperative 
Endangered Species Conservation Fund serves as a vital tool for States 
and territories to serve as equal partners in implementation of on-the-
ground conservation practices that work towards species recovery. The 
Wildlife Society requests Congress allocate no less than the FY 2023 
USFWS funding level of $25 million to the Cooperative Endangered 
Species Conservation Fund in FY 2024.
    Since 2002, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act (NMBCA) 
has provided more than $80 million in grants to support 686 projects in 
43 countries. These grants have enabled partner entities and wildlife 
professionals to conserve approximately 400 migratory bird species 
across more than 5 million acres. Moreover, NMBCA has achieved a 
partner match ratio of nearly 4:1 despite requiring only a 3:1 match. 
The needs of U.S. migratory bird species and conservation efforts to 
keep these species common extends to landscapes far beyond U.S. 
borders. As a result, TWS recommends Congress increase funding to no 
less than $9.9 million in FY 2024 to achieve greater proactive 
conservation results under the NMBCA program.
    Further promoting USFWS' partnership with non-federal stakeholders 
is the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. This program allows 
voluntary habitat restoration goals, aligned with identified strategic 
priorities, on private lands to be achieved through cost-efficient 
financial and technical assistance. If adequately funded, this program 
has the potential to serve as a vital tool in implementing private land 
conservation efforts and proactively conserving at-risk species prior 
to reaching the point of Endangered Species Act listing. TWS supports 
an increase in Partners for Fish and Wildlife program funding to no 
less than $79.7 million in FY 2024.
    The Migratory Bird Joint Ventures (MBJV), part of USFWS' Migratory 
Bird Management program, are locally-directed partnerships that develop 
and implement science-based habitat conservation strategies for all 
species of birds across North America. These partnerships have 
leveraged Federal funds at 31:1 to enhance and conserve over 27 million 
acres of avian habitat. The MBJV's Urban Bird Treaties grant program 
supports partnerships to conserve birds in urban environments by 
conserving nearby wetlands and creating parks for local communities to 
learn about wildlife. TWS supports $25 million in FY 2024 for the 
Migratory Bird Joint Ventures to enhance and promote the program's 
highly effective and collaborative partnerships.
                    bureau of land management (blm)
    The Wildlife Habitat Management program maintains and restores 
fish, wildlife, and their habitat across a large portion of America's 
western landscapes. This includes projects to balance effects of 
multiple public land uses, such as energy development and livestock 
grazing, with the needs of native species. This program also includes 
management of approximately 300 listed species under the Endangered 
Species Act. TWS recommends Congress support the Wildlife Habitat 
Management program with no less than the Administration request of $162 
million in FY 2024. Within the Wildlife Habitat Management line item, 
TWS also wants to emphasize our support for the Administration's 
request of $2 million in funding for Tribal co-stewardship of lands and 
waters that contain natural resources of significance to Tribal 
nations.
    The Wildlife Society recognizes free-ranging horses and burros in 
the U.S. as ecologically invasive, feral species. Free-ranging, legally 
designated ``wild'', horse and burro populations on BLM lands were 
estimated at over 82,000 individuals in March of last year, only the 
second estimated population decrease in a decade. While TWS has been 
pleased to see the BLM's increased use of gathers and adoptions, 
population estimates still exceed the agency's threshold for ecological 
sustainability by more than 55,000 animals. By the BLM's own estimates, 
it will take hundreds of millions of dollars and several years more to 
reach ecologically sustainable levels. TWS recommends support for the 
BLM in their efforts to employ all the tools at their disposal to 
achieve ecologically sustainable levels. Additionally, TWS requests the 
elimination of an annual appropriations rider limiting sale and/or 
destruction of unwanted or unadoptable horses and burros. This will 
allow for the flexibilities and long-standing protections to herd 
health as outlined in the 1971 Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act 
to be implemented as originally outlined by Congress.

                                 ______
                                 
             Prepared Statement of the World Wildlife Fund
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony on the 
Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) budget. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is one of the 
world's leading conservation organizations, operating in nearly 100 
countries to ensure a future in which both people and nature can thrive 
by helping to conserve our planet's biodiversity and the natural 
resources upon which we all rely. With one million members in the 
United States and over 10 million supporters globally, WWF takes an 
approach that integrates global reach and local impact with a 
scientific foundation, promoting innovative solutions to meet the needs 
of people and nature.
    WWF thanks the subcommittee for its past support of important 
international conservation and law enforcement programs at the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and 
urges continued support for these programs in FY24. U.S. investments in 
these programs are playing a critical role in addressing the 
biodiversity crisis and the loss, degradation, and over-exploitation of 
nature. According to WWF's 2022 Living Planet Report,\1\ population 
sizes of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have declined 
by a shocking 69 percent on average since 1970, primarily due to human 
activities. Conservation investments are some of the clearest and most 
cost-effective solutions to reversing this trend and addressing the 
loss of nature and biodiversity, including through support provided by 
several important programs at the Department of the Interior. WWF 
requests the subcommittee to support funding for the following USFWS 
and USFS accounts at these levels in FY24:

  --$26.7 million for US Fish and Wildlife Service International 
        Affairs;

  --$104.4 million for US Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law 
        Enforcement, including $15 million to implement the 2008 Lacey 
        Act Amendments and prevent illegal timber trade;

  --$22 million for US Forest Service International Programs;

  --WWF also requests that the subcommittee direct $2 million to 
        support the recovery of the endangered black-footed ferret as 
        part of significantly increased funding for the U.S. Fish and 
        Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Ecological Services program.

    Modest investments in global conservation made through agencies 
such as USFWS and USFS have out-sized impact in protecting species and 
habitats in developing countries while supporting local communities, 
fostering stability and sustainable growth, combating transnational 
organized crime, ensuring U.S. competitiveness in global markets, and 
demonstrating U.S. leadership on global challenges. Several recent 
reports, including from the Council for Strategic Risks,\2\ detail that 
nature is in crisis and increasing rates of biodiversity loss globally 
are threatening severe consequences for our societies and economies. We 
must work together to reverse these trends and ensure that economic 
growth and conservation move forward hand-in-hand on a global scale if 
nature is to continue providing the resources that we need. Secure food 
supplies, clean air and water, fertile soils, and well-functioning 
natural ecosystems are the foundation of our health and prosperity and 
powerful antidotes against forces of disruption and discontent that can 
take root in impoverished regions. The conservation of forests and 
other carbon-rich and biodiverse ecosystems--along with the wildlife 
populations they support--is also key to slowing and reversing global 
climate change and preventing spillover of new zoonotic pathogens that 
can cause future pandemics. For these reasons, U.S. investments in 
global conservation should be seen as essential elements of our foreign 
policy, development, and national security agendas and should be 
resourced commensurately.

                multinational species conservation funds
    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Multinational Species Conservation Funds 
are highly successful grant programs that support the conservation of 
rhinos, tigers, great apes, African and Asian elephants, marine and 
freshwater turtles and tortoises, and their habitats. Wildlife 
trafficking and poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict 
threaten these species throughout their ranges. Working with partner 
governments and non-governmental organizations in Africa, Asia, and 
Latin America, these programs provide dedicated support for habitat 
conservation, scientific research and monitoring, wildlife management, 
public education, anti-poaching, and wildlife-based tourism 
opportunities in developing countries. The programs also support 
wildlife health monitoring to detect and prevent transmission of 
wildlife-borne diseases, including Ebola among great ape populations in 
Central Africa. Since 1989, MSCF programs have awarded over 4,500 
grants totaling $330 million, leveraging over $475 million in matching 
contributions from partners. Conservation needs continue to surpass 
available funding for these programs, which were reauthorized by 
Congress in 2019 and have consistently garnered significant constituent 
interest and received strong bipartisan support. For these reasons, WWF 
requests that the MSCF be fully funded at its authorized level of $30 
million in FY24, an increase of $9 million over the FY23 enacted level 
and $8 million over the President's Budget Request.
                      usfws international affairs
    The USFWS International Affairs (IA) division supports 
international efforts to protect species and their habitat, prevent 
wildlife trafficking and human-wildlife conflict, and build 
conservation capacity in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin 
America, including at a regional scale. The program supports efforts to 
train wildlife conservation professionals in these regions and works 
with governmental and nongovernmental entities to provide technical and 
financial assistance to improve wildlife management and conservation of 
endangered species, prevent poaching and wildlife trafficking, reduce 
demand for illegal wildlife products, and the detection and monitoring 
of zoonotic diseases to prevent their transmission, spillover, and 
spread, including to human populations. USFWS-IA also supports efforts 
to protect critically endangered species that are not specifically 
covered by the Multinational Species Conservation Funds and is 
responsible for implementing the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES), including related permitting, and other 
laws to address wildlife trade and trafficking, such as the END 
Wildlife Trafficking Act, which was reauthorized by Congress in 2022. 
Increased funding will support global efforts to prevent the spillover 
of zoonotic diseases to humans due to high-risk wildlife trade and 
other human-wildlife interactions, to upgrade technological systems, 
including those supporting USFWS permitting processes, and to provide 
resources needed to implement congressional directives on enhanced 
safeguards for these programs, given the often challenging places and 
social conditions in which they operate. The President's FY24 budget 
proposes transferring the ePermitting program and the requisite funding 
of $7.5 million out of International Affairs, where it is currently 
managed, over to its own line in the FWS budget. Because of this, the 
President's request of $26.7 million for USFWS-IA represents an actual 
net increase of $5.1 million above FY23. WWF requests that the 
subcommittee support the President's requested increase for the USFWS 
International Affairs program and fund it at $26.7 million in FY24.
                    usfws office of law enforcement
    USFWS Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) is central to combatting the 
illegal trade in natural resources, investigating wildlife crimes, 
enforcing wildlife trade and trafficking laws, and implementing the 
2008 Lacey Act amendments that prohibit trade in illegal plant and 
timber products, with OLE inspectors working in nearly 40 ports of 
entry in the US and internationally. Wildlife trafficking is a 
transnational organized crime that generates up to $23 billion annually 
in illicit profits while driving elephants, rhinos, and tigers and 
other trafficked species towards extinction. It also helps finance 
criminal syndicates and armed groups, including some with ties to 
terrorist activities, while increasing corruption and undermining rule 
of law in developing countries. Trafficking and unregulated trade in 
species that can transmit dangerous zoonotic pathogens also heightens 
the risk of zoonotic spillover that can lead to future pandemics. OLE 
works with law enforcement in developing countries and via broader 
regional efforts to improve wildlife crime investigations and 
enforcement and coordinate anti-trafficking operations across multiple 
countries and regions, which have disrupted global wildlife trafficking 
networks and resulted in large-scale seizures of illegal wildlife 
shipments and the arrest, prosecution, and sentencing of major wildlife 
traffickers. USFWS has been able to provide significant support to 
these activities through the stationing of law enforcement attaches in 
strategic countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Additional 
funding is needed to increase the number of OLE personnel playing this 
role in more countries as well as dedicated staff support to enhance 
investigative capacity and intelligence capabilities, such as the 
ability to make use of big data analytics and to address the growth in 
online wildlife trafficking. Increased resources will also allow OLE to 
fulfill its mandate to enforce the Lacey Act amendments of 2008. The 
harvesting and sale of illegal wood products from other countries has a 
major impact on the U.S. forestry sector through lost revenues and 
wages due to competition from these illegal products, including those 
imported and sold in the U.S. These illegal activities are estimated to 
cost the U.S. forestry sector as much as $1 billion annually.\3\ 
Illegal timber trade is also a major driver of global deforestation, 
which exacerbates both climate change and the spillover of zoonotic 
diseases. In order to meet existing mandates and expand OLE's capacity 
in these areas, WWF requests $104.4 million for the USFWS Office of Law 
Enforcement in FY24, an increase of $12.3 million over the FY23 enacted 
level and level with the President's Budget Request. WWF also requests 
that $15 million of this amount be directed specifically towards 
implementing the 2008 Lacey Act amendments and efforts to prevent 
illegal timber trade.

              usfws black-footed ferret recovery programs
    One of North America's most endangered mammals, the black-footed 
ferret was saved from extinction in the 20th century through captive 
breeding, population reintroductions, habitat protection, and disease 
mitigation. Once found throughout the North American Great Plains and 
intermountain west, ferret populations declined dramatically with 
widespread poisoning of prairie dogs (their primary prey) and the 
arrival of a non-native disease--sylvatic plague--in the early 1900s. 
Currently, a total of only 316 individuals exist in 15 populations in 
eight Western States. Recovering the species will require mitigating 
sylvatic plague, supporting land managers willing to host populations, 
and securing additional ferret reintroduction sites on private, public, 
and Tribal lands. Currently, no dedicated Federal funding exists to 
maintain black-footed ferrets in the wild. WWF requests $2 million 
specifically to support black-footed ferret recovery as part of 
increased funding for the USFWS Ecological Services program.
                us forest service international programs
    Through its International Programs, the US Forest Service works to 
help partner countries improve forest management, including through 
provision of technical assistance on timber tracking technologies, 
harvesting techniques that reduce ecological impact, and forest 
certification regimes. By promoting legal and sustainable global trade 
in timber and other forest products, they help ensure a level playing 
field for sustainable wood products and producers. The programs also 
help to combat invasive species and conserve habitat for migratory 
species, such as monarch butterflies, and have supported conservation 
of tigers and other iconic species by reducing pressure on their forest 
habitats. By helping to stop deforestation, these programs also 
contribute to efforts to slow climate change and prevent the spillover 
of zoonotic diseases from wildlife to people. WWF requests $22 million 
for US Forest Service International Programs in FY2024, level with the 
President's Budget Request.
