 STATEMENT OF HON. TINA SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                           MINNESOTA

    Senator Smith. The Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk 
Management, and Trade will come to order. Welcome to our 
witnesses. Senator Hyde-Smith, thank you again to you and your 
staff for working so closely together with us to organize this 
hearing all this week, and I know that Chair Stabenow and 
Ranking Member Boozman will be joining us at some point. I want 
to thank them and the full Committee staff for their help and 
support in convening these committee hearings this week. Thanks 
to everyone for attending.
    This morning we conclude our two-part hearing. Earlier this 
week we focused on Title I of the farm bill, the commodity 
title, and we had a very useful and productive discussion with 
producers and farmers, as well as with the presidents of the 
American Farm Bureau and the National Farmers Union. Today we 
will be talking about Title X, the credit title, and Title XI, 
the crop insurance title. We are going to have an opportunity 
to hear directly from practitioners and implementers of crop 
insurance and Farm Credit programs.
    As I mentioned earlier this week, hearing directly from you 
is incredibly important, as the folks that are closest to the 
work you know best what is working and what we can do to make 
it work better. I know that all the members of this Committee 
share the goal of passing a bipartisan farm bill authorization 
this year, a bill that meets the needs of American farmers and 
ranchers and producers in every part of the country and a bill 
that meets the moment.
    Farmers, ranchers, dairy farmers, poultry and livestock 
producers are at the center of our economy, our food system, 
and our national security. There is nothing more important to 
our country than a stable, secure, healthy food supply, and we 
need to support farmers with credit and risk management tools 
that help them weather the inevitable ups and downs that happen 
in agriculture.
    Today, although commodity prices are good, farmers face a 
lot of challenges. Too many producers are struggling to cover 
their operating costs, and this is especially true for small 
and medium-sized farms. According to the USDA, nearly 50 
percent of farms in the United States have negative farm 
income. The high levels of concentration in the ag sector, 
combined with supply chain disruptions has driven up input 
costs, which are now outpacing commodity prices and putting 
farmers, again especially small and medium-sized farmers, in a 
real bind.
    Climate change and extreme weather events are increasing 
risks for farmers as well, as they deal with drought and floods 
and wind and hail and also increased pest threats. Last of all, 
global disruptions, both wars and trade disputes, add to the 
uncertainty.
    Farmers are creative and adaptable, but they need access to 
credit to grow their operations, and they need sound risk 
management options to help mitigate the losses that are out of 
their control. Credit and crop insurance programs are essential 
all across the country, and in my home State of Minnesota. Last 
year, Minnesota farmers insured 17.8 million acres and 
participated in many of RMA pilot programs and dollar liability 
programs.
    Over the last year, my staff and I have held, it feels like 
dozens, of farm bill listening sessions across the State, and 
we have heard from everyone that crop insurance needs to be 
there to help secure operating loans as well as when there is 
some other kind of risk that they are facing. We have also 
heard that there are sometimes gaps, that not all risk 
management programs are working well for smaller operations and 
specialty crop farmers, especially produce farmers. Some 
programs are sometimes hard to use, and a tweak here or there 
could really help.
    And when it comes to accessing credit through Farm Credit 
institutions or community banks, smaller operations, beginning 
farmers, farmers of color, and Indigenous farmers often 
struggle to find a way to access that opportunity.
    That is what this hearing is all about. It is an 
opportunity for this subcommittee to hear directly from you 
about what is working, what is not working, and what we need to 
do to improve insurance and credit programs.
    There are a few issues, in particular, that I am interested 
in hearing about today. I am going to ask you what are your top 
one or two priorities for the farm bill's credit title or crop 
insurance title. I am interested to hear you talk about what we 
can do to make risk management and credit programs work for 
beginning farmers, smaller producers, and non-traditional 
producers. I would like to hear your perspective on how 
consolidation in agriculture, from everything from seed and 
fertilizer to processing, affects the farmers that you are 
working with.
    I really look forward to hearing from all of you about 
these issues and more, and I look forward to a productive 
discussion.
    I now turn to Senator Hyde-Smith.

STATEMENT OF HON. CINDY HYDE-SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
                         OF MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Well said. I could not agree more. Good 
morning and thank you also for holding this very important 
hearing today. I want to thank Senator Boozman, our Ranking 
Member, for your interest in the Subcommittee, and I think we 
will be joined by Senator Stabenow as well.
    I am pleased that we are meeting again to continue the 
hearing from stakeholders about their priorities for the 2023 
Farm Bill. When people have asked me about the farm bill I have 
said, ``Well, we flip the coin. The games have not begun yet,'' 
but now they have. We are at a different stage. It is clear 
from the producer input we received on Tuesday, that Title I 
and Title XI of the farm bill need to be protected and 
strengthened.
    Today we will hear more about the importance of crop 
insurance. Additionally, we will hear about access to credit, 
which I say all the time is what makes the world go round in 
our farming world. The private sector is the cornerstone in the 
delivery system of crucial risk management tools and credit 
options. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses who will 
play vital roles in the private sector helps farmers access 
these tools.
    I would also like to extend an especially warm welcome to 
our two Mississippians here today, Mr. Phillip Morgan of 
Ridgeland, and Mr. William Cole of Batesville.
    Agriculture is the largest industry in Mississippi, and 
every American, whether they know it or not, has a vested 
interest in agriculture because every American has to eat, the 
last time I checked. Farmers face many challenges in managing 
risk and securing credit. As we heard from our producers on 
Tuesday, market fluctuations and rising input costs have 
significantly affected the ability to run a business and to 
stay afloat.
    With transportation and logistics systems disrupted by 
recent global crises, farmers and ranchers have faced a number 
of challenges in getting our products to market. This has 
resulted in significant losses for many agriculture producers 
who have been unable to sell their products or are forced to 
sell them at a reduced price.
    Another challenge has been labor shortages. Boy, I hear 
this from everyone. With many people unable or unwilling to 
work, agriculture producers have been left without the 
necessary labor to plant, harvest, and process their crops. 
This has resulted in significant losses for many farmers, and 
this is very real, as they have been unable to get their crops 
to market or forced to pay significantly higher wages to 
attract workers.
    All of these challenges have highlighted the importance of 
risk management and credit in the agriculture industry. With 
increased uncertainty and volatility in the marketplace, we 
must ensure our farmers and ranchers have access to the 
necessary tools and resources to manage these risks 
effectively.
    Similarly, in light of inflation, it is more important than 
ever for agriculture producers to have access to affordable and 
flexible credit options. Farming is a risky business, 
especially in Mississippi. Mississippi farmers are faced with 
floods, tornados, and some of the worst weed and pest threats 
in the entire country. This is why risk management is so 
essential.
    When I talk to Mississippi farmers, I am always inspired by 
their resilience. Farming is not just a job for us. It is our 
way of life. They want to produce more affordable food and 
fiber for our country now and be able to pass down their way of 
life to the next generation. Farmers have to borrow a lot of 
money. They lose sleep at night, thinking about the debts they 
incur to start or continue farming. In order for the American 
food supply to remain abundant and for the farmers to stay in 
business, credit must be accessible and it must be flexible as 
well.
    In order for more young people to start farming, they must 
have access to credit. As this Committee considers the 2023 
Farm Bill, we must remain mindful of the needs of the next 
generation, not just ourselves.
    Our witnesses will provide valuable insight into the 
challenges and opportunities ahead for our agriculture 
producers and the industry professionals who support them.
    Thank you again, Chairwoman Smith, for convening this 
hearing. I look forward to a productive discussion on how we 
can work together to ensure that the livelihood of the American 
farmer remains viable in the face of these challenges and 
opportunities.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Senator Hyde-Smith, and I 
would like to welcome to the Subcommittee our Chair, Senator 
Stabenow, and also our Ranking Member, Senator Boozman. Thank 
you so much for joining us.
    And we will now begin with witness introductions, and I 
believe that Senator Ernst is going to be introducing Mr. 
Barker, your fellow Iowan.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, and I want to welcome all of our 
witnesses today, but I have the honor and privilege of 
introducing Mr. Gus Barker, Verlin ``Gus'' Barker. Gus serves 
as President and Chief Executive Officer of First Community 
Bank in Rockwell City, Pomeroy, Fonda, and Newell. Gus also 
serves as Chairman of the Independent Community Bankers of 
America's Rural America and Agriculture Committee, which 
represents community bankers serving rural America and 
agriculture across the Nation.
    Over the years, Gus has been active with numerous civic and 
charitable organizations. Gus grew up on a family farm in 
northwest Iowa, just south of Pomeroy, and graduated from 
Pomeroy Community High School. He went on to get his B.A. in 
accounting from Buena Vista University and graduated from the 
Graduate School of Banking in Madison, Wisconsin.
    Mr. Barker is a career banker with over 46 years of 
experience. As a survivor of the 1980's ag crisis, Gus has 
experienced the ups and downs of agriculture's cyclic nature 
firsthand. He has worked tirelessly to maintain that sacred 
trust between the bank and the customer, no matter what the 
economic conditions are at the time.
    Gus's passion for community banking is staunchly evident as 
he has consistently sought to defend the importance of 
preserving the community bank model.
    Thank you, Gus, for being with us today.

    Mr. Barker, you are recognized for your opening statement.

  STATEMENT OF GUS BARKER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FIRST COMMUNITY 
                       BANK, NEWELL, IA,

TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BANKERS OF AMERICA
    Mr. Barker. Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, 
and distinguished members, as Senators Ernst and Grassley know, 
Iowa's 86,000 family farms average 350 acres. Those over 
$250,000 in sales average 1,000 acres. In Iowa we are the 
largest producer of corn, pork, eggs, ethanol, and biodiesel, 
and we are second largest in soybeans.
    Today ICBA's key principles include a well-funded safety 
net and crop insurance program; we want to enhance USDA 
guaranteed loan programs; and we would like to reject the Farm 
Credit System's proposals to engage in non-farm lending.
    Crop insurance is essential for farmers and lenders as it 
allows producers to qualify for operating loans. With extremely 
tight margins and incredible risk in agriculture, bank 
regulators insist borrowers have crop insurance to repay their 
loans. Insurance payments may not be large enough to make farms 
whole, but they are enough to keep farmers intact to survive 
another year. That is why community banks say whatever you do, 
do not harm crop insurance.
    Regarding USDA loans, farmland in my area sells for an 
average of $12,000 an acre. A 1,000-acre farm costs $12 
million. A 350-acre farm costs over $4 million, which is twice 
what a USDA loan provides. We urge Congress to raise the 
guaranteed real eState loan limits to $3.5 million on owning, 
and guaranteed operating loans to $3 million, indexed to 
inflation.
    Now can guaranteed loans help farmers, particularly young, 
beginning farmers? We worked with a struggling young family 
using a guaranteed loan to restructure their debt. Since the 
guarantee we have had two exams, and examiners could not 
believe the progress this struggling farm made. They are now 
one of our strongest customers, and without that USDA guarantee 
and our local USDA officer, that family would likely not have 
survived.
    Today, on behalf of ICBA, I am excited to propose a new 
program to speed up loan approvals with USDA called a ``USDA 
Express'' program, modeled after the SBA's Express program, 
which has worked very well. A 50 to 75 percent guarantee could 
be used instead of USDA's 90 percent, but USDA would approve 
the loans within 36 hours, because lenders would make the 
credit decision, and loans could total a cap of $1 million.
    Finally, we urge Congress not to expand the powers of the 
Farm Credit System by sidestepping their regulators' case-by-
case approval and open the floodgate to making essential 
community facility loans. USDA defines community facilities as 
a public improvement operated on a nonprofit basis, but FCS 
seeks to loan to facilities, whether operated on a nonprofit or 
for-profit basis. These loans could be fire stations, schools, 
health care facilities, housing, apartment complexes, 
restaurants, sports facilities, stadiums, gas stations, and 
more. This broad authority could drive community banks right 
off Main Street.
    FCS proposal only requires a single non-FCS lender to 
participate. That could be a large megabank or a large credit 
union implementing a national program with no local bank 
involvement. An Illinois banker commented the past three years 
their bank funded the school district for buses, hospital for 
infrastructure, Economic Development Corporation for building a 
daycare facility for 185 kids. They used leading arrangements, 
USDA Rural Development guarantees, local financial 
institutions, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines. 
These funding sources, plus the municipal bond market, were 
fully sufficient to fund all of those projects.
    A Virginia banker Stated, ``Community banks fund these 
projects. The bank loaned to every single community facility in 
the area. The community facility's lending space is full of 
lenders who step up, in a bid process, typically, to finance 
these projects daily across the United States.'' Now will FCS 
pay taxes on these loans, as the bank community does?
    FCS also is aggressively using tax-advantaged, cash 
management accounts to undermine the deposit base of community 
banks. Driving community banks out of rural America by 
leveraging GSE tax and funding privileges, decimating loan 
portfolios, and pilfering customers and deposits is akin to 
taking a wrecking ball to the economic vitality of our small, 
rural communities.
    Thank you.

   STATEMENT OF PHILLIP D. MORGAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 
                SOUTHERN AGCREDIT, RIDGELAND, MS

TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE FARM CREDIT COUNCIL
    Mr. Morgan. Thank you. Madam Chair, Ranking Member Hyde-
Smith, and other distinguished members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for your hearing this morning. My name is Phillip 
Morgan. I am the President and Chief Executive Officer of 
Southern AgCredit, based in Ridgeland, Mississippi.
    Southern AgCredit provides financing and other services to 
over 4,200 farmers, ranchers, and rural home buyers in 50 
central and southern Mississippi counties and 11 parishes in 
northwest Louisiana. Southern AgCredit is a member of the Farm 
Credit System, created by Congress in 1916, and charged with a 
mission to support rural communities and agriculture with 
reliable, consistent credit and financial services, today and 
tomorrow.
    As a cooperative, we are owned by our customers and exist 
to support their farms and ranches. As the owners, our 
customers share in the success of their cooperative. Last year, 
Southern AgCredit returned a record $11.9 million in cash 
patronage dividends to our customer owners. In the past five 
years, Southern AgCredit returned $53.5 million in cash 
patronage dividends to its customers. The remainder of our 
income was retained as capital in the co-op to support more 
lending to customers.
    The future of American agriculture and rural areas depends 
on a new generation of farmers and ranchers. We are committed 
to meeting the needs of young, beginning, and small farmers. 
Our years of experience in rural lending provide the expertise 
needed to finance young, beginning, and small farmers. Through 
flexible loan terms and working closely with other 
organizations and government agencies, including USDA's Farm 
Service Agency, we tailor loans to fit the unique situation of 
these producers.
    Last year, 23 percent of the loans made by Southern 
AgCredit went to young farmers and ranchers, 61 percent went to 
beginning farmers and ranchers, 75 percent went to small 
farmers and ranchers. Overall, 59 percent of our loans 
outstanding are to beginning farmers.
    The future of agriculture requires a diverse set of voices 
leading our industry. We are proud to partner and provide 
scholarships to Alcorn State University and Jackson State 
University, two historically Black colleges and universities in 
our area. Scholarships are offered to full-time HBCU students 
studying agriculture, business, or a combination of both.
    Southern AgCredit recently hosted two summer interns from 
Alcorn State as part of the Farm Credit's Launching Leaders 
program. In addition to their regular wages, Farm Credit awards 
a $3,500 stipend to an HBCU student or recent graduate hired to 
intern at a Farm Credit institution. Our goal is to attract 
more HBCU students interested in careers in the agriculture 
industry.
    Presently, farmers and ranchers in our area face elevated 
operating costs in all commodities. Inflated expense from seed, 
fertilizer, fuel, feed, technology, equipment, interest, and 
energy are tightening margins for our producers. A shortage of 
available workers also continues to create farm wage inflation.
    Agriculture producers in Mississippi and Louisiana need a 
strong farm bill, including a robust farm safety net to manage 
the ongoing risks presented by weather, markets, supply chain 
pressure, rising input prices, and declining profit margins.
    Crop insurance remains the key part of the farm safety net, 
and we strongly support efforts to improve this program.
    Livestock Risk Protection for Feeder Cattle is a USDA 
insurance program widely used in our area for the protection of 
declining cattle market prices.
    We work closely with the Farm Service Agency and its loan 
guarantee program. These guarantees help us to work with 
customers who face difficulties with their operations and 
provide an opportunity for young and beginning farmers. FSA 
loan limits have not kept pace with current prices. We strongly 
support increasing these limits in the 2023 Farm Bill.
    The construction cost of a modern poultry house in 
Mississippi and Louisiana is up 37.5 percent from those built 
three years ago. Today's young and beginning poultry farming 
family would need at least six poultry houses to earn a $75,000 
annual living. Six poultry houses have a total price tag of 
$3.3 million, not including the cost of the land or other 
necessary improvements or equipment. FSA guarantee limits are 
less than two-thirds of the capital requirement for this size 
poultry farm. Young, beginning farmers almost always require an 
FSA guarantee to mitigate credit risks.
    Important credit-related recommendations are detailed in my 
written statement for the Subcommittee to consider as it 
reviews the farm bill's credit title.
    Thank you very much, Madam Chair and Ranking Member Hyde-
Smith, for allowing me to testify today.

    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Mr. Morgan.
    Mr. Wagner.

STATEMENT OF JASE WAGNER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, COMPEER FINANCIAL, 
                        SUN PRAIRIE, WI,

TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE FARM CREDIT COUNCIL
    Mr. Wagner. Good morning, Madam Chair and members of the 
Subcommittee. The good news is there is a lot going on 
positively in rural America today. I would like to use this 
time to talk about how we make it even better.
    Our vision is to help enrich ag and rural America through 
teamwork and action. My name is Jase Wagner. I am the Chief 
Executive Officer of Compeer Financial. Compeer is a member of 
the Farm Credit System. We provide loans, leases, and other 
financing products as well as crop insurance and financial 
services, primarily in the Midwest. We are farmer led and 
farmer owned.
    Today's hearing offers a timely look at risk management 
products and credit availability in agriculture as Congress 
prepares for a farm bill. Let's start with the positives and 
then we can talk about ways to improve our actions.
    First, Federal risk management programs are well-suited to 
their purpose. Our crop and livestock insurance programs are 
inclusive and consistent. They create stability and certainty 
in an uncertain world. Good risk management equals good access 
to credit. Those two are inextricably linked. We should 
strongly support continuation of the crop insurance programs, 
but as my wife tells me often, ``You are not perfect.'' Many on 
this panel will have great ideas. Let's use them.
    Another positive is access to capital for underserved 
communities. This is expanding quickly. We cited several 
examples in our written testimony, and they include significant 
investment into underserved communities and young, beginning 
farmers by Compeer and others in the ag lending market. 
Additional teamwork and ideas are needed to best support these 
sets of clients.
    Now let's talk about the opportunities to further enrich ag 
in rural America. Credit is available across a wide spectrum of 
providers--public programs like USDA and FSA, State programs, 
private providers like community banks, Farm Credit, Farmer 
Mac, and insurance providers--and also non-traditional 
providers like ag retailers, investment funds, and other 
participants. Together these providers, along with the Senate 
Ag Committee, are part of the rural capital team. This is an 
essential team to best support agriculture long term. Together 
we can help America thrive.
    Access to traditional agriculture credit is stable, but it 
is still full of holes. Too many of our young and underserved 
farmers fall through the gaps before they can become stable, 
long-term farmers. Traditional ag credit is plentiful for 
traditional, well-served farmers. Young and beginning need more 
help.
    FSA loan programs are effective but need to be updated and 
streamlined to best support producers, and in particular, 
small, young, and beginning farmers whose needs and financial 
structures are changing. Succession planning is a real issue. 
We need FSA to be adaptable to that issue.
    Serving in the traditional ag market is a team sport. All 
of us on this panel contributed in some way. Public and private 
partnerships, as well as private-to-private partnerships 
demonstrate what is possible when the rural capital team works 
together.
    If we take a broader view and look at a broader credit 
availability across the country, beyond senior debt we have 
rural business investment companies. They provide equity 
capital to small businesses. They are an essential part. Fast 
Ag, based in Windom, Minnesota, is an RBIC junior capital 
recipient, who has grown to over 50 full-time employees and 
distributes products globally. Midwest Ag, an RBIC, partners 
closely with CEO and owner, Cody Fast. Cody could not 
accomplish his goals with the support of RBICs. Let us continue 
to build on that success and break down artificial barriers to 
help that happen.
    As we talk with ag producers and people like Cody, the pain 
points they tell us about, beyond inflation and capital, are 
finding a work force, basic health care availability, and the 
ability to earn off-farm income for other members of the 
family. Senator Smith highlighted those in her statement. 
Essential community facilities provide basic health care, 
public safety, and daycare to help solve these problems. Our 
research suggests the need for capital in this area is bigger 
than the existing private and public capital available today.
    Notably, several members of the rural capital team are not 
present or engaged. We believe creating further access to this 
capital through clarification of existing authorities can help 
create the partnerships that have proven so helpful in ag. 
Let's work on this together. When we do it right, everybody 
wins.
    More generally, breaking down artificial barriers to 
capital should be a goal of the Committee. We see examples of 
that from this Committee across the work that you are doing in 
the bills that you are introducing. We support those. Compeer 
is invested in ag and rural America, and we know you are, too. 
Please take action, and together we can further enrich ag and 
rural America which supports our clients and all members of the 
rural capital team.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner.
    Mr. Cole.

   STATEMENT OF WILLIAM COLE, OWNER AND AGENT, COLE AGENCY, 
                        BATESVILLE, MS,

TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CROP INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS ASSOCIATION AS 
            CHAIRMAN
    Mr. Cole. Thank you, Chairwoman Smith and Ranking Member 
Hyde-Smith, for the opportunity to testify before this 
Subcommittee today. My name is William Cole. I am a crop 
insurance agent from Batesville, Mississippi, and my family and 
I grow corn and soybeans and have a small cow-calf operation.
    I serve as the Chairman of the Crop Insurance Professionals 
Association, or CIPA. It is an association of premier crop 
insurance agents wring policies all over the country. As 
agents, we are very proud to be the primary financial advisors 
of our farmer and rancher customers. We not only advise farm 
and ranch families on crop insurance coverage options tailored 
to their individual operations, but we run a full suite of USDA 
programs including the commodity title choices ad hoc programs 
along with private risk management products, including wind and 
hail coverage.
    Though we are not compensated for services beyond advising 
on crop insurance, we go beyond our mission area to help our 
producers because we love agriculture, care about our American 
farmer and rancher customers. They are what Federal crop 
insurance, and we, as agents, are all about.
    The stakes today for agriculture could not be higher. In 
recent years, farm and ranch families have had to weather 
retaliatory Chinese terrorists, pandemic impacts on supply 
chains and markets, a string of severe and often chronic 
natural disasters, and high inflation and other factors driving 
up costs of production.
    Through all of them, Federal crop insurance has been not 
only the cornerstone of the farm safety net but arguably the 
only safety net for producers, given that the commodity title 
has really lost its relevance to producers because support 
levels are set based on 2012 costs of production, and so much 
has changed in 12 years. I believe that farmers and ranchers 
are truly grateful that the farm bill discussions have focused 
substantially on strengthening the safety net that undergirds 
the whole agricultural economy.
    Relative to crop insurance, I think it is extremely 
important to note that the coverage does not just help farmers 
recover after a natural disaster. It means so much more than 
that. Yes, indemnities are a measure of support, but the 
biggest value to crop insurance is the $200 million liability 
protection that is in force. This is the element of crop 
insurance that allows farmers and ranchers to obtain credit, 
invest in their operations, to better market their crops, and 
to avoid the kind of asset base ending that contributed to the 
1980's farm financial crisis. Imagine a world you live in 
without something as basic as insurance, and that is where farm 
and ranch families would be without Federal crop insurance. As 
vital as crop insurance is to farmers and ranchers, I submit 
that it is also good for the taxpayer. Farmers and ranchers 
have real skin in the game, paying some $6.7 billion in 
premiums alone last year.
    As you begin the important work of crafting the 2023 Farm 
Bill, we would respectfully suggest ways to strengthen the 
safety net in ways that are both meaningful to producers and 
taxpayers. First, let us work to narrow the deductibles that 
farmers and ranchers face to increase participation at higher 
levels to avoid ad hoc disaster programs.
    Second, surge RMA, private sector developers, and producer 
groups to work in a concerted way to use current legal 
authorities, including R&D and the 508(h) submission process, 
to help ensure that crop insurance works effectively for all 
producers, regions, and commodities. This, too, will help avoid 
expensive ad hoc programs.
    Finally, let us correct the serious and unsustainable flaws 
in our A&O system to ensure that agents and loss adjusters can 
continue to provide the excellent service that is one of the 
core pillars of Federal crop insurance.
    As Congress noted in the Omnibus Bill last fall, USDA has 
the legal authority to provide annual inflation adjustment and 
equitable relief for specialty crop policies without opening 
the SRA, and the Department must exercise this authority. From 
1938 to 1980, crop insurance struggled, but in 1980, when crop 
insurance was turned over to the private sector, it began to 
take off and became the vital program to farmers and ranchers 
that it is today. Fixing this A&O issue is critically important 
for the infrastructure, companies, adjusters, and agents that 
will support this vital program to meet the needs of the 
producers in the future.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you 
today. I cover more issues in greater detail in my written 
testimony, and I am certainly happy to answer all of your 
questions on these issues. On behalf of CIPA, we are grateful 
for all that you do for the hardworking ranch and farm families 
across this country who feed, clothe, fuel the Nation and so 
much of the world in a manner that is truly unrivaled in 
history. Thank you.

  STATEMENT OF JAMES KORIN, PRESIDENT, NAU COUNTRY INSURANCE, 
                          RAMSEY, MN,

TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CROP INSURERS
    Mr. Korin. Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, 
also Chairwoman Stabenow and the members of the Subcommittee on 
Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on Federal crop insurance and the vital 
role it plays in America today.
    My name is James Korin. I am the President of NAU Country 
Insurance Company, insuring nearly $45 billion of liability on 
behalf of America's farmers and ranchers. I am speaking today 
on behalf of my company and the American Association of Crop 
Insurers, a trade association with membership that includes 
companies, agents, reinsurers, and others involved in the 
marketing and servicing of Federal crop insurance.
    I am truly honored to be here today, and I am thankful for 
the support you have provided America's farm and ranch 
families, and in turn the rural communities in which they live. 
Without crop insurance, many rural communities across our great 
nation would not exist as they do today.
    NAU's roots go back to the beginning of crop insurance, 
when they company's founder, James Deal, working with Congress 
and the Carter Administration, helped craft and pass the 
Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980. Today, crop insurance 
covers over 90 percent of production agriculture in America.
    Crop insurance succeeds through the tenets of flexibility, 
affordability, and availability. On flexibility, last year 
farmers paid nearly $7 billion in premiums to purchase both 
individual and group-rated coverages they felt fit their 
operation and risk management needs. Farmers have a 
considerable amount of flexibility in tailoring coverage that 
best fits their operation, and while this variety adds 
complexity, it is essential to ensure the program is available 
to all.
    On affordability, without the safety net for our farmers 
and ranchers, grocery shelves could quickly empty after a bad 
growing season across America's heartland. Through the public-
private partnership that is Federal crop insurance, farmers can 
better afford coverages they need. In addition, farmers 
shoulder a significant share of premiums, offsetting costs to 
the taxpayer, ensuring crop insurance can survive and expand.
    On availability, private sector delivery and capital are 
key components to the success of crop insurance. NAU and our 
competitors invest billions of dollars in rural communities, 
shouldering the costs of operating crop insurance in its 
entirety. In addition, we put billions of dollars of capital at 
risk annually. For this actuarily sound program to stay viable 
it is important that the formula provides enough return to 
cover our costs and a reasonable, long-term rate of return on 
the billions of dollars of capital we invest.
    Despite the effectiveness of crop insurance, opportunities 
do exist for improvement. No. 1, the crop insurance industry 
continues to work with producers and commodity groups to 
enhance and/or expand coverages for crops on all producers. 
With higher participation, we can reduce the need for ad hoc 
assistance in case of a disasters. Importantly, investing in 
crop insurance is more efficient for taxpayers and provides a 
level of security to our farmers that ad hoc programs simply do 
not.
    No. 2, crop insurance has been operating on administrative 
reimbursements that have been stagnant since 2015. This has 
occurred during a time of significant inflation in every aspect 
of our business. Discussions are taking place regarding an 
inflationary improvement that would help keep our program 
strong for the American farmer.
    No. 2, the American farmer has already embraced many 
environmentally friendly practices, too many to mention in my 
short time with you today. While we believe further adoption of 
carbon-sequestering farming practices will help guide a better 
future for farming, we caution that non-market incentives 
should come from separately funded initiatives that do not 
detract from the current crop insurance program.
    In closing, I want to leave you with a reflection that I 
heard several years ago while attending a meeting of an 
Australian group called Thankful for Farmers. The program 
developer said, and I paraphrase, ``The typical person may 
occasionally need a doctor, or an attorney once or twice in a 
lifetime, but that same person, three times a day, every single 
day, needs a farmer.''
    I am proud to be part of a program that supports such a 
noble and important cause. I appreciate the support the 
industry has had from Member of Congress on both sides of the 
aisle, and with your support we have created a public-private 
partnership that helps protect the American farmer and truly is 
the envy of the world.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Mr. Korin.
    Mr. Meador.

  STATEMENT OF JASON MEADOR, HEAD, RURAL COMMUNITY INSURANCE 
 SERVICES, ZURICH NORTH AMERICA, ANOKA, MN, AND SCHAUMBURG, IL

TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CROP INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUREAU
    Mr. Meador. Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, 
Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to 
testify today on the importance of crop insurance and the vital 
role it plays providing risk management for farmers and 
ranchers.
    My name is Jason Meador. I am the head of Rural Community 
Insurance Services, one of 14 approved insurance providers that 
sell crop insurance to farmers and ranchers across the country. 
Our company has a national footprint, with more than 1,400 
employees across the United States, partnering with over 3,500 
agents, and protecting more than 100,000 farmers.
    I believe that crop insurance is the best tool available to 
farmers to manage the risks they face and to protect their 
livelihoods. Crop insurance provides a rapid response when 
losses occur. Private companies are typically able to deliver 
indemnity payments to farmers in fewer than 30 days after 
completing loss adjustment.
    Additionally, private sector delivery of crop insurance 
allows farmers to choose the company and local agent that best 
meets their needs. Crop insurance is inclusive. Our industry 
protects farmers of all types and sizes, covers over 130 
different commodities, including the major row crops, specialty 
and organic crops, as well as dairy and livestock.
    The crop insurance program functions as a ``three-legged 
stool'' where risk is shared by farmers, private sector 
companies, and the American taxpayer. Farmers pay premiums and 
are billed to purchase crop insurance and must meet a 
deductible before indemnity payments are made. Private 
insurance companies deliver the program and bear a portion of 
the risk. The Federal Government discounts premium, making crop 
insurance affordable for more farmers, and bears a portion of 
the risk with private insurance companies. The result is crop 
insurance being affordable and accessible for a wide range of 
farmers and ranchers.
    Crop insurance is flexible. Farmers can tailor their 
coverage to fit their specific needs, and if a farmer or 
commodity organization does not believe there is an existing 
policy that works for them, those farmers can utilize the 
508(h) process to develop a product that does. To this end, 
more than 40 policies have come to farmers through the 508(h) 
process over the last 20 years. Crop insurance successfully 
meets the needs of hundreds of thousands of farmers today, and 
we believe can address additional challenges going forward.
    With that as an overview, I would like to address three 
topics as we look ahead to the 2023 Farm Bill--climate and crop 
insurance, disaster assistance, and the 508(h) process.
    First, as the Committee continues to evaluate the 
intersection between agriculture and climate change, it is 
important to note that a farmer's first line of defense against 
climate change is crop insurance. As weather patterns change, 
having a strong insurance product is critical for farmers. 
Additionally, there are studies that show that farmers who 
purchase crop insurance are more likely to undertake climate-
smart agricultural practices.
    As this Committee looks ahead to the farm bill, I would 
like to share the criteria by which we evaluate proposals in 
this area. First, the intersection between climate-smart 
agriculture and crop insurance must maintain the actuarial 
soundness of the program. This is what maintains the program's 
integrity. Second, intersections between climate and crop 
insurance should be incentive based, not mandated. Finally, new 
climate initiatives should be funded on their own terms. Money 
from the crop insurance program should not be used.
    In terms of meeting these criteria, we believe the 508(h) 
process, when used as intended, can enhance the intersection 
between climate and crop insurance. We have seen recent 
examples of this process at work with the approval of both the 
Sprinkler Irrigated Rice Endorsement and Split-Application 
Nitrogen Endorsement.
    My second topic is crop insurance and disaster assistance. 
The last several years have seen a drastic increase in ad hoc 
disaster payments. It is only prudent for this body to be 
looking at the next farm bill for ways to plug these gaps in 
the safety net. We ask that you consider crop insurance as a 
primary tool. We know we cannot solve every problem that exists 
in agriculture, but crop insurance has a track record of 
delivering assistance to farmers in a predictable and timely 
fashion.
    Regarding disaster proposals, we discourage the creation of 
any disaster program that would disincentivize farmers from 
purchasing crop insurance or that would directly compete with 
existing crop insurance products, and we would oppose the 
creation of any disaster package that is funded by cuts in crop 
insurance.
    Finally, regarding the 508(h) new product development 
process, we are interested in working with Congress to ensure 
industry engagement during new product development and rollout. 
Our goal is to have a functional process that will bring 
innovation to farmers, and for the process to be consistent 
with the sound business practices that ensure we continue to be 
good stewards of the taxpayer dollar.
    In the past, companies have been faced with implementing 
new crop insurance products over a compressed time period, with 
no advanced evaluation or input on the product and possible 
implementation hurdles. The result is that some new product 
launches have not been as successful as we would like. For the 
sake of our farmers, we want to see successful product launches 
in the future that meet their changing needs.
    In conclusion, I would like to thank the Subcommittee for 
your continued support of crop insurance and for your 
willingness to seek the perspective of the crop insurance 
industry. We stand ready to work with each of you as we head 
into the next farm bill. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Meador can be found on page 
78 in the appendix.]

    Senator Smith. Thank you so much to all of our panelists. 
We will now begin a round of questions from the Senators. Each 
Senator will have about 5 minutes, and I will defer my first 
questions to Chair Stabenow.
    Senator Stabenow. Well thank you very much, Chairwoman 
Smith and Ranking Member Hyde-Smith. Always wonderful to be 
here with my Ranking Member, Senator Boozman. I appreciate you 
allowing me to go ahead. I am juggling two committees, as all 
of us do at various times this morning.
    First I have to say welcome to all of you, and the good 
news is overwhelming we hear that crop insurance is the No. 1 
risk management tool for farmers. You are doing a good job of 
whoever you are talking to. It is overwhelmingly what we hear, 
and I happen to agree with that as well.
    Throughout my time on the Committee I have been extremely 
supportive of crop insurance and have worked really hard to 
expand it. Certainly for us in Michigan, specialty crop 
insurance has been really important over the years. In 2014, I 
created a Whole Farm Revenue Protection Plan, which has been a 
key option for diversified producers, so I would like to start 
with that. Mr. Cole, I would like to ask you to dive in a 
little bit deeper on the question of how we go about this type 
of insurance. You talked about how the workload relative to 
specialty crop policies generally has increased dramatically, 
and noted your organization has specific suggestions to help 
simplify coverage and make it more accessible.
    Could you talk about the workload connected in selling 
Whole Farm policies, and if the workload affects what type of 
policies that agents are selling and any suggestions that you 
would have for simplifying that process.
    Mr. Cole. Yes, Senator. As you know, I am from Mississippi, 
so we do not have a lot of specialty crops in our area.
    Senator Stabenow. You have got a lot of catfish.
    Mr. Cole. That is right. Through our association, my fellow 
agents that are in specialty crops, really work hard, and the 
unique thing about crop insurance is through the 508(h) process 
anyone that has a good plan or proposal can submit it and it 
goes through the process. It is continuously evolving and 
improving in the specialty crop area, and we are reaching out 
to more crops. As these guys have noted, there are more crops 
being insured, more programs being added every year.
    Recently--this has been a big success--they improved the 
hurricane assistance in the coastal areas to include tropical 
storm coverage, and that has been a big help. That is a new 
issue that we have had, or a new program that we have had that 
has been added.
    One thing on the Whole Farm, especially in your area of 
specialty crops, that has really been embraced, and some of our 
agents that we have been talking to have noted that the 
coverage cap on WFRP might need to be removed or raised 
substantially to include the bigger specialty crop operations, 
which, in turn, would lower the cost and the rates for a lot of 
the specialty crop areas.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    I want to ask a broader question now because I am very 
confident that we are going to be able to work together on this 
Committee and be able to move forward a bipartisan farm bill 
that works for those across the country. My bigger worry right 
now is just the economic environment in which we are in, with 
all of the discussion about default and so on.
    We heard that the Fed Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, said 
yesterday no one should assume that the Fed can really protect 
the economy and financial systems and our reputation globally 
from the damage that a U.S. default might inflict. We should 
not even be talking about a world in which the U.S. does not 
pay its bills.
    Mr. Wagner, Mr. Morgan, and Mr. Barker, could you talk a 
little bit about the implications to farmers and our ag credit 
system generally, in terms of interest rates and credit 
availability, if, in fact, the Federal Government were to 
default on its debts?
    Mr. Morgan. Sure. Thank you, Senator. As far as interest 
rates, the rapid rise in interest rates over the last 12 months 
will impact every operator that we have. Any operator we have 
with an annual operating loan, whether that be cattle, whether 
that be row crops, right now is facing interest rates that are 
more than two times where they were at the beginning of last 
year.
    We also have a number of long-term real estate loans that 
will be repriced this year as their original pricing expires 
and there is an opportunity to reprice their loan. They will be 
facing much higher interest rate costs. In some cases, we will 
have a number of producers that will face both higher operating 
line costs plus real eState interest rate costs.
    Through that Farm Credit remains very well-positioned to be 
able to weather that adversity with those borrowers as we 
continue.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you. Mr. Barker?
    Mr. Barker. Yes. Senator, that is a big topic for as well. 
Our friends in the Farm Credit System have a better funding 
source than we do, using the bond market, where ours is the 
local savings and CD rates that we have to pay.
    We are proposing a new bill. We have an acronym of ACRE. 
Some of you may have heard that. We have been on Capitol Hill 
promoting that. What we are asking for is that the interest on 
all rural ag real estate loans and home loans in towns of 2,500 
or less be tax exempt. We have calculated that could mean the 
difference of 1.5 to 2.5 percent lower rates for our folks, and 
that is another tool that we would love to use for beginning 
farmers and our lower-income families in our towns.
    Senator Stabenow. Mr. Wagner, did you want to respond?
    Mr. Wagner. I will take a little bit different tact. I 
think the risk-free rate, which is what is driving our 
borrowing costs, impacts farmers every day. The higher that 
goes, the more they are impacted, and it tends to compound 
because that drives other risk-free rates in borrowing for 
other parts of ag as well--cost of fertilizer, cost of seed, 
all of those things are impacted by that risk-free rate. The 
higher that goes, the harder it gets, and that is something we 
are actively trying to work against, as I am sure you are as 
well.
    Senator Stabenow. We are. Is it fair to say no one thinks 
that the U.S. defaulting is a good idea for farmers and 
ranchers? Okay.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much, Chair Stabenow. Senator 
Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you very much, and my question is 
to Mr. Morgan. Can you please expand on the importance of crop 
insurance and livestock risk protection to your borrowers?
    Mr. Morgan. Thank you, Senator, for the question. First of 
all, Farm Credit strongly supports the crop insurance program, 
and every year that our row crop farmers, go in and they plant 
their seed, and they grow whatever the commodity is, they are 
risking the full equity or material equity of their farm in 
that crop. Without that crop insurance, any one year that they 
have a disaster or a disease or a market issue, that crop 
insurance will cover them and assure that they will be able to 
continue the next year to plant that same crop.
    The livestock risk protection is well-used in our area, 
very popular. Farmers use that. Cattle producers use that to 
hedge against a decline in market prices, which also is very 
important to us as a lender.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you. Mr. Cole, you have a pretty 
unique perspective here as both a crop insurance agent and a 
producer. What are some of the unique challenges faced by 
producers in the mid-South, and how does crop insurance meet 
those challenges specifically to the mid-South?
    Mr. Cole. As you well know, we are blessed with the amount 
of rainfall. Sometimes we are overly blessed with the amount of 
rainfall. Our crop insurance customers are primarily worried 
about flood damage, planting a crop and then losing the crop. 
We are constantly working with whatever their crop mix, because 
as you well know, in the mid-South, we could rotate three to 
four crops on the same farm. We have to sit down, depending on 
what the market drives, and work with our farmers every year to 
custom tailor the best coverage for them, where their loans 
with these guys would be collateralized to an amount where 
everybody is protected.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Yes, they say 55 inches annual, but I 
think we may have to go up on that one.
    Mr. Cole. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Mr. Meador, one reason it is critical 
to preserve access to risk management tools in this farm bill 
is that these tools help preserve family farms for the next 
generation, which I think is so critically important. I am 
pretty passionate about getting young people involved in both 
hands-on farming and industry-type jobs like yours. Please 
share more about the RCIS apprenticeship program, which I think 
is so interesting.
    Mr. Meador. Thank you, Senator. RCIS, as part of Zurich has 
an apprenticeship program for young adults or people returning 
from the military, so you could be a high school graduate, a 
military veteran, or shucks, somebody that wants to change 
careers. We have a program where you can come join RCIS and you 
are able to get an agriculture degree from Northeast Iowa 
Community College. We pay for the degree. While you get that 
degree you work part-time for us, doing a job, getting exposure 
to fields such as underwriting, claims handling, finance or 
marketing.
    Then after your two years, you have a full-time job working 
for RCIS. We require you to work for us for one year, and 
hopefully many, many years beyond that. It does allow a path 
for new people to come into the industry, young people, diverse 
people. It is a wide range that we are really looking for.
    This year we are hiring 18 individuals across the United 
States in different locations, in many different fields. That 
is really our focus, to bring people into the industry.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. I just really want to commend you for 
that. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Meador. Thank you.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much.
    I want to dive in a little bit into some of the comments 
that several of you made about the work we need to do to make 
these risk management tools more readily available, work better 
for small farmers, beginning farmers. Mr. Wagner, could you 
just go into a little bit more detail? You talked about some of 
the examples that you have about the work that Compeer does, to 
think about how we can help to overcome some of the hurdles 
that young farmers and beginning farmers face, and what you 
have seen that works.
    Mr. Wagner. We are actively involved in this area. I think 
there are a couple of things that I would say are required. 
First, you have to be engaged in that work. We have a dedicated 
team, our Emerging Markets team, that is dedicated to that. Sai 
Thao and Paul Dietmann lead Compeer's Emerging Market team, and 
do a great job of working in the communities. You have focus.
    You have to then build trust. These communities do not just 
accept you and say, ``Give me your money.'' They want to work 
in a sustainable fashion. You have to build trust, sharing 
knowledge, talking about the programs, helping get them 
networked around the country and with these programs to help 
them understand what is possible. We have to have commitment. 
You have to continue to show up, and you have to continue to do 
that.
    I think what it comes down to at the end of the day is 
flexible programs, so it is incumbent upon capital providers to 
have the flexibility to adjust to those communities and work 
through those issues to try and find ways to support them.
    Reggie, who is our producer in the written testimony, did 
not have much of a credit balance, did not have much of a 
credit history. We were able to work with him, get him started. 
He brought others into the community, and they are operating a 
regenerative poultry farm near the Twin Cities. It is a great 
story. It is an example of how you can get introduced, you can 
build trust, you can create flexible programs, and now they are 
off and running, and we hope that they continue to succeed as a 
traditional farmer, where they have more access to capital.
    Senator Smith. I think you mentioned something about how we 
need to make sure that FSA has the flexibilities as we are 
looking at this big generational transition in farms. Could you 
just talk a little bit more about what you think that ought to 
look like?
    Mr. Wagner. Absolutely. There are specific items within the 
FSA programs which require kind of an owner-operator issue. 
When you have extended families, these operations often times 
have multiple kids. I am from a family of three, so you get 
that. How do you pass that land on and maintain somebody on the 
farm? There are many different ways that farmers are choosing 
to do that, but oftentimes many of those legal structures they 
are selecting force them out of the FSA programs.
    It is really about structuring something that is flexible 
for the new age around liability protection with LLCs and 
partnerships, but also just that flexibility around family and 
partnerships in those programs and not having it be kind of one 
farmer, one piece of land. I think that is where the 
flexibility really is needed, and I think we can do that pretty 
easily and still stay within the intent of the original 
programs.
    Senator Smith. Thanks so much.
    Mr. Korin, I want to followup a bit on a question, and you 
are welcome to respond to this as well, but followup on a 
question that Senator Stabenow was asking about Whole Farm 
insurance. That Whole Farm revenue protection is nearly a 
decade old. I think that USDA's Risk Management Agency has been 
championing this. We are seeing that there is still some work 
to do there, and I have heard that because of administrative 
requirements and some of the financial information required it 
just can be sort of burdensome.
    Could you just talk a bit about that and anything you think 
we ought to be doing to make that work better?
    Mr. Korin. Yes. Thank you, Senator, and we appreciate the 
work that the Committee did to get Whole Farm active. One of 
the tenets of crop insurance is to make sure we get the pool as 
large as we can so we can spread risk and get everybody in the 
program, benefiting all, and in some of the specialty crop 
areas there was a need, especially in the Northwest and in the 
Northeast parts of the country, where specialty crops like 
apples and grapes and things like that are grown, there was a 
need for additional coverage. Because it does not apply itself 
to the normal APH kind of coverage that is in crop insurance, 
Whole Farm did make a push to get more people in the program, 
and for that it was successful.
    I think last year we wrote, as an industry, about $125 
million of coverage on Whole Farm. I can tell you that this 
year, with the changes that we worked with RMA to put into 
place with regards to the micro Whole Farm and some of those 
things, we are already over that number.
    I looked at our own book of business, and from last year to 
this year we are up 18 percent on Whole Farm.
    It is maybe slow to grow, but it fills a void that we 
needed in crop insurance, and I think it is working, Senator.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much. Senator Ernst.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member, 
and thanks again to the witnesses for being here today. Gus, 
Mr. Barker, thanks for being here. In your testimony you did do 
a very nice job of describing how productive Iowa farmers are, 
but you did also, in your remarks, mention the high cost of 
land in Iowa. That makes it particularly difficult for our 
young and beginning farmers, and small farmers.
    There was a 2022 study from Iowa State University that gave 
the land value. It was called the Land Value Survey, and it 
gave the cost of an average price per acre of Iowa farmland. 
The average was around $11,000 or so per acre, but it ranged up 
to $30,000 for a high, up in northwest Iowa. I know you are 
familiar with some of those costs.
    According to the most recent USDA census data, which came 
out in 2019, and I have heard this before, but the average age 
of an Iowa farmer is just over 57 years old. My sister and her 
husband are those average Iowa farmers right there.
    Mr. Barker, from your experience how can we better help and 
incentivize young and beginning farmers so that they start and 
stay in agriculture? We get a lot of these young people. They 
will start in farming, but they find that they cannot often 
stay in farming.
    Are there special financing terms or other unique programs 
that are being offered to keep these young people in 
agriculture?
    Mr. Barker. You know, we use a variety of programs, 
Senator. We have used a partnership with USDA where they 
provide a down payment and we provide the funding for a 
purchase of hog facilities, and the young man is willing to 
work. They have to be willing to work. It is not something you 
can just sit in the office and manage. They have got to be 
willing to do that.
    We use the programs that have the guarantees. We feel the 
new USDA Express program would fill a niche. Some of the 
opportunities my young farmers have had come up are under a 
deadline, because there are multiple people willing to pay the 
price, and for a young farmer who applies for a USDA loan, they 
do not come through very fast. If that is delayed, that seller 
is going to go somewhere else where he knows he can get the 
money fast.
    Senator Ernst. And Gus, if I could interrupt there, just so 
folks know, how long does it typically take for that process?
    Mr. Barker. We estimate 60 days, minimum, to get that done. 
In a worst-case situation, at times when funding is low, it 
could be six months. It is really a pretty tough time. The 
paperwork is intimidating, so if the lender can use their own 
forms, have a 36-hour turnaround, that young person has the 
best shot of getting something purchased for them. Not 
everybody has family members that are willing to help.
    The State of Iowa does have a program, that may be tailored 
at the Federal level, that gives a tax break to the seller of 
the farm to the young farmer. For a five-year term they get a 
tax break on their income taxes, a tax credit, and that has 
worked well for some of the beginning farmers in Iowa.
    Senator Ernst. Yes, that is good. Thank you. Mr. Wagner, 
how about you?
    Mr. Wagner. We like the Express program, by the way. I 
think that is a great idea. It is something that we would 
definitely support.
    I think where we look at it is we do a lot of different 
structuring around young and beginning farmers. Down payment 
assistance tailored the cash-flows to the right thing. More 
broadly we want to provide off-farm income opportunities for 
the partner or the spouse who is working in that rural 
community, and if we can do that and have that off-farm income 
and contribute to them getting on their feet as full-time 
farmers, then as their operation grows they can come back and 
be full-time.
    It is a whole look. Much of the farm income around the 
country is off-farm, and we need that support and that strong 
rural community in order to help those producers start and stay 
on that farm, as you said. It is a key item to look at it 
holistically versus just on the farmer aspect, because that is 
just not broad enough.
    You cannot get started the way it is with ag today, and the 
prices that we have to pay. It has to be kind of a collective 
working hard and working, you know, and two jobs or one job to 
try and make that work, that is quite often the solution. I 
think that is something we are producing. We are trying to 
support that growth in those rural communities as well as 
providing specific programs for young and beginning farmers.
    Senator Ernst. Yes. Thank you both very much. I think it is 
important that folks out there in non-ag country understand how 
difficult it is to really get into farming and to be able to 
thrive in farming. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. 
Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Senator Ernst. Senator 
Tuberville.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here 
today and helping with this all-important farm bill that we are 
getting ready to attack. I guess that is the way we would call 
it.
    As we heard during Tuesday's hearing, protecting the farm 
safety net is the top priority for commodity groups across the 
country. For this farm bill, crop insurance programs represent 
only seven percent of the total $1.5 trillion package. We 
cannot have an effective and functional safety net without 
stabilized crop insurance coverage for our producers. It is not 
going to happen.
    Also, we must ensure our producers have access to capital 
and risk management tools to weather rising input costs and 
skyrocketing prices for farmland and equipment.
    Mr. Wagner and Mr. Morgan, I hear from Alabama poultry 
producers about the rising cost of poultry houses. Four houses 
can cost up to $2.5 million, or more. In your testimony, you 
mentioned the need to increase FSA-guaranteed loans. What is 
the appropriate level of FSA-guaranteed loan limits?
    Mr. Morgan. Thank you, Senator. Farm Credit is asking for 
an increase of up to $3.5 million for ownership, and up to $3 
million for operating. In my statement I indicated a similar 
example of what it takes for a poultry farmer to make $75,000. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, household median income 
for the last two years has been about $70,000. For a poultry 
producer, they have got to go in and make a $3.3 million 
investment in order to achieve the same level of median income. 
An increase in the guarantee amount, which is currently a 
little over $2 million, would significantly cover the cost of 
those houses, and be an entry point for so many young, 
beginning, and small farmers.
    If I could, in Mississippi and Louisiana, we have a 
concentration of integrators in poultry houses and great 
opportunity there. That is just a really key item for us with 
this farm bill.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Mr. Wagner, have you got 
anything to add?
    Mr. Wagner. Just quickly, a broader perspective. When you 
have an ownership loan and an operating loan and those two 
things combine, that limit still applies. I think where we have 
young, beginning farmers who may have some help on the land 
loan, may not have that same help on the operating loan. That 
limit is real, and as the cost of inputs and the cost of land 
move up, as Senator Ernst indicated, you run into those limits 
really fast. Updating is important.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Mr. Barker, thanks for 
wearing the appropriate blue and orange tie today, by the way.
    I was co-sponsor of ECORA last Congress and look forward to 
support ACRE this Congress. Mr. Barker, can you share with the 
Committee how ACRE could allow community banks like yours to 
better serve rural communities in your market?
    Mr. Barker. It is a lower interest rate. With those 
interest income tax-free to the bank we could pass that on to 
our borrowers. Any cost savings that we could provide those 
beginning farmers is essential. We cannot control the input 
costs or anything else. The only thing we can control is the 
interest, and that is one way we could do that, by having that 
interest tax-free to the bank on the ag side of things. Also in 
my markets, my towns are all under 2,500 people, and the 
housing situation is very, very difficult there. It would 
really benefit my folks who have very limited means of income 
in making a purchase and affording the houses, rather than the 
double and triple interest rates they see now.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you.
    Mr. Cole, Mr. Korin, or Mr. Meador, to any of you working 
in the crop insurance industry, as you know, half of the 14 
approved insurance providers have parent companies that are 
owned by foreign entities. I know that some AIPs have 
subsidiaries in China. Do Chinese entities have significant 
ownership stakes in any AIPs or their parent companies?
    Mr. Meador. I will take that one, Senator. At RCIS, Rural 
Community Insurance Services, our parent company is Zurich. 
Zurich is a Swiss-based company. Just a little bit of 
background on who Zurich is and what our role is with RCIS. 
Zurich purchased RCIS in 2016. Prior to the purchase in 2016, 
Zurich was a reinsurance partner with RCIS going back to 1998, 
so providing capital to RCIS to be able to support crop 
insurance in American agriculture.
    If I go back further, Zurich in North America has been 
doing business in the United States going back to 1912, 
providing insurance for many infrastructure projects over time, 
everything from the Hoover Dam, Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and the 
update to LaGuardia Airport. There is a lot of capital that 
comes from Zurich globally to be able to support North America.
    From a business perspective, broadly, globally, roughly 90 
percent of Zurich's property and casualty business is in North 
America and Europe, so Western economies. When I look at the 
life business there is not as much in North America, but it is 
more in Latin America. Asia-Pacific makes up only about 10 
percent of the business or a little bit less. Major markets 
there are Australia and Japan. We do not do business in China.
    The one caveat to the China question--so we do not have 
subsidiaries in China, to answer your question very directly--
the one caveat to China is we do insure multinational 
companies. If they have business in China, we carry our 
insurance through an international program to give them 
protection while they are doing business in China, but we do 
not do it directly in China.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Senator Tuberville. Senator 
Gillibrand.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Over the 
past few months we have seen three of the four largest bank 
failures in American history. Quick action by regulators in the 
private sector have allowed for stabilization to a point, but 
it is clear that Congress must act with some banking reform to 
guarantee long-term economic stability in the banking sector or 
risk similar future events.
    For all the panelists, do these banking disruptions pose a 
risk to our rural lenders and rural creditors?
    Mr. Barker. Well, from our standpoint in rural Iowa, and in 
talking to my ag committee, which is scattered across the 
United States, we have not seen an impact. Those megabanks were 
not typical bank management, and we just feel there needs to be 
a distinguished line drawn in the sand between the risk of 
those megabanks who are investing in far-out ways of doing 
business compared to what the community bank model has always 
been. It has been stable. It has survived everything from world 
wars to the ag crisis and survived that bank model. We just 
feel that we are stable. We have not seen withdrawals of major 
deposits or anything like that. We just think there needs to be 
risk-based fees to those big places. We should not have to be 
tagged on to paying for those failures of those people. We get 
monitored----
    Senator Gillibrand. Can I just interrupt you for a second? 
I am not concerned about the large banks right now. I am 
concerned about community banks, regional banks, smaller banks. 
Specifically--and maybe it is not happened to you in Iowa--for 
the other panelists, have you seen capital flight to larger 
institutions? Are you concerned with the rising interest rates, 
that it will destabilize your regional banks or your community 
banks or your partners? Because we have data and information 
that they have not reached stability. It started at Silicon 
Valley Bank, but then it went to regional banks in New York, it 
went back to a regional bank in California, now all these 
regional banks are having a reduction in their stock price, as 
much as 50 percent loss.
    There is enormous instability in the regional banking 
system today because of interest rates and because of 
misaligned investments. You may have had very prudent 
investments, and you may be extremely stable, and there are 
many banks like that I know in New York as well. For the rest 
of you, have you seen any flight of capital? Are you worried 
about misalignment with interest rates, and are you seeing any 
impacts that affect your business?
    Go ahead, Mr. Morgan.
    Mr. Morgan. Yes. Thank you, Senator. I mean, community 
banks are an integral part of our small towns and rural 
communities in Mississippi. Of course, any time there is 
discussion of a credit crunch, whether it is ag or non-ag, that 
bothers all of us.
    I will say that there is conversation among our communities 
regarding those concerns. I cannot necessarily speak to them 
because I am in Farm Credit, but I can tell you that Farm 
Credit is well positioned right now, well capitalized, and does 
not have the same concerns, and we are well positioned to 
continue to support local agriculture.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you. Mr. Wagner?
    Mr. Wagner. The impact is real. When you have contagion 
like you have, I think you start to see increase in spreads. 
People require more for the risk that is being taken. Farm 
Credit is part of that. Our GSE spreads have expanded because 
of that, which is costing our farmers money. We are trying to 
do what we can to move through that.
    I would say the impact is not real acute right now. It is 
around the edges, newer producers coming in, newer loans that 
are being funded. It is something we are actively watching. We 
are working with our district bank, AgriBank, to monitor their 
risk and understand what is going on there so that we can 
protect what is going on.
    I think what you are seeing more broadly, initially, is 
everyone talking about risk, and when everyone is talking about 
risk you tend to get more conservative. It is immediately 
impactful to your young, beginning farmers.
    Senator Gillibrand. For the rest of you three, has it 
increased your costs? Has it increased the cost of access to 
capital? How is it impacting your customers? Mr. Cole?
    Mr. Cole. Yes. Our customers were able to secure, for the 
most part, without any issues, production loans for this year. 
Now it is just apparent that the high rates are going to have a 
severe impact, especially with the cost of production just 
dramatically rising. It is going to be an issue. There is no 
doubt.
    Senator Gillibrand. Mr. Korin?
    Mr. Korin. Yes, Senator, there is no doubt the change in 
the banking industry has impacted capital, and as such, for 
example, this year our reinsurance costs are up probably 40 
percent. You see it more in property and casualty because the 
crop industry has better performance. Everyone was hit with 
that this year. We are seeing our cost of capital really go up.
    Mr. Meador. Yes, I agree with Jim on the reinsurance costs. 
From our perspective, being part of a large, multinational 
company, I do have access to broader capital, so it probably 
impacts me a little bit less given what we actually do.
    The other point that I want to make, from a banking versus 
insurance sector, is in the insurance sector, our investments 
were focused on assets matching liabilities, so some of the 
liquidity issues that banks have, insurance companies naturally 
do not have, given how we manage our business. I just wanted to 
make sure that point is out there as well.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you, 
witnesses.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. Senator 
Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and we do 
appreciate you all so much. I apologize for running in and out. 
We have all got about three or four hearings. In fact, I was 
with the NIH and folks like that. I am trying to get a question 
in there about the high rate of suicide amongst the ag 
community and what we are doing to try and focus on that and do 
a little bit better job.
    Mr. Wagner, a theme we have heard come up more than once in 
testimony is how producers are getting squeezed by higher 
costs, due in part to persistently high inflation, interest 
rates, cost of production has increased. How important is it 
that we ensure farmers and ranchers have access to a level of 
credit needed to keep pace with the current inflationary 
environment? I would add, how important it is, especially to 
make sure that our risk management tools, crop insurance, all 
of the other risk management tools are up to date in this 
really generational inflation rate, generational high interest 
rate, generational high input costs. The list just goes on and 
on.
    Mr. Wagner. It is very important that farmers have that 
access to capital. As we talked about, that rural capital team 
is important, so building up and having access to many 
different options across the spectrum is very important to help 
alleviate some of those issues that you have with specific 
sectors, specific groups that may have problems as inflation 
moves up.
    I think we are very focused on trying to also adapt the 
programs. We have not had significant inflation since the 
1980's, and many of the programs and structures were not set up 
with those in mind. I think this is a great opportunity to 
relook at some of those options and provide that flexibility, 
up and possibly down, as you see things move over time. Things 
like FSA loan limits, as we look at crop insurance and some of 
the things that are moving around within those products as 
well.
    We want to serve our farmers. We want to serve them in the 
best way, and flexibility is oftentimes the best way to adjust 
to rapidly changing markets like inflation and input costs.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Wagner.
    Mr. Morgan, over the past several years the debt-to-asset 
and debt-to-equity ratios have increased while working capital 
is expected to decrease by more than 10 percent in 2023, 
according to USDA forecasts. Meanwhile land values have 
continued to climb, and farm incomes are set to decrease by 
double digits. While these statistics do not rise to the level 
of the 1980's farm debt crisis, what can we do to minimize the 
risk of returning to that type of environment?
    Mr. Morgan. Thank you, Senator. As we see growers and 
producers, as we see their balance sheets begin to decline, as 
we see that the equity begins to deteriorate based on high 
costs and declining margins and so forth, it is just critical 
that we continue to have the safety net in the farm bill, that 
those producers are, in some ways, assured that that safety net 
is there, that they are going to be able to continue. As that 
equity declines, so does the risk of a smaller loss causing a 
greater issue in the future.
    I would also say for entry-level farmers, for our young, 
beginning, and small farmers, they need a guarantee that there 
is going to be a living there, that they can earn as they 
continue to see the risks increase in agriculture.
    Senator Boozman. As lenders, Mr. Barker, Mr. Morgan, 
whoever, do you see increased scrutiny by the bank examiners 
with the banking system a little bit shaky right now? You are 
seeing these balance sheets, and then again, you are having to 
be a little, you know, scrutinize things a little bit more 
because of the nature of the beast with the farm economy. Do 
you see people scrutinizing you more as a result, and that 
making it even that much more difficult, and another reason 
that we make sure that our safety nets are in place and up to 
date?
    Mr. Barker. We have always been scrutinized pretty heavily, 
Senator.
    Senator Boozman. You do not know that you can have any 
more.
    Mr. Barker. Yes, I do not know that there has ever been a 
lull in my banking career, but I did survive the 1980's, so I 
guess that is an accomplishment. I just finished a State exam, 
one of the best exams I ever had. Our files are up to date, we 
have our lenders that are trained, and our customers are well 
positioned. They have had some very good years, and we hope to 
keep that sustained, even though I am in the severe drought 
area of the State of Iowa. We worry about that every year, and 
the last couple of years we did not think we would have a crop, 
and we had such timely rains that it made a big difference. We 
had the safety net, and that is a question we get asked on 
every customer from the examiners, do they have Federal crop 
insurance? As long as we can tell them yes, they feel much more 
comfort in that.
    Senator Boozman. Good. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Senator Boozman. My colleague 
from North Dakota, Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thanks to both 
of you, you and the Ranking Member, for holding this hearing. 
Thanks to our witnesses.
    For Mr. Barker, in the 2018 Farm Bill I worked to increase 
loan limits for both FSA direct and the guaranteed loans, and I 
am looking to work on that again in the 2023 Farm Bill. Do you 
believe that the current FSA loan limits provide producers with 
adequate access to credit relative to their cost of the 
production?
    Mr. Barker. Actually, Senator, our opinion is no, that they 
need to be adjusted upward. The price land and inputs have just 
skyrocketed for us, and we are proposing $3.5 million for the 
ownership and $3 million limit on the operating line for USDA 
guarantees. We feel we could live with that, but we would like 
it indexed to inflation to keep up in the future. I think some 
of my colleagues also mentioned those same numbers.
    Senator Hoeven. Does anybody disagree that the cost of 
production agriculture has gone up and we need to increase 
those loan limits? Just if you disagree, say so. Otherwise I 
will figure you all agree, because it is obviously that is the 
case. Okay.
    Then to Mr. Cole, Mr. Korin, and Mr. Meador, what would it 
mean to your producers if crop insurance were weakened? In 
fact, don't we need to continue to strengthen it? Is it not, in 
fact, our producers' No. 1 risk management tool?
    Mr. Cole. Yes, thank you, Senator. I would submit that it 
is the only viable risk management tool that our farmers have 
today. It is so important to our small, rural communities, not 
just the farmers relying on it, these lenders here rely on it 
heavily, the tractor dealerships, the seed and chemical 
dealerships. It is the underpinning of all of our rural 
communities, to a certain extent.
    Mr. Korin. Yes, Senator, the higher input costs have 
definitely put the risk at a higher level in rural America, and 
our farmers invest more to get their crop in the ground. You 
know, in your area we have seen a flight to higher coverages 
through ECO, SCO, some of those plans. The reason is that the 
margins are tight on the farm. Input costs are expensive, and 
farmers cannot afford a year where they cannot pay their bills.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes, and you make a really important point 
there. You know, as they get up to higher levels of coverage it 
gets prohibitively expensive. What can we do to enable them to 
get those higher levels of coverage, as well as what role can 
supplemental coverage options and enhanced coverage options 
play? Thank you for bringing that up.
    Mr. Korin. We, three years back, NAU piloted or sponsored 
the EDO product, which is a 95 to 86 cover, and we did that 
through the 508(h) program. When we see the need, you know, I 
think as an industry we need to go and see if we can get that 
coverage expanded.
    Unfortunately, with ECO, when we went through the process 
there was a statutory cap on how much subsidy or premium 
support the government could provide, and it would be helpful 
to get that increased, similar to STAX and the FCO. That would 
help a lot.
    To be honest with you, I think just about everybody up 
here, in their opening comments, said that it is more efficient 
for taxpayers to put money into the crop insurance program, 
where the farmer is shouldering some of the cost. I think it is 
prudent to look at those ideas and see if we can get there.
    Senator Hoeven. Really good point. Thanks for making it.
    Mr. Meador. I agree with everything Mr. Cole and Mr. Korin 
said. Crop insurance is the No. 1 risk management tool for 
farmers and ranchers, to be able to support their loans or 
their livelihood and stability in agriculture going forward. I 
think it is critically important.
    I will echo a little bit of what Mr. Korin said around the 
508(h) process and being able to bring new and different 
products to enhance the program. That is really what growers 
would be looking for. He brought up a great example that allows 
for coverage at a slightly lower cost. ECO/SCO allows them to 
get a bit higher coverage, moving from your specific farm to an 
area-based coverage plan. Those types of things can be done. I 
would also highlight things like index products. When we talked 
earlier about the hurricane insurance protection, wind index 
product, the program just added tropical storm coverage this 
February. Those types of things give additional coverage.
    I would be remiss not to echo again the point on premium 
discounts. Premium discounts for some of these products as you 
get to higher levels of coverage do potentially make it cost-
prohibitive for some growers to be able to get that. If you are 
able to increase it, that will or should be able to help 
address some of the ad hoc disaster assistance that has been 
needed over the past several years.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you. Mr. Cole, I want to ask you 
about the A&O reimbursement for insurance companies that 
provide Federal crop insurance. USDA has the authority to 
provide inflationary adjustments. They have not done that since 
2015. They did it before. That authority did not magically 
disappear. They have it.
    Mr. Cole. Yes, sir.
    Senator Hoeven. Talk to me about why they need to use it 
and provide an inflationary increase for the insurance. We just 
got done talking about crop insurance being the No. 1 risk 
management tool for our producers out there. They need a 
network of insurance companies out there across rural America, 
a lot of them small companies, that are willing to provide 
service to them, right, people that actually know the farmer or 
rancher they are dealing with, right?
    Mr. Cole. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I 100 percent agree. First, I 
want to start by thanking you and your colleagues for 
bipartisan support in the Omnibus that actually Stated just 
what you said. The Department does have the authority to 
implement the A&O inflation indexing without opening the SRA. 
As you well know, crop insurance program is extremely 
complicated, and we have very skilled workers that deal with 
this, and our agencies, most agencies provide benefits--health 
insurance, retirement accounts.
    The problem that, especially in the specialty crop areas, 
it is very complicated. We work very hard every year to add 
more coverage, add more policies, but it is very risky 
proposition to not be able to pay those employees. As we are 
adding to the program, we run the risk of not being able to 
provide the service to that program.
    Yes, I 100 percent agree. We have got to urge the 
Department to add indexing on the A&O. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Sorry 
for going over my time.
    Senator Smith. No. No worries. Thank you, Senator Hoeven.
    We have now completed our first round of questions by the 
panel. I believe that Senator Ernst has one more question, and 
I have one more question, then I think we will be done.
    I want to just open it up to the panel and get at something 
that several of you have referred to, which is how important 
these risk management tools, crop insurance and other risk 
management tools, certainly they are important to farmers and 
producers, but they are also really important to rural 
communities, you know, more broadly. Strong agriculture equals 
strong rural communities equals just more opportunity, flat 
out, in small towns and rural places.
    Would anybody like to comment about how you are partnering 
with rural communities to support local economic development 
growth?
    Mr. Barker. Well, I am in some pretty small communities, so 
the bank is the majority of the economic development there. 
Whatever we do impacts our community directly. The next thing 
we have would be a grain elevator, and maybe a small 
convenience store. One of my communities was lucky enough to 
have a grocery store built by a regional chain, and that serves 
every community within a 30-mile radius now.
    It is a devastating thing not having the agriculture 
community around, and they support everything we have.
    Senator Smith. It is people.
    Mr. Barker. It is, and at the gas stations you are going to 
see 15 or 20 pickup trucks every morning, for coffee and 
comparing notes on what they know and do not know.
    Senator Smith. That sounds familiar. Mr. Wagner?
    Mr. Wagner. The rural community is obviously a big part of 
where we are at. We are doing some specific things around rural 
vitality. This is a new initiative for me, as a CEO, and for 
Compeer. We are adding extra oomph to this. We are building 
networks.
    We are working with a group called CEDA, which is locally, 
to build networks around small businesses to, one, identify 
what they need, two, to try and work regionally versus locally. 
We believe that is really an important factor for us is to work 
regionally. Then bring capital. We are providing capital to 
these groups to get started. We are providing low-interest 
loans to try and help them do what they can do to work within 
those communities to build those. We are also being a voice. We 
are here talking about rural communities and how we can help 
them.
    Between those three things we believe we are really focused 
on driving that rural vitality. Further, we would love to 
support rural health care. We are building hospitals. We are 
building senior care facilities through case-by-case approval. 
We would really like to streamline that process and utilize 
that existing authority more fully.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. Thank you. I will turn 
to Senator Ernst.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, Madam Chair. For our lenders that 
are here, in my home State of Iowa, our turkey and our egg 
producers have been hit hard by avian influenza, and I think we 
all vividly remember 2015, when it swept through many of our 
States. That was my first year in the Senate, and it left a 
lasting impression.
    As you know, once that flock is infected, that farmer 
producer has to depopulate the entire flock. Thankfully the 
USDA does have an indemnification program. The farmer has a 
loss for income that was expected in outlying years from that 
flock.
    Mr. Wagner, why don't we start with you. Those poultry and 
livestock producers are very focused on foreign animal 
diseases. We had the avian influenza. God forbid if we ever 
have an African swine fever episode. They are focused on those 
foreign animal diseases, so the preparedness and the 
biosecurity that comes with that. Can you walk through what 
you, as a lender, can do for those producers, when the avian 
influenza or another foreign animal disease strikes?
    Mr. Wagner. Yes. Thank you, Senator, for the question. It 
is unfortunately happening more often, and so our plan is we 
increase the voice of the customer. Spend time on their farm 
trying to understand that individual situation. Every one seems 
to be a little bit different, and each producer is in a 
different situation when that arrives. Between working with the 
USDA and those programs and the insurance providers that they 
may have, we try and find ways to structure the cash-flows to 
keep that farmer farming out into the future.
    It is a consistent thing that Farm Credit does. We work 
with our borrowers. We try and engage with their cash-flows and 
their opportunities. We look for other programs that may be 
able to support that, and work with them to keep them farming 
over time.
    Typically they have been able to recover, and that has been 
a really positive sign of both the work of this Committee and 
the support that we have from the government, but also just the 
support they have from those communities. They will oftentimes 
have neighbors and friends help them out as you go through that 
process. That is something we like to see and have a network to 
build around.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you. Anything different, Mr. Barker or 
Mr. Morgan?
    Mr. Morgan. Thank you, Senator. I would just say that 
whether it is avian flu disaster, whether it is tornados, 
whether it is anything that would knock out the cash-flow of 
that borrower, we have the tools and the availability to move 
that timing around of when they can get cash-flow back and when 
they can make their payment.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you.
    Mr. Barker. Same thing with us. We make use of any tool we 
have. It may or may not involve USDA-guaranteed programs, but 
usually they have to restructure and stretch some payments out 
over a number of years.
    Senator Ernst. Yes. Something always to be aware of. Thank 
you very much, Madam Chair.
    Senator Smith. Thank you so much, Senator Ernst, and I 
really appreciate you bringing up avian influenza. It is an 
issue that affects both of our States so intensively, yes, 
probably all of our States. Exactly. Thank you.
    Colleagues, does anybody else have any other questions that 
you would like to ask?
    In that case I want to thank our witnesses again for being 
here today and for providing testimony, and thank you again to 
Senator Hyde-Smith and to your staff for working with us on 
these committees this week. Thanks to Ranking Member Boozman 
and Chair Stabenow for joining our Committee hearing this 
morning.
    You know, we mentioned several times that the Ag Committee 
is lucky to work in a space where there is strong 
bipartisanship. We are not as partisan as in some other spaces, 
and I hope that this hearing this week, all of the hearings 
that we did this week, will help to inform us as we build a 
bipartisan farm bill that meets the needs of farmers and 
ranchers and small towns and rural places all across the 
country.
    For Senators who wish to submit questions for the record, 
these questions are due one week from today, which will be 
Thursday, May 11th. For our witnesses, you will have two weeks 
to respond to any questions for the record.
    Thank you again, and with that this hearing is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 11:40 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
