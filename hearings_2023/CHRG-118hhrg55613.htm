OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Again, good afternoon and welcome to the 36th hearing the 
U.S. Congress has held on privacy and data security over the 
last 5 years. I am using a bit of math there from one of our 
previous witnesses. As for the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
this will be our sixth hearing in the 118th Congress. We have 
now examined in depth how a Federal data privacy and security 
law can make us more competitive with China.
    While a Federal standard is needed to protect Americans and 
balance the needs of business, government, and civil society, 
what happens when malicious actors like TikTok and the CCP, 
through ByteDance, exploit access to data, where the FTC's 
lines of jurisdiction and authority are and how that interplays 
with the comprehensive privacy law, the role of data brokers, 
and the lack of consumer protections over one's data, and, 
finally, our hearing today, which will examine how consumers 
may not be covered by sector-specific laws in a way that is 
consistent with their expectations.
    The fact is that the data privacy and security concerns 
permeate across multiple areas within Congress, even in 
seemingly unrelated topics, which highlights just how important 
it is for us to work together across the aisle and across 
Capitol Hill to protect the American people.
    In today's hearing we will discuss sectoral data privacy 
regimes like the Financial Sectors Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; and 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act; and the healthcare's--health 
sector's Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 
or HIPAA; the education sector's Family Education Rights and 
Privacy Act, FERPA; and, of course, the Children's Online 
Privacy Protection Act, COPPA, which this subcommittee knows 
very well, and the gaps in coverage that a piecemeal, sector-
specific approach has created for consumers.
    We will hear from the witnesses about how these gray areas 
for Americans also result in risks and uncertainty that 
businesses could better avoid if we had clearer rules of the 
road. This only gets more complicated as 50 different States 
move towards their own data privacy laws, meaning an 
increasingly complicated and confusing landscape for consumers 
and for businesses.
    Having clear rules in place will protect Americans, 
particularly our kids, as well as fuel innovation in the 
American marketplace. Sounds good to me.
    Each of the witnesses has a unique story to tell when it 
comes to these gaps, but the challenges are the same: Consumers 
think their data is protected, but the sector-specific law in 
place does not extend as far as consumers expect.
    Mr. Codling, with REGO Payment Architectures, will discuss 
how it is possible to operate a payments infrastructure that 
has strong protections for children. REGO has filled the gaps 
that exist with the GLBA and COPPA by protecting all kids under 
18. We appreciate that very much.
    Ms. Vance, with the Public Interest Privacy Center, is a 
recognized expert in FERPA and kids' privacy. She will speak 
about how current gaps exist in educational privacy and child-
specific laws that a comprehensive privacy law would cover.
    Thanks very much for being here.
    Mr. Britan, with Salesforce, helps clients collect data in 
a way that is compliant with the Federal sectors--sectoral laws 
and State privacy laws. His clients do business in every 
sector, and will speak to compliance burdens that the patchwork 
of State laws has created.
    Thanks for being here.
    Mr. Reed, with the App Association, will discuss how the 
piecemeal approach of State laws creates confusion for member 
companies. App Association members are regulated by all of the 
sector-specific laws and must spend significant resources 
complying with all of the various State data privacy laws. That 
is so tough. It has got to be very difficult.
    In closing, I want to thank all the witnesses for coming 
today. I also want to thank Chair Rodgers and the ranking 
member, Ranking Member Pallone, for all of the progress we have 
made so far and the continued commitment to get this done--we 
will get it done--as well as Ranking Member Schakowsky, who has 
made this effort a true bipartisan partnership. Thank you so 
much.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Bilirakis follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Bilirakis. Lastly, I want to recognize and thank a 
valuable member of our team, whose last day is tomorrow and has 
served as a technology fellow on our subcommittee, on our staff 
for this past year. We are really going to miss you, Lacey--
Lacey Strahm.
    Lacey, your insights and contribution, particularly with 
the NIL, to the team have been invaluable over these past 
years. I really appreciate all your hard work. And don't be a 
stranger. We are going to miss you tremendously.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Let's give her a round----
    Mr. Bilirakis. Yes, why not?
    [Applause.]
    Mr. Bilirakis. Hey, Lacey, second thoughts?
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Bilirakis. No? I wish you would stay, but I understand.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on 
providing protections for Americans and certainty for 
businesses.
    So with that I will now recognize the gentlelady from 
Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for her 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAN SCHAKOWSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. You know, 
you mentioned that we have been working in the subcommittee and 
the full committee for at least 5 years, talking about how are 
we going to protect consumers' data. And rather than things 
getting better, despite our being able to pass it out of the 
full committee, which was a tremendous achievement in a totally 
bipartisan way, I think consumers are increasingly, every day, 
concerned about their inability to protect their private 
information.
    And you outlined some of the sectoral ways that consumers 
are supposedly protected but don't do the full job and don't 
fill the gaps. You mentioned healthcare, so--and I am really 
anxious to hear about that, among other things, because I 
think, at first, when HIPAA was put into place, the idea that 
doctors and hospitals would not be able to share information--
there weren't so many applications out there that went well 
beyond that, and opportunities to go beyond that. But now we 
know that there are all kinds of apps that collect information 
and may share that, even sell that, about you and your health--
one example of what we have to do.
    You mentioned financial information. Now, you know, there 
were days where we just went to our banks, and we were pretty 
sure that that information wasn't going to be shared, and there 
were some protections. But we now know that there are 
retailers, for example, who have plenty of information when we 
do shopping online, and lots of our data, the--that leads back 
to all of our financial information becomes available.
    And then you also mentioned FERPA, which is--I didn't 
actually know the acronym, but I am going to say it--it is the 
Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, for our kids. Well, 
you would hope that all of our--and we know that all of the 
information about our children isn't--is not protected right 
now. And for example, the student data. But children who attend 
private schools, they are not going to find that their 
information is protected. We know that there are a number of 
educational apps that our kids and, even as parents, that we 
are connecting them to, that may have lots more information 
about our children than we want. And that is always a primary 
concern for members of these committee--of this committee.
    So I think I want to just conclude by going back to what we 
have already done. We have passed the American Data Privacy and 
Protection Act out of this committee, and it is time for us to 
return to that. If there are things that we still need to do, 
if we want to continue negotiations on various parts--but we 
passed a really good bill, and it is that that we ought to 
build on, that we ought to move forward on so that all those 
gaps that are now in protecting consumers' information, the 
information they do not want stolen, sold, the manipulations 
that are happening right now to our kids online, ourselves 
online--we can address this right now and get going once again 
on the ADPPA legislation and move forward as quickly as we can.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Schakowsky follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Ms. Schakowsky. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thanks so very much. I appreciate it. And we 
are going to make a good bill even better.
    I now recognize the chair of the full committee, Mrs. 
Rodgers, for her 5 minutes for an opening statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon and 
welcome.
    This is our sixth privacy and data security hearing this 
year. It gives us another chance to discuss our efforts to 
enact a comprehensive national standard. Currently, there are 
sector-specific Federal statutes on the books to protect data, 
ranging from healthcare to financial to youth-oriented laws.
    While preserving those laws, the American Data and Privacy 
Protection Act passed out of committee with near unanimous 53 
to 2 vote, and it included many safeguards to ensure activities 
in these various sectors remain governed by the appropriate 
State and Federal regulators. Many of these laws were crafted 
in this very hearing room over the last 30 years. The level of 
innovation and competition that resulted since then is amazing, 
and it represents some of the greatest accomplishments in 
American history.
    That said, these technologies come with challenges that 
must be addressed. These companies have developed tools that 
interact to track Americans both online and offline, and they 
are also using their data to manipulate what we see and what we 
think. This is especially true for children.
    I am very proud of our work last Congress to pass ADPPA out 
of committee. It included the strongest privacy protections for 
kids online. These protections have support from several 
stakeholders as being stronger than any proposals from any 
other Federal or State laws or proposals to date. It would make 
it illegal to target advertising to children and treats data 
about kids under 17 as sensitive. This means establishing 
higher barriers for the transfer of personal information.
    This provision, along with the overarching data 
minimization provisions and the ability to delete personal 
information, will make it tougher for kids' personal 
identifiable information, like their physical location, to land 
in the hands of drug dealers, sex traffickers, and other evil 
actors attempting to find and track them.
    It would also require assessments for how their algorithms 
amplify harmful content. This will keep them accountable for 
stories like the one reported by Bloomberg last week about 
Tiktok's algorithm continuing to push suicide content to 
vulnerable children.
    Child privacy protection advocates, including many parent 
groups, are already on the record in support of a national data 
privacy standard. It is just one piece of protecting children 
online.
    This is difficult to get right, but it is imperative that 
we do. Through many discussions with stakeholders, we 
determined that an underlying framework of protections must be 
strong and consistent, no matter the user, young or old. For 
this reason, any legislation to protect kids online must be 
rooted in a comprehensive national standard for data privacy 
and security to ensure there are broad protections. As long as 
there are regulatory gaps, companies will exploit them in order 
to monetize the data captured and refuse to do more to shield 
children from bad actors like cyberbullies, sex predators, drug 
dealers, and others trying to do harm. This can't be allowed to 
continue.
    I can't emphasize this enough: We need legislation like 
ours that protects children from having their information 
harvested, like geolocation data--gives everyone the power to 
delete the information collected on them, and opt out of 
collection together--altogether, provides greater transparency 
over the algorithms these companies use to manipulate and 
amplify the information we see, and requires assessments for 
how algorithms harm children.
    Last week, we had a hearing with the Federal Trade 
Commission. We raised concerns about the direction of the 
agency related to the unilateral rulemaking efforts. I believe 
the FTC should be the preeminent data protection agency in the 
world, but it needs to be at the direction of Congress.
    I appreciate the work of the people in this room to ensure 
that we get this legislation right. Our efforts have shown us 
that the single best way to protect Americans in today's 
digital ecosystem is with a national privacy and data security 
standard, and the American people agree. More than 80 percent 
of Americans say that they are looking for Congress to act. It 
is our responsibility to ensure their data privacy and 
security, and to even higher levels of protections for their 
kids. It is time to rein in Big Tech.
    [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mrs. Rodgers. I look forward to your testimony, and I yield 
back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And now I 
recognize the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, for 5 
minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Chairman Bilirakis.
    For decades we have sought to safeguard Americans' 
fundamental right to privacy with a series of fragmented 
sector-by-sector laws. Anyone with a smartphone, laptop, or 
tablet can tell you that we are not getting the job done. The 
alphabet soup of well-intentioned Federal privacy laws--HIPAA, 
COPPA, FERPA, GLBA--have failed to rein in the collection, use, 
and transfer of Americans' sensitive data. That is partly 
because they were not designed for our modern online economy.
    FERPA, or the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 
passed in 1974. HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability 
Accountability Act, passed in 1996. GLBA, or the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act, which addresses privacy within the financial 
sector, passed in 1999. And COPPA, or the Children's Online 
Privacy Protection Act, became law in 2000. So the phone wasn't 
released--or I should say that the iPhone wasn't released until 
2007. In internet years, these laws are dinosaurs.
    So today, health information is no longer confined to the 
relative safety of a doctor's filing cabinet. Fitness trackers 
monitor our heart rates, sleep patterns, and oxygen saturation 
levels. Health information websites provide diagnosis and 
treatment information on every possible medical condition. 
Mobile applications track dietary, mental, and reproductive 
health. But the HIPAA privacy rules only restrict the use and 
sharing of health information by healthcare providers, 
clearinghouses, and health plans. As a result, some of the most 
commonly used websites, apps, and devices have the green light 
to mine and use Americans' health information without 
meaningful limitations.
    The lack of strong privacy protections threatens Americans' 
financial information, as well. Existing financial privacy laws 
largely do not apply to retailers and online marketplaces, nor 
do they provide protection from discriminatory algorithms.
    Likewise, existing children's privacy laws leave vast 
amounts of children and teens' sensitive information 
unprotected. FERPA, the privacy law protecting educational 
records, does not apply to private and parochial elementary and 
secondary schools. It also doesn't apply to EdTech downloaded 
and used at home or in afterschool programs to supplement or 
complement children's schoolwork. And COPPA only restricts 
online operators from collecting data from children under the 
age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent, but 
only under limited circumstances.
    Children's data collected on sites like TikTok, Instagram, 
Google, Facebook, and Snapchat is not protected unless the site 
knows it is collecting information from kids under 13. So this 
honor system has become a get-out-of-jail-free card for Big 
Tech companies, which often claim that their services are 
intended for users 13 or older. But we know children are on 
these sites and apps. Sixty-four percent of children between 8 
and 12 years old report watching online videos on platforms 
like TikTok and YouTube every day. Nearly one in five say they 
use social media every day.
    So simply tweaking current child privacy laws will not 
sufficiently protect our nation's youth. That is because age 
verification is notoriously challenging and has proven to be 
ineffective. After all, children today are digital natives. 
They know how to bypass popups asking for their age or birth 
date and can enter these virtual playgrounds with little 
parental supervision and meager privacy protections.
    So we also know that parents' use of the internet routinely 
provides information about their children, either directly or 
by inference. When a parent or guardian goes online to research 
and sign up for summer camps, family vacations, Little League 
teams, gymnastic classes, or a broad variety of other 
activities, they share data about their children, and that 
information is then used and shared for targeted marketing and 
other purposes. As a result, protecting kids and teens' privacy 
requires us to protect everyone's privacy.
    So that is why we must pass a comprehensive privacy bill 
that closes the gap and enshrines Americans' right to privacy 
in law. We need a bill that reins in the overcollection of 
information by mandating data minimization. And we need a bill 
that puts all Americans back in control of how the data is 
collected, used, and shared.
    Last Congress, as, you know, most of my colleagues have 
already mentioned, this committee overwhelmingly passed such a 
bill with broad bipartisan support. I am committed to getting a 
bill over the finish line, and look forward to continuing to 
work with Chair Rodgers and our subcommittee chairs to that 
effect.

very much, I appreciate it, the gentleman yields back.

STATEMENTS OF MORGAN REED, PRESIDENT, ACT-THE APP ASSOCIATION; 
 DONALD CODLING, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY, 
     REGO PAYMENT ARCHITECTURES, INC.; EDWARD BRITAN, VICE 
   PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AND HEAD OF GLOBAL 
   PRIVACY, SALESFORCE, INC.; AND AMELIA VANCE, FOUNDER AND 
           PRESIDENT, PUBLIC INTEREST PRIVACY CENTER

                    STATEMENT OF MORGAN REED

    Mr. Reed. Chairman Bilirakis, Ranking Member Schakowsky, 
and members of the subcommittee, my name is Morgan Reed, and I 
am the president of the App Association.
    The App Association is part of a $1.8 trillion global 
ecosystem that supports 6 million American jobs. Our members 
are often tiny companies but quite literally serve all 435 
congressional districts. And most importantly, our member 
companies are building products that help your constituents 
manage their health, their finances, and their education.
    For example, two companies--Thinkamingo in your district, 
Mr. Chair, and Kidz Learn in your district, Ms. Schakowsky--
must manage the intersection between COPPA and FERPA and the 
gaps that exist. In healthcare our companies like Podimetrics 
help veteran warfighters manage their diabetic foot issues, and 
Rimidi gives doctors a platform to manage remote patient 
monitoring, all while dealing with HIPAA rules for both data 
portability, but also how to govern data that may be outside of 
HIPAA's very narrow scope.
    But regardless of the regulatory silo, what our members 
hear from consumers is loud and clear: They want access to 
their information--health, education, and financial--in digital 
form, and they want to manage it on their smartphone. Moreover, 
they want all of that to happen in an environment that meets 
their expectations around privacy and security. This is a tall 
order, but one that is made more difficult by the lack of 
Federal privacy legislation, the current odd silos of privacy 
regulation that put parts of their personal data under HIPAA, 
others under FERPA, some under GLB.
    And what consumers feel like as a random mishmash really 
devalues the trust that we need in the system. And consumers 
need to trust our members are delivering the next wave of 
digital tools and services in a manner that protects privacy 
and secures data against bad actors. With this in mind, I want 
to focus on three concepts.
    First, expanding HIPAA is a nonstarter. HIPAA is a 
portability and interoperability regime. It is right there in 
the name. The P stands for portability, not privacy. It is 
designed for insurers and providers as part of a narrow set of 
covered entities providing healthcare services to patients. 
Expanding HIPAA to all entities processing data with any 
connection to health--like grocery stores--under the concept of 
social determinants of health would turn the Office of Civil 
Rights into a second FTC.
    Practically speaking, consumers don't need another FTC, 
especially when the staff of 72 that already oversees 6,000 
annual complaints, many of them unrelated to privacy. And we 
also don't need grocery stores, mapping apps, and smart ag 
platforms to make all of their data interoperable with 
electronic health records, which is HIPAA's primary purpose.
    But we can't shrug and walk away. Instances where digital 
health apps process or transfer sensitive personal data in ways 
that go against consumers' expectations are numerous. After the 
FTC entered a consent order with period trapping--tracking app 
Flo, we sent a letter to this committee arguing that the 
conduct of Flo is one of the most important reasons for a 
comprehensive privacy bill. But that privacy bill cannot be an 
outgrowth of a health record portability law. We need your bill 
to become law.
    Number two, financial services go beyond Gramm-Leach-
Bliley, and we need a risk-based framework to better empower 
consumers. Like HIPAA, GLBA only applies to a narrow, already 
defined group of entities. We need to, A, ensure that after 
financial data is passed from a GLBA-covered entity to the 
consumer, it is treated as sensitive PII; and B, provide a 
risk-based framework so that the financial services industry 
understands where their liability risks are and, most 
importantly, aren't, so that the industry can spur innovation.
    Lastly, FERPA overlaps with the FTC Act and its child 
requirements under COPPA, resulting in uncertainty for parents, 
commercial industries, and the education institutions alike. We 
need to improve clarity and avoid making confusion worse. Some 
data is opt-out under FERPA but opt-in under COPPA. This helps 
no one.
    We need to focus on ensuring that a Federal bill benefits 
all persons of any age and avoids convoluted fictions like 
adding a constructive knowledge threshold to COPPA, which will 
neither be constructive or add knowledge. And we need to 
modernize verifiable parental consent requirements currently in 
place so that parents and developers can actually make VPC work 
and make it harder for some to simply pretend that all of their 
audience is over 13.
    Ultimately, privacy enforcers need better tools. When Tom 
Hanks' character was stranded on a remote island in the movie 
Cast Away, he used an ice skate to remove a tooth. What the FTC 
needs is not more ice skates, tools that don't fit the job and 
cause more pain than is necessary. The FTC and my members need 
a statute that specifically prohibits privacy harms resulting 
from processing, collection, and transfer that go against 
consumer expectations.
    Thank you for inviting me to this important discussion, and 
I look forward to your questions.

    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    Our next witness is Donald Codling, senior advisor for 
cybersecurity and privacy for REGO, the REGO Payment 
Architectures.
    You are recognized, sir, for 5 minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF DONALD CODLING

    Mr. Codling. Commerce Committee Chair McRodgers, Ranking 
Member Pallone, Subcommittee Chair Bilirakis and Ranking Member 
Schakowsky, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for 
inviting me to testify. My name is Donald Codling, and I am the 
senior advisor for cybersecurity and privacy.
    For over 23 years, I worked in the FBI in various 
investigative programs focusing on international cyber crime 
and national cybersecurity operations. These programs 
particularly emphasize cybersecurity challenges that impact the 
global financial services, energy, and healthcare industries. I 
also served as the FBI's chairman of an international cyber 
crime working group that consisted of the heads of cyber 
investigative departments of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States. My experience in 
cybersecurity and the FBI have taught me to identify areas of 
cyber risk and assess its threats.
    What we are now experiencing in the financial industry is 
the convergence of several trends that, though individually 
benign, will collectively cause unnecessary harm to our 
Nation's children.
    The first trend is the rapid adoption of mobile devices by 
children under the age of 18. According to Statista, 97 percent 
of households with children under the age of 8 either have a 
smartphone or tablet that the children use exclusively.
    Secondly, according to a report by Mastercard, the COVID-19 
pandemic doubled consumer adoption of cashless payments.
    Finally, the purchasing power of the under-18 demographic 
has significantly increased in recent years. The National 
Retail Federation reports that children influence 87 percent of 
a family's purchases, and preteens are spending their own money 
at over twice the volume compared to 10 years ago. Businesses 
know the enormous potential of the under-18 market. Yet this 
perfect storm of financial and technology trends is worsened 
because Federal laws and regulations have not kept up with the 
advent of a cashless society.
    It is true that the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
Act of 1998 makes it unlawful for online companies to collect 
the personal information of children under 13. This is an opt-
in process, while the parent must actively engage and agree to 
that data collection.
    However, most fintech companies that provide financial 
services products to children adhere to the privacy protections 
of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. Under GLBA, companies 
must offer an opt-out option for nonaffiliate data sharing.
    But there is no opt-out option for affiliate sharing. This 
means the default setting for these websites and financial apps 
allows for the collecting and sharing of data between the ages 
of 13 and 17 for children with nonaffiliated third parties, 
unless the parent proactively opts out. In fact, there is often 
no ability for the parents to opt out of sharing of their 
children's financial transactions between affiliated companies.
    Keep in mind that, according to a report by Superawesome, a 
London-based child privacy firm, by the age of 13, mobile 
applications have collected over 72 million data points from 
just one child.
    Though Federal laws are currently not adequate to make it 
unlawful for such behavior, it must be the responsibility of 
companies to take steps to protect our children's privacy. I am 
proud to be an advisor for REGO, who has developed the only 
certified COPPA and third-party GDPR-compliant financial 
platform for families and children of all ages. REGO is 
designed to be implemented as a white label offering for banks 
and credit unions, giving them the ability to provide a secure 
family banking platform that is fully integrated with their 
bank's brands and systems.
    Since its inception in 2008, the core of REGO was built 
around the concept of data minimization, where the only 
information collected for children under 17 is the date of 
birth. That is it. REGO has created a family digital wallet 
experience that cannot function without the explicit consent 
and approval of the parent. This includes requiring parental 
approval for others to deposit money into the child's account 
or restricting children to purchase items only from parental-
approved vendors, critical security features that many popular 
mobile payment apps do not have but should.
    In my experience, no other financial technology company has 
child data and privacy protections so integrated into its 
foundational strategy except REGO. On behalf of REGO, we 
support the enactment of strong, comprehensive, and bipartisan 
Federal privacy legislation like ADPPA that includes strong 
data minimization and the data security standards and will 
update privacy laws to protect children. We believe that REGO 
is a perfect example of how you can create innovative fintech 
products and services that incorporate ADPPA standards and 
treat your users as customers instead of as products.
    Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to 
participate today. I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. Next we have a witness, Edward 
Britan, from the head of global privacy for Salesforce.
    You are recognized, sir, for 5 minutes.

                   STATEMENT OF EDWARD BRITAN

    Mr. Britan. Thank you. Chairman Bilirakis, Ranking Member 
Schakowsky, and members of the subcommittee, my name is Ed 
Britan. I lead Salesforce's global privacy team, a team of 
professionals located across the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific 
regions. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. It is a 
privilege to be here today.
    I am passionate about privacy and the urgent need for a 
comprehensive U.S. Federal privacy law. I have spent almost two 
decades focused on helping companies comply with global privacy 
and data protection laws, including roughly 2 years at 
Salesforce, 7 years at Microsoft, and 7 years helping a range 
of companies at Alston and Bird.
    Global privacy laws have changed significantly during my 
career, with a particular inflection point being effectuation 
of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, in May of 
2018. Since then, comprehensive privacy laws frequently modeled 
on GDPR have passed all over the world. The U.S. is now one of 
the few developed nations lacking a comprehensive privacy law. 
The UK, Japan, Brazil, Kenya, and Thailand have all passed 
comprehensive privacy laws since the GDPR went into effect.
    This is not to say that the U.S. has never been a thought 
leader in this space. In fact, the core concepts in GDPR and 
most other global privacy laws build upon ideas first 
introduced in 1973 in a report published by the Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare, the HEW Report.
    The HEW Report introduced rights to access, delete, and 
correct personal information, the data minimization inaccuracy 
principles, and restrictions on automated decision making. 
Further, it called for these concepts to be included in 
comprehensive Federal privacy legislation. Had the U.S. taken 
that action, our industry, a crucial driver of global 
innovation and economic growth, might not be facing the current 
crisis of trust that led our CEO, Marc Benioff, to call for a 
comprehensive Federal privacy law beginning in 2018.
    But it is not too late for Congress to act. The world has 
advanced the concepts that the U.S. first introduced. Now, as 
we approach the 15th anniversary of the HEW Report, the U.S. 
can reassert its leadership by passing a comprehensive Federal 
law that builds on the current global standard and advances 
global privacy law for the next 50 years and beyond.
    So why do we need a comprehensive Federal privacy law, and 
what should that law look like?
    We need a Federal privacy law because privacy is a 
fundamental human right. It is also essential for preserving 
other human rights, such as life, liberty, speech, and freedom 
from discrimination. Polls show that a majority of Americans, 
regardless of political affiliation, strongly favor increased 
legal protections governing companies' use of personal 
information.
    The right to privacy cannot be sufficiently protected by 
the current sectoral approach at the Federal level or by the 
individual State laws. The current U.S. sectoral laws are 
effective and influential, but they are not sufficient. Without 
comprehensive legislation, there are significant gaps in 
protection. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, HIPAA, effectively protects data related to 
health conditions and provision of healthcare held--data held 
by providers and health plans. HIPAA fails, however, to cover 
health-related data that may be collected by noncovered 
entities such as through connected devices and online services 
that monitor and improve health and fitness.
    States have sought to fill the national gap in privacy 
protection by passing comprehensive privacy laws of their own. 
Salesforce welcomes this development. These State-led efforts, 
which have taken place in red States and blue States, are 
important and demonstrate the need and demand for comprehensive 
privacy law.
    However, one's level of privacy should not depend on their 
ZIP Code. Congress should be inspired to build upon these 
State-led efforts in setting a national standard which ensures 
that these privacy protections are held by all Americans. That 
Federal law should address core privacy principles, including 
transparency, individual control, data minimization, security, 
individual rights of access, correction and deletion, risk 
management, and accountability.
    More specifically, the Federal law should include enhanced 
protections for sensitive data, children's data, mandatory data 
impact, and algorithmic assessments, prohibitions on using 
personal information to discriminate, the controller processor 
distinction, and restrictions on third-party targeted 
advertising.
    Congress has made great strides toward passing a 
comprehensive Federal privacy law. Last year this committee 
passed the American Data Privacy Protection Act, ADPPA, by a 
resoundingly bipartisan vote of 53 to 2. While there are 
undoubtedly aspects of ADPPA that every stakeholder would like 
to change, ADPPA reflected a hard-fought compromise that would 
meaningfully protect privacy, increase trust in industry, and 
position the U.S. as a world leader on tech issues.
    Salesforce welcomes the role of regulators in shaping 
responsible innovation. Presently, the world is looking to EU 
regulators and GDPR to write the rules of the road for emerging 
technologies like generative AI. With ADPPA, the U.S. has 
proposed important ideas that should be part of the global 
conversation.
    The path to providing world-leading privacy protections for 
all Americans is clear. Now is the time for Congress to pass a 
comprehensive privacy law that builds upon the existing global 
standard and reasserts U.S. leadership on privacy and data 
protection. Thank you.

    Mr. Bilirakis. And last but not least, certainly not least, 
Amelia Vance from the founder and president of the Public 
Interest Privacy Center.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes. Thank you.

                   STATEMENT OF AMELIA VANCE

    Ms. Vance. Chair Bilirakis, Ranking Member Schakowsky, 
Chair McMorris Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone, and members of 
the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify on the 
need for better child and student privacy protections.
    My name is Amelia Vance, and I am president of the Public 
Interest Privacy Center; chief counsel of the Student and Child 
Privacy Center at AASA, the School Superintendents Association; 
and an adjunct professor teaching privacy law at William and 
Mary Law School. For the last decade I have focused exclusively 
in my career on child and student privacy.
    Children require exceptional privacy protections. They are 
not yet equipped to weigh the potential benefits and risks of 
data collection and use. Gaps in Federal laws and a patchwork 
of State laws mean privacy protections for kids and students 
are outdated and confusing. Even when clear, these protections 
contain numerous loopholes that leave children unprotected from 
companies, predators, and other threats that endanger their 
health, support systems, and social development, and future 
opportunities.
    Congress should enact baseline Federal privacy protections 
for all consumers that include additional protections for 
children and students that recognize children's unique 
vulnerabilities. Without proper privacy safeguards, children's 
lives and futures could be irreparably harmed.
    I would like to focus my testimony today on a few key 
points: first, existing Federal law does not adequately protect 
children and students online; second, efforts by States has--
have primarily created confusion and hampered efforts by 
schools, districts, and parents to protect kids online; and 
third, baseline consumer privacy law with special protections 
for children would be a meaningful step forward to protect kids 
online.
    As discussed in the opening statements, two major Federal 
laws provide the bulk of privacy protections for children and 
students online: the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
COPPA, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 
FERPA. However, both of these have significant gaps that fail 
to provide children and students with the protections they 
deserve.
    For instance, COPPA only applies when apps or websites 
collect data directly from children under 13. It does not 
protect children when websites or data brokers collect 
information about them. Even more concerning, most of COPPA's 
limited protections can be easily waived by one click of 
parental consent.
    FERPA only directly regulates schools, not EdTech 
companies, saddling schools and educators with the burden of 
policing large companies and corporate data practices. This is 
an enormous problem, especially since those school vendors are 
responsible for more than half of student data breaches.
    FERPA also only protects student information when EdTech is 
used in the classroom. The minute that a child goes home and 
stops using that app for homework, or the teacher suggesting 
it, FERPA protections go away and companies have free rein.
    These are serious shortcomings in Federal law created in 
large part by lightning-fast growth in tech. Recognizing some 
of these issues, States have introduced and passed child, teen, 
and student privacy protections at an astounding rate. But even 
when these laws have been successful and have not created 
confusion, we are still left with a legal landscape riddled 
with far more gaps than many people realize. We need updated 
Federal data privacy protections.
    ADPPA is a strong and important step forward. But when 
addressing general consumer privacy protections, it is critical 
to remember children are uniquely vulnerable to certain harms, 
and we must create meaningful protections to safeguard them. We 
have all seen recent headlines of dire consequences of 
insufficient privacy protections. For example, student 
information including detailed mental health and sexual assault 
records was posted online after a Minneapolis school district 
was hacked. The lives of these students are forever changed, 
and the worst moment of their lives may follow them every time 
someone Googles their name.
    While increasing data security is one method, new 
protections must also minimize the data that is collected in 
the first place and ensure data is deleted when it is no longer 
necessary. Action to address these harms must be balanced with 
the real benefits that technology can provide to children 
learning and social connection. However, we need to make sure 
that those protections are rooted in a strong underlying, 
comprehensive consumer privacy law so children are still 
protected the day after they turn 13 and the day after they 
turn 18. Thank you so much.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Vance follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you so very much, and excellent 
testimony by all of you. We appreciate it so much.
    I will begin the questioning. I recognize myself for 5 
minutes.
    In the 1990s Congress responded to the rapid growth of 
online marketing tactics that targeted children by passing the 
Children's Online Protection Act mentioned many times, COPPA. 
In the decades since COPPA's enactment, unfortunately, we have 
seen far too many violation settlements between the FTC and Big 
Tech. Instead of protecting children under COPPA's guardrails, 
Big Tech has determined the value of exploiting kids' data is 
higher than the cost of FTC fines. In fact, they seem to 
operate their budgets to account for these fines. This is an 
unacceptable business practice, I think you all agree.
    So this question is for the entire panel, but please be 
brief in your questions, because I only have a limited amount 
of time--in answering the questions. In your experience, what 
are the ways in which COPPA does not go far enough in its 
protection of children?
    And what are some circumstances where a parent might expect 
their child's data to be covered, but in reality it is not? 
Could you provide us with some concrete examples?
    We will start from here, sir. Mr. Codling, please.
    Mr. Codling. Thank you, sir.
    REGO protects the child's financial data, whether online or 
purchasing in a retail store, as an example. And part of its 
basic foundation is data minimization constantly, continuously. 
And quite frankly, sometimes that hasn't been super popular 
with the marketing folks. But the mantra has always been, ``Do 
not collect more than the absolute necessary amount of data on 
that child in particular.'' Therefore, you don't have to 
protect something that you have never collected.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Very good.
    Ms. Vance, please.
    Ms. Vance. As I mentioned, COPPA is limited to information 
collected from children, which I think many parents would be 
surprised by.
    But there is also confusion about whether COPPA protects 
information when you have a label of ``family-friendly'' or 
``kid-safe.'' And many parents assume that, when they download 
an app or have their child access a website with those labels, 
it is protected not only from an appropriateness standard, but 
also from a privacy standard. And it, generally, is not.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Britan. I think the greatest shortcoming with COPPA, as 
has already been mentioned, is that it only protects children 
of 13. Children 13 to 18 aren't protected under COPPA. It is 
also really hard to identify children. So the best way to 
protect children broadly is to pass baseline comprehensive 
privacy law that broadly regulates personal data of everyone, 
including children.
    Mr. Bilirakis. I am happy to agree with that, sir.
    Mr. Reed, please.
    Mr. Reed. I will make this quick. Pretty much everything 
everybody else said, but I will say one aspect that has been 
phenomenally important: verifiable parental consent has to work 
for parents. Right now we call it the over-the-shoulder test. 
If the device has to go over the shoulder, come back to the 
parent, and they have to enter in something, the parent then 
says, ``You know what, just go to the general audience app.''
    So as--we think your bill is really important because it 
protects people of all ages. Because when we are building the 
technology, if you make it too hard for the parent to use, then 
they won't always use it.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. Congress needs to do--to once 
again respond to the new wave of online marketing tactics that 
fuel Big Tech's ad-based revenue stream and enact a 
comprehensive, as I said, Federal data privacy law--everyone is 
in agreement on that--to close these gaps. That is why we are 
having this hearing.
    All Americans, no matter their age, deserve privacy 
protections, just as you said, sir. It is clear that privacy 
protections should not end when you turn 13.
    So my last question, because I am running out of time, Mr. 
Codling, it seems like you already--you are already practicing 
a data minimization principle, as we included in last year's 
bill. It seems clear that REGO cannot only comply but continue 
to succeed if a comprehensive data privacy law is enacted. Is 
that accurate?
    Mr. Codling. Yes, sir. That is completely accurate.
    Mr. Bilirakis. OK. You note in your testimony that REGO is 
the only certified COPPA-compliant financial platform for 
families and children. Can you explain what that certification 
means and what you have to do to--what do you go--how do you 
get that certification? How do you go through it?
    Mr. Codling. Yes, sir. It requires a very, very detailed 
audit where a third party--in our case, a company called 
PRIVO--is granted full access not only to our website, but our 
internal workings, our internal platform. They run tests of 
placing data in certain areas of an app, as an example, 
determine how that data is utilized, where is it stored, how is 
it processed, and, more importantly, how is it protected.
    And that audit goes every single year. You look through any 
time there is a significant change in the app's performance or 
the app's features, it is run again through this audit, and we 
are told, ``Yes, you are in compliance. Here are some areas you 
need to fix.''
    Mr. Bilirakis. So it is a valuable tool. How many companies 
are part of this, the certification program, now?
    Mr. Codling. I do not know that, sir, but we can certainly 
get you that----
    Mr. Bilirakis. Yes, please get back to me on that.
    Mr. Codling. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Bilirakis. All right. I appreciate it very much. Thank 
you.
    All right. Now I recognize Ms. Schakowsky from the great 
State of Illinois for your 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you so much, and I really appreciate 
the testimony that we are hearing.
    The--we had a hearing last week that dealt with data 
brokers who are buying and selling Americans' information. And 
I would like to focus first on healthcare information. And Mr. 
Reed, let me ask you about that. So what kind of sensitive 
information do health apps have right now?
    You know, we talked about what is covered, but what are the 
kinds of things that people ought to avoid, maybe giving it a 
little alert that their health data could be collected?
    Mr. Reed. Well, I think right now you are highlighting the 
problem by having this hearing and pushing for the Federal 
bill.
    We actually operate under multiple State laws that have 
different perspectives. California has its own tweak on 
sensitive health information. The reality is, in many 
instances, it depends on the platform itself and the product 
itself. Generally, it is the State laws. And for a lot of our 
members, they have to abide by GDPR. But, as we--everybody has 
pointed out, it should be the United States Government that is 
also providing that insight.
    Right now, too much data that people consider to be 
sensitive personal health information is available in 
conditions that I don't think people are aware of.
    Ms. Schakowsky. What kind--can you describe what kind of an 
app would it be that people----
    Mr. Reed. Well, I think----
    Ms. Schakowsky [continuing]. Should avoid?
    Mr. Reed [continuing]. One of the things that--the best 
example I can give is there is a very well-known website that 
has a portion of it that is COPPA that--I mean, sorry, that 
follows HIPAA and is a HIPAA-compliant entity, and another part 
of the website allows people to report their symptoms and have 
discussions about their symptoms and have a sense of community 
about it. But the information that they are typing into that 
website is available to be harvested for providing targeted 
behavioral advertising.
    So I think that people oftentimes are misled by, as you 
said--heard earlier--by the names of the product in a way that 
can allow that data to flow to data brokers in a way that 
doesn't meet their expectations, and that harms the healthcare 
industry as well as the mobile app industry.
    Ms. Schakowsky. I want to--your--in your testimony--maybe 
it is just really naive of me, but it says 97 percent of kids 8 
and under. Was that the number?
    Voice. Yes.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Are--either have a smartphone or a tablet.
    Mr. Reed. They have access to a smartphone or a tablet, 
right. Especially nowadays, when schools are providing this 
technology as part of the curricula and the way that students 
are receiving their curricula.
    So as Amelia Vance talked about, this gets very important 
on this overlay between what you are doing at school--you take 
your homework home--or for a growing community, for home 
schooling, what happens with that information? Does it meet the 
parents' expectations?
    And I would go back to, for my industry, the key thing we 
need is trust. And when we don't have trust, nobody will buy 
our products. So it is important that there is a good Federal 
comprehensive privacy law that help us better eliminate the bad 
actors, and so that we are not pushed out and we lose that 
trust.
    Ms. Schakowsky. I wanted to go to Ms. Vance about this 
issue too.
    Just--I mean, of course, when I think about education now, 
kids, little kids, are online. I wonder if you wanted to add it 
to that--add to that, what we need to--how much more we need to 
do, and why this is a problem.
    Ms. Vance. Specifically related to data brokers?
    Ms. Schakowsky. About children.
    Ms. Vance. About children in general?
    Yes, I mean----
    Ms. Schakowsky. Especially----
    Ms. Vance. I think----
    Ms. Schakowsky. I guess beyond the educational, but that 
they are on their phones.
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely. So as I think everyone knows by now, 
your phone is the computer in your pocket that tells everybody 
where you are, what you are doing, sometimes what you are 
thinking. And that is, of course, so much more sensitive when 
you are talking about kids who--their brains are still 
developing, they may post things or say things that they 
immediately regret or shouldn't have shared. And that 
information is already out there.
    And particularly when we are talking about outside of the 
school context, when we are talking about the information 
coming from someone over the age of 13 or where there is 
another gap in COPPA, all of that is fair game for bad actors 
to take it and use it to market products, to potentially sell 
it, or otherwise----
    Ms. Schakowsky. Let me ask one final question about kids.
    Can we fully protect our kids' privacy if we don't also 
protect the parents' privacy?
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely, we need to protect parents' privacy. 
Just think of the last Amazon search you did, and the presents 
that you may have gotten your kids, or a workbook or a book 
about a learning disability. That information is incredibly 
sensitive, and so parental information needs to be protected, 
as well.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you for that question. It is so true. 
That is why we need the comprehensive bill, because one goes 
with the other. And so we are filling the gaps.
    All right. Now I recognize the chairwoman from the great 
State of Washington, my friend Mrs. Rodgers, for your 5 
minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A big thank you to 
all our witnesses for being here today.
    I wanted to continue down this line about how we have these 
layered laws around privacy. We have the FTC Act, we have 
FERPA, HIPAA, other sector-specific laws, and kind of what Ms. 
Schakowsky was getting to, the ranking member: Americans think 
their data privacy is being protected, and yet there's many 
examples where it actually is not. And part of our goal with a 
comprehensive privacy bill is to address the gaps and make sure 
that people are protected, but also that innovation will 
thrive.
    And, you know, this is our sixth hearing, as others have 
mentioned. It is also--it is just--we continue to feel like 
we--you know, I want to make sure--and I wanted to ask Mr. Reed 
about this--we celebrate the small businesses, the 
entrepreneurs, the innovators, and we want that competition to 
continue as we enact a national data privacy law.
    So would you speak to what we have learned as far as the 
regulatory framework, and what resources do your members have 
to navigate not only this emerging patchwork of laws now that 
we see at the State level--the sixth State just implemented 
their own State law--but also the gaps in the other laws?
    Mr. Reed. Well, absolutely. And look, the reality is that, 
when you are a small business, trust is the most important 
thing that you can sell. Yes, your product has to work. Yes, it 
has to be a change element for the company or person who is 
buying it. But ultimately, nobody is going to use it if they 
don't trust you. And if you don't have the money to buy a Super 
Bowl ad, then you need to have an environment where trust is 
assumed. Therefore, having comprehensive privacy laws help.
    And you talked about the State bills that have passed, but 
I don't know if you realize this: There are 289 currently 
introduced State privacy bills happening right now. I have a 
member of staff, my staff, who literally builds a State map of 
all of the privacy bills and how they are changing right now. 
We are happy to provide it for you.
    The reality of that is that most of our members--and this 
is something superinteresting from an entrepreneurship 
perspective--my smallest member, including the ones in your 
district, are actually international businesses. They might 
only be 2 people, but they are selling mobile applications in 
100 countries around the world. So having a bill that you pass 
mesh with GDPR is crucial for them to be able to innovate and 
sell globally while making domestically.
    So from a tools perspective, I hope our trade association 
can help. That is my job, is to help them navigate it. But what 
you can do is provide them clear rules of the road that apply 
to the large companies that provide the infrastructure that we 
depend on, whether it is the platforms, whether it is the edge 
providers, whether it is our cloud computing services. If 
everyone in the food chain has the same set of rules, then 
small businesses can follow the rules in a way that gets them 
there.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. I also wanted to ask you--because 
in your testimony you caution us on deferring entirely to the 
agency rules--Health and Human Services, HIPAA. As you know, 
FTC just announced their commercial surveillance rulemaking. It 
just--well, it was just weeks after we actually passed our bill 
out of committee last July.
    But would you speak to your concerns around the FTC going 
its own way to establish rules in this space?
    And do you think the FTC by itself has the ability to fill 
all the gaps created by these current----
    Mr. Reed. Well, the answer to your final--the last part of 
the question is no. And we just touched on it with the 289 
State bills. The Federal Trade Commission can't issue the kind 
of preemption that we are absolutely going to need for small 
businesses to be able to manage their compliance.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK.
    Mr. Reed. We don't have 100-person compliance departments 
in order to do that.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    Mr. Reed. So right off the bat, we can't do it.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. I want to get to Mr. Britan too. I 
wanted to get to some of the new AI models that are--we see. We 
see reports every day about companies that are using AI, and 
there is--you know, and using reckless, transparent methods 
when they are incorporating AI into their products.
    Just--would you speak to how risky some of the AI use is in 
processing of the data, in the heightened risk, and just how a 
data privacy law might help these new applications for AI? In 
30 seconds, yes.
    Mr. Britan. Absolutely, yes. There is no doubt that AI is 
powered by data, so the best way to ensure that AI is built 
responsibly is comprehensive regulation of data. And that is 
how the EU is presently looking at AI and regulating AI and 
examining generative AIs through the GDPR.
    And so advancements in AI hold great promise, but they also 
highlight the need for a Federal comprehensive privacy law, so 
that the U.S. has a voice in how these technologies develop 
responsibly.
    Mrs. Rodgers. I appreciate that. We will dig into that 
more.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. And now I will recognize Ms. 
Blunt Rochester for her 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Kelly, I didn't see Ms. Kelly. Ms. Kelly, I will 
recognize you for your 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Chair Bilirakis and Ranking Member 
Schakowsky, for holding this important hearing this afternoon. 
It is critical that this subcommittee continues the discussions 
to ensure our Nation's laws provide adequate protections for 
Americans' personal information. So I want to thank the four 
witnesses for sharing your expertise.
    As a chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, I am deeply 
concerned that sector-specific healthcare privacy law does not 
cover vast amounts of consumers' health-related data. Although 
many think their personal health data is secure, the reality is 
that consumers have few protections under the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act.
    In fact, HIPAA does not provide privacy protections for 
health information, and only limits health data using and 
sharing by healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and 
health plans. This allows many health apps, websites, and 
devices to share information with a host of advertising 
companies and other uncovered entities. Reports confirm that 
some of this data transfers include terms like ``HIV,'' 
``diabetes,'' and ``pregnancy.''
    Common sense tells us that highly personal, intimate health 
information should be protected, regardless of the context in 
which that data is collected and used. Mr. Reed, I have a 
couple of yes-or-no questions for you. Does information about 
cardiovascular health become any less sensitive when collected 
by a fitness tracker rather than a cardiologist?
    Mr. Reed. No.
    Ms. Kelly. Does information about a patient's symptoms 
become any less sensitive when collected by a website rather 
than a physician?
    Mr. Reed. No.
    Ms. Kelly. Does information about reproductive health 
become any less sensitive when collected by an app rather than 
a gynecologist?
    Mr. Reed. No.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you for those quick responses. Lastly, Mr. 
Reed, is there any good reason why apps, websites, and fitness 
trackers shouldn't be required to safeguard consumers' 
sensitive health information and treat it with the same care as 
a physician? And please feel free to explain.
    Mr. Reed. This is the hard part. The legislation you are 
all proposing has important factors like data minimization and 
the right to delete. But when something is in your electronic 
health record and you are a physician, that information, it is 
really important that it not be deleted and the physician have 
the full totality of your record.
    So we have to be very careful when we consider who the 
audience is for the product. A physician that doesn't know 
about your hypertension because you have deleted it might give 
you the wrong medication. So when we talk about it in that way, 
we have to look at it as, what does the physician need to know 
to treat you? And that is critical.
    Separately from that, we also want fulsome data so that 
patients can treat themselves. By 2030 we will be 90,000 
physicians short, and communities of color are more affected by 
that than anywhere else. At the same time, you see tools that 
allow the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes being 
absolutely critical to those communities.
    So what we need--and your legislation helps to provide, the 
committee's legislation helps to provide--are some rules of the 
road for sensitive personal information. But I want to be 
careful that we don't suggest that what the doctor gets is 
covered in the same way, because the physician must know about 
your condition over time to properly treat you.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you for your response.
    I also think it is important that any Federal privacy law 
we consider must strive to end data-driven discrimination. 
Simply put, any legislative proposal must strengthen civil 
rights protections by prohibiting discrimination using personal 
information. That is why last Congress I was proud to support 
the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, which prohibited 
covered entities and their service providers from collecting, 
processing, or transferring data in any way that discriminates 
or otherwise makes unavailable the equal enjoyment of any goods 
or services on the basis of race, color, religion, national 
origin, sex, or disability.
    Mr. Britan, how would enhanced protections for specific 
types of sensitive data, notably data related to race, color, 
religion, national origin, sex, or disability, promote equality 
and civil rights?
    Mr. Britan. Absolutely. We support those provisions of 
ADPPA, as well. And those types of protections will give 
individuals more power to control these sensitive categories of 
data and how they are used by companies. And I think giving 
individuals that power is what privacy law should be and data 
protection law should be all about, adjusting that power 
balance and giving power to people.
    We also support the civil rights provisions that you 
mentioned that were included in the ADPPA around prohibiting 
discriminatory uses of data. That is a very important means to 
protect individuals, regardless of any actions they may take on 
their own behalf to protect their data.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you so much.
    And again, thank you to all the witnesses, and I yield 
back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. I appreciate it very much, and I 
will--5 minutes to Dr. Bucshon.
    You are recognized for your 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you, Chair Bilirakis, for calling 
today's hearing.
    Before coming to Congress I was president of a medical 
practice. I was a surgeon in southern Indiana and was acutely 
aware of how important it was to protect the health data and 
personally identifiable information of our patients and to 
comply with the requirements laid out in HIPAA.
    As technology has advanced and society is gathering and 
utilizing ever greater amounts of data, it is very clear there 
are gaps in health data protections, as we have talked about 
some in this hearing. This committee needs to be thinking about 
the best ways to cover these gaps as it considers a national 
privacy and data security framework.
    Interestingly, I was just with Chair Rodgers in Europe, and 
we met in Brussels with the EU. We did talk about this and 
about GDPR. And one of the things I want to make sure we avoid 
is the effect that we can possibly have on small and medium-
sized businesses if we do the wrong thing here. So there is a 
fine line to be drawn.
    Mr. Reed, in your testimony you mentioned cases where 
nonhealth information can be used to extrapolate health-related 
information that--and that putting extra restrictions on such 
information would limit consumers' access to digital health 
tools. I understand that concern and agree that we do not want 
to limit access to such tools, but I still believe private 
health information probably deserves greater protection than 
many other kinds of data. In fact, for the most part, it is the 
most monetizable data in the world, health information, in many 
people's estimation. By that I mean people get your data and 
they can make money with it, as people know.
    Would it be feasible to require disclosures from an entity 
to a consumer if the entity does use or gather data to 
extrapolate private health information?
    Mr. Reed. So, Doctor, I think that is something that we 
continually work on. In your district there is a company called 
Anew that helps with----
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes.
    Mr. Reed [continuing]. Farm elements and agriculture. One 
of the problems we run into there is, as you know, under social 
determinants of health you could run into what they do, which 
is agriculture and food, being considered health data. So I 
agree with you.
    And you are right, what we--we calculate that, if I get 
your full health profile, including key information, it is 
about $7 a person. It is the most valuable information on the 
black market possible.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes.
    Mr. Reed. And so, completely right. I do think, though, we 
have to think about the totality and that we don't end up with 
grocery stores and the company in your district that provides 
agriculture technologies being there. So yes----
    Mr. Bucshon. What----
    Mr. Reed. Absolutely.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, what would be the biggest challenges 
implementing something like that, if we----
    Mr. Reed. Exactly, exactly what we just talked about: How 
do we make sure that it is sensitive information about you?
    We look at things like physiologic data. Does it record 
physiologic data about you? We already have that. The FDA 
already explores these questions of collection of physiologic 
data. I think those are elements of it. But as you know, we 
have to preserve the ability to do research, as well. And 
whether it is through an IRB or other methodologies, we need to 
be very careful about not requiring such extreme data 
minimization that you can't do the research we need to do.
    Mr. Bucshon. Sure, I understand.
    Mr. Reed. Or cancer clusters, et cetera.
    Mr. Bucshon. And most research is de-identified 
information----
    Mr. Reed. Correct.
    Mr. Bucshon [continuing]. Anyway, right?
    Mr. Reed. Right. Well, you have to be very careful because, 
depending on which lawyer you talk to, the definition of de-
identified is a moving line.
    Mr. Bucshon. I understand frequently you can extrapolate 
who it is, based on that.
    Mr. Britan, you had comments on that, the same issue?
    Mr. Britan. I would say the same thing, you know, and I 
would just say be on notice--notifying people of when that 
information is being used. We need a regime that protects the 
data--that protects data use for these purposes, regardless of 
whether an individual takes action to protect themselves and 
providing all these notices----
    Mr. Bucshon. Agreed.
    Mr. Britan [continuing]. It has to be actionable, and I 
think people should be protected, regardless of whether they 
take action.
    Mr. Bucshon. Agreed. In fact, I would say the vast majority 
of people don't know that their health information is very, 
very valuable, and that it is one of the things that is at 
biggest risk of all of their privacy data. I am focusing on 
health here because I was a doctor.
    Mr. Reed, are there any guardrails for the use or 
transmission of personal health information not covered by 
HIPAA that could protect users in these cases without limiting 
access to digital health tools?
    So what can we--what should we do?
    Mr. Reed. So I think we are going to be a broken record on 
this entire panel. I think that we need to move forward with 
the bill that you have. There are some sections, section 702--I 
mean, sorry, 207--where there are elements that could affect 
doctors like you in terms of having to kind of double dip and 
be covered by both in a way that I don't think is helpful. But 
overall, I think comprehensive privacy reform that, as this 
panel has discussed, provides notice, provides actionable 
items, gives tools to the FTC when it is outside the domain of 
healthcare is the way to move.
    Mr. Bucshon. OK. As I said, the--even some of the EU people 
who we talked to, they didn't directly admit it, but you could 
tell by their comments that they do have the concerns with GDPR 
because of startups, small and large businesses--small and 
medium-sized businesses struggling to comply. And we want to 
avoid that situation here in the United States.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Doctor. I now recognize Ms. Blunt 
Rochester for her 5 minutes of questioning.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
so much to the witnesses. Your testimony makes it abundantly 
clear that a comprehensive Federal data privacy law is 
desperately needed in this country.
    Last year I was proud to support and vote out of committee 
the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, and I am ready to 
work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this 
bill passed and to the President's desk for signature.
    While there are several gaps in our current sectoral 
privacy regulation system, I am alarmed by the rise of dark 
patterns, especially for children, and the use of health data 
without effective regulation. Over the last several years the 
FTC has detailed the ubiquity of dark patterns that misled 
consumers, as well as the misuse of health data on apps not 
covered by HIPAA.
    To follow up on Ms. Schakowsky's questions, Ms. Vance, your 
testimony highlights the issues surrounding manipulative device 
design practices, often known as dark patterns, that are 
intended to trick people, including children, into making ill-
informed choices. While deception isn't a new problem, 
deception and manipulation in the age of social media and 
mobile apps has changed the game. That is why I am planning to 
reintroduce the DETOUR Act, which would crack down on deceptive 
design practices that undermine user autonomy.
    Ms. Vance, in your opinion, how pervasive a problem are 
dark patterns?
    Ms. Vance. I think we see across the internet that they are 
everywhere. Every, you know, smaller ``no, I don't want this'' 
button, every ``no, I don't want to be smart when I don't 
subscribe to this newsletter,'' and sort of pushing people to 
stay on and keep on the apps and the games and the website, 
which is maybe good in the case of a math app and getting kids 
to read more but incredibly problematic in manipulating people 
against their will with no idea that it is happening.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Yes. I have to tell you, I--for a 
while there I thought it was me, but I literally could not find 
these little X's to X out of things. I mean, I know I am not 
the only one now, and it is just ridiculous.
    And, you know, are dark patterns especially pernicious when 
it comes to children's usage of online products?
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely. Children's brains are still 
developing, and they won't necessarily notice as easily as an 
adult might that they are being pushed in a certain direction 
or driven further down a rabbit hole of videos they are 
watching or monetization from games.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Yes. Well, given the examples that you 
noted in your testimony, do you believe a comprehensive privacy 
bill that includes regulations on dark patterns is a more 
effective approach than a privacy bill that only protects 
children?
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely, especially since those, when they 
turn 18, go to higher ed, and that affects all of their 
futures.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Yes.
    Ms. Vance. It is essential.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you.
    And any other--Mr. Reed, I see you have got your hand up--
on dark patterns?
    Mr. Reed. I think it is important to note that the issues 
you are talking about, about not being able to find the X, that 
actually hurts small businesses a lot.
    If I have a mobile app, the numbers are very simple. If I 
build an application and I charge $1 for it on the store, I get 
1 download for every 100 I get of an ad-supported application. 
But if you download my ad-supported application where I am 
using someone else to provide that ad, and you can't find the 
X, you stop using my app.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. So true.
    Mr. Reed. So the issue, as she points out, I don't care how 
developed your brain is, if you can't find that X, you stop 
using my product.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Right.
    Mr. Reed. And so, as we clean up the industry, as we have 
this kind of legislation, it helps everyone do a better job.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Yes, yes.
    Mr. Reed. Thanks.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you, Mr. Reed.
    Mr. Britan, did you have something you wanted to share on 
dark patterns?
    Mr. Britan. Sure, yes. I would just say Salesforce strongly 
believes that people should not be misled or tricked into 
making decisions based on dark patterns. I think the DETOUR Act 
would help in this regard, and the DETOUR Act as part of a 
comprehensive bill would be even better.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you so much.
    And Mr. Codling, is there anything you want to share on 
dark patterns?
    Mr. Codling. Not directly with dark patterns, but as an 
example, because REGO is COPPA-certified, part of that 
certification process is to review the privacy policies, to 
look at the websites and specifically not allow certain dark 
pattern kind of behavior, to make the privacy policy age 
appropriate.
    So there is one privacy policy for the parent and there is 
one for the child to say, here is what we are doing with your 
stuff and here is what we are not doing with it. It goes to 
your point, ma'am, about can I find the X quickly? Yes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Yes. Thank you so much. I have some 
additional questions that I will enter for the record for Mr. 
Reed, particularly on HIPAA and the health aspect of this, the 
health--I am on the Health Subcommittee, as well.
    And so I will yield back the--actually, I don't have time 
to yield back, but I will yield back the time I don't have. 
Thank you.
    Mr. Walberg [presiding]. You always have time. You always 
have time to yield back.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you.
    Mr. Walberg. I thank the gentlelady, and I recognize myself 
for my 5 minutes of questioning.
    And thanks so much to the panel for being here. This is a 
topic, as we have said, we must continue looking for solutions.
    Children's privacy protections need to be updated. That is 
very clear. Whether at school or at home, there are significant 
gaps in how their information is protected. The pandemic and 
forced school closures made that even more clear. I am glad 
that there were so many online resources for parents and 
teachers and grandparents to turn to when their children were 
unable to go to school. Educational apps and websites offer 
immense benefits, and I would much rather my grandkids use them 
over social media. We at least can choose those apps.
    But there are also very concerning reports of these apps 
and tools collecting and selling children's data for 
advertising. An article by the Washington Post last May 
reported that nearly 90 percent of educational apps and 
websites were designed to send the information they collected 
to advertising tech companies to help them predict potential 
buying habits of kids. Some EdTech platforms unnecessarily 
request access to students' cameras and locations.
    And so I would ask for unanimous consent to include that 
article for the record.
    Without objection, and I--hearing none, it will be 
included.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Walberg. I serve on the Education and Workforce 
Committee, as well, which has jurisdiction over the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA. I have also been 
an avid supporter on this committee for updates to COPPA and 
kids privacy overall. With at least a decade behind us since 
either of these laws were updated, neither of these laws 
reflect the realities of today's digital world.
    Mr. Vance, there are clearly gaps and confusion on when and 
to what extent--excuse me, Ms. Vance--these two laws protect 
children's privacy. What is the result of this confusion for 
kids, parents, and schools, and how do we provide greater 
clarity?
    Ms. Vance. As Morgan was saying, they lose trust in 
vendors, in their schools, in other parents, in society itself. 
It undermines everything we do if we can't do the digital 
equivalent of step outside our front door without some harm 
potentially falling from the sky.
    And so it is incredibly important that we have these 
comprehensive privacy protections, with heightened protections 
for children.
    Mr. Walberg. Mr. Reed, as I said, the explosion of digital 
education services is great, but I am extremely concerned how 
common and easy it is for apps to collect, store, and sell 
children's data.
    In your testimony you indicated that COPPA and the FTC's 
guidance sufficiently holds EdTech and schools accountable for 
their privacy practices. But obviously, significant amounts of 
information about kids are being collected and sold by these 
tools every day. Where does the issue lie?
    Mr. Reed. I think, in the case of my testimony, I misspoke 
in the sense of sufficient, in the sense that they have 
authority over sufficient areas, but the gaps are huge.
    One of the areas that creates the greatest concern--I think 
it is really important you talk about--is verifiable parental 
consent issues. I appeared before this committee, I think, in 
2010 as a vociferous advocate for VPC. Unfortunately, 
verifiable parental consent has not taken the world by storm. 
And instead what you see is even limited amount of friction 
causes parents to basically say, ``Well, use the general 
audience portion of the application.''
    One of our members actually provides--is a safe harbor and 
provides services to another person on this panel. And what 
they find is the cost of getting the parent engaged and to do 
these steps is oftentimes something the parent doesn't want to 
do. As I talked about earlier, we call it the over-the-shoulder 
problem. The moment the parent can say, ``Oh, go to the Kids 
YouTube, it is too hard, go to regular YouTube,'' we have lost 
them. I testified multiple times at the FTC about this.
    We need to have the platforms that are part of our 
ecosystem have more flexibility to provide either credentialing 
or flags to my members to say, ``Hi. To the best of our 
knowledge, this user is a child. You need to behave in this 
manner when we pass that flag.''
    Unfortunately, right now you heard my fellow panelists talk 
about auditing. The platforms are not in a stage where they 
want to audit 1.5 million applications that are currently on 
their platforms. But if there were a way for the FTC to be more 
flexible in providing that flag, then that is something that 
the FTC, through your authority, can use to say, ``Hey, you 
were provided this flag, you didn't use it, you didn't get rid 
of that information.'' It is a tool the FTC can use to get to 
what you want.
    But merely expecting more from parents is not going to get 
the solution that you are after and that, frankly, all of your 
panelists are after.
    Mr. Walberg. Well, clearly, yes, we are--a comprehensive 
privacy law would fill many of the gaps we discussed today, but 
I also believe that we need to take another look at both FERPA 
and COPPA.
    Thank you. My time is ended. I yield back, and now I 
recognize Representative Clarke.
    Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank 
our ranking member for holding today's hearing.
    I would also like to thank our witnesses for being here to 
testify on such an important issue. Passing legislation to fill 
the gaps in current privacy laws is long overdue, and I remain 
committed to working with my colleagues across the aisle to 
pass a bill that protects all Americans' data.
    Mr. Britan, in your testimony you cite the EU's GDPR as a 
driver of core privacy concepts like data minimization, the 
right to access, delete, and correct data, and guardrails on 
automated decision making. In your opinion, does the U.S.'s 
lack of a comprehensive national privacy standard inhibit our 
ability to lead or even participate in the global conversation 
on rights to data privacy and human rights?
    Mr. Britan. Absolutely. And it is table stakes to enter 
those conversations. I believe we share these values with our 
allies all over the world, but at some point we have to 
demonstrate that through action.
    Ms. Clarke. Absolutely. I see you nodding your head, Mr. 
Reed. Would you like to add your position on that?
    Mr. Reed. I think Mr. Britan said it as well as any of us 
can, which is we need to demonstrate through action.
    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Mr. Britan, I would like to follow 
up and ask how the lack of a clear national standard will 
impact the U.S.'s ability to lead in data-intensive innovations 
like generative AI, quantum computing, and smart cities.
    Mr. Britan. Salesforce welcomes regulation, and regulation 
is really important for ensuring that these new, innovative 
technologies are released in a responsible manner. Because if 
we release it in a way that reduces trust, it is virtually 
impossible to regain that trust.
    And there's important global conversations happening right 
now. This is an amazing time for tech innovation, and the U.S. 
needs to be part of that conversation. In order for the U.S. to 
be an effective part of that conversation, we need 
comprehensive privacy law.
    Ms. Clarke. We can't be the weakest link, in other words.
    [Pause.]
    Ms. Clarke. Absolutely.
    OK. Mr.--sorry--Ms. Vance, do any parts of COPPA require 
analysis of how algorithms may disproportionately cause harm to 
certain groups?
    For example, some algorithms may show content that may be 
more dangerous if shown to children than the general 
population. Is there anything in COPPA requiring companies to 
look into how their algorithms affect children?
    And what about FERPA?
    Ms. Vance. No, there is not in either law. And that is part 
of the reason why ADPPA was so exciting for me, because that is 
an invaluable and important protection.
    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Well, it is my position that 
comprehensive privacy legislation is long overdue and 
absolutely necessary for the U.S. to maintain leadership in a 
range of industries driving innovation. Our laws have failed to 
keep pace with revolutionary innovations, leaving Americans 
more vulnerable to discriminatory algorithms, invasive data 
collection, and cyber attacks. Increases in the amount of data 
available have earned--have created enormous and unprecedented 
consumer benefits. But we need legislation to ensure vulnerable 
populations are not--are, excuse me, are protected against 
discrimination, exploitation, and manipulation.
    So I want to thank all of you for your expertise and 
bringing it to bear today in this--in today's hearing. We look 
forward to working with you as we move us into the 21st 
century, as I like to say.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis [presiding]. I appreciate that very much. Now 
I will recognize Mr. Duncan from the State of South Carolina 
for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this 
hearing and the continued work that you are doing on this 
important issue.
    I want to ask all four witnesses--and I will start with Mr. 
Britan--from whom should we be protecting the data of American 
citizens? Who is the greatest threat here, is it Russian 
hackers, Communist Chinese, big American companies, identity 
thefts, predators?
    And from your unique perspectives, who is the threat that 
we, as policymakers, need most to focus on to protect our 
citizens, especially kids and teenagers?
    Mr. Britan. Those are all significant threats that I think 
a comprehensive privacy law would help us to address.
    The greatest threat is going to be the one that we don't 
know about, and it is really hard to predict. And I think 
baseline protections that include data minimization and 
treating data as a potential liability and the reduction of 
data and managing data responsibly and in an organized fashion, 
understanding who has access to the data and that sort of data 
management capabilities is the best way to address all of those 
threats.
    Mr. Duncan. OK. Mr. Reed?
    Mr. Reed. I think we have to be thoughtful. All of those 
are good, but there is a company in your district, Topography 
Digital, that does drone and a lot of other really cutting-edge 
technology. I think we have to realize that the biggest threat 
to the success of the companies in your district, like them, is 
the unexpected, for the loss of trust that happens.
    So when we talk about threats from outside influences, what 
you really see is most of the data ends up in the hands of 
somebody who isn't going to do harm, just wants to make money 
off of it. But that destroys the trust and degrades the value 
of the systems we are providing.
    So on the one hand, you absolutely should be focused on the 
international threats and the security, but we also need a 
comprehensive bill so that consumers know what to do and what 
the products are going to do to them, so they know if they are 
going to share the data. So it is the insidious ones that 
aren't there to harm, just there to make money off of it, that 
create the loss of trust sometimes.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes.
    Ms. Vance?
    Ms. Vance. I can't agree enough with my fellow panelists.
    I would add anything that has the opportunity to destroy a 
child's future, whether it be information that data brokers are 
collecting and sharing with anyone who asks for it, or the use 
of that information by stalkers, parents with restraining 
orders, pedophiles, et cetera, that is really, I think, the 
greatest threat.
    Mr. Duncan. Mr. Codling?
    Mr. Codling. Your question is excellent, sir, so I will 
split it into two areas. There is the criminal activity, and 
then there is the national security activity.
    Criminal activity, cyber crime organizations, have become 
truly globalized. They have vertically integrated their 
capabilities to the state that they are as good as nation 
states, some of these criminal activities.
    A national security standpoint, of course, you have got to 
be very concerned about the Chinese, Russians, Iranians, North 
Korea.
    But a perfect example from a child's privacy protection 
standpoint, the worst-case scenario is something like TikTok or 
some other social media platform that can come in, aggregate 
the data that the child in this case is utilizing from the 
social media standpoint, and if that company platform also 
offered financial services capabilities, because those are 
affiliated companies that data is going to flow back and forth 
between those two. And Lord only knows where that stuff will 
end up.
    So in my FBI career we spent a lot of time finding out 
where that stuff ended up.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes.
    Mr. Codling. Typically, it was not in your home district. 
It was overseas someplace.
    So just last week, TikTok made an announcement that they 
are very interested in working with large American retailers to 
allow individuals on the TikTok platform to purchase, buy, 
engage in commerce. To me, as an uncle, that is a nightmare. 
There is no good end of that with that particular company. I am 
not going to paint everybody in the same way.
    It does scare me, because I can now build a complete data 
dossier on that individual as a young person and have now those 
last couple of little gaps filled in. I know who you are and 
what you are and what you have been doing since--pick an age. 
That is very, very concerning.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes. OK. If Congress were to pass a Federal 
privacy law, what single provision would be the most essential 
factor in that new law being successful?
    And I will ask Mr. Codling.
    Mr. Codling. I think having a comprehensive law, sir, puts 
the United States, to my--the panelists' opinion--back in the 
game. We should be the leaders. We were the leaders.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes.
    Mr. Codling. We can be again.
    Mr. Duncan. Let me ask Mr. Britan real quick. Mr. Britan, 
same question, yes. Eight seconds.
    Mr. Britan. Yes, I think the key is to build these 
responsibilities and apply these responsibilities to the 
companies that process data, and ensure they are processing it 
responsibly.
    I think the notice-and-choice regime has failed. It puts 
too much burden on the individual. We need a comprehensive law 
that comprehensively regulates data.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, identify the threat----
    Mr. Reed. I am going to say one word: preemption.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, yes, oh, yes. Identify the threat and then 
craft something to combat it. And you do that in football, you 
do that in war.
    So I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. I thank the gentleman, and I will recognize 
Ms. Castor from the great State of Florida, and my fellow Tampa 
Bay resident. Go Rays.
    Ms. Castor. Go Rays. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
and thank you to all of our witnesses for being here to discuss 
data privacy.
    I strongly support this committee moving forward 
expeditiously with a comprehensive data privacy law that 
protects the personal privacy of all Americans, and I have been 
particularly focused on the harms to children and just recently 
filed--refiled my Kids PRIVACY Act that was developed with 
advocates like you and parents and pediatricians from all 
across the country. And it is time to act. I was heartened last 
session that the committee included portions of the Kids 
PRIVACY Act in ADPPA, but we really need to move forward 
quickly.
    And on kids, one of the things that we aim to do is raise 
the age. Right now there is--really, it is just kids 12 and 
under who are protected. Ms. Vance, is there any reason that we 
shouldn't give all adolescents a fighting chance here and 
protect their privacy by increasing the age?
    Ms. Vance. I think that is absolutely vital.
    We also need to recognize, though, that teenagers have 
different needs, are at a different developmental stage. And so 
making sure we are taking that into account, as well, is really 
important.
    Ms. Castor. That is why, in the Kids PRIVACY Act, I created 
a protected class, so it is not quite as stringent as COPPA, 
but the Children's Online Privacy Protection law right now, it 
is so outdated. When was it first adopted?
    Ms. Vance. In 1998.
    Ms. Castor. In 1998. Think of all the technological changes 
since 1998 in this huge surveillance and data-gathering 
enterprise that exists right now. We have got to move now to 
update this.
    You also, Ms. Vance, in your testimony highlight the fact--
you kind of compare what the Europeans did in the GDPR, which 
is their privacy law, and then explained in your testimony that 
they followed on with an age-appropriate design code. So that 
is actually missing from ADPPA. Do you recommend that the 
committee also begin to develop an age-appropriate design code? 
Some States have done this, as well, but--what is your 
recommendation?
    Ms. Vance. I think it definitely needs to be based on the 
foundation of a comprehensive consumer privacy law, and that is 
really what has led to a lot of the successes in the UK with 
their age-appropriate design code.
    Obviously, the EU legal landscape versus the U.S. legal 
landscape is not the same. So there's a lot of details to work 
out, as California is finding out. But the principles, the 
underlying, you know, location, off-by-default, just-in-time 
notifications, consideration of different age ranges and what 
is appropriate, all of that are protections that should be 
here.
    Ms. Castor. Isn't it interesting that some States are 
moving to banning social media outright? And it is such--it 
seems like, you know, it is appealing, it is kind of a--based 
upon all the harm that we know that it is causing to mental 
health, addiction, and things like that.
    But wouldn't privacy protections come first, and then a 
design code to require that apps and platforms actually design 
their products with kids in mind? Isn't that the most important 
thing that we can do right now, and is--I don't know that 
banning social media is even--if that is even realistic. What 
do you think?
    Ms. Vance. I completely agree. We shouldn't punish kids for 
the bad actors, whether it be the companies, individuals on 
social media, or websites or apps. We should acknowledge we 
need to protect the spaces that they are going to go into.
    We all know how innovative kids can be when it comes to 
getting around particular restrictions. And so it really is 
important to make the world that they are living in, that they 
are going to go into safe, no matter what website or what app 
it is.
    Ms. Castor. And we have the ability and the authority to do 
that by passing new, modern laws that put the kids' interests 
first and direct that apps and platforms actually develop these 
with kids in mind, and then not allow them to target children 
with advertising. That is pretty basic in privacy laws that are 
being adopted across the country towards--for children, isn't 
it?
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely. Almost every one of the 140 State 
student privacy and child privacy laws that have passed in the 
past decade ban targeted advertising across the board for kids.
    Ms. Castor. Well, I encourage the committee to move 
expeditiously, and I thank the witnesses and Ms. Vance for 
being here. Thank you.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. I now recognize Dr. Dunn from the 
State of Florida for your 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Dunn. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    At our last hearing I mentioned that the Chinese Communist 
Party seeks to sabotage freedom and democracy everywhere that 
it exists. And this mentality permeates throughout all of 
China's corporations, as well, including those that operate in 
America.
    Despite American leadership and technology, we still do not 
have a comprehensive national privacy standard. Ironically, 
China does.
    However, China's privacy law, the personal information 
protection law, is in reality a national surveillance plan. 
Their law forces data sharing of every person and business in 
China with their government. Their law puts everyone's personal 
details at grave risk of government surveillance, and their law 
enables their government to individually target citizens for 
concentration camps, enslavement, and even death. It literally 
enables the Chinese Communist Party to target individuals who 
are a potential source for organ transplantation, and the 
government knows whose genetic codes match whose, and they will 
murder and steal organs at will. Thus, their law does not 
protect privacy at all. It gives all their data to the 
government. Most of all, it certainly doesn't keep China from 
hacking Americans' data.
    I want to remind my colleagues and my fellow Americans of 
some of the largest data breaches in the last decade, all of 
which left millions, hundreds of millions, of Americans' data 
exposed.
    [Chart displayed.]
    Mr. Dunn. I refer you to the poster behind me, starting 
with Yahoo and going down to the final entry there, U.S. 
Government employees with security clearances, 20 million 
hacked.
    The American Data Privacy and Protection Act is both a 
privacy bill and a cybersecurity bill, and we need both. 
Protecting Americans from privacy invasion by domestic and 
foreign companies is important. And when we choose to share our 
data voluntarily with them, the security of our data in that 
company is also essential. Information that is not secure 
cannot be private.
    Without a comprehensive privacy standard, we can't stop Big 
Tech, the Communist Chinese Party, TikTok, or anyone else. When 
Big Tech and data brokers compile large troves of data, they 
are creating massive targets for malicious Chinese hackers and 
others. We cannot allow them to profit from our loss or 
inattention.
    Mr. Britan, thank you for your testimony. You have spent 
the last two decades working on global privacy and data 
protection policies. In hindsight, what are the key Federal 
provisions you would recommend to protect Americans' data?
    Mr. Britan. I think a strong Federal law has to have all 
the rights that were first introduced in the HEW Report that 
exist in GDPR and most global laws: the rights to access data, 
obtain a copy of data, to delete your data. I think that the--
but that is not enough. That is the first step.
    We couldn't--we can't--we shouldn't put the burden of 
protecting privacy entirely on individuals. I think what really 
sets ADPPA apart are the obligations it puts on companies to 
protect individuals, regardless of whether or not they exercise 
their rights. And those are obligations around mandatory 
assessments, obligations around corporate responsibility, and 
the duty--the duties that are included in ADPPA for companies.
    Mr. Dunn. Excellent, excellent. So there are certain 
guardrails we think should be put--we talk about it as 
minimization of data, but guardrails on what data is being 
allowed to be collected and by whom. Can you comment on that, 
Mr. Britan?
    Mr. Britan. Yes, absolutely. I think data minimization is--
we view it as a good thing. It is not a new concept. As I 
mentioned, it is something that has existed since the HEW 
Report.
    I think the key thing that ADPPA does is it forces data 
collection to be purposeful. It forces you to think about the 
data you are collecting and why you are collecting it, and have 
a strategy. And as you mentioned, that is going to be so 
critical for minimizing the data we have, ensuring we have it 
for the right purposes, ensuring that we have proper access 
controls around that data. That all has to be documented and 
analyzed under ADPPA, and that is going to be some of the best 
protection we have against the threats that you identified.
    Mr. Dunn. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Codling, in your testimony you mentioned that your 
experience with the FBI has informed your conducting 
cybersecurity assessments. What, in your opinion, is the most 
vital and vulnerable personal information the government 
collects on individuals?
    Mr. Codling. I am going to follow some of Mr. Britan's 
comments of data minimization, data minimization, data 
minimization, all day long. Then you have less material to 
defend. You have less material to be concerned about if you 
never collected it.
    Data thieves are completely going to go after children's 
data, particularly their financial data. And the fact that you 
have a blank slate when you are a young person, data thieves, 
nation states can come in and destroy your credit before you 
even realize that you needed credit.
    Mr. Dunn. Ah, the Equifax hack. Well, thank you very much 
to the entire panel for your time and testimony.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very much, Doctor. I will 
recognize now Mrs. Trahan for her 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mrs. Trahan. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Bilirakis and 
Ranking Member Schakowsky, for calling this important hearing.
    Today's meeting is just another example of the bipartisan 
consensus on this committee that the current laws governing the 
internet fail to protect users and our most sensitive 
information. And it further highlights the importance of 
passing a strong, comprehensive privacy law like the American 
Data Privacy and Protection Act, and doing so urgently.
    As many of my colleagues on the committee are aware, I am 
deeply concerned about what the emergence and embrace of 
education technology means for privacy and data of our 
children. Students and parents rarely have the option to 
withhold consent when using education technology or providing 
their data for platforms and devices used by schools. That is 
why I unveiled draft legislation 2 years ago to detail concrete 
steps Congress should take to protect student privacy and rein 
in tech companies.
    And I am grateful that, when this subcommittee met to 
consider ADPPA last Congress, the chairman and ranking member 
worked closely with me to improve the bill to specifically 
protect students, including an important clarification that 
EdTech companies are not exempt from the bill simply because 
they work with schools.
    Ms. Vance, in your testimony you mentioned that EdTech 
companies must comply with FERPA only to the extent that 
schools negotiate those restrictions in their contracts. In 
your opinion, do you think it is right to place that burden on 
schools?
    And do you believe they have secured sufficient privacy 
protections for their students in those negotiations?
    Ms. Vance. It is absolutely unfair to put that burden on 
schools, just as it is to put child privacy protections burden 
on parents. You often don't have a dedicated privacy person, 
security experts, and others who can adequately protect that. 
And whether a company is small or large, they have more 
personnel who can do that than an individual school.
    Mrs. Trahan. Well, I couldn't agree more. I don't think 
superintendents or principals should be responsible for 
negotiating our kids' data rights with multibillion-dollar 
companies. And I certainly don't believe that parents should 
have to pore over school district contracts with EdTech service 
providers to understand where the protections negotiated by 
their schools are strong enough. At the end of the day, the 
burden should be on the companies to design their services with 
privacy at the forefront and minimize the data that they 
collect.
    There is bipartisan agreement that data on minors should be 
considered sensitive data, but there are different views on how 
we should set standards for when a company knows a user is a 
minor. Ms. Vance, again, would you agree that, regardless of 
the company's size, a company should protect user data as 
sensitive children's data when the company targets and markets 
the products to serve K-through-12 students?
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely.
    Mrs. Trahan. I agree. And we have discussed three 
circumstances where companies generally must take extra 
measures to protect kids data: first, in the school setting, 
where education records collected--excuse me, where education 
records collected by most schools are protected; second, when 
companies direct services towards children; and third, when 
companies have actual knowledge that users are children.
    Are there other circumstances where you think companies 
should give heightened protection to kids' data, and can you 
explain how you think about those requirements?
    Ms. Vance. Absolutely. We briefly mentioned the UK's age-
appropriate design code in a previous question. The creator of 
it asked a question on a working group I was in several years 
ago: What if kids didn't have to lie to be on the internet? 
What if they could have the same experience? And that doesn't 
mean making the internet kid-proof; it means I can say that I 
am a kid, I can say that I am a teen, under 18, and have 
tracking pixels and other things turned off.
    Mrs. Trahan. Yes.
    Ms. Vance. And I think that isn't something that we have 
necessarily considered here. It doesn't have to be a kid-
proofed internet or a Wild West. It can be a good place for 
kids to grow up in.
    Mrs. Trahan. Well, I share those concerns and that view of 
how the internet could be. And I think that there are important 
lessons here.
    As our committee discusses the failures that exist in other 
laws, we always need to be on the lookout to strengthen the 
legislation that we work on and pass today. So I am grateful, 
certainly to the chairman and ranking member, members of the 
subcommittee, for their continued attention to these important 
issues, but really grateful for your expertise and bringing 
that to the subcommittee today.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. The gentlelady yields back. Now I will 
recognize the gentlelady from the State of Arizona, site of the 
NFL draft tonight.
    I will recognize you for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Reed, according to a January 2022 report from the 
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, the growing 
patchwork of State laws will cost small businesses at least 
$200 billion over the next 10 years. Given the differing levels 
of size and sophistication that businesses may have, how 
important is it to small businesses that a data privacy law is 
clear and consistent throughout all of the 50 States?
    Mr. Reed. It is absolutely essential for all the reasons 
you outlined. And I think what is most important about what you 
are trying to do is, it is not just the small businesses that 
will end up complying. It is all of the third parties that we 
depend on to build our products.
    Software is built like Lego. We write something special, 
but it is built of parts from other things, whether it is a 
software development kit or any other tools that we need. When 
everybody has the same rules, it helps the small business build 
something unique and special out of the pieces that we all see 
out in the table.
    Mrs. Lesko. Well, and related to that, my next question, 
followup, is if we keep the status quo and the patchwork of 
State laws continues to grow, how can we expect entrepreneurs 
to take risks and innovate? Will they?
    Mr. Reed. No. And a very good example during GDPR, which we 
have kind of all gotten to deal with, one of our members came 
to me and said, ``Well, so for the past year I have had one of 
my programmers, a full FTE for an entire year, just going back 
through to make sure we complied with GDPR.'' It is a five-
person shop. Now it was--for a year it was a four-person shop. 
That means there were jobs they didn't bid on, projects they 
didn't build, innovations they weren't able to put into it. And 
if I have to do that for 50 States, hire 50 different people 
doing a single year's worth of FTE to comply, it is simply 
unworkable.
    Mrs. Lesko. Yes, I can definitely see that.
    The next question is to any of you: Is there a State data 
privacy law that this committee should look at that is a good 
example that we should either replicate or use parts of it?
    Mr. Codling. Yes, I will throw out California, because 
California Consumer Rights Act and California Consumer Privacy 
Act were leading edge. They actually said, ``We have a problem, 
let's tackle it. It may be a fight in the mud puddle, but let's 
tackle it, and let's move the ball forward.'' So kudos to them. 
And several other States have followed suit with that.
    Mr. Reed. I am going to go in a different direction. 
Virginia and five other States--Virginia, Colorado, 
Connecticut, and others--have done bipartisan legislation that 
I think is worth looking at.
    Mrs. Lesko. All right, very good. One last question, and 
this is, quite frankly, to any of you: What changes, if any, 
should be made to the American Data Privacy Protection Act that 
we passed out of committee last Congress to make sure we put 
consumers in control of the data shared through their smart 
home systems?
    Ms. Vance. I think one of the really important things, as I 
mentioned, there is a lot of intangible privacy harms when it 
comes to kids, when it comes to all of us. And so making sure 
that we are really looking at protecting not only a physical 
safety issue, but also something that may happen down the road, 
the misuse of information that we don't know yet is going to 
happen but history tells us it almost certainly will. So 
including more protections against those sorts of intangible 
harms would be invaluable.
    Mrs. Lesko. OK. And does anybody have any input on 
specifically smart home systems?
    [No response.]
    Mrs. Lesko. No? All right. Well, thank you.
    Oh, Mr. Reed?
    Mr. Reed. Just that a smart home system is, at the end of 
the day, a way to collect data that should serve the consumer 
who buys it, right? I get a smart home system because I want to 
be able to answer questions in my kitchen. I want the Alexa 
when I say ``Don't forget that I need to buy milk'' to do it. 
The question is, what is done with that data moving forward?
    So I think, when we look at smart home systems, I think, as 
Ms. Vance said, there's some physical security elements when it 
locks your door, when it shuts off your lights that are in 
question. But I think you should look at the totality of it, 
which is it is collecting data on you that should be used for 
the purpose that you want it to do--remind you to take out the 
garbage, play a song, not ship that data to somebody else, to a 
broker that you didn't expect, that ends up shipping you 
something that you didn't want.
    So for that reason, I think smart homes are sensitive, but 
it is part of the larger picture of, ``Hey, I am--I want a 
service,'' and this is what you are doing with the data.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you. Thank you for all of you coming here 
and spending hours with us. I appreciate it.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Well, I tell you what, you asked some great 
questions, Mrs. Lesko. Thank you very much.
    I yield back--she yields back, and we are going to ask Mrs. 
Dingell to ask her--she has 5 minutes of questioning.
    You are recognized.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want you to 
know the NLF draft is in Detroit next year.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Next year.
    Mrs. Dingell. The Debbie Caucus is cheering for the NFL.
    But thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member----
    Mr. Bilirakis. That should be exciting. Am I invited? Am I 
invited?
    Mrs. Dingell. Well, did she invite you? I will.
    Mr. Bilirakis. I will hold you to that.
    Mrs. Dingell. I will. Anyway, thanks for both you and 
Ranking Member Schakowsky for holding this important hearing, 
and this is a subject that is very important to me.
    As I have highlighted at several of these hearings focused 
on privacy, we have got to ensure that consumers are the 
ultimate arbiter of the data while allowing companies to 
perform any action that consumers should reasonably expect from 
the use of a platform device or any other technology. And as we 
all know, but--we do, but too many consumers don't--many 
platforms are already collecting far more data than most 
consumers expect or know, and it is much to their detriment.
    But we must also take into consideration how gaps in 
current privacy law have led to vulnerabilities, such as those 
presented by notice-and-consent regimes and their impact on 
consumer and industry behavior that we must ensure are 
addressed.
    Neither a consumer that dutifully reads the terms of 
service of a platform nor one--and I think this is most 
people--that immediately click yes to this consent request 
currently have sufficient baseline privacy protections and 
availability of consumer choice in the current landscape. And I 
think it is crucial that Congress address this gap in any 
comprehensive privacy legislation we advance through committee 
and the Congress.
    So notice and consent. To best safeguard America's 
sensitive information we need privacy by design, not privacy 
through popups. Unfortunately, our fragmented Federal privacy 
laws heavily rely on the failed notice-and-consent regime. As 
anyone who has ever opened up a checking account or filled out 
paperwork at a doctor's office or applied for a credit card 
online can tell you, notice and consent does not actually 
involve meaningful consent or consumer choice. It is simply 
impractical, especially online, where consumers may visit 
dozens of websites in any given day. And quite frankly, they 
want to get rid of the popup. They don't realize how it is 
impacting their life.
    Mr. Britan, do existing privacy laws provide consumers with 
a meaningful opportunity to understand and say no to an 
entity's data practices?
    Mr. Britan. Thank you for this question. I 100 percent 
agree with you that notice and choice has failed as a privacy 
regime. It puts too much burden on the individual. It is unfair 
to the individual. There is no--most individuals don't have the 
time or the wherewithal or the ability to find all the 
information they need to make meaningful decisions.
    And individuals should be protected, regardless of the 
decisions they may or may not make. There need to be baseline 
protections. I think--that is not to say that notice and choice 
isn't helpful and that we should get rid of notice and choice 
altogether. I think it just should not be the end of the story. 
And there need to be clear obligations and protections that 
apply to individuals, regardless of any decisions they may or 
may not make.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you. I believe that we must move away 
from this failed approach and support data minimization.
    By the way, I don't think most people know how much data 
they are giving away. I just think 98 percent of the people--
and that may be generous--don't. But I think we got--the 
practice of only collecting, processing, and transferring data 
that is reasonably necessary, this is what I think we need to 
move to, and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific 
product or a service.
    Mr. Britan, do you believe that all entities should be 
required to minimize the amount of data they collect on 
consumers by default?
    Mr. Britan. I do. I think data minimization is a good 
thing. It is not a new concept. It is something that existed 
since the HEW Report in 1973. I think data collection should be 
purposeful. Companies should know the purposes for which they 
are collecting data and only collect the data that they believe 
they need to fulfill those purposes. This is--this sort of 
proactive, planful approach to managing data will produce 
better privacy results.
    Mrs. Dingell. Consumers are deluged with constant breaches 
of their privacy and trust: weather apps collecting and selling 
users' location data to the highest bidder; data brokers 
selling--and that is what--this is what people don't realize is 
happening--data brokers selling information collected from 
wellness apps about users' mental health conditions; and kids 
and teens' banking apps that collect sensitive data, name, 
birth dates, email addresses, GPS location history, purchase 
history, behavioral profiles, all about our Nation's youth.
    Mr. Britan, without data minimization requirements in 
place, are companies incentivized to collect, process, and 
transfer user data that is not necessary to provide a specific 
product's services?
    And does overcollection of data increase the potential 
impact of a data breach?
    Mr. Britan. Absolutely. I think we need to shift the 
mindset of companies to, rather than thinking of data as an 
asset, to thinking of it as a potential liability. The more 
data you have, the more surface area you create for potential 
issues and--such as improper access or misuse of that data. So 
even seemingly innocuous data can produce significant impacts 
if it is combined with other data sets or used in different 
contexts than what were contemplated.
    So yes, we need data minimization, and the more data you 
have, the more chances you have of a breach.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, and I yield back with an 
invitation to Detroit for next year.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very, very much. The gentlelady 
yields back, and I will recognize Mr. Armstrong for his 5 
minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Armstrong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Reed, COPPA imposes an actual knowledge standard on 
operators, meaning various duties are only imposed when an 
operator has information verifying that they are collecting or 
maintaining personal data on a minor.
    ADPPA imposes a constructive knowledge standard on high-
impact social media platforms that should have known the 
individual was a minor. Your testimony states that the 
constructive knowledge requirement may result in further data 
collection on all individuals, not just minors, in order to 
verify age. Can you explain that further?
    Mr. Reed. Sure. One of the problems that has existed from 
the initial step of COPPA was--remember, COPPA's initial 
purpose was--COPPA--was to prevent advertising to children. 
COPPA is a collection standard, right? If you collect the 
information, you need to first receive verifiable parental 
consent.
    The problem when you start moving from an actual knowledge 
standard to a constructive knowledge standard is it essentially 
requires companies to start gathering more data on you to know 
whether or not--what the condition of it is. And I said earlier 
in my testimony here, one of the problems is that we aren't 
empowering some of the platforms that might be able to send a 
signal or add a flag as a way for our developers to have that 
information before we ever collect something. Instead, it puts 
us on the mouse wheel of verifiable parental consent, which the 
parents don't like, which leads to problems.
    So overall, though, we think that ADPPA--can we say ADPPA 
now--ADPPA moves us in the right direction. But that is the 
thing to make sure, that we are not actually burdening parents 
with more, not less.
    Mr. Armstrong. Do you think there is any interaction 
between that and the First Amendment right to anonymous free 
speech?
    Mr. Reed. Well, not--we are focused here, instead of being 
on a constitutional law panel on apps. But absolutely, First 
Amendment is something that is critical to my members. They 
care about it. They talk about it. They send me emails about 
it. So absolutely, we need to make sure that whatever we are 
doing here around the privacy, that we do allow for anonymous 
speech in a manner that is--since the birth of our Nation and 
in the Federalist Papers.
    Mr. Armstrong. Your testimony also cautions against 
expanding the use of verifiable parental consent under COPPA, 
which you argue puts the onus on--of privacy protections on the 
consumers. Can you explain those concerns?
    Mr. Reed. Yes, that is exactly what we were just saying, 
that VPC essentially requires the developer to affirmatively 
identify that it is the parent that is providing the permission 
to do things. Once you are through that gate, you can do a lot, 
and that has its own questions.
    As I know Ms. Vance testified in her testimony, once you 
are through that COPPA verifiable parental consent gate, your 
access and ability to use the child's data raises its own 
questions. So I think VPC is onerous on the small businesses 
who impose it, although there are good companies like PRIVO and 
others that provide solutions. But it is also onerous--it also 
creates uncertainty once you have gathered that data, 
especially if you have done it in a way that doesn't comport 
with PRIVO or other VPC safe harbors.
    Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Britan, this hearing is largely focused 
on sectoral privacy laws at the Federal level. But your 
testimony also states that Salesforce would welcome the passage 
of strong, comprehensive privacy laws at the State level. Does 
Salesforce support State privacy laws only in the absence of 
preemptive Federal comprehensive privacy law, or do you suggest 
that States should enact laws in addition to Federal privacy 
law?
    Mr. Britan. I think States should continue to be the 
laboratories for democracy, but I think we need a strong 
national standard. We need to speak with one voice as a 
country. And I think that the States have done great work, and 
we have supported that work because it has advanced the 
fundamental right to privacy in ways that didn't exist 
previously. But I think ADPPA is objectively the strongest 
privacy bill I have seen in the United States, and so I think 
it would set a strong national standard.
    Mr. Armstrong. But we also already exempted--I mean, as 
part of ADPPA was, like, the Illinois Biometric Information 
Privacy Act. The case law that is produced from those laws is 
an important--it has to be a risk for this community. And one 
of the--to consider.
    You know, an Illinois Supreme Court case that was decided 
months after we actually voted on ADPPA fundamentally altered 
the legal ramifications in Illinois and, by extension, the 
ADPPA. That court held that each scan or transmission of a 
biometric identifier or information constitutes a separate 
violation.
    So you are working at White Castle. You have to open a cash 
register with your fingerprint. You do it 10,000 times. That is 
10,000 unique individual counts that can be brought against 
you.
    So when we talk about national privacy, I mean, it just--
how does--well, I will just ask you. How does Salesforce plan 
to mitigate for such compliance risks?
    Mr. Britan. These are tough issues.
    I think, on the issue of preemption, Salesforce understands 
that we need a Federal law. And we understand that preemption 
is one of the issues that is going to have to be a matter of 
compromise. And I think the compromise that was reached on 
ADPPA seemed reasonable. And if that is the compromise that has 
to be reached to get us a Federal law, that is--then Salesforce 
would support that.
    Mr. Armstrong. And I think--I mean, I can agree with that 
to some degree, except then you have a case that comes out 
exactly like this. And I just wonder how smaller businesses 
with less resources are going to be able to deal with it.
    So I would love to, but I am out of time and they have 
called votes, so I will yield back.
    Mr. Bilirakis. The gentleman yields back. I know they 
called votes. We are going to try to get through this so that 
we won't have to come back, but we are going to do the best we 
can.
    I will recognize Mr. Allen for his 5 minutes of 
questioning.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chair Bilirakis, for convening this 
hearing, and I want to thank the witnesses for enduring this 
and talking about this important issue. I would like to follow 
up on Chair Rodgers'--the point she made in her questions about 
the dangers of tech companies recklessly testing their new AI 
models on the masses, specifically children.
    Snapchat has a new feature called MyAI that integrates 
OpenAI's GPT technology into Snapchat's platform offering users 
which are on Snapchat, mainly teens, a new chat bot featured to 
interact with. This interaction can lead to hyperspecialized 
data sets on teens, including their thoughts, their questions, 
and their fears--namely, anything a teen would think to ask 
chat bots. Snapchat would own this data and plans to monetize 
it.
    Mr. Britan, how should we think about data processing 
privacy in a world where users interact with chat bots on a 
wide array of topics?
    Mr. Britan. Yes, I think the best thing that we can do is 
pass comprehensive privacy law. I know I sound like a broken 
record.
    Mr. Allen. Yes.
    Mr. Britan. But I think these advancements hold great 
promise. There is also great potential pitfalls. And I think AI 
is powered by data, and the best thing we could do to ensure 
responsible AI and responsible chat bots is to pass 
comprehensive law regulating data broadly. That is missing in 
the U.S.
    Mr. Allen. Yes.
    Mr. Britan. And in the absence of that law in the U.S., the 
rest of the world is looking at this issue and examining it and 
pushing for responsible regulation. I think the U.S. has a very 
important voice in that conversation and should be a part of 
that conversation, and can be if we pass ADPPA or a law like 
it.
    Mr. Allen. Right. Well, we keep harping on data 
minimization. And certainly, this is the opposite of data 
minimization.
    You know, as a Member of Congress, I am concerned that we 
should be about--I am concerned about what should be about AI-
powered chat bots in the hands of our children. I have got 14 
grandchildren, and I am worried about their interaction and the 
harm that this would do to their future. How valuable would 
this data set be to a business?
    Mr. Britan. It is hard for me to speak. I have worked at 
Salesforce, and I have worked at Microsoft to primarily B2B 
company Salesforce, entirely B2B. So I haven't had in-depth 
experience with understanding the value of children's data at 
Salesforce. We do have some educational projects, but we don't 
sell any of the children's data related to those products. So I 
am happy to say I haven't had to examine that issue in my 
career.
    Mr. Allen. And I assume you agree that this development 
makes a data privacy bill, which you said, even more timely.
    And does everyone on this panel agree that this needs to be 
done as soon as possible?
    Mr. Britan. Yes. I am not in the business of working--don't 
do children. I have three kids.
    Mr. Allen. Yes.
    Mr. Britan. I want them to be protected. We need a 
comprehensive privacy law to protect our kids.
    Mr. Allen. Good. With that, is there anything that you 
would like to add that might accelerate this process as far as 
the Congress is concerned?
    Mr. Reed. Congressman, I think the most important thing 
that would be helpful on this is reminding the Members of 
Congress that the small businesses in their district are 
actually part of this. And the better that you can do a 
preemptive privacy bill that helps the small businesses, it has 
as much of an impact.
    I have heard a lot of discussion about Big Tech, but the 
people that rely on the technology are the people in the 
factories, in the companies. In your district there is Zapata 
Technologies that does some military contracts and other work. 
They depend on a robust data system and a robust privacy 
system. So if you are talking to your members on the floor and 
want to make the case, don't make the case about regulating Big 
Tech. It is for the benefit of their small businesses and U.S. 
innovation, so that we can compete on the global scale.
    Mr. Allen. Right. And I am in meetings, I am having 
meetings all week with small businesses from my district, and I 
am hearing the same thing.
    So with that, I am out of time. Thank you so much for your 
time.
    Mr. Pence [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
now recognizes Congresswoman Harshbarger for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. I will be as quick as I can. Thank you 
all for being here.
    You know, I believe it is tremendously important that we 
establish a single national standard, really, before Chair Khan 
and her posse have the opportunity to go rogue and create more 
disastrous regulations, which they are prone to do.
    And I want to focus on the idea of creating a private right 
of action as part of any legislation this committee is 
considering. And one consideration when we create a private 
right of action is running the risk of differing 
interpretations in different court districts, which results in 
more confusion of the rules rather than more clarity.
    So what can be done to mitigate some of these concerns with 
the private right of action so that our Federal standard brings 
real clarity to the regulated community?
    And I guess I could start by asking you, Mr. Reed.
    Mr. Reed. Well, I think that we have all seen appropriate 
give-and-take on the question of private right of action. I 
think the main thing for small business is going to be not 
implementing a private right-of-action system that allows for 
what we call sue-and-settle, where you are going to send a 
letter to a small business, it is going to be for 50K. You talk 
to your attorney who is in your small town, they say, ``I don't 
handle that stuff.'' And they say, ``You know what, 50K? Just 
pay it.''
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Yes.
    Mr. Reed. So that is the part that we have to do. But I 
think the work, the bipartisan work that this committee has 
done to handle those questions, and hopefully some of their 
fellow members on the Senate side can get us through that hump 
by limiting it to a certain cadre of actions that can be taken.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Yes, I have been a small business owner. 
And so, you know, and having pharmacies, that leads me right 
into my next question.
    You know, I have had pharmacies, and what we do is we have 
to get licensed in several States. And listen, every State has 
different rules and regulations for my profession. So I have 
learned that the most stringent regulation is the one we have 
to follow. It could be a Federal guideline from the FDA or it 
could be a State board guideline.
    So if State data privacy standards are conflicting with the 
Federal standard, then companies may well have to listen to 
those, you know, stringent regulations. For example, you have 
talked about California, the blue State regulations, rather 
than the ones we set if there are conflicts. And so, you know, 
I don't want California telling me what I have to do in east 
Tennessee when it comes to how I practice pharmacy.
    So how important is preemption in ensuring that we have 
clarity at a Federal level? And I go to you first, Mr. Reed.
    Mr. Reed. It is critical. And you raised an interesting 
point about levels. Some of the problems aren't levels, they 
are definitions. If one State says you call this data this, and 
this something else, or says----
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Yes.
    Mr. Reed [continuing]. If you have a breach for a breach 
notification, you must immediately report. Others say you have 
to tell the police first. It isn't just that we have levels. I 
think too often when we discuss this issue, people say, ``Well, 
one State can be a floor and another State''--and that doesn't 
create a ceiling. For small businesses, it might just be the 
definitions that are in that compliance regime that create the 
problem. It is not always about levels. So absolutely critical.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Mr. Britan?
    Mr. Britan. Yes, we need to set a national standard for 
privacy. Privacy can't depend on ZIP Code, and we can't have 
more powerful States dictating rights for other States.
    I think preemption is going to require compromise. But I 
think, at the end of the day, it has--it can't be a compromise 
that sets no level of preemption. It has to be a clear national 
standard that sets the rules of the road for the country.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Yes. You know, if there are carve-outs to 
get this on the President's desk, my question is what 
provisions of the framework should we absolutely refuse to 
concede? Anybody?
    [No response.]
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Or nobody.
    Mr. Reed. I think you have heard from everyone on the panel 
that data minimization is something that I don't think we can 
give up.
    And I think that making sure that the exceptions--that 
whatever you have to give up doesn't do some kind of odd carve-
out that puts small businesses on an unbeneficial footing.
    We want to--we want privacy laws to apply to us. We want to 
abide--because that creates trust, and that helps us get from 
small businesses to big businesses.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. It is almost like when you are audited by 
a PBM, and they ask for certain information. Don't give them 
any more than they ask for. It is just inviting more questions 
and more audits.
    So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Pence. I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize myself 
for 5 minutes.
    I would like to thank Chair Bilirakis and Ranking Member 
Schakowsky for holding this meeting, and all of you being here 
today at the end of the day.
    You know, as the chairman already noted, this marks the 
36th time Congress has had a hearing on the--on privacy in the 
last 5 years. I heard that a couple of hearings ago, and I was 
just shocked. I couldn't believe it. And here, really, we are 
talking--it is like a chipmunk in the wheel. We are just 
talking about the same thing over and over again, getting 
nothing done. And I don't think we are really getting the 
attention of Big Tech and those--the violators in this 
environment.
    You know, like many of my colleagues have discussed today, 
our increasingly digital world leaves Hoosiers and all 
Americans in the dark about who has access to their 
information. It is striking to me how little the consumers back 
home know about how much of their information is being 
collected, shared with third parties, and monetized without 
their informed consent. And that really bothers me. What am I 
getting for all the information you are taking from me all the 
time?
    Just as truth in lending--years ago I served on bank boards 
for many years--was enacted to protect consumers from bad 
actors manipulating a complex financial industry, Congress 
needs to enact similar protections for all Americans where no 
current protections exist, like for internet platforms that are 
becoming all but required to participate in modern society.
    Unfortunately, this growth-at-any-cost mindset has led to 
more divisive interactions online and harmful rhetoric that is 
impacting social fabric.
    There is nothing wrong with making money, but it seems to 
me that mass collection and sale of our information has become 
foundational to Big Tech's big business model, and now many 
other industries, as well.
    Consumers deserve to have control over their information, 
how their information is collected, who has access to their 
data, the right to remove, private right of action, and where 
their data might be shared.
    Mr. Britan, Axiom is commonly cited as one of the largest 
data brokers in the United States, collecting and selling 
information on hundreds of millions of Americans with whom they 
have no direct relationship. In the 12-month period preceding 
July 1st, 2022, Axiom reported receiving just 279 right-to-
delete requests, despite at least 25 million American adults 
being eligible to make such a request under State laws.
    One reason for this low participation rate could be that 
Axiom, like many of its peers, requires individuals to navigate 
a complex web portal in order to submit a relatively simple 
privacy request. It seems likely that data brokers have an 
incentive to make this process as difficult for individuals as 
possible. Even some of the non-Big Tech folks, it is difficult 
to get out of that.
    Get--the question. What is your opinion--like--the 
gentlelady asked this--but the right-to-delete requests, 
especially for those directed at data brokers, what can we do 
about--should we treat the data brokers differently than 
others?
    Mr. Britan. Absolutely, and I have supported a lot of the 
data broker legislation that we have seen across the country.
    I think in order for the rights to be effective, people 
have to know who is processing their data so that they can make 
requests of those organizations. And I think that we need to 
make clear to people who has their data so that they can 
exercise their rights effectively.
    I also think that we need to impose responsibilities on 
these companies that apply regardless of whether or not people 
take that action.
    Mr. Pence. Thank you.
    Mr. Reed, though it was not mentioned today, we have 
discussed private right of action in past hearings. Without a 
well-defined private right of action in Federal law, how will 
consumers be able to actually enforce their right to delete and 
other important privacy rights?
    I know you touched on that a moment ago, but what is the 
Federal way to do it?
    Mr. Reed. Well, I think right now, as you know, State AGs 
have power, and a bill like this would help them deal with it 
from a Federal--from a national perspective.
    I think that we--the main caution that we would say--and we 
have supported the work that you guys are doing on this 
legislation--is to avoid making it so easy that we end up with 
a sue-and-settle system, which is hard on small business. But I 
think there are some ways to belts-and-suspenders this to put 
it into the hands of State AGs or other actions.
    Mr. Pence. Well, thank you for that. I hope we 
differentiate between the size of the folks involved.
    And with that I yield back. I now recognize Mr. Obernolte 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Obernolte [presiding]. Thank you. Well, thank you very 
much for the hearing, and thanks to all of you for being here.
    Mr. Reed, I would like to start with a question for you. 
First of all, very--I have a lot of respect for your 
organization. As an app developer myself, thank you for the 
good work that you do. You had some really interesting 
testimony about preemption and the need to take all of these 
disparate sectoral privacy standards and unify them under one 
universal rule at the Federal level. But I would like to ask 
kind of a followup question on preemption, because this is one 
of the big debates that we are having about the ADPPA here 
coming out of this committee, is the degree to which it should 
preempt State law.
    So do you believe that we should fully preempt State law in 
the issue of digital data privacy, or do you believe that, as 
some States have requested that we do, that we merely establish 
a floor and allow the individual States to go above that floor 
in their requirements on privacy if they wish to?
    Mr. Reed. I think we need fully--a full Federal preemptive 
legislation. I think, without it, you cause international 
problems.
    As I said earlier, tiny app developers will be in the 
international trade business. They will be selling their apps 
or making them available in 100 countries. So if the privacy 
laws aren't federally mandated across the board, then we have a 
problem even on international trade.
    Secondarily, as you point out--and I said this earlier--
there is this idea or conflagration of this idea that it is 
levels. But sometimes it is just the definitions. So I might do 
the right thing, but I call it one thing in one State and one 
thing in another. And that means the compliance costs for a 
small business go up, because I have to create separate 
documents to talk about separate regimes with slightly 
different definitions. It is not always about levels. Sometimes 
it is just about what you call it.
    Mr. Obernolte. Yes, I completely agree with you. You know, 
I think sometimes we forget about the fact that when we allow 
this patchwork of regulation to exist with 50 different laws 
and 50 different States, it is very destructive to 
entrepreneurialism because the people that have the regulatory 
sophistication to deal with that are the big companies that 
have offices full of lawyers. And the people that don't have 
the sophistication to deal with that are two people in a garage 
that have to pay lawyers by the hour. So I am--completely agree 
with you. I think that we have to be very careful about 
preemption. I think we need to decide what areas we are 
legislating in with our privacy bill, totally preempt within 
those areas, and then carve out the other areas to make it 
clear where States can act independently and where they can't.
    And then, you know, just following up to that, I was in the 
California State Legislature. I was one of the leads in 
drafting the California Consumer Privacy Act, and I think it is 
very important that we avoid some of the mistakes that were 
made with CCPA. We got a lot of things right. We were under 
time pressure--without getting into detail--to get that passed, 
but there were some kind of unexpected consequences that arose 
after that.
    One of the main ones was that, much to our surprise, we 
thought this was going to be an iterative process, and once we 
passed it we knew we were going to have things that were missed 
as it was implemented, and we thought we were going to come 
along in subsequent years and fix it. You know, we would have a 
fix-up bill that--the year after, another fix-up bill the year 
after that.
    And what we had not anticipated is that when you create, 
even unintentionally, a regulatory landscape with winners and 
losers, all of the winners will then get together and try and 
prevent you from changing the rule the subsequent year, even if 
the rule was arbitrary, unintentional, or unfair. And that is 
just a fact of political life. And I had underestimated how 
much that came to play.
    So that is why it is so important that you are here, 
because I think stakeholder engagement is how you guard against 
that. And so I think we need to be very careful and deliberate 
about that.
    Another thing that I think we need to be very careful about 
is that we are very specific in our choice of language in the 
bill. When you allow ambiguity to creep into what should be 
technical terms, particularly when it comes to things like data 
minimization, you need to be very careful that you are specific 
about what you mean when you say the data that you collect has 
to be necessary. Or if you say that it has to be related to the 
core business of your company, you better define what that 
means.
    If you use a technical term, you better very carefully 
define it, because otherwise you will find yourself in the 
situation that we were in of having to watch a roomful of 
lawyers argue in front of a judge about what the intent of the 
author was, and that is something that, you know, when we 
abdicate our responsibility as legislators to the judicial 
branch, it serves no purpose.
    So I am hoping that we can avoid some of that--some of 
those complications this time around. And again, it is going to 
be through the engagement of stakeholders like the groups that 
you represent that we are able to get that done. So thank you 
very much for your testimony today, and we are looking forward 
to continuing to work with you to make sure we get this right.
    So I will yield 5 minutes--do we have anyone else up?
    Mr. Bilirakis. Do you want to close it?
    Mr. Obernolte. Sure.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Close it. But you don't get it next time.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Obernolte. So I ask unanimous consent to insert in the 
record the documents included on the staff hearing documents 
list.
    Without objection, that will be the order, and--as there is 
no one here to object.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Obernolte. I remind members they have 10 business days 
to submit questions for the record, and I ask the witnesses to 
respond to the questions promptly. I know you will.
    Members should submit their questions by the close of 
business on May 11th.
    Without objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:27 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
    [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
