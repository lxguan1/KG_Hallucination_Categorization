                              ----------                              


                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met at 10:02 a.m., in room SD-138, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Christopher Coons (Chairman), 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Coons, Shaheen, Merkley, Murphy, Van 
Hollen, Schatz, Murray, Graham, Boozman, Moran, Rubio, Hagerty, 
and Collins.

                        U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE


             opening statement of senator christopher coons


    Senator Coons. I call this hearing to order. Welcome to the 
first State and Foreign Operations Hearing of the fiscal year 
2024 Appropriations process.
    Each member of the subcommittee will have 7 minutes for 
questions. Those present will be called in order of seniority, 
followed by members in order of arrival. Alternating sides, of 
course, between the parties. If you miss your turn and later 
come back and rejoin, I will do my best to insert you at the 
appropriate time. We will have a second round of questions, 
time permitting.
    Mr. Secretary, it is great to have you with us again. We 
have a lot to cover. But let me briefly first mention that 
tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of the passing of a dear 
friend, Secretary Madeleine Albright. I was pleased that we 
could honor her tremendous impact on U.S. diplomacy and 
national security in last year's fiscal year 2023 SFOPS Bill, 
and will continue to reflect our shared values through the work 
of the State Department.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for what you are doing to keep 
alive her memory, as someone who was a clear-eyed, high 
spirited, and hardworking advocate for our unique role, as the 
indispensable nation.
    I know that you and the President also believe in the 
importance, the centrality of bipartisanship in foreign policy. 
I am very fortunate to have Senator Graham as the Ranking 
Member on this subcommittee, and strong subcommittee membership 
on both sides of the aisle. I am confident we can forge and 
maintain bipartisan support to address the most critical 
challenges facing us, and to advance America's interests, 
including supporting Ukraine's determined fight against Russian 
aggression, countering the threats posed by China, and 
leveraging our trade tools in the private sector to drive our 
core economic interests.
    We have made real progress together to advance our national 
security priorities over the last 2 years, this subcommittee 
has provided you and the President with the tools you need to 
lead the international community in unwavering support of the 
Ukrainian people. We have recognized the need to enhance U.S. 
competitiveness globally, using our diplomatic and 
developmental tools, especially to address the coercive 
influence of authoritarian states, like the PRC and Russia.
    We work closely together to help you strengthen the State 
Department workforce, provided additional flexibility, 
increased funding, and work to expand the U.S. presence 
overseas, accordingly, including in the Indo-Pacific.
    We have addressed the impacts of an unprecedented number of 
globally displaced people, roughly 100 million, so far, and an 
ongoing global food crisis. And we reaffirmed U.S. multilateral 
engagement by enabling you to rejoin UNESCO, and increase 
investments to support Americans seeking entry-level and 
leadership positions in international organizations.
    But, we face enormous challenges. Vladimir Putin continues 
his barbaric assault on Ukraine. The PRC, through 
misinformation, and expanded diplomatic developmental trade 
investments seeks to reshape the global environment challenging 
our core interests. There are the ongoing impacts of climate 
change including increased water and food insecurity that are 
driving mass displacement and fueling instability. And a 
sustained global trend of democratic backsliding.
    We need to be proactive, and use every tool at our disposal 
to get ahead of these challenges. Your task is daunting, and my 
message to my colleagues is simple: We can't do more with less. 
We must increase our investments in our diplomatic and 
development tools if we want to strengthen our national 
security. That is why I am encouraged by the fiscal year 2024 
budget request for the State Department, USAID, and Related 
Agencies. It is an ambitious request, but the challenges of our 
time demand no less.
    We look forward to discussing the details with you, 
including your highest priorities, as we consider how best to 
support the Department's critically important people, programs, 
and operations.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Senator Graham.


              opening statement of senator lindsey graham


    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to also 
welcome Senator Collins, and Senator Murray. They have done a 
good job of getting the Committee back in business. We are 
having hearings, we are going to do markups, we are going to 
become appropriators again, and that is welcome news to me.
    As to the budget request, it is ambitious. We have got to 
deal with the House eventually. An 11 percent increase, I don't 
think the market will bear that, but we will do the best we 
can. I consider this account to be national security in another 
form. Soft power, to me, is just as important as hard power, 
and many times even more important.
    We are dealing with real threats out there. Countering 
China is one of them. A 13.1 billion dollar mandatory spending 
request in this budget is not going to fly. We need to 
appropriate money directly to counter the influence of China, 
but it will not be in a mandatory spending construct, like it 
has been requested. I want to work with you Mr. Chairman, and 
the Department, for coming up with some funds to counter China 
throughout the world, particularly in their backyard.
    Bottom line is we will get the bill done. We always do. I 
enjoy working with you. On Taiwan: there is no funding in the 
budget, specifically, for Taiwan. Senator Menendez and I, and 
many others have pushed for a $2 million authorization for 
Taiwan's defense needs, and I think we need to put money 
directed for Taiwan's defense needs in the bill during markup, 
when that time comes.
    But Mr. Secretary, I want to say this to you and your 
personnel; you serve in very dangerous places without a lot of 
military support at times. The military gets a lot of credit, 
and they deserve it, but our men and women of the State 
Department, they are heroes in their own way. And I appreciate 
what they do for our country.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Ranking Member Graham.
    It is my understanding the Chair and Vice Chair did not 
want to make opening statements?
    Senator Murray. I do have one, but I can wait for the 
Secretary.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Secretary, if you would, please proceed.
STATEMENT OF HON. ANTONY J. BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF 
            STATE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you, very, very much.
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, very good to be with 
you; Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, to all the Committee 
Members here today, thank you for this opportunity to speak 
with you about our proposed fiscal year 2024 budget for the 
State Department and USAID.
    And I think as you have both laid out in different ways, we 
are meeting at an inflection point. The post-Cold War era is 
over, and there is an intense competition underway to shape, to 
determine, what comes next.
    We, the United States, have a positive vision for the 
future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, 
that is prosperous. And it is our belief that the budget that 
we put forward will help advance that vision and deliver on 
issues that actually matter to the American people, 
particularly by preparing us to effectively meet two broad sets 
of challenges.
    The first is the challenge posed by our strategic 
competitors. The immediate, acute threat posed by Russia's 
autocracy and aggression, most destructively, of course, 
through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and the long-
term challenge from the People's Republic of China.
    The second set of challenges is really posed by shared 
global tests, including the climate crisis, migration, food and 
energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly impact the 
lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.
    With this committee's leadership and support, including 
through the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus, the United States is in a 
stronger geopolitical position than we were 2 years ago, hence 
our ability to deal with these challenges, I think has been 
enhanced.
    We have drawn enormous power from investments that we have 
made in our own economic strength and technological edge at 
home, including through the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the 
CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has 
never been stronger. In fact, we have been building on it, not 
only strengthening existing alliances and partnerships, but 
building new coalitions of countries and other institutions 
that are fit-for-purpose.
    We are expanding our presence in critical regions, like the 
Indo-Pacific. We are leading the unprecedented coalitions to 
confront aggression and address humanitarian challenges around 
the world.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request for the State 
Department and USAID meets this moment head on. This budget 
will sustain our security, economic, energy, and humanitarian 
support for Ukraine to ensure that President Putin's war 
remains a strategic failure.
    It will strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC. 
President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and 
open Indo-Pacific, which is why this proposal asks for an 18 
percent increase in our budget for that region over fiscal year 
2023.
    The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory 
proposals, and we are happy to talk about why we proceeded this 
way, for new, innovative investments to outcompete China. 
Including, by enhancing our presence in the region, and 
ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies are able to 
offer, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean 
energy infrastructure, digital technology, is more attractive 
than any alternative.
    The budget will help us push back on advancing 
authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening 
democracies around the world, including through supporting 
independent media, countering corruption, defending free and 
fair elections. And it will allow us to pay our contributions 
to international organizations, because we need to be at the 
table wherever and whenever new international rules that affect 
the livelihoods of our people are being debated and being 
decided.
    The budget will allow us to continue leading the world to 
addressing these global challenges, from food and energy 
insecurity to climate and health crises.
    And just on that last point, as you all know, we are 
celebrating now the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I think 
is one of the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over 
the last decades. It has helped us save 25 million lives around 
the world.
    This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/
AIDS, while advancing health security more broadly through a 
new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I 
look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.
    The budget will advance our efforts to modernize the State 
Department, including by expanding our training float, updating 
our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility initiatives including, to make our overseas 
missions more accessible.
    I am grateful for the progress we have already made 
together, including Congress' support in updating the Secure 
Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act, and 
Accountability Review Board to give us some of the flexibility 
that we need to open new missions and better manage the risks 
that we face.
    We know there is more to do. And we are looking forward to 
working with Congress to accelerate these modernization efforts 
so that the Department can better attract, better retain, and 
support a first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in 
what is a very complex and fast-moving world.
    Finally, the budget will further a personal priority for 
me, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring 
Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan 
allies. Keeping our promises to those who served alongside the 
U.S. remains an unwavering priority. This budget will help us 
continue to make good on that commitment.
    When I took on this role, I committed to doing my part to 
try to restore Congress' place as an equal partner in our 
foreign policymaking. I am determined to continue to do that 
and very much appreciate the work that we have been able to do 
with this committee over the last couple of years and look 
forward to the work ahead.
    And with that, I welcome any questions. Thank you.

    Prepared Statement of Secretary of State Hon. Antony J. Blinken
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, Chair Murray, Vice Chair 
Collins, committee members: thank you for the opportunity to speak with 
you about the administration's proposed FY 2024 budget for the State 
Department and USAID.
    We meet at an inflection point. The post-Cold War world is over, 
and there is an intense competition underway to determine what comes 
next. The United States has a positive vision for the future: a world 
that's free, secure, open and prosperous.
    This budget will help us advance that vision, and deliver on the 
issues that matter most to the American people, by preparing us to meet 
two major sets of challenges.
    The first set is posed by our strategic competitors--the immediate, 
acute threat posed by Russia's autocracy and aggression, most 
destructively through its brutal war against Ukraine . . .  and the 
long-term challenge from the People's Republic of China.
    The second set is posed by shared global tests, including the 
climate crisis, migration, food and energy insecurity, and pandemics, 
all of which directly impact the lives and livelihoods of Americans and 
all peoples around the world.
    With this Committee's leadership and support, including through the 
FY 2023 Omnibus, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical 
position than we were 2 years ago.

including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean energy 
infrastructure to digital technology, is more attractive than any 
alternative.
    This budget will help us push back on advancing authoritarianism 
and democratic backsliding by strengthening democracies worldwide--
including through supporting independent media, countering corruption, 
and defending free and fair elections. And it will allow us to pay our 
contributions to international organizations, because the United States 
needs to be at the table wherever and whenever new international rules 
that affect the livelihoods of our people are debated and decided.
    This budget will allow us to continue leading the world in 
addressing global challenges, from food and energy insecurity to 
climate and health crises. On that last point: we're celebrating the 
20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which has helped us save 25 million lives 
worldwide. This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/
AIDS, while advancing health security more broadly through a new Bureau 
of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I look forward to 
working with Congress to establish this year.
    This budget will advance our efforts to modernize the State 
Department, including by expanding our training float, updating our 
technology, and carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility (DEIA) initiatives, including to make our overseas 
missions more accessible. I'm grateful for the progress we've already 
made together, including Congress' support in updating the Secure 
Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act and Accountability Review 
Board to give us the flexibility to open new missions and better manage 
risks. We know there's more to do, and we're looking forward to working 
with Congress to accelerate modernization efforts, so the Department 
can better attract, retain, and support our first-rate workforce as 
they advance U.S. interests in a complex and fast-moving landscape.
    Finally, this budget will further a personal priority for me, and I 
know for many of you: supporting Enduring Welcome, our whole-of-
government effort to resettle our Afghan allies. Keeping our promises 
to those who served the U.S. remains an unwavering priority, and this 
budget will help us continue to make good on that commitment.
    When I began this role, I committed to restoring Congress's place 
as an equal partner in our foreign policymaking.
    I'm looking forward to continuing that close coordination, and I'm 
grateful for the chance to answer your questions. Thank you.

    Prepared Statement of Diana R. Shaw, Deputy Inspector General* 
    (*Performing The Duties Of The Inspector General) United States 
                          Department of State
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished Members of 
the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony 
today for this hearing on the U.S. Department of State's fiscal year 
2024 budget request.
    The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of 
State (Department) inspects embassies and diplomatic posts throughout 
the world to determine whether policy goals are being achieved and 
whether the interests of the United States are being represented and 
advanced effectively. OIG performs specialized security inspections and 
audits in support of the Department's mission to provide effective 
protection to our personnel, facilities, and sensitive information. OIG 
also audits Department operations and activities to ensure that they 
are as effective and efficient as possible. Finally, OIG investigates 
instances of fraud, waste, and mismanagement that may constitute either 
criminal wrongdoing or violations of Department regulations. In short, 
OIG plays a crucial role in overseeing the funds Congress appropriates 
to the Department for its many programs and activities and we believe 
that our work can play an important role in assisting Subcommittee 
Members with funding decisions.
    A growing and substantial element of our mission emerged within the 
last year: oversight of the U.S. government's response to the invasion 
of Ukraine. In the past fiscal year, we have worked closely with our 
OIG counterparts in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Agency 
for International Development (USAID), as well as the broader oversight 
community, to ensure comprehensive oversight of the more than $113 
billion in U.S. assistance that has been appropriated as a result of 
the war in Ukraine. This remains our top priority for the coming year.
    In this testimony, I will discuss the nature and scope of our 
oversight mission, various projects related to Ukraine and Afghanistan, 
and other recently completed and noteworthy projects. I will conclude 
by making an appeal for the subcommittee's assistance in addressing 
OIG's resource challenges.
                          mission and results
    OIG's mandate covers both Department and the U.S. Agency for Global 
Media (USAGM) programs and operations, which include more than 80,000 
employees and more than 270 overseas missions and domestic entities. We 
also oversee the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water 
Commission, a Federal agency that operates under the foreign policy 
guidance of the Department. In terms of dollars, we are responsible for 
the oversight of more than $81 billion in Department, USAGM, and 
foreign assistance resources.
    In pursuit of this mission, OIG provides valuable return on 
investment through its audits, evaluations, inspections, and 
investigations. In FY 2022 alone, OIG identified nearly $400 million in 
questioned costs and taxpayer funds that could be put to better use. 
Additionally, OIG's criminal, civil, and administrative investigations 
produced $14.7 million in monetary results (including fines, 
restitution, and recoveries) in the last fiscal year.
    Our work consistently results in findings and recommendations that 
significantly improve the programs and activities we oversee--including 
improvements that are not easily quantifiable, such as our safety and 
security work. By helping the Department improve its security, OIG's 
work safeguards the lives of the thousands of people who work in or 
visit U.S. posts abroad and at home. Our recommendations frequently 
address inadequate compliance with emergency planning standards and 
facility safety and security deficiencies.
    Further, our investigative work consistently holds employees, 
contractors, and grantees accountable. In FY 2022, OIG obtained 14 
indictments or informations\1\ and 16 convictions. In one case, a 
former employee was sentenced to 5 years in prison and ordered to pay 
approximately $2 million in restitution for using his official position 
to embezzle grant money by falsifying official documents to solicit 
overpayments.
                          ukraine-related work
    As mentioned, Ukraine oversight is our top priority. State OIG, 
along with DoD and USAID OIGs, as well as other U.S. government 
oversight organizations, have adopted a collaborative approach to 
ensure that our oversight of the U.S. government's response to the 
Ukraine crisis is comprehensive, relevant, timely, and transparent, and 
preemptively identifies and mitigates gaps in coverage or duplication 
of effort. At State OIG, we have 43 staff members working on Ukraine 
oversight projects full time and a total of 107 staff members 
contributing on at least a part-time basis. Congress provided us with 
$13.5 million in dedicated funding for Ukraine response oversight--
funds that are available through FY 2024. We are grateful for this 
essential support and are using these funds to support about two dozen 
Ukraine response oversight projects. As of today, we have completed 
four of these projects.
    One of the completed projects is an information brief issued in 
December of last year.\2\ This brief is a tool for decisionmakers at 
the Department to assist them with preventing and mitigating challenges 
encountered in similar situations. In the brief, we noted that Embassy 
Kyiv's dispersed operations, with essential functions simultaneously 
based in Poland and Ukraine, present a similar set of leadership and 
management challenges faced by remote missions examined in prior work. 
The brief highlights effective practices for addressing such challenges 
and was well received by Department personnel.
    Also in the brief, we noted the challenge of conducting official 
activities in Ukraine where there are significant security 
restrictions. Although this makes monitoring and evaluation activities 
difficult, we identified and shared practices from our past work that 
have been successful in addressing such difficult circumstances, 
including the establishment of third-party monitoring contracts to 
increase visibility on the ground and the need to properly document 
monitoring and evaluation practices.
    We have many other projects underway, including a review of the 
management and operations at Embassy Kyiv to determine whether the 
Department established a foreign assistance strategy and how it is 
exercising its foreign assistance coordination responsibilities. We 
will also describe Embassy Kyiv's operating status, highlight potential 
risks, and outline how the Department plans to address facilities, 
staffing, and security challenges. Other projects will address end use 
monitoring of security assistance to Ukraine and examine whether the 
Department implemented Ukraine-related humanitarian assistance in 
accordance with policies, guidance, and award terms and conditions to 
ensure funds achieve intended objectives.
    I believe that robust oversight of the U.S. government's response 
to the invasion of Ukraine will help give both taxpayers and Congress 
the necessary confidence that our resources are being used efficiently 
and effectively.
                        afghanistan-related work
    Another priority is oversight of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
In the wake of the Department's suspension of operations in 2021, OIG 
devoted substantial time and resources to planning and coordinating 
oversight activities focusing on key aspects of the situation and its 
aftermath. For example, in response to a congressional request, OIG 
issued an information report on the Afghan special immigrant visa 
(SIV)\3\ process and related data.\4\ In an audit of the same program, 
we found that the Department's actions to address open OIG 
recommendations related to the SIV process did not improve methods for 
collecting or verifying Afghan SIV application processing times.\5\ 
Specifically, the Department established procedures for calculating the 
average processing time for applications; however, it continued to use 
inconsistent calculation methods because the procedures lacked details 
and did not encompass the entire Afghan SIV process.
    In addition, we discovered a lack of internal controls for 
verifying Afghan SIV data and the Department continued to face a 
significant SIV application backlog. The backlog occurred for several 
reasons, including insufficient staffing, limited coordination with the 
Department of Defense, and the lack of prioritizing SIV functionality 
within the Department's consular system modernization program. We 
concluded that these deficiencies may have delayed vulnerable Afghan 
allies from reaching safety.
    In other work, we inspected the Afghanistan Affairs Unit (AAU) and 
learned that Department and interagency stakeholders were unclear about 
the lines of responsibility among the multiple Department entities that 
had a role in managing U.S. government policy or programs for 
Afghanistan: the AAU, the Special Representative for Afghanistan, the 
Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs' Afghanistan Desk, and the 
Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights, among others. 
Although there was some principal-level coordination, an understanding 
about the division of responsibilities at the working level was less 
clear. Failure to redefine responsibilities and authorities when 
multiple entities contribute to the Department's policies and programs 
can result in duplication of effort, delayed action, and resource 
misallocation.
    Our work on Afghanistan is ongoing. We continue to closely 
coordinate with other relevant OIGs, and we have several forthcoming 
projects, including a review of the evacuation and suspension of 
operations at Embassy Kabul.
                        other oversight efforts
    For our oversight work outside of the specific contexts of Ukraine 
and Afghanistan, I would like to highlight some recent findings and 
recommendations that relate to three management challenges that we have 
consistently identified for the Department: safety and security, 
stewardship, and staffing.
Safety and Security
    Safeguarding people, facilities, property, and information is a 
continual challenge for the Department. Physical security and safety 
deficiencies at diplomatic facilities is one aspect of this challenge. 
To illustrate, a recent inspection of Embassy Kuwait City, Kuwait, 
found that the Embassy did not comply with all Department standards for 
two buildings constructed on the chancery compound.\6\ The Embassy 
built the permanent structures without requesting the required 
technical review to ensure the projects conformed to Department 
building codes. This is problematic because construction and subsequent 
use of structures without ensuring building code requirements are met 
poses significant life safety risks to employees.
    Residential safety is another area that our inspection work 
frequently assesses. In an inspection of Embassy La Paz, Bolivia, we 
found the Embassy did not assess 17 of its 46 residences for seismic 
risk to mitigate deficiencies. Failure to conduct seismic evaluations 
and mitigate deficiencies risks the life safety of residential 
occupants and could result in fatalities or serious injuries in an 
earthquake.\7\
    Another health and safety risk our work often highlights relates to 
emergency action planning. For example, an audit of emergency action 
plans at domestic facilities showed that plans were not always 
certified in a timely manner and did not always contain complete, 
accurate, and executable information.\8\ Our report noted that when the 
Department addressed the emergency action plan deficiencies, domestic 
Department personnel would be better prepared to execute emergency 
procedures that are meant to prevent injury, loss of life, and property 
damage.
    In addition to the security of people and property, we often focus 
on information security, and our oversight of the Department's IT 
security program continues to identify numerous control weaknesses. The 
FY 2022 Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) audit 
concluded again that the Department had not fully developed and 
implemented an effective organization-wide information security 
program.\9\ Specifically, we reported that the Department was operating 
below an effective level in four of five FISMA cybersecurity functions, 
making it vulnerable to IT-focused attacks and threats to its critical 
mission-related functions.
Stewardship
    Efficiently and effectively managing its significant resources is 
another longstanding challenge for the Department. OIG's work 
demonstrates that the Department could enhance its stewardship of 
taxpayer resources by improving its ability to identify and address 
weaknesses in financial and property management and contract and grant 
oversight. Additionally, identifying and addressing weaknesses in its 
internal controls is an element of the Department's stewardship 
challenge.
    For example, a January inspection revealed that the Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) had weak and 
missing internal controls related to monitoring, evaluating, and 
closeout of foreign assistance projects. OIG also found multiple 
internal control weaknesses in the management of its bureau resources 
and information management operations. Regarding the latter, OIG found 
deficiencies and waste in information technology contract management, 
and a lack of oversight for both domestic and overseas systems. Most of 
OIG's 28 recommendations were related to weak internal controls, which 
collectively hindered INL's ability to effectively plan, manage, and 
evaluate the results of its projects, programs, and operations.\10\
    Turning to contracts, during one project we found that the 
Department did not administer its domestic guard services contract, 
valued at approximately $362 million, in accordance with applicable 
Federal and Department standards.\11\ For example, we found that 
Contracting Officer's Representatives files were incomplete. We also 
found that the Department had not obtained sufficient documentation to 
support invoice approval. During the project, we identified numerous 
issues with the invoices, including mathematical errors, incorrect 
number of hours worked, and lack of overtime approval. As a result of 
these deficiencies, we questioned the entire amount of the contract 
(approximately $362 million).
    We also issued a report related to how the Department promotes 
competition for overseas construction projects.\12\ During that 
project, we found that the Department took steps to promote competition 
as required by law but had not developed a formal process to guide its 
efforts. Moreover, the Department did not fully comply with acquisition 
planning and market research requirements. Until deficiencies are 
addressed, the Department will continue to miss opportunities for 
increased competition that could enhance the Department's ability to 
obtain quality construction services at reasonable prices.
    Likewise, proper oversight and management of grants and cooperative 
agreements continues to be a challenge for the Department. In an audit 
of Federal assistance to for-profit organizations, we found that Grants 
Officers and Grants Officer Representatives did not always manage and 
monitor selected awards in accordance with requirements.\13\ 
Specifically, the grant officials did not consistently perform and 
document performance and financial monitoring, complete updates to risk 
assessments and monitoring plans, or conduct annual reviews when 
applicable. Until the deficiencies are addressed, the Department will 
not have reasonable assurance that awards are being administered in 
accordance with requirements.
Staffing
    The Department expends substantial resources on recruiting, 
training, and retaining a diverse, talented workforce capable of 
carrying out the Department's foreign policy mission and priorities. 
However, OIG's work finds that staffing gaps, frequent turnover, poor 
oversight, and inexperienced and undertrained staff are frequent 
challenges for the Department.
    In one report from the past year, OIG examined the process for 
selecting public members of Foreign Service Selection Boards (FSSBs), 
the entities responsible for selecting and promoting all Foreign 
Service Officers. OIG found that the Bureau of Global Talent Management 
did not demonstrate that it considered all required criteria when 
recruiting and selecting FSSB public members. Less than half of the 
public members who served from 2019 through 2021 were fully qualified 
under these criteria. OIG also found that the public member recruitment 
and selection process lacked adequate management oversight and internal 
controls to minimize the risk of favoritism and to ensure that the best 
qualified applicants were recruited and chosen. For example, family 
members of Department employees received public member contracts to 
serve on FSSBs every year from 2014 to 2021.\14\
    In another example, an OIG inspection of Embassy Khartoum, Sudan, 
illustrated the unique staffing challenges presented in a difficult or 
critical operating environment. We found the diplomatic post had 
persistent difficulty in attracting bidders to fill Foreign Service 
positions. Despite incentives and allowances, the Embassy struggled to 
attract mid-level officers, which, in turn led to long-term staffing 
gaps in the Embassy's Political-Economic, Public Diplomacy, and 
Consular Sections. For instance, the Public Diplomacy Section sustained 
a staffing gap of 20 months or more for two of its three U.S. direct-
hire positions. Similarly, the Political-Economic and Consular Sections 
sustained long-term gaps of more than 1 year.\15\
                               resources
    We appreciate the subcommittee's ongoing support of our work and 
are grateful for the $13.5 billion in supplemental funding for Ukraine 
response oversight. The subcommittee's timely foresight in recognizing 
the draw on OIG resources created by the invasion of Ukraine allowed us 
to strategically shift our focus and resources to this critical and 
dynamic event.
    Nonetheless, OIG's baseline budget has remained relatively flat in 
recent years, which has affected our operations in significant ways. We 
have not been able to keep pace with inflation due to our static budget 
and we have had to scale back staffing--instituting a hiring freeze for 
the first 9 months of FY 2022. More fundamentally, it has jeopardized 
our ability to sustain high-quality oversight work across the wide 
spectrum of programs and activities at the Department and USAGM. In 
addition to meeting our mandated reporting responsibilities, the 
effectiveness of our oversight relies on our ability to take on 
important discretionary work, including work on big initiatives of 
congressional interest, such as Afghanistan. Our funding challenges 
have made this difficult.
    I would like to quantify the magnitude of this challenge. As 
mentioned earlier, we oversee approximately $81 billion in agency 
resources, funds that span more than 35 appropriation accounts. While 
those accounts have grown over time, our budget has remained relatively 
constant, resulting in our budget being less than a quarter of 1 
percent of what is appropriated to the accounts we oversee. In absolute 
terms, OIG would have needed an additional $94 million across FYs 2020-
2023 to keep pace with increases in the scale and scope of the programs 
we oversee.
    Our FY 2024 budget request was designed to reset the relationship 
between our budget and the dollars we oversee, while also addressing 
past shortfalls. Our FY 2023 baseline appropriation was $93 million, 
and we are pursuing a roughly 15 percent increase for FY 2024 to $106.8 
million. This level of funding will help us address key priorities 
related to Department and USAGM management challenges, maintain our 
core operations, and adapt to future workforce needs.
    Beyond securing adequate funding, a related resource priority for 
State OIG is securing quality oversight professionals to meet 
increasing oversight demands. I am fortunate to lead an organization 
with outstanding staff members who have pivoted quickly to focus on 
Ukraine-related work. However, we must not let the Ukraine response 
oversight detract from our broader oversight mission spanning the 
globe. We will need to ramp up staffing to effectuate the broad set of 
extensive oversight plans highlighted in this testimony.
    The largest challenge we face in this regard is the current 
selection and appointment requirements, which add months to the 
onboarding process for new hires. In the context of our Ukraine-related 
work, this not only delays our ability to meet staffing needs, but also 
makes it difficult to effectively utilize our supplemental funding. To 
address this challenge and meet the long-term and critical hiring needs 
associated with Ukraine-related oversight, we would like to secure 
selection and appointment flexibilities consistent with direct hire 
authority. We are also seeking legislative changes that would give us 
the same flexible hiring authorities that exist in the context of 
overseas contingency operations.
                               conclusion
    I am incredibly proud of the work of my OIG colleagues and the 
value we provide to the Department, USAGM, Congress, and taxpayers. We 
are a talented and committed team of professionals dedicated to helping 
the Department and USAGM successfully accomplish their respective 
missions through robust oversight and well-designed, practical 
recommendations. I want to thank my team for their resilience, 
ingenuity, integrity, and leadership.
    I also want to conclude by thanking Chairman Coons, Ranking Member 
Graham, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee for the many ways 
in which you support OIG's mission. I take my statutory requirement to 
keep Congress fully and currently informed seriously, and I appreciate 
your enduring interest in our work.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for that brief, 
but a broad review of the challenges we face, and the 
leadership that you have shown at the helm of the State 
Department.
    Let me open with a question, if I could, about the 
workforce. I have had the opportunity to visit State Department 
employees around the world in lots of difficult and dangerous 
places; and like I believe all my colleagues, I am uniformly 
impressed with their skills and their determination.
    If we are going to achieve our national security objective, 
it is critical to ensure our diplomatic corps is putting the 
right people with the right tools, and the right resources, and 
training in the right places to carry out their work. We worked 
together, Senator Graham and I, to ensure that last year's bill 
delivered on that goal, but there is more to be done.
    What are the most critical workforce and other investments 
needed to strengthen the Department to meet the challenges 
confronting us today, and to have the flexibility to meet 
emerging challenges in the year ahead?
    Secretary Blinken. Very much appreciate that question, Mr. 
Chairman. And really, it does come down to us, to people, to 
resources, and in some cases to some authorities, what you will 
see in the budget is a proposed hiring increase for another 500 
new employees to fill some of the staffing gaps that we have, 
and that I can go into more detail on.
    We need more people to address some of these emerging 
priorities and emergencies. That include, for example, a couple 
of hundred new consular positions, I know you are seized with 
some of the challenges that Consular Affairs has experienced 
over the last few years, because of COVID, we have been 
building back in a very significant way, but we need more work 
there, and we need more resources there. So the budget proposes 
that.
    We need an additional number of civil and foreign service 
employees to scale up the Indo-Pacific strategy, and to out-
compete China, to strengthen our outreach to fully staff, for 
example, new missions in the Pacific Islands, something else 
that we can talk about.
    We want to make sure that we are building on something that 
has been a terrific innovation that has been supported by this 
committee, and that is having additional positions so that we 
can increase our float, which enables us to pull people out of 
their day in day out, and allow them to have career-long 
training, so that they can keep their skill set fresh. In fact, 
get new skills as they go along; for example, by coming here to 
spend time, by going to an academic institution, et cetera.
    We are requesting, in addition, new management hires, this 
is critical because where the rubber meets the road in the 
Department, as in so many other institutions, is particularly 
our mid-level management. And we have terrific management 
people in the Department, but what you know, and what you will 
see, is the people who don't actually come up through the 
management silo in the Department are, nonetheless, called upon 
at different stages in their career, to exert management 
skills. We need more there.
    We have money there to make sure that we are protecting our 
missions, and our diplomats, and I commend that to you. We have 
to keep pace with the increased security threats, and costs, 
the growing overseas presence, as I said, in the Pacific 
Islands, we hope to reopen the mission in Libya, something we 
want to work with you on, that is going to require some funding 
as well.
    We have significant funds as well to make sure that we are 
up to speed on cybersecurity. We have all been challenged 
across government by this, and we have to make sure that we 
have the funding to do that. There are a number of authorities 
as well, Mr. Chairman, that we can get into, and I am also 
happy to share with you, that would be very helpful, it would 
be very useful for us to have a new funding account for the 
Enduring Welcome operation, to consolidate up to about $2.5 
billion in existing funding for relocating our Afghan partners.
    There is some personal services, Contractor Authority, we 
need to hire more domestic personnel services contractors, we 
can get to that, some Special Immigrant Visa adjustments, 
again, to make sure that we are making good on our commitments 
to our Afghan allies.
    And then, I would just cite one last thing, there is more 
to be said, but you touched on this. I think it is very 
important for us to be able to pay our multilateral 
commitments. And this is not a gift to these institutions, it 
is not saying that these institutions are perfect, or don't 
need a lot of work, it is saying that when we are not at the 
table, then usually someone else is, and probably not in a way 
that advances our interests and values.
    And particularly in institutions that are actually having a 
real impact on--you know, in windowless rooms, that people 
don't see, in shaping a lot of rules, and a lot of norms, and a 
lot of standards. For example, the way technology is being 
used, we need to be there. And part of being there sometimes is 
paying our dues.
    The other thing that happens in these institutions, we are 
the largest, actually, contributor to the U.N. system, and yet, 
when we are in arrears, our competitors and adversaries point 
to that and say: You know, the United States isn't serious 
about it. So I hope we can do the best possible on that.
    I very much believe we should be back in UNESCO. Again, not 
as a gift to UNESCO, but because things that are happening at 
UNESCO actually matter, and if we are not there, we are not 
shaping it. They are working on rules, norms, and standards for 
artificial intelligence, we want to be there. They are doing 
the same thing on education curricula around the world.
    China right now, is the single-largest contributor to 
UNESCO. That carries a lot of weight. We are not even at the 
table. It is important that we get back there. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Secretary; both for that 
answer and for your leadership across those different issues. 
You mentioned at the conclusion of your introductory statement, 
Operation Enduring Welcome, I would just be interested in a 
brief update on your efforts to review and identify any lessons 
learned on Afghanistan, so far.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you very much. Yes. One of the 
things that was very important to me was that we conduct an 
after-action review of the State Department's role and 
execution of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And we initiated 
that review, we brought in very experienced people who had--
including one of our most senior retired diplomats to conduct 
it.
    And they conducted many, many interviews, reviewed many, 
many documents, and produced a, I think, important report that 
looks at what we did, what we did right, what we did wrong, and 
could do better. And other agencies, as you know, have been 
doing the same thing. We have not been spending time putting 
all of this together to make sure that we look at the--some of 
the common lessons learned, especially where there are 
overlaps. And I am committed and determined to make that 
information available to Congress. And we will do that.
    We will do that by mid-April, so I can tell you today, you 
will have the after-action review, we will share the findings, 
and find the appropriate mechanism to do that within the next 
three weeks.
    Senator Coons. Great. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. In your 
opening, you referenced your commitment to including consulting 
with Congress, and including us in the foreign policy making 
process and this is a good example of that work.
    I have long questions I look forward to asking about the 
Development Finance Corporation, the Global Fragility Act. But 
I will just ask one, and then turn to my Ranking Member.
    We are in the middle of a global food crisis, according to 
the World Food Programme: pre-pandemic, there were 135 million 
people in more than 50 countries who were facing hunger. That 
has gone up to 345 million people across more than 80 countries 
today. It is fueled by conflict, climate change, COVID-19, and 
as the war in Ukraine grinds on, its shocks, in terms of prices 
of food and fertilizer, are driving millions to the edge of 
starvation and increasing instability.
    What is the Department doing to increase contributions from 
other donors to help tack this challenge? And what should the 
international community be doing differently in order to 
improve the resiliency of communities facing food insecurity 
for the long term?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I will say, 
I very much appreciate the leadership of this committee; 
particularly you, Senator Graham, on this issue; and others. I 
say quickly two things: First of all, we have to tackle two 
aspects of this problem. We have emergency situations that 
demand an emergency response, where people need food now.
    And back in May, we gathered together countries from around 
the world at the UN Security Council, to focus them, not just 
us, on the specific things that they can do, and we can do, to 
make sure, to the best of our ability, that food is getting to 
people when they need it.
    And of course, as you know very well, we have had an almost 
perfect storm that has built up between climate change, between 
COVID, and of course conflict, and now, exacerbated 
dramatically by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine, 
bread basket to the world, that grain was taken off the market 
by the Russian aggression. I am very glad that through the work 
of the United Nations and Turkey, we were able to get the Black 
Sea Corridor going, but that is a fragile thing. It has made a 
difference, but it is fragile.
    So there is the emergency assistance. We have significantly 
increased our own contributions, as you know, we provided about 
$13.5 billion going back to the Russian aggression over the 
course of 2022. We have gotten other countries to step up and 
increase their contributions, World Food Programme, Food and 
Agricultural Organization, the UN Fund. That is one critical 
piece of it.
    But again, as I know you know very well, the other piece 
that is critical, and what I hear, and I know you hear from our 
colleagues around the world, especially in Africa, is that, as 
focused as they are in emergency assistance, what they really 
want, is investment in their productive capacity, and this is 
absolutely critical to making sure that they have sustainable 
agricultural production, and that they ultimately can feed 
their own people, and actually feed others. There is tremendous 
potential in Africa.
    Let me just cite one thing that we are doing. And we have 
in the budget, a significant fund for this. To me, one of the 
most exciting things, building on and adding to the Feed the 
Future Program, that USAID, and the State Department run, is 
something that we have, I think you know, one of the leading 
agronomists in the world at the State Department, Dr. Cary 
Fowler. One of the things that we have learned in recent years 
is that the two most determinative things to having sustainable 
food production capacity, comes down to two things: soil and 
seeds.
    If the soil quality is bad, you can throw as much 
fertilizer on it as you want, it is not going to work. We now 
have the ability to map the quality of soil, pretty much 
anywhere, including throughout Africa, determine where it is 
good, where it is bad, what needs to be done to improve it. And 
we have a program there, the seeds, if they are not resilient 
to drought, to climate, to other things, again, it doesn't 
matter, we have the capacity to do that, to provide resiliency 
through nutritious crops. So I think what you will see in the 
budget is the beginnings of an important program to provide for 
that.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. That is a topic of 
interest to both of us.
    Let me now turn to my Ranking Member, Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Yes. I really want to work with you. I 
think what you have said is absolutely spot on. I talked to 
Larry Ellison, from Oracle, and he has created a new school, I 
think at Oxford or Cambridge, about food security. So, there 
are a lot of people interested in making sure people can feed 
themselves, and you know, it is soil, seed, and water, you have 
got to have water.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. I look forward to working with you on that. 
Are you familiar with the International Criminal Court (ICC) 
arrest warrant issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Do you think that is sound?
    Secretary Blinken. I think we have all seen, Senator, the 
atrocities and war crimes committed in Ukraine.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. And we all--we believe strongly as we 
have said at the outset----
    Senator Graham. I think the President said he thought that 
was a sound approach.
    Secretary Blinken. There needs to be accountability.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. And the ICC is an----
    Senator Graham. What do they want to arrest him for?
    Secretary Blinken. The focus of the--as I understand it--
the focus is on the, in effect, abduction of children----
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. From Ukraine, taking them 
to Russia, giving them to Russian----
    Senator Graham. Yes. So let us just stop for a second. 
There is an arrest warrant for Putin by the ICC, for kidnapping 
children in Ukraine, and taking them to Russia.
    Secretary Blinken. That is right.
    Senator Graham. Is that pretty much it, right?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. If Putin came to the United States, for 
whatever reason, would we turn him over to the ICC?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, I can't get ahead of that, 
because, as I said, I would have to look at the laws, and 
those, as you know, we are not actually a party to the ICC, so 
I don't want to engage in that hypothetical, but----
    Senator Graham. I would encourage you, that if he came 
here, we should turn him over.
    Secretary Blinken. Now, I don't think he has any plans to 
travel here soon.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Well, would you encourage our European 
allies to turn him over?
    Secretary Blinken. I think that anyone who is a party to 
the court, and has obligations, should fulfill their 
obligations.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Are you aware that the Congress, 100 
to nothing, which is pretty rare around here, supported the 
idea of declaring Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under 
U.S. law?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. I don't know how much more we can do to 
help you in that regard. Do you intend----
    Secretary Blinken. Could I just--can I just say on that?
    Senator Graham. Yes. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. I appreciate it. Well, we have as you 
know, multiple designations that focus on Russia's war crimes, 
atrocities, et cetera. The SST brings with it, also, I think, 
potentially, some unintended consequences----
    Senator Graham. So here is my question.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Are you going to designate Russia a state 
sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law? Do you intend to do that?
    Secretary Blinken. What we have been doing, Senator, as you 
know, I think, is working with you to look at a new designation 
that would go to a----
    Senator Graham. Well, but we sort of failed in that 
endeavor, and since we started, he has been--an arrest warrant 
has been issued-- what more do you have to do to be a state 
sponsor of terrorism?
    On China, the meeting between Xi and Putin: would you 
consider that a marriage of convenience, or a strategic 
alliance?
    Secretary Blinken. Perhaps a combination of both. I think 
you have got a--you do have a partnership. Remember, as you 
know, right before the Russian aggression, they met.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. They talked about a partnership with no 
limits.
    Senator Graham. So let us just break that down a bit here, 
``with no limits'', the world is trying to put a cap on Russian 
oil.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. The West; is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. That is correct.
    Senator Graham. I think China just agreed to buy oil, as 
much as Russia can supply. They are undercutting our efforts 
there: do you agree with that?
    Secretary Blinken. They are, although, we see it as two 
things, Senator. With the oil cap, we try to accomplish two 
goals. One, reduce the revenues that Russia is getting from 
selling energy.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. But at the same time keep enough energy 
on the market so that we don't have a crisis.
    Senator Graham. Sure.
    Secretary Blinken. I think we have largely accomplished 
that goal. Russian oil revenues are down as a result of the----
    Senator Graham. But China has made a pledge to buy all of 
the Russian oil they can buy, right, not at the cap price?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, we will see at what price they 
actually buy at.
    Senator Graham. The bottom line is China is working against 
us, when it comes to Russia: do you agree?
    Secretary Blinken. I think their diplomatic support, their 
political support, and to some extent material support for 
Russia, certainly goes against our interest in bringing this 
war to an end, in a way that is just----
    Senator Graham. You have publicly said that you had reason 
to believe that China may be considering providing lethal aid 
to Russia: is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. That is correct.
    Senator Graham. If you provide lethal aid to a state 
sponsor of terrorism, that would be considered material support 
under U.S. law: is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. I believe that is correct.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Don't you think it would be smart to 
tell China, you provide lethal aid to a state sponsor of 
terrorism, and they may be more deterred than if we just 
remained silent about that?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I have shared directly, with my 
Chinese counterpart the serious problem that China providing 
lethal material support to Russia for----
    Senator Graham. Do you think it is working? Do you think 
they will provide aid?
    Secretary Blinken. As we speak today, we have not seen them 
cross that line.
    Senator Graham. So my point is, that we made a mistake, I 
think, by not having pre-invasion sanctions. We should have 
supplied more weapons to Ukraine before the invasion to deter 
the war. We are at tipping point here. China is openly 
embracing Russia, they are undercutting everything the West is 
trying to do to isolate Russia. They are buying unlimited oil.
    I think now is the time, Mr. Secretary, to label Russia 
state sponsor of terrorism, because they are. Up the ante if 
China wants to continue to help Russia. Would you at least 
consider that as a deterrent possibility?
    Secretary Blinken. We want to look at every reasonable 
deterrent, but again, when it comes to the SST, and we should 
talk about this further, I think there are better ways to get 
at the same--at the same thing, that could have some of the----
    Senator Graham. Whatever those ways are, let us--we are 
over a year into this war. Let us do something. And I am just 
going to tell you, as a friend. I like you. I will try to work 
with you. I am not going to sit down on the sidelines any 
longer, and see Russia not labeled for who they are. They are 
terrorists. They are wreaking havoc all over Africa. We just 
got back from a trip to Africa.
    Through the Wagner Group, Russia committed immense war 
crimes in Syria, this is just a modus operandi. They just bomb 
the hell out of people, terrorize people, use rape as a weapon 
of war. And it is now to stand up and say: You are a terrorist 
state under U.S. law. And I think the sooner we do that, the 
better.
    Let us go to Mexico, real quick. And I will try to keep 
within my time, go over a couple minutes. Are there places in 
Mexico that the Government of Mexico does not have control?
    Secretary Blinken. I think you see significant insecurity 
in parts of----
    Senator Graham. Well, my question is, if their own 
Government----
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. I am sure that there are 
individual places, communities, where the--break down.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Are there drug cartels in control of 
parts of Mexico, not the Government of Mexico?
    Secretary Blinken. I think it is fair to say, yes.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Do you agree with the following 
statement: that fentanyl coming from Mexico is killing 
Americans by the tens of thousands?
    Secretary Blinken. It is. And it is also killing Mexicans 
as well.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Well, do you agree it is now time to 
change our policy because it is not working? Or do you think it 
is working?
    Secretary Blinken. I think that, Senator, first of all, you 
are exactly right about the insecurity in Mexico. As I said, 
the Mexican people themselves are the number one victims of 
that insecurity. The Mexican Government have supporters 
working----
    Senator Graham. Are more Mexicans are dying of fentanyl 
poisoning than Americans?
    Secretary Blinken. Currently, no. But it is growing 
problem.
    Senator Graham. So how many have died in Mexico from 
fentanyl poisoning?
    Secretary Blinken. I don't have the exact numbers, but I am 
sure that is----
    Senator Graham. Well, 70,000 died last year----
    Secretary Blinken. That is correct.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Alone, in the United States. 
Do you believe our policies toward drug cartels, and fentanyl 
coming from Mexico are working?
    Secretary Blinken. They need to do more. They need to be 
more effective.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. Here is one way we can do that. One way 
we can do that, is making sure that we have, for example, the 
technology on our borders to detect and intercept the fentanyl. 
96 percent of the fentanyl coming into the United States is 
coming through legal ports of entry. We have the technology 
that can catch a lot of that.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. We need to deploy it faster, that is 
exactly what we----
    Senator Graham. How about this idea. Rather than just 
interdicting at the border, we go to the source and declare 
Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations under U.S. 
law.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. Would you consider that?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, we would certainly consider that.
    Senator Graham. And that would help us with China, because 
if you provide material support to a foreign terrorist 
organization, you could be prosecuted in U.S. courts.
    Secretary Blinken. They are also transnational criminal 
organization, and that brings with it a number of sanctions----
    Senator Graham. That is what they are today?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, and----
    Senator Graham. I want to up----
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. It is not clear to me that 
the--again, that we would get additional tools of authorities, 
it is worth pointing out that----
    Senator Graham. We would with China, Mr. Secretary, 
Transnational Criminal Organizations cannot--material support 
doesn't bring in U.S. courts. For Foreign Terrorist 
Organizations (FTOs), material support for an FTO would capture 
in U.S. courts if you are a China company.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. So please consider that. I would say our 
policy is not working. I want to introduce into the record a 
State Department travel advisory map that tells you where to go 
and not to go in Mexico. The red is getting redder, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Mexican President Obrador is going to call Chinese 
President Xi, great. I am not looking for a phone call from 
Mexico. I am looking for action on their part. I am willing to 
do a Plan Colombia-type effort with Mexico, but I am going to 
put the Mexican Government on notice, and your Department, when 
it comes to poisoning of America, we are going to take 
different action because what we are doing is not working.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. This is not a confrontational statement, it 
is a statement of fact. More Americans are being poisoned by 
fentanyl from Mexico in a single year than we lost in the 
entire Vietnam War. And the leading cause of death in America, 
from 18 to 45 years old, is fentanyl poisoning.
    Secretary Blinken. And Senator, I----
    Senator Graham. Enough is enough.
    Secretary Blinken. I absolutely share your priority and 
focus on that.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Senator Coons. Chair Murray.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Coons, and 
Ranking Member Graham. I am really glad to join you as we kick 
off this subcommittee hearing on President Biden's budget 
request. We are really lucky in the Senate to have a Chair and 
a Ranking Member on this committee who both really know their 
stuff when it comes to foreign policy, and are so similarly 
committed to finding common ground for the good of this 
country.
    These hearings provide a really important opportunity for 
us to assess our country's needs as we write our funding bills 
for the year ahead.
    Vice Chair Collins, who is here today, and I, have made 
very clear we want to return to regular order, a goal I know 
that both you and the Ranking Member share, and many of our 
colleagues do as well. We have a responsibility to work in a 
timely way to write funding bills that will build a stronger 
economy, make our communities safer, and ensure we stay ahead 
of our global competitors.
    I think we all know that getting this done through regular 
order, for the first time in years, will be no walk in the 
park, but it will be worth it. So I am really glad to have both 
of you as partners in this effort, and I look forward to 
working with everyone on this subcommittee to provide the 
robust funding that these issues deserve.
    Now, this hearing offers an important reminder that when it 
comes to keeping our Nation safe, and competitive, and secure, 
defense spending is important, but it is only one part of the 
equation.
    After all, our strength here at home and across the world 
isn't just measured by the strength of our military, it is 
measured by our diplomacy, our influence abroad, and our 
strategic investments, which make the world, including our own 
Nation, safer and more secure.
    And that is why boosting investments in non-defense 
discretionary spending is so critical, because we are weaker, 
our families are more at risk, when we retreat from the world 
stage, and folks back home get that. They see every day how our 
world is more connected than ever, and how crises on the other 
side of the world have ramifications for their daily lives: 
like when supply chains are broken, and families can't get the 
products they need; or when small businesses and our growers 
are cut off from foreign markets that they rely on to make a 
living; or when viruses spread undetected, leading to 
outbreaks, and as we know, pandemics; or when the world becomes 
more hostile to women as their rights are attacked, and less 
free, as democracies are undermined; or when families become 
refugees, and flee their homes due to persecution and violence. 
The more we are engaged in the world now, the better we can 
address and prevent these challenges before they reach our 
door.
    But if we fail to invest in the State Department and the 
powerful diplomatic tools we have, if we don't keep our 
embassies well-staffed, Mr. Secretary, as you mentioned, if we 
don't invest in preventing conflict before it causes 
catastrophe, and promoting stability with humanitarian aid and 
development, if we don't stand up for democracy, and stand up 
to autocrats, and if we don't invest in global solutions to 
global challenges, like food security, and tackling the climate 
crisis--in short, if we stand down on the world stage, our 
adversaries and competitors will step up and fill that 
leadership void.
    We know China is already working to build relationships and 
alliances across the world by building infrastructure far 
beyond its borders. If we are going to stay competitive we have 
to continue making smart investments that make our allies and 
our partnerships stronger. And we know a global challenge, like 
the climate crisis, cannot be solved through unilateral action, 
it can only be solved through global cooperation, and that 
requires leadership.
    Chair Coons, I really appreciate your leadership in 
focusing on how we must address the climate crisis on the world 
stage, because we are constantly seeing new, alarming examples 
of how the climate crisis poses an immense threat to global 
security, and to our own national security: water scarcity, 
food scarcity, extreme weather events, don't just create 
humanitarian crises in a vacuum, they can destabilize entire 
regions, threatening our own security.
    And we have also seen how Russia has tried to use energy 
dependence to strengthen its hand in its brutal war against 
Ukraine, which is just one more reason it is so important that 
we invest in global solutions to the climate crisis that allow 
our allies be less reliant on our adversaries for energy.
    At the same time we have to keep in mind that when we 
strengthen our ties in Asia, when we support economic stability 
in Latin America, when we build up public health capacity in 
Africa, those investments pay dividends, including for all of 
us right here at home. And that is true for families across the 
country, and especially for my home State of Washington.
    My State is a hub of global trade, especially with Asia, 
and one of America's great gateways to the world. We welcome 
diplomats, and have numerous consulates in our State. We 
welcome refugees, and are one of the top five States when it 
comes to hosting families that have fled the conflict in 
Ukraine.
    And not only do we welcome students, and workers, and 
tourists, we engage with the world too, including the many 
Fulbright scholars, and students, and Peace Corps members who 
head out from Washington State to learn about other countries, 
and cultures, and build relationships, and strengthen 
communities. Our investments in these programs help create a 
world that is safer and more open to Americans.
    So Mr. Chairman, I will just end by noting the list of 
issues in this subcommittee are really critical, for our 
Nation, for our families, and they literally span the globe. 
But the bottom line is pretty simple, we cannot be a player on 
the world stage and keep our country safe and prosperous if we 
put ourselves on the sidelines. And there is just too much at 
stake in this moment to let that happen.
    We have to continue the work of leading a global coalition 
that holds Russia accountable for its cruel and unjust invasion 
of Ukraine. We have to continue standing with our Ukrainian 
allies, supporting refugees, and providing the support they 
need, especially as we see China stepping in to grow its 
influence, with Xi's visit to Moscow earlier this week.
    We have got to continue to be steadfast in our investments 
to counter these influences, and continue to lead by example.
    So Mr. Secretary, I welcome you here today. I look forward 
to working with you and the administration, and working with my 
colleagues on this subcommittee on a bipartisan funding bill 
for next year that provides robust investments for the State 
Department, so we can strengthen our ties, support our allies, 
and solidify our place as the leader of the free world.
    So I have used my minutes.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Murray. But Mr. Chairman just let me say, I am 
following this subcommittee very closely. And look forward to 
working with you on a bipartisan product for all of us to 
support. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Madam Vice 
Chair. I am so excited by the drive, the energy, the leadership 
that you are delivering, and look forward to spending lots of 
time together, on subcommittee hearings, on full committee 
hearings, on markups, and getting a work product out. And thank 
you for sharing with us the ways in which Washington, as I 
suspect we may now hear is also true for Maine, are parts of 
our Nation, that although thousands of miles apart, share a 
common connection to the world, to global trade, and a 
connection to our security.
    Madam Vice Chair.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS

    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am 
going to take the opposite approach of Chair Murray. I am going 
to submit some comments for the record, and go straight to 
questions.
    Senator Collins. So as usual, we are complementing one 
another.
    Let me start with Ukraine, Mr. Secretary. There are those 
who view our support of Ukraine, as an either-or proposition 
for our national security. And they argue that either the 
United States focuses on pushing back Russian aggression in 
Ukraine, or the United States focuses on countering the rising 
influence of China.
    I don't agree with that assessment. I view the two 
challenges as interconnected, and believe that Russia and China 
are working in concert to reshape the international order to 
our disadvantage.
    Two questions for you. First, what message would it send to 
China and Russia, were we to abandon Ukraine at this point? And 
second, please articulate the case for why our involvement in 
Ukraine is in America's national interest?
    Secretary Blinken. Madam Vice Chair, thank you very much 
for that question. First of all, I fully agree with you. And 
let me put it this way, because it does go--in effect, the 
second part of your question actually goes right to the first 
part. Why is this in our interest? Why is it profoundly in the 
interest of the United States, to do what we have been doing, 
which is to continue to stand with Ukraine, as it defends 
itself, against this Russian aggression, to continue to exert 
pressure on Russia, to end the aggression, and to strengthen 
our own alliance, defensive alliance, NATO, in case that 
aggression spreads?
    It is two reasons: fundamentally, first of all, I think 
Americans do not like not like to see big nations bullying 
smaller ones, that is something that sticks in our craw, and we 
see the horrific abuses and atrocities that are being 
committed, and that is something that, I think, Americans focus 
on very intensely.
    But fundamentally, the reason is this: If we allow the 
Russian aggression in Ukraine to go forward with impunity, if 
we allow the very basic rules of the road, for how countries 
relate to one another, that were established after two world 
wars, and that focus, among other things, on making sure that 
countries respect the territorial integrity of other countries, 
respect their independence, respect their sovereignty.
    If we allow that to be violated with impunity by Russia in 
Ukraine, we open a Pandora's box around the world, where would-
be aggressors everywhere look at this and say: If they can get 
away with it, I can too. And that is a world of conflict, that 
is a world of war, that is world that we have been in before, 
and we have had to come in and do something about it. But it is 
not a world that we want.
    So the stakes in Ukraine go well beyond Ukraine. And to 
your point, I think it has a profound impact in Asia, for 
example. Everyone is watching to see how we and the world 
respond to this aggression. And they will draw their lessons 
from it. One of the reasons that there are so many partners 
involved in this from Asia is precisely because, even though 
this is happening half-a-world away, they see the stakes for 
them.
    One of the leading countries in our coalition that support 
Ukraine is Japan, South Korea is playing an important role, 
Australia is too, and they see the stakes. I think if China is 
looking at this, and they are looking at it very carefully, 
they will draw lessons for how the world comes together, or 
doesn't, to stand up to this aggression.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. And let me encourage you, and 
the other members of the administration, including the 
President, to make that case to the American people, much more 
forcefully, so that we do not see this continuing troubling 
decline in public support for our efforts in Ukraine. It goes 
way beyond doing the right thing from a moral or a humanitarian 
viewpoint. It is very much in our interest.
    Let me follow up, to some extent, on Senator Graham's 
questions on fentanyl.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Collins. We have recently had a tragic case in 
Maine, where a 14-year-old girl with no history of drug abuse, 
died from taking a pill that was laced with fentanyl, so this 
is a tragedy that affects each and every one of our States. The 
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account, 
works to reduce the production and trafficking of fentanyl, and 
other drugs, through its drug supply reduction program.
    The President's budget proposes $20 million for this 
program, which is only a $3 million increase above this year's 
level, despite the flood of fentanyl, the precursors of which 
come from China, go to Mexico, and then into this country to 
poison our people.
    So this disappoints me, and I ask you: do you think you are 
requesting sufficient funding? If you do, what other measures 
are you taking to specifically address the threat of fentanyl 
flowing into our country?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you very much for that question, 
because I absolutely share the priority that you, Senator 
Graham, I think everyone on this committee, is putting on this 
problem.
    As Senator rightly said, the number one killer of 
Americans, 18 to 49, is fentanyl, synthetic opioids. And so 
this is, it needs to be, a national priority. And I think we--
the way that we are approaching this is really a whole-of-
spectrum approach, by which I mean, that obviously we are doing 
work at home to try to reduce demand, protect our own people, 
get them the treatment, and antidotes they need, but that is 
not the answer, it is part of it, but it is not the answer.
    We talked a minute ago about border security and 
technology, where we can do a lot more to effectively intercept 
things coming into the country. But that is not enough. We have 
to be, and we are, working to disrupt the transnational 
criminal organizations that are engaged in moving this--making 
this stuff, and moving this stuff, and we are.
    We need to be working with, as we are, with Mexico to take 
down the labs, to take down the enterprises. And we need, to 
your point, to be more effective in preventing the diversion of 
illicit precursors into the illicit fabrication of synthetic 
opioids, like fentanyl.
    So we have done a number of things to intensely focus on 
this with Mexico. We actually are working in very close 
collaboration. They have now, you know, over the last year, 
arrested dozens of first- and second-tier transnational 
criminal organization leads. They have seized record amounts of 
fentanyl, but it is a huge sea. But that is going up. They 
disrupted production facilities with our assistance.
    We have our financial intelligence unit working with theirs 
to disrupt the financing of these networks, and we have now, as 
a result of work that I did with my colleagues, a Joint 
Synthetic Drug Action Plan with Mexico that expands cooperation 
with them, from law enforcement to the regulatory agencies in 
Mexico, to the trade and health organizations that are really 
important.
    Second, more broadly, for the first time, I just came, a 
couple of months ago, from the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting, 
in preparation for the leaders. For the first time the United 
States got this on the full agenda of the G20, so these are the 
most important economies in the world that have a real role and 
stake in different ways in this, and we will be establishing a 
working group in the G20 to work on this.
    Third, from the perspective of the State Department as 
well, one of the things that we are working on is building a 
coalition on a voluntary basis at first, to tackle another 
aspect of this problem, and that is the illicit diversion of 
legal precursors. This is a big problem, as you know.
    There are things that we can do much more effectively: 
sharing information, labeling, putting in place know your 
customer protocols, around the world including with China, to 
make sure that companies that are, again, involved in the 
production of perfectly illicit precursors, do not have them 
diverted into the fabrication of synthetic opioids. So all of 
that we are coming together.
    Now, as to the resources, Madam Vice Chair, very happy to 
work with you, very closely, to make sure that we are properly 
resourced for this. I could not agree with you more. This is a 
number one priority.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. My strong 
suspicion is that an amendment to increase the funding would 
get unanimous support.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Yes. I would be happy to cosponsor it.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. And I want to 
begin by thanking the State Department and the President for 
your request in the budget to support those people who have 
been affected by anomalous health incidents. As we know, that 
continues to be an issue for people affected, and I appreciate 
the continued work of the State Department.
    I was also pleased to see the President's budget include 
20,000 additional special immigrant visas for our Afghan 
allies, you mentioned that as part of your remarks. And I 
understand the Department is undertaking an effort to review 
our withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. I hope that that is 
a review that also considers the implication on Afghan women 
and girls----
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Shaheen[continuing]. Who have been, again, once 
again, had their rights stolen by the Taliban regime after our 
departure, who were not, as we have heard, have real concerns 
about what their future holds.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Shaheen. So can you give us an update on this 
effort, and is it going to be shared with the members of 
Congress?
    Secretary Blinken. So for the after-action review, and I 
think I mentioned at the very start of this, before you were 
here, yes. In short, yes, we have been working on that review, 
this was a commitment that I made very early on after the 
withdrawal to make sure that we learned the lessons from our 
part in that, what we got right, what we got wrong, what we 
need to learn from it. We brought in very experienced retired 
senior Foreign Service Officers to run that process. We did 
that.
    Other agencies have done similar efforts. We have been 
working in recent months to bring all of that together, to 
understand what the common lessons learned should be. A bottom 
line is this, we will be making those reports available, 
sharing that information with Congress within the next three 
weeks.
    Senator Shaheen. You wouldn't like to preview what it is 
going to say, would you?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, I don't want to get ahead of it, 
except to say that we have been looking at, just from the 
perspective of the State Department, I obviously can't speak to 
other agencies, about how we can be more effectively organized 
to deal with complex emergencies in advance. And we have 
definitely learned lessons from this experience that I think 
can make us more effective going forward, but we will share in 
detail what we have learned.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I will look forward to 
seeing that. And one of the places where I think that kind of a 
more coordinated strategy would be really important, is in the 
Black Sea region.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Shaheen. And the invasion of Ukraine really pointed 
out, with the closing of shipping lanes, and the impact on food 
security globally, just how important that region is. And as I 
am sure you are aware, we had language in the last Omnibus and 
Defense Authorization Bill, to ask the administration to 
develop a comprehensive approach to the Black Sea. I think it 
should include, not just national security issues, which we saw 
with the downing of our drone, how important those are in the 
region, but also economic and democracy support for what is 
happening in the region.
    So can you talk about where the administration is in 
developing that kind of a strategy, when we can expect it, and 
how it is helping to--helping us think about our approach to 
the region?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I very much appreciate your 
focus and leadership on this. And bottom line up front, we will 
produce that strategy. I think there is actually a deadline in 
the----
    Senator Shaheen. Right.
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. Legislation of June. And we 
will produce it by then. And I couldn't agree with you more. It 
requires, and we are focused on a much more comprehensive 
approach to the Black Sea region. As you know, larger than 
California, it has got six countries on its coast. Three of 
them are our NATO allies, others like Ukraine are obviously are 
important friends to the United States.
    And to your point, the strategy will focus, not just on the 
security aspects, but on promoting political engagement, on 
promoting economic cooperation, including strengthened energy 
security, which is critical to all of these countries in a 
variety of ways. As well as building democratic resilience 
because they are in a challenged neighborhood.
    And one of things that we have done, and the reason we want 
to make sure that we get this right is, we have gotten inputs 
from some of these countries, we want to make sure that they 
are factored into our strategy. For example, our Romanian 
colleagues have done, as you know, very well, have done a lot 
of thinking, and a brought a lot of focus to this. They shared 
with us their own views and plans, and that is something that 
we are factoring in. The bottom line though is, we will have it 
to you by June.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, I can tell you, I was in the region 
in both Romania and Georgia, the end of February, and there was 
a great deal of interest in the fact that we were beginning to 
think about that region more comprehensively, and really 
looking also at the economic potential that is there. In 
Georgia they are looking at what they are calling the ``Middle 
Corridor'' that would provide an opportunity to get around 
Russia in terms of energy.
    And I think as we look at countries like Georgia, where I 
am disappointed by some backsliding in the government, but 
where the people are very clearly committed to looking towards 
Europe, to looking at NATO, we need to think about how we can 
better support them. Our ambassador, their Ambassador Degnan, 
has done an excellent job.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen. As I was saying to the Chairman, thinking 
about where we put in Development Finance Corporation Office in 
that region, Georgia, I think has some real potential for that. 
It is something that could be very important.
    Let me just end by going back to the fentanyl question, 
because it has been such a huge issue for us in New Hampshire, 
and for everybody, I think, on this committee. We passed, 
Senator Portman and I worked on a legislation called the 
FENTANYL Results Act, to try and give the State Department more 
resources to work with other countries who might want to help 
us address fentanyl coming into the United States.
    Are there resources you need to do that legislation, and if 
so, what do you need? Let us know what you need so that we 
can----
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen [continuing]. So that we can ensure that 
that happens.
    Secretary Blinken. I really welcome working with you on 
that, because, indeed, one of the things that we are doing, is 
working to build a coalition of countries that can work 
together more effectively to deal with this challenge 
internationally, particularly again, when it comes to the 
diversion of licit precursors into illicit production of 
fentanyl.
    We started to do that, as I mentioned, at the G20, but 
there may be other ways that will be effective in building that 
out. That may require some additional resources. It will be 
great to work with you on that. Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Rubio.
    Senator Rubio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
coming in, we appreciate it.
    It strikes me--I know you like history. Is that one of 
your--isn't that one of your majors? Did you study that?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Rubio. Yes. And I think history is always 
instructive. One of the things that is most interesting about 
history is if you look back at these pivot moments in human 
history, the people that lived through them didn't realize that 
is what was happening. When you are living a hinge moment in 
history, you know, you are busy with everyday life, and 
everything else that is going on, and sometimes you don't 
entirely perceive it.
    So I am pleased, as I read the beginning of your statement 
here, and I heard it before I came in on the broadcast, where 
we meet at an inflection point, the post-Cold War world is 
over, and there is an intense competition underway to determine 
what comes next.
    So it is an acknowledgment that this is not what it was 
like 10 years ago, 5 years ago.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Rubio. Very different. And that is important. I 
would argue that we are beyond simply competitive, and I don't 
understand why we talk about strategic competition, and I don't 
say this with any joy in my heart, but simply because it is 
sort of par for the course in human history. I think we are 
entering, perhaps the beginning of a period of conflict, which 
doesn't necessarily always mean military conflict, but conflict 
nonetheless. We have an all-out war in Europe.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Rubio. That is most clearly a conflict, and it has 
been a globalized one. People call it a ``Proxy War'', but it 
has been globalized.
    We saw that very clearly yesterday with Xi's visit to 
Moscow, but beyond that, sort of the way the world is aligned 
in different ways. We have seen the rise of, by necessity, 
militarization. Germany, Japan, nothing that we are against, 
frankly, because given the necessities of the world, but this 
post-Cold War--post-World War II Order in which both countries 
decided that they were going to be less martial, less military. 
Necessity has changed it for both of them.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Rubio. A positive development for our alliance, but 
nonetheless a reality. We have these nine Eastern European 
countries that are even more hawkish than the rest of Europe, 
geography puts them right at the edge of Russia's aggression, 
when they can see very clearly what is happening.
    We have the very clear outlines of this emerging conflict: 
the U.S., the West, the democracies, and an alliance, the 
China-Russia Alliance, they don't want to call it that, but 
that is what it is, in conjunction with others like Iran, 
potentially, participating as well. And then these dozens and 
dozens of developing, so-called, the ``Non-Aligned Nations'', 
all trying to cut deals for themselves; we saw that with Saudi 
Arabia, you see it throughout Africa, et cetera.
    And then on top of that, in this emerging block of two 
nations between, it is not simply these military alliances, we 
are seeing the rise of alternatives to the SWIFT Banking 
System, to the U.S. dollar, ways to--the growth of countries 
that now have a vested interest in figuring out how to evade 
sanctions.
    You see supply chain diversity, Europe is diversifying 
where it gets its energy, and the rest of the world is 
diversifying, because I think there is the understanding that 
the market is responding to the fact that we are entering a 
period, a conflict. It is in that vein, given all of that, that 
I am really concerned about whether we can continue to afford 
to do some of the things that we are doing. I don't mean from a 
dollar standpoint, but from a geopolitical standpoint.
    So for example, last summer the State Department released a 
report attacking the Solomon Islands for their stance on same-
sex marriage. It alienated their partners there. The next week 
they signed a Mutual Security Agreement with Beijing and the 
Pacific, and the Prime Minister declined to participate in the 
commemoration of the memorial marking the Battle of 
Guadalcanal. That is just one example.
    I mean, we could go--I could take 10, 15 minutes to go 
through each of these here, and point to different such places 
where we have sort of aligned ourselves in that way.
    Haven't we now reached a point where, frankly, we have to 
understand we are entering a period of geopolitical competition 
bordering on conflict, diplomatic conflict, economic conflict; 
and God forbid, potentially military conflict, and as a result 
need to govern ourselves accordingly? Not that these values, or 
whatever our values may be don't matter, but our approach has 
to look very different than it did 5, 10, 15 years ago when, 
frankly, the U.S. was the world's sole superpower.
    And we had, in many cases, the luxury to be able to go 
through and do some of these things, because it is not that 
these issues don't matter, it is that none of these issues are 
going to matter if 15, 10, or 5 years from now we live in a 
world in which the dominant economic military and technological 
power in the world is in the hands of authoritarian regimes, 
who frankly resemble what the vast majority of human history 
looks like. And that is, led by despots where there are no 
individual rights, and all these things that have made, not 
just our prosperity and freedom possible here, but the world a 
better place.
    Isn't it time for us to view the world through the lens, 
frankly, of the beginnings, the early stages of a geopolitical 
conflict?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator I share your--I share your basic 
analysis. And I think that, in a sense that is exactly what we 
are doing. We have worked from day one to do two things, 
foundational things: One is to support important investments in 
ourselves, which I talked about a little earlier, to make sure 
that we are as strong and competitive as we can be. And I 
think, thanks to Congress, we have made those historic 
investments. And the CHIPS and Science Act is maybe the best 
example.
    But second, we have worked from day one both to reengage, 
rejuvenate, and strengthen our existing alliances and 
partnerships, but also build new ones, new coalitions of 
countries, and even beyond countries, that are fit-for-purpose 
in dealing with different parts of the challenge that I think 
you described very, very well.
    Just to give you one quick example. When we are dealing 
with the challenge posed to supply chains around the world, to 
make sure that we have, and benefit from, diversified and 
resilient supply chains. We brought together countries in a 
coalition to do that, to in many cases, near-shore and friend-
shore, to have early warning systems in place if they are being 
disrupted. And also, through something called the Mineral 
Security Partnership, to make sure that the United States and 
likeminded countries are focused on ensuring that we are able 
to invest in, effectively, some of the critical minerals that 
are so important to so much of what we are doing.
    When it comes to our engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, 
the Indo-Pacific, we have put that on full throttle. We have 
reopened an Embassy, as you know, in the Solomon Islands. We 
are looking at other places in the Pacific Islands, where we 
can make sure that we are present in ways that we haven't been 
in recent years, precisely because we are engaged in a 
competition.
    And I could go down the list of different collections of 
fit-for-purpose partnerships that we built to deal with exactly 
the world that that you are describing. I do think, and you 
said it, that as we do that, the values that unite us are also 
usually important to the strength and solidarity of these 
alliances of partnerships.
    Now, not every country that we need to be working with is 
in the same place that we are. I think we recognize that, and 
we need to make sure that we are adjusting and flexible enough 
for that.
    The last thing is this: There are a number of countries 
that are looking, as you know, very carefully and what is 
happening, making their own decisions, in some sense making 
their own bets about which direction they are going to go in. 
And from my perspective this is less about saying to them: You 
have to choose, and more offering them a choice. If we are able 
to do that, for example, in being able to catalyze real 
infrastructure investment that is a race to the top, not a race 
to the bottom, they are going to choose us.
    We also have to have some strategic patience. There are 
countries that have had long-standing, for decades, 
relationships, for example, with Russia, where moving away from 
that, as they want to do, is not like flipping a light switch, 
it is moving an aircraft carrier, and we have to work with them 
to do that.
    But I share the basic picture that you have painted, and 
really welcome working with you to figure out the most 
effective ways to deal with it. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Rubio, I couldn't agree 
more that that is one of the core arguments for robustly 
resourcing the State Department and the USAID, is to make sure 
we are meeting this moment.
    Senator Murphy.
    Senator Murphy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good to 
see you, Mr. Secretary.
    The eyes of the world and the nation are rightly focused on 
Ukraine, on our broad set of competition, challenges with 
China; the Middle East always gets an outsized share of 
attention from this country and this Congress. But I want to 
thank you for the work that your diplomats have done to achieve 
two preliminary, but very important, smaller scale diplomatic 
agreements in the past several weeks.
    First, the Windsor Framework, which the United States had a 
great interest in, to make sure that peace is preserved in 
Northern Ireland ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good 
Friday Agreement, and the Normalization Agreement between 
Kosovo and Serbia. The team that you have in place in that 
region is absolutely exceptional. Well, that is the beginning 
of what we hope is more accommodations between those two 
countries, a really important step. So I just wanted to 
congratulate you and your team on the work that you have done 
on those two important achievements.
    I want to turn your attention to the Global Engagement 
Center.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Murphy. Because this is something you and I have 
talked about, and I appreciate the fact that we have continued 
to scale up the size of the Global Engagement Center, and that 
your budget requests another double-digit percentage increase. 
I am of the belief that the GEC needs to take a primary, rather 
than secondary role when it comes to the way in which we 
counter misinformation around the world. I think, often, the 
Department of Defense which has a budget that dwarfs that of 
the GEC, doesn't always have the sensitivities that the State 
Department does about what messages work and what doesn't.
    But what concerns me more is that we have ahead of us, the 
reauthorization of the GEC, we have got to put it back on the 
books, and there is really no way to combat Russian 
misinformation, their propaganda efforts, which are integral to 
their campaign against Ukraine; or China's efforts to expand 
its reach, without the GEC.
    So I just wanted you--I want to sneak in at least one more 
question, but ask you for a minute to talk about what impact it 
would have if we were not able to extend the GEC's authorities 
beyond the end of 2024?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. And really, thank you for raising 
that. And also, thank you for your leadership on this.
    And this is a front in the conflict that Senator Rubio was 
just talking about. That is information. And we have 
competitors, adversaries, who are using information, or more 
accurately, misinformation and disinformation, against us, 
virtually every minute of the day, and against our allies and 
partners, both to drive wedges between us, and also to 
misinform publics in profound ways.
    The GEC, for us, is a critical tool in actually being able 
to deal with that. And as you know, what it is doing is working 
with other agencies to direct, to lead, to synchronize, to 
coordinate, our efforts to understand these trends in foreign 
malign actors trying to spread disinformation and propaganda 
outside of the United States; and both to understand it, to 
expose it, to share that information with others, and to help 
them develop tools to combat it. We have campaigns through the 
GEC to--as I said, to expose, to educate, to mitigate 
disinformation.
    It is now the premier information sharing platform 
internationally. For this we have dozens of countries that are 
participating with us, among other things. Just to cite a few 
examples: we have exposed through the GEC, Russian websites 
that have been pushing misinformation, disinformation, 
including about Ukraine, again in countries around the world; 
disinformation coming from China in third countries about 
elections, again, about Russia's war of aggression against 
Ukraine. We have done tremendous work, I think, doing open 
source mapping of some of the use that China has made of 
surveillance technology and data collection, and so on. I could 
go on, but the point is, it is a very effective vehicle for 
doing this, and if we lose that we are, in effect, disarming 
ourselves in this aspect of the competition.
    Senator Murphy. Here, here. And I hope that those of us who 
have worked in a bipartisan way to support the GEC, will 
continue to do that.
    I wanted to turn your attention to North Africa for a 
moment. Senator Coons has led the effort in trying to increase 
our ability to operate in fragile environments, and there are a 
number of them in North Africa, one of them is Libya. Your 
budget requests a 6 percent increase in worldwide security 
protection funding for local forces to make sure that we have a 
diplomatic presence in dangerous places; and few more dangerous 
places than Libya.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Murphy. But other countries are reopening their 
diplomatic presence there. Senator Risch and I have led an 
effort to rewrite the Accountability Review Board process to 
try to give your folks a little bit more reason to reengage in 
those fragile places.
    I just worry that without a presence there in 2023, we are 
going to have a hard time protecting our equities and a lot of 
taxpayer dollars that have been spent there. Do you have--with 
this additional funding that you have put in the budget; do you 
have any timetable for our ability to reopen the Embassy in 
Libya?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I can't give you a timetable, 
other than to say that it is something we are very actively 
working on. And like you, I want to see us be able to 
reestablish an ongoing presence in Libya. There is also an 
important moment where, through the work of the UN Envoy, there 
may be, emphasize, ``may be'', a path forward to moving Libya 
in a better direction, including getting elections for a 
legitimate government.
    And our diplomats are deeply engaged in that, but obviously 
it would be a lot easier and more effective if they were on the 
ground day in day out. So we are working on it. We want to work 
with you, work with this committee, on what would be necessary 
to support that.
    Senator Murphy. And lastly, on Tunisia.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Murphy. I know that you are just as concerned as 
this committee is, about the dramatic turn in Tunisia away from 
democracy, an 11 turnout in the so-called ``elections''. It 
seems to me that President Saied has made up his mind to move 
away from a success story of democracy in Tunisia, towards a 
neo-autocracy.
    It seems that your budget, you know, is a bit of a middling 
ground, and maybe that is where you want to be, cutting 
economic funding, maintaining military funding, but then also 
opening up the possibility of additional military funding if 
Tunisia, quote ``shows signs of a return to democratic 
governance.'' I kind of feel like they have made their 
decision, and I think that our funding and our policy should 
reflect that, but your budget suggests that you still have hope 
that Tunisia can return to the rule of law; is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. Hope is always important, but of course, 
it has to be grounded in reality. I have met with President 
Saied on a number of occasions, including most recently, I 
guess, the Africa Leaders Summit, at the end of last year. We 
are engaged with the Tunisian Government. We are indeed 
concerned about what we have seen over the last year.
    There is another aspect of this that is critically 
important that also goes to our budget, which is the most 
critical thing they can do on the economic side, is actually 
get an IMF agreement. And we have been strongly encouraging 
them to do that because the economy risks falling off the deep 
end. So we need to see that, but we also want to see steps 
taken to put Tunisia fully back on the democratic path it was 
on.
    Senator Murphy. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you Senator Murphy. One of the things 
we could do to help with public diplomacy is confirm Elizabeth 
Allen to the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. But forgive me. Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman Coons.
    Secretary Blinken, welcome, it is good to see you again.
    Secretary Blinken. Good to see you.
    Senator Hagerty. A number of things to get through, 
Secretary, so I am going to move pretty quickly. The first one 
I would like to touch on: this past year, Senator Cardin and I 
passed a law to create a Commission on Reform and Modernization 
of the Department of State, via the 2023 NDAA.
    This new law authorizes the commission to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the State Department, and to offer 
specific legislative proposals for modernizing the Department. 
And funding the Commission will be one of my top SFOPS 
appropriations priorities this year.
    Secretary Blinken, if the committee includes in our 
appropriation for the Commission on Reform and Modernization of 
the Department of State, do you commit to cooperating fully 
with this commission, on all matters described in the 
underlying law that created it?
    Secretary Blinken. In short, yes. And indeed, one of things 
I will just say very quickly, Senator, is: I think we have been 
looking as well, and talking to your team about recommendations 
for that. And we very much want to make sure that we provide 
the support to be able to do it.
    Senator Hagerty. Excellent. We look forward to working with 
you on it too.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. As Senator Rubio mentioned, we do face new 
and evolving challenges every day, and I think that 
modernization of the Department will help us address those 
challenges. So thank you for that commitment.
    Let me turn to another area that is very troubling. It is 
an issue related to our neighbor at our southern border, 
President Lopez Obrador continues to take arbitrary and 
punitive actions against U.S. businesses operating in Mexico.
    So my first question is, whether you are aware of the 
Mexican Military's recent seizure of a U.S.-owned Deepwater 
Port that is on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico?
    Secretary Blinken. I am not sure that I am aware of that 
particular seizure. And when did this happen?
    Senator Hagerty. It just recently happened in the past few 
weeks.
    Secretary Blinken. Happy to follow up with you on that.
    Senator Hagerty. I would like to do that. In that 
situation, it concerns me that the Mexican Government has put 
its Military in charge of constructing a section of the Tren 
Maya Railway that is near this recently seized port. And the 
bigger concern is the fact that China may be involved in 
building sections of that railway. The Chinese have bragged 
that the China Communications Construction Corporation is 
heavily involved in providing key materials for the railway. 
You probably are aware of----
    Secretary Blinken. Just if I could ask, just as a point of 
information. There is the case, and I am not sure if this same 
one, of Vulcan Materials.
    Senator Hagerty. That is the case.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. I am sorry. I didn't, I didn't 
associate. Yes. That I am aware of, and share the concern about 
that, and we have been asking the Mexican Authorities, local 
authorities as well national authorities, about the military 
and police presence there. So this is a deep concern. I think 
as a practical matter as well, cases like this can very 
negatively impact Mexico's effort to attract future investment 
from the United States, and any other countries.
    Senator Hagerty. Absolutely.
    Secretary Blinken. So yes. I am sorry. I didn't----
    Senator Hagerty. No. I think that is a grave concern, as 
you just described, that Mexico would take this sort of 
arbitrary and very detrimental action against U.S. assets. I 
mean, the rule of law is critical to the relationship, and I am 
just shocked that President Lopez Obrador is operating in this 
manner. I think the even deeper shock though, is the concern 
that a Chinese company is involved in building a section of the 
railway nearby.
    I also understand that this company that they are using is 
deeply involved in building Chinese military infrastructure, 
they are involved in militarizing the islands in the South 
China Sea, that China has poured concrete into the ocean to 
build. I think the other thing I hope we can investigate is 
whether the Chinese are involved in financing this.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Hagerty. There are deep concerns there. We have 
got, potentially, Chinese companies working with the Mexican 
Military to take adverse actions on U.S. assets, and in 
particular, seizing a deepwater port in that location. I would 
be interested in your opinion whether this would be in the 
interest of the Chinese Communist Party to have control of this 
port.
    Secretary Blinken. I think it, theoretically, would be. And 
it would certainly not be in the interest of Mexico. One of the 
things that we have worked actively with Mexico on, is making 
sure that, in other areas, for example, in the telecom sector, 
that they focus on making sure they have trusted vendors 
engaged in their system, because we know the challenges to 
their own sovereignty, when you don't have a trusted vendor in 
your telecom system.
    Senator Hagerty. It is a deep concern.
    Secretary Blinken. And this is something I must say that 
President Lopez Obrador seems seized with, but I would welcome, 
first of all, making sure we have all the information that you 
have about this particular case, and sharing with your team 
what we know.
    Senator Hagerty. We will exchange information.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. And we may even have an opportunity to 
discuss it further this afternoon, at the SFRC.
    I would like to turn to another area, and that again, 
relates to China, and the situation with Taiwan. In 2023, this 
year, February, CIA Director Burns said that, ``As a matter of 
assessment, China seems to be capable of conducting an invasion 
by 2027 if so ordered.'' Do you agree with Director Burns' 
assessment?
    Secretary Blinken. I agree with his assessment, yes.
    Senator Hagerty. Time is not on our side, Secretary, 
especially when we have a $19 billion arms backlog to Taiwan. 
That is why I was proud to contribute to and vote for the 
Taiwan Enhancement Resilience Act, TERA, the Security 
Assistance Authorization Law that Senators Bob Menendez and Jim 
Risch passed into law via the 2023 NDAA.
    The Bipartisan Menendez Law annually authorizes as much as 
2 billion in grants in foreign military financing to Taiwan 
between now and 2027. I was deeply disappointed, however, to 
see that the President's proposed budget this year included 
only 113 million in new FMF lines for emergency foreign policy 
priorities, far short of the $2 billion target.
    This 113 million in the President's proposed budget, 
assumes a mere 16 million as a baseline for foreign military 
financing in the Indo-Pacific.
    So my question, Secretary, is: Why did the State 
Department's budget request for foreign military financing 
exclude funding for this bipartisan law?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, Senator as you point out, we do 
have, a part of our request, the emerging priorities fund 
globally, which as you rightly said, is about $113 million in 
the budget. When it comes to Taiwan, you know, FMF is one tool, 
we appreciate the authority, we also appreciate the drawdown 
authority, which we are looking at. But we have looked at how 
we can be most effective in supporting Taiwan in its defense.
    As you know, the State Department has notified just over 
the past decade or so, nearly $40 billion in foreign military 
sales to Taiwan, going back just between 2019, and today it has 
been about $21 billion. I have signed out more cases than any 
Secretary of State in history for Taiwan. Taiwan also increased 
its own defense budget, by 11 percent, giving it the additional 
means to buy equipment necessary for its defense.
    Senator Hagerty. Back to the original question, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. I am sorry. The time is so tight.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. But to the original question, the budget 
is far short of what you have been authorized. My question now 
is, whether the PRC has said to you, or to anybody that works 
at the State Department, or any of our diplomats, that there is 
some sort of red line involved with us stepping up our Foreign 
Military Financing?
    Secretary Blinken. No. And to the extent they would ever 
try to say anything like that. That is not something that we 
would obviously take into account. As I said, I signed out more 
cases than any previous Secretary of State, the challenge that 
we have is--I think you have pointed to, is we have a backlog, 
a very significant backlog that has built up.
    This fundamentally goes to production challenges that we 
have. I know that we are working on, on a bipartisan basis, 
working with industry to build up that production capacity. 
That is the long pole in the tent, and we need to address it.
    Senator Hagerty. I am very familiar with foreign military 
sales process.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. And I would just say this, we learn to--we 
have an opportunity for deterrence with Ukraine, we didn't take 
it. We have the opportunity here, the Menendez law, actually, 
is aimed at providing that opportunity to create deterrence 
there that could be significant. I encourage, and look forward 
to working with you to do everything we can in that regard.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, great to see you. And thank you for your 
support for the men and women at the State Department, 
including the Foreign Service as well as the Civil Service.
    A few years ago I teamed up with my colleague, Senator 
Sullivan, and we passed, with the support of members of this 
committee and the Senate, the Foreign Service Families Act, 
which is designed to help us continue to retain and to recruit 
the finest diplomatic corps in the world.
    We are in the implementation process. My staff just met 
with your team yesterday. We are pleased with the progress that 
has being made. And I am just asking for your assurance today 
that we will continue to implement those parts that are still 
in progress?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. Absolutely, because it is critical 
that we be able to attract and retain the best talent 
available, this is an important component of that because this 
is something that you have known and lived more than, or as 
much as anyone. This is a family enterprise. It is not simply 
the Foreign Service Officer that is there, it is the entire 
family. So we want to make sure that we are finding ways, 
through the Act to support them, to create greater opportunity 
for them, because that is the most effective way to attract and 
retain people.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you Mr. Secretary. Let me turn 
now to the recent meeting between Putin and President Xi, which 
took place, of course, just days after the ICC confirmed what 
we knew, which is that Putin was a war criminal, this case 
based on the fact that they have abducted Ukrainian children 
and taken them forcefully to Russia.
    You know, President Xi has reiterated the fact that that 
relationship between Russia and China knows, quote, ``No 
limits. The friendship knows no limits''. You and others in the 
administration have warned of the possibility that China would 
provide--start providing material----
    Secretary Blinken. Right.
    Senator Van Hollen [continued]: Military support to Russia 
in its fight against Ukraine, and that that would be a red line 
that would trigger severe economic consequences in the form of 
sanctions. I am glad you have established that very clearly. In 
order for that to be effective we need to make sure our allies 
and partners are on board.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Van Hollen. That includes our European partners. It 
also includes our democratic partners, like South Korea, Japan, 
Australia, others in East Asia, and around the world. So my 
question is, do we have a break the glass plan? Because what we 
don't want to see happen is if China were to provide military 
assistance that we are, you know, all fluttering around trying 
to figure out the way forward. Obviously imposing economic 
sanctions on Chinese entities is tougher than on Russian 
entities, given the more interconnected nature of the 
economies. But do we have a break-the-glass plan with our 
partners in the event China were to provide military assistance 
to Russia?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you Senator. Let me say two things 
quickly about this. First, as you noted, going back to day-one 
of the Russian aggression we have been very clear with Beijing 
about the serious problem that any material lethal support to 
Russia, for the Russian against Ukraine would pose for us, and 
we believe for countries around the world. President Biden 
shared this directly with President Xi about three weeks into 
the aggression when they spoke by video conference. We have 
reiterated that.
    And as we have seen them consider it more actively in 
recent months, we have doubled down in making clear to them the 
serious problem that this would pose. But what is important is 
this, and it is to your point, it is not just us. When we 
shared with allies and partners some of the information we had 
about the act of consideration that China was giving to 
providing this lethal material support to Russia, this 
galvanized a number of other countries, all of whom directly 
engaged senior Chinese leadership on the question.
    And so we are actively talking to them about what it is we 
would do in the event that that happened. But my hope is that 
China having heard, not just from us, but from many countries, 
including countries with which it is trying to carry more 
favorable relations, that it heard them, and heard us, and will 
not cross that line.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, Mr. Secretary, I appreciate that. 
I just think it is going to be really important that we have in 
place a specific plan with our partners so that we are ready to 
go, and that China knows we are ready to go, because the 
deterrent effect of that, I think, depends on their clearly 
understanding the impact.
    If I could turn now to the Israeli-Palestinian issue; since 
the new Israeli Government was formed, high-level members of 
our Government have visited Israel, including yourself. Just a 
few days ago, President Biden had a phone call with Prime 
Minister Netanyahu. The readout from that call indicated that 
President Biden underscored the need to quote, ``Maintain the 
viability of the two-state solution,'' unquote, and the 
importance of abiding by the two agreements that the United 
States helped to recently broker between Israelis and 
Palestinians, at Aqaba, and later at Sharm el-Sheikh.
    Those agreements committed Israel to, I quote, ``Stop 
discussions of any more settlement units for 4 months, and stop 
authorization of any outposts for 6 months.'' Within days of 
the Aqaba Agreement, as you as know, President--Prime Minister 
Netanyahu rushed to disavow it, said that doesn't apply.
    And then just days after the meeting at Sharm el-Sheikh, 
and after the phone call between President Biden and Prime 
Minister Netanyahu, the Knesset voted to pass a law to lift the 
ban on reentering four settlements, including Homesh, that 
Israel had committed to evacuate 20 years ago.
    State Department Spokesperson Patel, said the move was, and 
I quote, ``Inconsistent with Israel's recent commitments to 
deescalating Israeli-Palestinian tensions,'' and said, ``It was 
a clear contradiction of undertakings the Israeli government 
made to the United States.''
    I am assuming that you also support and endorse those 
comments made by the State Department spokesperson?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I do, but it is also based on 
the--what we hear. And I have heard directly from Israeli 
leadership, as well as the Palestinian Authority, about the 
desire for both sides to see the violence that has reached 
record levels in recent months, deescalate, and to try to get a 
period of calm. And that is clearly in the interest of both 
sides, and it is an interest that at least Prime Minister 
Netanyahu has expressed directly to me.
    And there are a number of things that go with that, you 
decided if we see----
    Senator Van Hollen. No. Mr. Secretary----
    Secretary Blinken [continued]: If we see steps inconsistent 
with that, I think it does contradict what we believe both 
Israelis and the Palestinian Authority are seeking to do, and 
what they have said to us, is in their own self-interest.
    Senator Van Hollen. No, I appreciate that. Obviously we 
need to see compliance on both sides, the Palestinian Authority 
and the Government of Israel. But this was a very official act 
by the Knesset, just days after the phone call between Prime 
Minister Netanyahu and President Biden. So I am pleased to see 
you support, endorse the statement by the State Department 
spokesperson.
    But it seems to me that we look very weak when we 
continually make statements without any kind of consequence, so 
I guess my final question to you is: What are we prepared to 
do? What is the Biden administration prepared to do if you see 
continuing violations, by either side, of this agreement?
    Secretary Blinken. Look, I don't want to speculate or get 
into a hypothetical about where this may go and what we would 
do. I can say that both the Israeli Government and the 
Palestinian Authority want us to be involved and engaged in 
helping, and supporting, and working with them to try to get to 
this period of calm. At some point if either or both sides are 
not doing what we believe is necessary to get there, it will be 
hard or may be futile for us to do that. So we have to look 
very carefully at that.
    But I also think that it is important for everyone to try 
to double down on the steps necessary to try to get there, 
because it is profoundly not in the interests of Israel, our 
close ally and partner, or for that matter the Palestinian 
Authority, to see this cycle, cycle up and not down.
    Senator Van Hollen. Mr. Secretary, I appreciate the 
efforts. And the United States has been involved in trying to 
broker these agreements, I guess my question, and I will just 
leave it with your last answer is that, you know: What are we 
prepared to do when we see violations of those commitments?
    Thank you Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you.
    Mr. Secretary, pleased to be with you this morning.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Moran. Last year in this setting I asked you about 
the CPTPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. Your response to me touted the Indo-Pacific 
Economic Forum. I would highlight for you that just in the last 
6 months the Australian Foreign Minister, Singapore's Defense 
Minister, Japan's Foreign Minister have noted, I think with the 
objection our absence, from that agreement.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. What is it that keeps us from a willingness 
to engage? You can shift me back to the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Forum; but why is it that this is not a good idea? The TPP is 
not a good idea for us to engage in?
    I say this, I mean, perhaps from an economic, you know, 
point of view, but from a relationship. I meant to say this at 
the very beginning: I am as concerned about our Nation as I 
have ever been. Those are usually throwaway lines from 
something we say throughout our careers and lives, but it is 
genuine with me. The circumstances we now face suggest to me 
that we need a lot more friends and allies, and our trading 
relationship, our economic support, those relationships matter.
    I walked as Senator Rubio and you were conversing, and it 
seems to me that our foreign policy needs to be different in 
today's world than it was just even a few years ago.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. And this would be one that I think would be 
important from a relationship, from a national security point 
of view, as much as it is from an economic point of view.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. So Senator, a couple of things on 
that: First, our focus, in the immediate, is on building up and 
building out the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, known as 
IPEF. That does include, among other things, some trade 
facilitation measures, it has a focus, for example, on digital 
trade which is so critical to the 21st Century economies. It is 
something that the partners in that endeavor are very focused 
on and----
    Senator Moran. Why does that exclude TPP?
    Secretary Blinken. It doesn't exclude it. I am saying, in 
the in the first instance this is where our focus is, supply 
chain diversification and resiliency. That is a big part of 
IPEF, building out clean economy infrastructures, that is a big 
focus, and then, as well, making sure that we are combating, 
together, corruption that still undermines the systems that we 
are trying to bring together.
    I was there when TPP was negotiated in the--during the 
Obama administration, I was engaged in that. And I think that 
in that moment it was a very good endeavor, and one that I 
think, both economically and strategically, had real benefits. 
I think as it now stands, the world has moved on, and I think 
we have to focus, in the first instance, on what we can do, and 
what we can build out, and generate support for. Let us see 
where we get to----
    Senator Moran. Generate support for.
    Secretary Blinken. Here.
    Senator Moran. Within the United States.
    Secretary Blinken. Within the United States, as well as, of 
course, among our allies and partners. I would note, of course, 
that even as we are working on the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Framework, we have been building and strengthening new 
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to include the Quad. I just 
came from a meeting with Japan, with Australia, and with India. 
That is a very effective vehicle, including on--increasingly on 
economic matters. We, of course, more strategically, have 
AUKUS.
    The President, as you know, just came from a meeting with 
U.K. and Australia on that, and we have deepened and 
strengthened our engagement with ASEAN, including economically, 
so all of those pieces fit together.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Secretary, I just would say from my 
point of view, when you say, ``We have moved on'', we should 
not have moved on. And we should reengage. These things are not 
mutually exclusive, and what you described as occurring are, in 
my view good things, but it still leaves out an important 
component.
    I joined a number of my colleagues here. I am a co-chair of 
the Senate Hunger Caucus.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Afghanistan, massive, massive humanitarian 
crisis, 20 million people facing food insecurity. The Taliban 
recently eliminated the ability for women to work in NGO 
organizations in food delivery. What steps are you thinking 
between you and Samantha Power, and others that can be done, in 
regard to Afghanistan and the world food crisis?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. Senator, you are right to point to 
this, this huge challenge. We have been, even since the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ending the war, the largest 
single humanitarian contributor to Afghanistan, particularly 
when it comes to the fundamentals of the basics, like food, we 
have been working, relatively effectively, through 
international partners, implementers, the United Nations, NGOs 
that were getting food where it was needed, and getting other 
basic humanitarian support.
    I think there was a real concern in the first year about 
the possibility of Afghanistan as challenged, deeply challenged 
as it was, falling even further off the edge, that that didn't 
happen in large part, because we were able to send the 
assistance. The problem that we face now is exactly what you 
pointed to, the edicts promulgated by the Taliban, preventing 
women from participating in the delivery of assistance. That 
violates a fundamental principle that we do not want to in any 
way ratify.
    But what is happening, as a practical matter is, that in 
many parts of Afghanistan that edict is not being implemented, 
which means that where it is not being implemented we are able 
to continue to have these groups provide--support them, 
providing assistance, because women are still allowed to 
participate in its distribution.
    So that is what is going on right now. But look, I agree 
with you, the Taliban is taking steps that are digging an even 
deeper hole for the people of Afghanistan.
    Senator Moran. This evening, a number of us will say 
goodbye to Ambassador Beasley.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Moran. And say hello, and welcome to Ambassador 
McCain.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Moran. I would use this opportunity to express my 
gratitude for the leadership of Ambassador Beasley and----
    Secretary Blinken. He has been remarkable.
    Senator Moran. He has been remarkable. And wish every best 
wish for Ambassador McCain.
    I have 38 seconds, Mr. Secretary. Last month I sent a 
letter, along with a number of my colleagues, to Assistant 
Secretary Bitter, Consular Affairs.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. What needs to be done to improve the 
processing of visas, that is the nature of our inquiry, it can 
take over 400 days for a student to get an interview for an 
appointment. These are, certainly, strategic in relationship, 
they are family and humanitarian. Our office I would guess, 
like most of my colleagues, has become a passport and visa 
office. We are a part of the, apparently, the State Department, 
with just hundreds.
    I see a report every week of what we call ``casework'', 
lots of many significant things, visas and passports occupy a 
significant portion of our staff's time. We are willing and 
happy to do it. But something needs to be change at the State 
Department and Consular Affairs.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. I very much appreciate that. And 
this is something that, Senator, we are, and I am absolutely 
seized with. As you know, we have had to build back from COVID, 
the system for doing the visas, as well, by the way here doing 
passports, is very labor intensive, a lot of that labor, both 
in terms of contractors and State Department personnel went 
away during COVID. We have had to build back and that has not 
been without challenge. And we are very focused on dealing with 
the wait times that people are experiencing in countries around 
the world.
    It affects, primarily, right now, first-time visitor 
applicants, processing times for categories that have a 
particular impact on the U.S. economy, students, temporary 
workers, maritime crew renewals, they are actually where they 
were before the pandemic, or actually better.
    For visitor visas, the median, global interview appointment 
wait time is now under 2 months. That is the median. I don't 
want to say that there are not places of importance where it is 
longer, but the median time is under 2 months. That is half of 
what it was in--a year ago, in 2022. Most places, the wait 
times are actually much lower than that, as a practical matter.
    We have 58 million foreign nationals who actually hold a 
valid multi-entry visitor visa, so they don't, of course, need 
to keep reapplying. And they can visit whenever. And in fact, 
most international visitors to the United States come to the 
United States without a visa, because they are either Canadian, 
or they are part of the Visa Waiver Program.
    Again, that doesn't answer the problem for those who 
require visas. What we are seeing, I think the first 5 months 
of this fiscal year, fiscal year 2023, we have had a huge surge 
again in non-immigrant visas, we increased those by 18 percent 
over the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.
    Many countries, like Mexico, like Brazil, we actually 
issued more tourist visas in fiscal year 2022 than we did in 
fiscal year 2019. India, which I know has been a particular 
concern to a lot of people, the wait time for first-time 
visitor visa interviews, dropped 60 percent since January of 
this year, just in the last few months. And we have issued 60 
percent more non-immigrant visas this fiscal year, to date, 
than the same period, again, going back to 2019.
    It is a long way of saying: If you look at it 
comprehensively, there is significant progress and improvement. 
But there are clearly places where we need to do more to surge 
some of our assets. And I think also what happens is, you know, 
anecdotally, these are real human problems, we all hear about 
them, we get seized with them. We want to work with you to 
continue to strengthen this, and improve our----
    Senator Moran. In that regard, would you thank your 
personnel at Consular Affairs? They have been helpful and 
appreciative of the circumstances that we----
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Moran [continuing]. And the people we care about 
are in.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Moran. We agree on an 
awful lot of trade policy issues.
    Senator Schatz.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am thrilled to 
be on this committee.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service, and thank you 
for being here today. First question is: What is your level of 
confidence that Israel is in compliance with the Leahy Law?
    Secretary Blinken. To the best of my knowledge, they are. 
And certainly it is something that we take very, very seriously 
everywhere around the world. And when we do the necessary 
vetting for foreign military sales, or others, one of the key 
things we look at is Leahy Law compliance. So to the best of my 
knowledge, they are.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. I see that you have a new 
program, Strengthening Forest Conservation and Land Management 
Initiative, which is great. You know I care very deeply about--
--
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz [continuing]. International deforestation, 
especially commodity-driven deforestation. A kind of technical 
question: It is not obvious to me why you are dividing 
implementation between State and USAID. So can you describe the 
theory of the case here?
    Secretary Blinken. I am actually happy to come back to you 
on that. And make sure that I give you a fully, informed 
answer. I can say, generally, two things: one, we are deeply 
committed to this, and appreciate the leadership that you have 
shown on it.
    Just by way of example, President Lula, as you know, was in 
Washington just recently to meet with President Biden. One of 
the things we focused on, of course, was dealing with the 
deforestation of the Amazon, and indeed hopefully dealing with 
the reforestation as necessary. We are committed to that. We 
would like to actually contribute to the Amazon Fund, something 
we will probably need to work with Congress on.
    But that as to the allocation of resources between State 
and USAID, you know, generally speaking, we are focused on, and 
by ``we'', I mean the State Department, are focused on the 
policy and diplomatic aspects of working things, USAID tends to 
implement, and it may be that the Budget Division reflects 
that. But I need to give you an informed answer. So let me come 
back to you.
    Senator Schatz. Sure. Just on Lula, I think, obviously, 
there are incredible opportunities here, but it seems to me 
that we are not going to say of the world's forest, just sort 
of hoping for a bunch of Lulas to get elected across the 
planet. And so I think we do need to come up with an economic 
model. Lula is a willing, enthusiastic participant, but we have 
to make it worth it to their country.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. So that other countries that are trying to 
figure out where to move, economically, that they get--that 
they can see a pathway that works for them. So I agree with you 
about the Deforestation Fund, and whatever we can do to be 
supportive there, I will try to help.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. I welcome the budget's focus on democracy 
and human rights, and particularly robust funding for promoting 
press freedom. There is no dedicated envoy or office for press 
freedom, so how do you ensure that press freedom stays high on 
that list of priorities, as your offices across the planet have 
so many things to contend with, and yet this seems to me need 
to be part of the slide towards authoritarianism across the 
planet.
    Secretary Blinken. It really is front and center on the 
agenda for a number of offices at the Department, and by the 
way, for me, since this is something I have spent some time on, 
including making sure that I was speaking up and speaking out 
on World Press Freedom Day. But also making sure that 
programmatically, we are putting in place the resources, the 
tools to defend press freedom, and that is exactly what we have 
done over the last couple of years.
    It was a key feature, and we will--by the way, next week we 
will begin the key feature of the Summit for Democracy. It is 
one of the critical pillars in that. We put in place, for 
example, funds to help the press that is being assaulted with 
lawfare in various places, be able to have the funds to defend 
themselves. We put in place resources to help protect 
journalists who are actually under physical threat.
    Senior officials in my Department, particularly in the 
Bureau of Democracy and Labor are--this is right front and 
center on their agendas. So I can tell you that it is something 
that I am personally focused on, and the critical Bureaus in 
our Department, are focused on.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Let us move to the Pacific. I am 
glad to see a larger request from the administration for 
foreign assistance for Pacific Island countries for fiscal year 
2023, but it is still short of the enacted level. And so could 
you speak to that, the dollar amount, but also I want to give 
you a chance to talk about what we are doing in the Pacific 
Island region. And I want to coach you a little bit.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Schatz. Not that you need coaching. But I want to 
remind us that it is difficult to compete with graft, right?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. And so what we have to offer are, as you 
say, values, right, and relationships. And as I have talked to 
Pacific Island leaders, sure, they need resources, and 
especially in a climate-change context, lots of these countries 
are really in need of our direct material assistance. But they 
also want to be respected as sovereigns.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Schatz. And so I would like you to talk through 
how, attitudinally, we are shifting, and not just throwing 
another, say, $80 million at the problem, and then trying to 
park all of our military hardware wherever it is convenient on 
a map. These have to be a sovereign-to-sovereign relationship. 
I would like you to talk to that.
    Secretary Blinken. So we have, we fundamentally elevated 
the Pacific Island countries in our foreign policy and in our 
diplomacy, and that really culminated with what was really, I 
think, a historic Summit Meeting between President Biden and 
the Leaders of the Pacific Island nations. It is something that 
I took part in, and it really was an extraordinary moment, 
because I think it said to them, and it said to their people, 
that the United States is engaged in a different way.
    And now that needs to manifest itself in concrete, 
practical ways. Our diplomatic presence, as you know, we opened 
in the Solomon Islands, we are looking at establishing two to 
three other embassies, or outposts in the Pacific Islands where 
we have been absent for the last years. That is moving forward. 
It is also reflected in our budget.
    Our economic engagement, particularly in finding and 
catalyzing resources to deal with challenges that are affecting 
the lives of Pacific Islanders, that is front and center. As 
you know, it is an interesting challenge because, in many 
cases, each individual island nation is small, and so making a 
market can be complicated, but particularly as they are pooled 
together, and we are able to pool some resources, we are doing 
that.
    I think on climate we have an absolute responsibility, and 
we are acting on it, to try to provide the technical 
assistance, the technology and, yes, the resources to deal with 
this, particularly for countries that, literally, risk not 
existing because of climate change. And of course, programs 
that we have that are reflected in the budget: for education, 
for governance, for building institutions, all of those were 
there. I am happy to work with you, and work with your team to 
make sure that we are properly resourced to do that, but this 
really is front and center in our thinking.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Just one final thought on what 
is happening with climate. I think there are some cases, 
Kiribati is a good example where they really might vanish.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But I think the less precipitous, but just 
as bad scenario, is saltwater inundation of the freshwater 
systems, of the irrigation systems, and so you can't drink 
water, you can't use water to farm.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. And then there is no economy at all.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. And none of these people have any place to 
go. So although I, you know, I love what DFC is doing, and I 
love the opportunities to kind of envision economic growth. But 
the truth is, some of these people need immediate assistance 
because they can't drink the salt water, and their runways are 
flooding. And so I think we need to race to their aid without 
precondition.
    Secretary Blinken. Appreciate that.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Blinken. Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. If you have 10 more minutes, rather than 
submitting a whole bunch of questions for the record, I am 
going to quickly run through five topics.
    Secretary Blinken. Sure, of course.
    Senator Coons. We have a noon vote, to the best of my 
knowledge no other Member of the Committee is coming back. None 
of these will surprise you, but I thought it was worth the time 
since we have each other here.
    Secretary Blinken. Sure.
    Senator Coons. Let me pick up from the point that Senator 
Schatz was just making. The Development Finance Corporation I 
think is a big step forward. You are the Chairman of the Board. 
I would love to hear--so I briefly want to talk about DFC, GFA, 
Conservation Foundation, PEPFAR, Mexico.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Coons. And I can start with the first two and get 
them disposed of quickly.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. The 20th anniversary of PEPFAR is, indeed, 
worth celebrating. I am glad that you have prioritized it in 
your opening statement. We have some real work to do here to 
make sure that it remains authorized and robustly funded, and I 
look forward to working closely with you on that.
    I just spent the weekend in Mexico with a broad bipartisan 
group of Senators and House Members. We have an outstanding 
Ambassador. We have got 4 hours of the President's time, 
President Lopez Obrador and his entire Cabinet. And for the 
first 2 hours he simply listened, as members of his Cabinet 
made presentations, and members of our delegation engaged.
    I believe there is much more good news about our 
partnership, and its potential, in terms of border crossings 
and security, fentanyl interdiction, economic development, and 
some of the ways that our economies, and our values, and 
priorities align, than one could easily discern from the cable 
coverage of this. But there are some real irritants in the 
relationship.
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, can I just say very quickly, I 
very much agree with that. And we really have seen, in many 
places the--our Mexican partners step up to, including dealing 
with drug trafficking, dealing with the transnational criminal 
enterprises. But the problem is huge, they are resource 
deficient, and so I think we have to continue to work with 
them. We have restored the security dialogue that would have 
been held in advance, we are working very actively under that. 
We have a ``Bicentennial Framework'', as we called it.
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. To really move out on concrete 
cooperation. And again, we have seen seizures go up, we have 
seen the active, very active work to disband criminal 
enterprises, we have seen a very significant increase in 
Mexican law enforcement that has arrest authority, by the 
creation of a National Guard. That has been important.
    And of course, on migration, they have been a critical 
partner, it doesn't answer the full problem, but absent that 
partnership, the challenge would be even greater. So sorry to 
interrupt but I think it is important, you are right, to 
underscore the fact that they are a vital partner. Never mind 
the fact that, you know, one of our two largest trading 
partners in the world.
    Senator Coons. A presentation at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs made it very clear that the recent initiative taken by 
the Biden administration to require an application, a legal 
process crossing at that border point, brought down 
dramatically entrants from four different countries.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. That is right.
    Senator Coons. I am eager to work with you, if I possibly 
can, to support finding a path forward as we anticipate the end 
of Title 42, in the middle of May.
    So DFC, you are the Chairman of the Board.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. How successful do you think we have been, 
using this newly expanded tool? It is built on the base of OPIC 
but it has got new equity authorities, it can do a whole range 
of things that we couldn't do before. I think this is a 
critical opportunity to crowd in private sector capital 
investment, and de-risk it. Where are we making a difference? 
Where are we not? And what do you think we need to fix to make 
it really reach its potential?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. So I fully, I fully share your view 
that the DFC is a critical tool, one that I think we are using, 
increasingly, effectively, and it goes to exactly the points 
that you are making. For the United States the comparative 
advantage we have, if we do it right, is mobilizing--catalyzing 
the private sector. We obviously are not going to match China, 
for example, dollar for dollar, coming from our taxpayers. And 
the DFC is a vital tool in doing that.
    I do think that there are a couple of critical additions 
that we could make to the DFC that would make it even more 
effective, and one, maybe the most important one from my 
perspective, and our perspective, is lifting the constraints 
that require counting equity like a grant.
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. Basically what is most in demand, which 
are equity investments from the DFC, end up being what costs 
the most. And I believe if we do that we will see its 
effectiveness in leveraging more private sector investment go 
up significantly.
    Senator Coons. Well, I look forward to working closely with 
you on that, your budget proposes a $2 billion mandatory to the 
DFC.
    Secretary Blinken. That is right.
    Senator Coons. Well welcome, well engaging, that does not 
address the most important issue, which you are absolutely 
right, is a legal fix----
    Secretary Blinken. That is right.
    Senator Coons [continuing]. To a scoring issue that is 
restraining this from being--if you come to the party and 
everybody else has got equity investments, and you have only 
got debt, you are the last person, and in a game of musical 
chairs, that often means we don't get to pick our partners, we 
don't get to drive and scope the project, we don't get to 
deliver on the values that are at the core of transparency, and 
labor, and environment that we would like to see.
    So I hope that in this year, in this authorizing process, 
in the Foreign Relations Committee, where you may well be this 
afternoon, this issue might also be discussed.
    Global Fragility Act, something Senator Graham and I 
crafted based on positive experiences with Colombia. It is an 
important tool, but the whole goal here was to, with State at 
the lead, have State, USAID, and DOD jointly plan. Having 
recently visited Niger, as I know you did as well, likely 
heading back to Coastal West Africa, there are places where we 
need to show this kind of prioritization.
    I think it is off to a slow start, and I am concerned about 
the lack of active senior engagement from DOD. I want to make 
sure this isn't just viewed as another foreign assistance 
program, but instead is a framework that prioritizes State's 
leadership. What are you doing to get this off the ground 
right? How can I help?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. I agree with you. This is a 
critical framework for us, and I think it has the very strong 
merit in making sure that we have a holistic, comprehensive, 
whole-of-government approach to dealing with fragility, because 
we know that just focusing on any one piece of this, security, 
foreign assistance, you take it, is not enough, doesn't answer 
the mail. And that is why I think this is a--was a very welcome 
thing.
    Yes, we have been working intensely on this. And what I can 
tell you today is that I think very, very imminently 
forthcoming, are the actual approved country plans by the 
President. So I think that will be an important step forward. 
And as I said, I think that is imminent.
    Senator Coons. Perhaps we will have another conversation as 
soon as those are out about how to better engage DOD at a 
senior enough level that it moves the needle. Thank you. The 
last thing--I am sorry, I have one more.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, please.
    Senator Coons. We have worked hard together to provide 
robust assistance to Ukraine, in fact I think this has been 
President Biden's best chapter, in a very long career public 
service, really marshaling the resources of the world to 
deliver from sanctions, to humanitarian, to economic, to 
military assistance as Ukraine continues to fight bravely.
    Are we doing enough to ensure proper oversight of our 
assistance, and to avoid an unforced error, a challenge to 
sustaining our assistance, through a lack of accountability and 
transparency?
    Secretary Blinken. So again, I couldn't agree with you 
more. This is something we are intensely focused on, precisely 
because we have an obligation to make sure that the taxpayers' 
money is being used the way it was intended to be used. And 
also we certainly don't want to give those who may not want to 
sustain the support, reason to move us in that direction.
    So we have been intensely focused on this. I have got on 
the ground, right now, in our Embassy in Kiev, 45 people whose 
responsibility it is to oversee the funds that we are providing 
to the Government of Ukraine. That is just on the State 
Department side. DOD has its own people on the ground including 
at our Embassy, to make sure that the military equipment that 
we are providing, is being used in the right way. The system 
that is in place is actually a very good one. Basically when it 
comes to direct budget support goes through--most of it goes 
through the World Bank. The World Bank has a system where the 
money is dispersed to reimburse, based on receipts and approved 
expenditures----
    Senator Coons. Right.
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. The money. The Office of 
the Inspector General did its first report on this, that just 
came out a few weeks ago, and it found--and I don't want to 
quote it directly, but the bottom line finding was that there 
is--we got very good marks on the oversight, and making sure 
that the money is being spent well, and that the processes are 
in place to ensure that.
    At the same time, there is also third-party validation, 
Deloitte is working within the Ministry of Finance in Ukraine, 
to make sure that it has the systems in place, to make sure 
that the money is being well used.
    And the final thing I will say is this: We have seen 
President Zelenskyy go at challenges of corruption, or misuse 
of funds in the government with a sledgehammer, removing very 
senior officials across multiple ministries who, allegedly, 
were involved in either corruption, or improper oversight of 
funds. So I take that as a very good sign, that not only are we 
seized with it, but the Government of Ukraine is too.
    Senator Coons. You talked with two different members about 
a reforestation in Brazil and the Amazon.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. And the importance of addressing climate in 
a meaningful way. One of the areas I think we could come 
together is around reforestation and conservation.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Coons. Improving the management of wild and open 
spaces that are not yet overrun by people and poachers, 
particularly in South America and in Africa. A group of us, led 
by Senator Graham and me, but four others, introduced the U.S. 
Foundation for International Conservation Act. It would, 
principally, draw in philanthropic and private individual 
donations, set up a board that would have U.S. Government 
experts in the field, and donors, prioritizing these funds for 
the long-term preservation of spaces that are genuinely at 
risk.
    Are you aware of it? Is it something you might support? Is 
it something we could work on together?
    Secretary Blinken. I need to look at this very carefully. 
As you have described it certainly sounds like something that 
we would want to support. Let me look at the details and come 
back to you.
    Senator Coons. Okay.
    Secretary Blinken. But I think there is a lot of merit to 
that, particularly when it comes to making sure we are engaged 
now in places that are still open to being secured and 
preserved. So I would welcome working on that.
    Senator Coons. You just released the Department's Annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. Closing question: Where have we made the 
most progress? What have we left undone? What should we do in 
the next 2 years to advance human rights?
    Secretary Blinken. So you know, if you look at the report I 
think it is--let me say diplomatically--a mixed picture. We 
continue to see democratic backsliding, and backsliding on 
human rights in a number of countries, something that we call 
out very clearly in the report. And you know, one of the things 
that is so important about the report is we apply the same 
lens, the same prism, to friends, to competitors, to 
adversaries across the board; and of course we acknowledge our 
own challenges in that.
    At the same time, I think the report points out that in a 
number of places we have seen genuine progress, important 
progress. I think there are a number of countries, for example, 
where looking at some marginalized groups that have been 
particularly victimized, like the LGBTQI+ community, there are 
some countries where we have actually seen real progress in 
upholding or protecting their rights. Just as there are other 
places where that continues to backslide in a significant way.
    So it is a mixed--I think it is a very mixed report, but 
what is important about it is, it continues to put a spotlight 
on these challenges, with the imprimatur of the United States 
Government on it. I think it is a way of--strongly encouraging, 
countries to take steps that they need to take to improve the 
human rights picture.
    It is one of the reasons, by the way, that every year when 
we do this, I think it is incumbent upon me to go and present 
the report. I do that in front of our media in the State 
Department Briefing Room, just to make sure that people 
understand that this really comes from the Secretary of State 
on behalf of the President of the United States. And it is 
something that we attach tremendous importance to.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your 
leadership. Thank you for two hours of high energy, and 
engaging testimony. I know you have another session in front of 
our authorizing committee, the Foreign Relations Committee 
later today. I think most importantly you make a compelling 
case for the urgent national security-based need to invest more 
robustly in our diplomacy and development.
    So I look forward to working with you, together, to see 
what we can move forward and get passed this year. I will just 
say to the colleagues who have joined, we had, I think, a dozen 
senators participate at different points. This was a good and 
constructive hearing.
    Senator Hagerty had information related to the Vulcan case.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. The seizure of a port that he would like 
added to the record. So ordered. And the hearing record will 
remain open for written questions until 5:00 p.m., Wednesday, 
March 29.
    [Information follows:]
    <GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>
    
                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
            Questions Submitted to Secretary Antony Blinken
             Questions Submitted by Senator Jeanne Shaheen
    Question. The Black Sea is clearly of geostrategic importance to 
Putin, but the United States and the broader transatlantic community--
including NATO--have failed to successfully push back on Putin's 
expansionist agenda toward the Black Sea. Will the relevant State 
Department officials make themselves available to testify at the Europe 
Subcommittee to discuss the strategy once it is issued to Congress?

    Answer. Yes, I will ensure the relevant officials are available to 
testify on our U.S. Black Sea strategy once it is submitted to 
Congress. The United States has an enduring interest in the Black Sea 
region and we are working on a strategy that will strengthen our 
political, security, economic, and energy cooperation with the region 
and promote democratic resilience.

    Question. Sometimes the loudest and most extreme voices make 
national headlines, overshadowing the less news-worthy fact that the 
majority of this Congress remains firmly in support of Ukraine's war 
against Russia's aggression. How is the Biden administration supporting 
the Ukrainian government's efforts to focus on these reform efforts for 
successful membership into the European Union while engaged in a full-
on war with Russia?

    Answer. We welcome Ukraine's EU candidacy and support the Ukrainian 
government's efforts to advance necessary institution-building in line 
with Ukraine's European path. In our engagements with Ukraine's 
government, we have consistently emphasized the importance of 
inclusive, transparent, and accountable democratic institutions. We are 
also providing technical assistance to increase judicial independence, 
foster greater adherence to the rule of law, and counter systemic 
corruption.

    Question. We are all closely watching the implications of President 
Xi's visit to Moscow recently. I know that you met with your Chinese 
counterpart in Munich last month. What outcomes of the Xi-Putin summit 
hold the greatest national security implications for the United States?

    Answer. President Xi's visit to Moscow was further evidence that 
the PRC continues to align with Russia as Moscow wages its brutal war 
against Ukraine. At the Munich Security Conference, I made clear there 
would be real consequences in our relationship if the PRC were to 
provide Russia lethal assistance or systematic assistance evading 
sanctions. We have already sanctioned the PRC firm Spacety for 
providing satellite imagery to Wagner forces in Ukraine, and we 
continue to monitor this space very closely.

    Question. To what extent will Xi leverage China's influence on 
Russia to encourage Ukraine to pursue a peace deal?

    Answer. The United States welcomes any initiative that advances a 
just and durable peace in Ukraine, no matter the author. The PRC issued 
a 12-point position paper on Russia's war in Ukraine, which includes an 
essential point: respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity 
of all countries. We call on President Xi to advocate for this key 
point, which necessarily includes the withdrawal of Russia's forces 
from Ukraine's sovereign territory, consistent with the UN Charter.

    Question. I appreciate that, very early in its tenure, the Biden 
administration rescinded the ``global gag rule'' of the Trump 
administration, which prohibits foreign NGOs from using separate, non-
U.S. funds to provide legal abortion services. But simply rescinding 
the dangerous policy is not enough. How are you working with USAID 
administrator Samantha Power to ensure that the administration's policy 
is clear to all partners, including other countries, multinational and 
nongovernmental organizations as well as the implementing organizations 
on the ground that provided much needed services to women?

    Answer. The Department of State continues to coordinate closely 
with USAID to ensure full implementation of the Presidential Memorandum 
on Protecting Women at Home and Abroad. Our collaboration to 
demonstrate the administration's commitment to sexual and reproductive 
health and rights, including in relation to policy clarification, 
extends to our partnerships with various international organizations 
and U.S. Missions around the world.

    Question. Two years ago, President Biden nominated Geeta Rao Gupta 
to be Ambassador At Large for Global Women's Issues. Given the 
rollbacks on gender equality around the world, including here at home, 
how can the United States continue to be a human rights leader in this 
area?

    Answer. Over the past 2 years, the Department has released the 
first-ever strategy on women's economic security, updated its global 
gender-based violence strategy, and continues to implement the Women, 
Peace, and Security agenda. We demonstrate U.S. leadership through 
multilateral engagement in the UN Commission on the Status of Women, 
targeted programs such as the SHE WINS Rapid Response Fund, and public 
diplomacy through the International Women of Courage Awards. Senate-
confirmed leadership is important to the continued success of these 
initiatives.

    Question. Within the State Department, how do you ensure that 
gender issues are mainstreamed across every sector of the State 
Department?

    Answer. The Department's Action Plan for the U.S. National Strategy 
on Gender Equity and Equality identified entry points for better 
integrating the perspectives of women and girls in institutional 
policies and practices. This work is ongoing as the Department and 
USAID strive to meet the President's budget request of more than $3 
billion for foreign assistance related to gender equality. The 
Department regularly convenes foreign assistance Community of Practice 
sessions and has strengthened our gender equality training and 
analytical tools to build the capacity of Department personnel.

    Question. The Women, Peace and Security Act makes it a U.S. 
priority to protect and support women's roles in peace negotiations and 
conflict resolution around the world and within the U.S. government. 
The Office of Global Women's Issues does the important work of 
promoting WPS in U.S. policy around the world, but who in your 
department is tasked with ensuring that the tenets of WPS are upheld 
within the Department of State?

    Answer. The Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues (S/GWI) 
is the senior official for Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) 
coordination; and works closely with Department leadership to oversee 
integration of WPS in U.S. foreign policy and assistance. S/GWI 
established and regularly convenes the Department-wide WPS Steering 
Committee to exchange information on progress, challenges, and lessons 
learned. The U.S. is co-chairing the UN Women WPS Focal Points Network 
for the first time in 2023; the S/GWI Ambassador-at-Large serves as the 
U.S. government Focal Point.

    Question. What role does the Office of Diversity and Inclusion play 
in ensuring that women at the Department of State have access to the 
resources and opportunities needed?

    Answer. The Department's Office of Diversity and Inclusion promotes 
the principles of accountability and transparency as it works to 
advance issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for 
all Department employees, including women. The Office is currently 
working with key stakeholders to develop a policy to facilitate the use 
of lactation devices within controlled access areas, an issue of 
particular interest to working mothers. Ambassador Abercrombie-
Winstanley would be happy to discuss with you.

    Question. Today, both Sweden and Finland are on the cusp of NATO 
membership, but two countries hold up their membership ambitions; 
Hungary and Tuerkiye. Ahead of the Vilnius Summit, what deliverables 
does this administration hope to achieve?

    Answer. The administration continues to urge Hungary and Turkiye to 
ratify Finland's and Sweden's accession to NATO at the earliest 
possible opportunity before the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius. Finland's 
and Sweden's accession will strengthen NATO's collective defense. The 
administration also supports an updated defense investment pledge; 
enhanced support for Ukraine; implementation of NATO's updated plans 
for collective defense; and enhancing NATO's partnerships including 
with the Asia Pacific as Vilnius deliverables.

    Question. I remain committed to working with the administration to 
ensure that peace is upheld in Bosnia; supporting their democratic 
reform agenda is an integral component in bringing them closer to EU 
and NATO membership. To what extent to you envision the funds requested 
by the administration for the Western Balkans will include new 
initiatives to enhance the cyber defenses of this region?

    Answer. The Biden administration is actively working to ensure our 
alliances reflect and respond to the world we face. As part of the 
fourth Ukraine supplemental appropriation from Congress, we plan to 
allocate $50 million in cybersecurity support to the Western Balkans. 
This includes a recent $25 million pledge to Albania, with an 
additional $25 million yet to be allocated. We recognize the importance 
of cybersecurity to the stability of the region and NATO's collective 
security and will leverage our technical assistance and expertise to 
strengthen the cyber capabilities across the Western Balkans.

    Question. Lukashenka continues a brutal crackdown on the Belarusian 
people; a recent news article reported that Lukashenka is now targeting 
therapists to snitch on ``pro-Ukraine'' patients to suppress partisan 
activity. What additional measures are under consideration to prevent 
Lukashenka's further oppression of the Belarusian people?

    Answer. Since the fraudulent 2020 election, we have levied 
sanctions and visa bans against the Lukashenka regime for its brutal 
crackdown against the pro-democracy movement, flagrant human rights 
abuses, and facilitation of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As 
these acts persist, we continue to examine new targets, and to 
coordinate with our partners and allies, to impose additional costs on 
the regime for its repression of the people of Belarus and its ongoing 
support for Russia's unprovoked and illegal war against Ukraine.

    Question. In last year's NDAA, the HAVANA Act was expanded to 
ensure that all relevant agencies received the authority to designate 
AHI's to ensure that all affected individuals could receive access to 
this payment. Do you have the funds and resources in place to ensure 
that this legislation is fully implemented and that the victims receive 
treatment?

    Answer. Under the law, I continue to hold the authority to 
designate as ``other incidents'' reports of anomalous health incidents 
that occurred to individuals under Chief of Mission security 
responsibility. For HAVANA Act payment requests, I have delegated this 
authority to the Under Secretary of Management. The State Department 
has sufficient resources to ensure that the HAVANA Act is fully 
implemented for our employees and their family members, and that they 
receive appropriate treatment.
    The State Department is working with other departments and agencies 
to help them facilitate their rules and processes for reviewing HAVANA 
Act payment requests.

    Question. After widespread protests against the Georgian 
Parliament's consideration of a foreign agent law, it is clear that we 
need to revisit our policy toward Georgia and reinvigorate our approach 
toward the country. Is the State Department considering any measures to 
apply necessary pressure on those responsible for actively working 
against Georgia's Euro-Atlantic ambitions?

    Answer. The United States does not preview designations or 
sanctions in advance. However, the Department of State will use Section 
7031(c) visa restrictions and all other appropriate measures to promote 
accountability when we have sufficient, credible information to do so.

    Question. Will the administration commit to a full review of our 
policy toward Georgia?

    Answer. Our policy toward Georgia remains the same, and we review 
our strategy to achieve our policy on an ongoing basis. We have made 
our concerns about democratic backsliding very clear to the government. 
We remain steadfastly committed to supporting the people of Georgia's 
Euro-Atlantic aspirations. The United States continues to urge Georgia 
to implement the necessary reforms to achieve EU candidate status. We 
firmly support Georgia's NATO aspirations. We continue promoting the 
vital democratic reforms that are essential for EU candidacy. Such 
reforms also are essential to NATO accession, as NATO is a values-based 
political-military alliance.

    Question. I am proud to have both the National Visa Center and the 
National Passport Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It is to 
everyone's benefit that both centers operate efficiently, which is why 
I welcome the inclusion in the President's request for additional 
funding to improve consular services. What efforts are being undertaken 
at the NVC to reduce the immigrant visa backlog and better communicate 
to Afghan SIV applicants?

    Answer. The National Visa Center has eliminated all internal 
immigrant visa pre-processing and public inquiry backlogs. NVC is using 
data-driven analyses to help posts adjudicate immigrant visas more 
efficiently and schedule more applicants sooner. NVC is working with 
posts that have large pandemic-driven backlogs to inform backlog 
elimination plans. NVC is also working closely with the Department's 
Afghan Evacuation Coalition to improve communications with Afghan SIV 
applicants about how, when, and where their cases will be scheduled.

    Question. I have worked closely with Democratic and Republican 
administrations to bring home Americans wrongfully detained or taken 
hostage abroad. Instead of terrorist cells, increasingly we are seeing 
foreign governments unjustly detain Americans to use for their own 
malign intentions. Will you commit to working with Congress to conduct 
a review of U.S. hostage and detainee policy to ensure that the U.S. 
government is ready to meet the evolving challenge of ensuring that all 
Americans are brought home safely?

    Answer. I am committed to working closely with Congress on this 
issue, and my team has worked hard to ensure Congress is kept abreast 
of our engagements and initiatives as an equal partner in our foreign 
policy making. There is no higher priority than the safety and security 
of U.S. citizens around the world, including those who may be 
wrongfully detained or held hostage.

    Question. One of my constituents alerted me to a lingering inequity 
affecting some 250 Foreign Service employees that dates back to 2014, 
when the State Department did not pay the compensation traditionally 
awarded to employees who were recommended for promotion but who fell 
below the cutoff. While employees in the same category in 2013, 2015 
and 2016 were later retroactively paid, there is one group who have 
been forgotten. As you can imagine, these employees have not forgotten. 
What is the Department doing to honor the Department's commitment to 
its workforce and ensure these forgotten employees are fairly and 
expeditiously compensated? May I seek your assurances that you will 
direct the Department to use its resources to remedy this outstanding 
payroll issue?

    Answer. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) filed four 
``implementation disputes'' against the Department's awarding of 
Meritorious Service Increases (MSIs) to less than 10 percent of the 
eligible employees, alleging that the Department violated the 2013, 
2014, 2015, and 2016 Selection Board Procedural Precepts. The Foreign 
Service Labor Relations Board (FSLRB) held in the 2014 MSI case that 
``the plain meaning of the agreement is that the Agency may award MSIs 
to 10 percent or less of the eligible employees.'' The FSLRB decision 
fully resolved the 2014 MSI case which involved approximately 270 MSIs 
with an estimated risk liability of over $2.5 million.
    However, in the subsequent 2015 and 2016 MSI cases, the FSLRB ruled 
in AFSA's favor in a split decision. That decision, which the 
Department contends was wrongly decided, does not disturb the 
resolution of the 2014 MSI case in the Department's favor. Therefore, 
the Department declines to apply the FSLRB's incorrect interpretation 
of the law to effectively overturn the FSLRB's earlier, correct 
interpretation in the 2014 MSI case.

    Question. At a time of significant global challenges from 
disinformation and pandemics to migration and climate change, and 
amidst rising strategic competition from China and Russia, I believe 
it's more important than ever to expand international people-to-people 
exchanges to develop new partnerships, share American values, and 
increase mutual understanding worldwide. If people-to-people exchanges 
are essential to achieving our near and long-term U.S. foreign policy 
objectives, how does the administration justify decreasing funding for 
core academic, professional, and cultural exchange programs for fiscal 
year 2024?

    Answer. The Department's FY 2024 Request for ECA programs is $783.7 
million, $6.2 million above the fiscal year 2023 Adjusted Enacted 
level. Central to this request is Exchanges Support, which pays for all 
of the bureau's administrative expenses from staff salaries to IT, as 
well as staff travel for program oversight. Increased funding for 
Exchanges Support will help ECA best support the workforce and program 
implementation, including staff monitoring to ensure the safety and 
security of our participants. Strategic alignment of program delivery 
with the necessary administrative support required certain offsets 
reflected in the President's budget.

    Question. How will the Biden administration optimize our 
competitive advantage vis a vis China, Russia, and other countries if 
we continue to underinvest in the State Department's Bureau of 
Educational and Cultural Affairs and these proven soft power programs?

    Answer. With its global reach and proven models for exchanges, ECA 
is well positioned to help ensure that U.S. embassies and consulates 
have the tools necessary to build alliances and maintain U.S. 
leadership. For instance, exchange program funding supports Ukraine 
through cultural heritage protection efforts, counters Russian 
disinformation, and enables the Department to increase Indo-Pacific 
engagement through the expansion of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders 
Initiative and English language programming.

    Question. The costs associated with global mobility and exchange 
have risen steadily over time and more dramatically in recent years. 
Exchange organizations who administer these soft power programs are 
being asked to do so for a greater number of participants, despite flat 
administrative funding, increasing costs and higher required levels of 
effort due to, for instance, a rise in safety and mental health related 
issues. While I'm pleased that the Biden administration has requested 
long overdue funding for internal administrative support, given the 
President's requested decrease in funding for fiscal year 24 regarding 
core exchange programs, is the State Department sufficiently 
considering the needs of its exchange organizations at this challenging 
time?

    Answer. The Department continues to prioritize the importance of 
engagement with foreign publics on behalf of the United States. We 
value the essential contributions of exchange organizations to the 
success of Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) efforts and 
will continue to evaluate the resources needed to deliver on the 
mission these organizations are given. The fiscal year 2024 request 
takes into account the need for appropriate program and staff support, 
understanding that the inflationary impacts on our limited resources 
may mean some reduction in participant numbers. Increases in some areas 
are offset by reductions in others to strategically align program 
delivery with the necessary administrative support.

    Question. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has made 
it clear that it is committed to maximizing the return on investment 
when it comes to exchange alumni, including by supporting their ongoing 
development as future leaders through targeted programming that 
advances U.S. interests and objectives. Yet, the President's fiscal 
year 2024 budget request recommends a decrease of $700,000 in alumni-
related funding. Does the State Department remain committed to 
strengthening its engagement with and support of exchange alumni?

    Answer. We remain fully committed to continuing and expanding 
engagement of exchange alumni. We have expanded resources for alumni 
seminars on policy priorities such as democracy, the Indo-Pacific 
strategy, and diversity in foreign policy. Alumni engagement is not 
only funded by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) 
Office of Alumni Affairs, but also within each exchange program's 
grant, giving us a range of ways to continue engagement. The funding 
request reflects increased support for the workforce and program 
implementation, including staff monitoring to ensure the safety and 
security of our participants.

    Question. Since the start of the pandemic, technology has become 
increasingly more important in international exchange program 
implementation and is one way to make an exchange experience more 
accessible. Investing in and developing virtual and hybrid programming 
requires a lot of intentionality in order to be a successful supplement 
or complement to traditional in-person exchanges. How will the State 
Department support program implementers in integrating virtual and 
hybrid components to expand participation and reach new audiences?

    Answer. When the pandemic temporarily halted many USG-funded in-
person exchanges, ECA's innovative management of international 
exchanges allowed programs and partner organizations to pivot rapidly 
to virtual and hybrid models, replicating key components of an in-
person exchange. ECA was able to reprogram funds to support these 
partner organizations. As a result, community members acquired critical 
technology and training that enabled them to learn and engage in 
virtual programming. ECA continues to incorporate lessons learned 
during the pandemic and supports virtual engagement that helps reach 
new audiences and enhances the impact of in-person exchange programs.

    Question. The fisacal year 2023 omnibus included report language 
encouraging the Department of State to allocate resources through the 
Migration and Refugee Assistance account to provide safe, inclusive, 
and quality education for refugee and internally displaced children. 
What is the administration's fiscal year 2024 plan to support education 
and flexible learning to maintain continuity across situations of 
crisis?

    Answer. The Department is committed to taking all possible steps to 
ensure access to quality, safe, and inclusive education for forcibly 
displaced and conflict-affected children. We do this through both 
diplomatic engagement and programming. We also remain a steadfast 
supporter of Education Cannot Wait, a global fund for education in 
emergencies and protracted crises. The Department also participates in 
the U.S. Basic Education Working Group, and we look forward to 
contributing to the next iteration of the U.S. Government Strategy for 
International Basic Education.

    Question. The situation in Lebanon is dire. In December, Sens. Bob 
Menendez (D-NJ) and Jim Risch (R-ID) wrote a letter to Secretary of the 
Treasury Janet Yellen and yourself, calling for the use of sanctions 
against Lebanon's financial and political elite for obstructing the 
election of a president and implementation of needed financial reforms. 
Why has the administration yet to announce any additional sanctions 
against corrupt officials in Lebanon?

    Answer. I share your concerns about endemic corruption in Lebanon, 
officials' reluctance to implement reforms, and stalled presidential 
elections. We continue to press Lebanese officials at all levels on 
these priorities. In addition to diplomatic engagement, sanctions can 
be a useful tool to encourage progress and a warning to those 
undermining the rule of law. Our previous designations clearly 
demonstrate our commitment to combatting corruption, and we continue to 
work with the Department of the Treasury to identify impactful targets.

    Question. How is the administration communicating any consequences 
if Lebanese parliamentarians elect a president who is not clean, 
capable and reform minded?

    Answer. The administration continues to stress that Lebanon needs a 
president free of corruption who can unite the country and forge a 
coalition to implement badly needed reforms. In concert with our 
partners in France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, we continue to make 
clear that Lebanese politicians blocking progress on the election of 
such a candidate could face negative repercussions--an idea that senior 
U.S. officials continue to underscore with Lebanese leaders at all 
levels, including via our Embassy in Beirut and in meetings with Saudi 
and French partners (September 2022), joined by Qatar and Egypt 
(February 2023).

    Question. Can you assess our relationship with our European and 
Gulf partners, particularly France and Saudi Arabia, on the Lebanon 
file?

    Answer. We continue to work closely with our European and Gulf 
partners--including France and Saudi Arabia--to press Lebanese 
officials on the need to expedite presidential elections and implement 
reforms. Productive engagements to date include a meeting with Saudi 
Arabia and France on the margins of UNGA (September 2022) and a 
February 6 meeting in Paris (which also included Qatar and Egypt) aimed 
at applying joint pressure on Lebanese officials. We remain in regular 
contact with our partners on these issues and look forward to future 
engagements.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Brian Schatz
    Question. The Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (or STOP) Act 
of 2021, Public Law No. 117-258, was signed into law in December. The 
STOP Act was designed to prevent the international trafficking of 
tribes' sacred items. It requires the Departments of the Interior, 
Justice, State, and Homeland Security to undertake important and 
immediate implementation actions. State, among other things, must 
notify foreign nations of the STOP Act's passage so they can monitor 
imports and facilitate repatriations under their own domestic laws, 
enter into agreements with those foreign nations, and participate in 
the STOP Act's interagency working group. What budgetary resources do 
you anticipate needing to carry out the Department of State's 
responsibilities under the STOP Act?

    Answer. The Department is ready to notify and work with foreign 
governments to facilitate repatriations under the STOP Act. The 
Department also is ready to develop the required trainings and other 
programming, in consultation with Tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations, on the voluntary return of cultural heritage for 
Departmental personnel, representatives of Indian Tribes and Native 
Hawaiian organizations, and other stakeholders. We are currently 
evaluating the resources needed to carry out our responsibilities under 
the STOP Act.

    Question. The Pacific Islands countries are vital partners, and it 
is encouraging to see that the State Department will be expanding its 
footprint in the region. However, it is important to recognize that 
working in very remote locations poses real challenges for State 
Department staff and their families. How is the Department planning to 
support staff in the new embassies in the region and what incentives 
are you planning to offer to ensure that those posts are adequately 
staffed?

    Answer. The Department is in the process of enhancing capacity in 
Manila to provide management services and guidance to new embassies in 
the region, and Embassy Port Moresby and Embassy Suva will continue to 
provide Regional Security and Public Diplomacy support. The Department 
is establishing positions and tours of duty. In recognition that 
standard three-year tours of duty may be difficult to staff, the 
Department is in the process of establishing two-year tours and 
evaluating available benefits and allowances to further incentivize 
employees.

    Question. According to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), U.S. 
funded armaments are required to be used for legitimate self-defense 
purposes. Do you believe that Israeli government personnel use of 
U.S.--origin arms in the course of Palestinian home demolitions, mass 
evictions, and settlement expansion would be in compliance with U.S. 
law, including AECA, which generally prohibits the use of security 
assistance for purposes other than those for which the United States 
provided it?

    Answer. While the United States remains unwavering in its 
commitment to Israel's security, we expect all our allies and partners 
to use U.S.--origin arms consistent with U.S. law for legitimate self-
defense and military purposes. Upon the receipt of credible reports of 
unauthorized end use by a foreign government, we launch an 
investigation to determine an appropriate response and to prevent 
future violations.

    Question. What systems and processes are in place to ensure that 
U.S. funded armaments are in compliance with U.S. law, including 
potential AECA violations?

    Answer. Whether U.S. funded or not, potential arms transfers are 
assessed to ensure that they can be implemented consistent with all 
statutory requirements and with the Conventional Arms Transfer policy. 
With respect to End Use Monitoring (EUM), we have an ongoing security 
relationship with the vast majority of foreign recipients. We are able 
to draw on that background to inform future transfers, and, if dealing 
with a new partner, we assess all available relevant information to 
make the determination. This is an ongoing process, so, as 
circumstances arise, reviews may occur before, during, and after 
delivery. In addition, Leahy Vetting is applied to all U.S. security 
assistance funded transfers.

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Senator Susan Collins
    Question. In fiscal year 2023, the Department of Defense began to 
transition its Operation Allies Welcome to the Department of State 
under Operation Enduring Welcome, which focuses on bringing eligible 
Afghans and their families who remain abroad to the United States, 
including those remaining in Afghanistan. Responsibility for the 
program will require the Department of State to manage multiple 
overseas processing platforms for an extended period of time, providing 
life support in addition to visa processing. An estimated $4.8 billion 
in prior appropriated funds, including $3 billion transferred from the 
Department of Defense to the Department of State, are available to 
support Operation Enduring Program. Mr. Secretary, how many principal 
applicants are currently in the Special Immigrant Visa pipeline, and 
what is your best estimate on the time required from start-to-finish 
for these applicants?

    Answer. As of December 31, 2022, there were over 147,000 principal 
applicants in the Afghan SIV pipeline, more than half have submitted 
some, but not all, of the required documentation for Chief of Mission 
approval, and processing times vary on the complexity of each case. We 
are available to discuss with you Enduring Welcome operations and 
Afghan SIV processing in more detail. Additionally, the Department 
publishes a quarterly report on Afghan SIVs which can be found here: 
https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-
immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html#quarterly.

    Question. Are you satisfied with this pace?

    Answer. No. The Department of State seeks to process Special 
Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications and to relocate post-Chief of 
Mission, interview-ready SIVs out of Afghanistan more rapidly. The 
Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts is working as quickly as 
possible to increase its relocation tempo. Many factors in the 
relocation process which impact the pace of operations are out of the 
control of the U.S. government and our Afghan allies to whom we provide 
relocation assistance. We are always available to discuss those factors 
with you.

    Question. The Department of State operates numerous processing 
platforms, including in Qatar. How many Afghans are currently located 
at each platform?

    Answer. That is correct, the Department's principal processing 
location for relocated Afghans is Camp As-Sayliyah in Doha, Qatar. The 
Department currently has processing platforms in Albania and Kosovo as 
well. The U.S. government is also engaged in case processing for 
Afghans at the Emirates Humanitarian City in the United Arab Emirates. 
We are available to discuss with you in more detail.

    Question. Which other countries have offered to take Afghans in, 
and how many has each country taken in?

    Answer. Many countries around the world are providing protection to 
vulnerable Afghans. According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 
there are more than 8.2 million Afghans in neighboring countries, 
including 4.5 million in Iran and 3.7 million in Pakistan. Of these, 
more than 1.6 million Afghans arrived in neighboring countries since 
August 2021.

    Question. How many principal applicants in the Special Immigrant 
Visa pipeline remain in Afghanistan?

    Answer. The Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts 
in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs provides relocation 
assistance to post-Chief of Mission, interview-ready Special Immigrant 
Visa (SIV) cases, provided that the case has undergone pre-travel 
vetting, everyone on the case has a valid Afghan passport, the case can 
be contacted, and everyone on the case is ready and willing to depart 
Afghanistan. We are available to answer questions and discuss specific 
numbers of SIV cases that have been relocated, and specific numbers of 
SIV cases at other stages of the process.

    Question. What is the Department of State's plan to sustain 
Operation Enduring Welcome?

    Answer. The administration requested a new Enduring Welcome account 
in the President's fiscal year 2024 budget to help streamline the 
complex relocation operations and meet our enduring commitment to our 
Afghan allies. Additionally, CARE continues to hire more staff in order 
to meet the needs of the operation as the Department assumes additional 
roles and responsibilities under Enduring Welcome this year.

    Question. Have annual operating costs been determined and what 
resources do you anticipate needing in fiscal year 2025 to sustain the 
mission?

    Answer. We have not yet determined our annual operating costs. We 
expect to have a clearer understanding of our projected long-term costs 
by the end of fiscal year 2023, and are available to discuss with you.

    Question. At what point does the Department of State consider 
``mission accomplished'' regarding Operation Enduring Welcome?

    Answer. The U.S. commitment to relocate and resettle all eligible 
Afghans is enduring. The Department of State intends to continue the 
mission as long as there are eligible Afghans to relocate and resettle.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Senator Lindsey Graham
    Question. My Senate office is not provided direct answers when 
inquiring about SIV/P1/P2 cases. My staff has attended a number of case 
management calls and, quite frankly, they do not receive answers to 
their questions, including regarding case specific questions. 
Furthermore, when case inquiries are submitted to the CAREHillInquries 
mailbox, my office only receives unhelpful, boilerplate responses. The 
information my office receives is of little use, and in turn we have 
very little useful information to help provide answers to those who 
have submitted cases or reached out for assistance.
    Additionally, there was a particular case where I wrote a letter to 
the Department of State asking for assistance for an Afghan service 
member I served alongside in Afghanistan. My office corresponded with 
the Department of State multiple times about his ``case'' and was told 
it was being tracked, only to find out this month--one and half years 
later--that he never actually had an active case. We have since asked 
the Department of State to provide information that we could share with 
him on how he can go about submitting a P1 or P2 application. We have 
yet to receive a response to this inquiry. Overall, the failure to 
provide specific answers to the majority of inquiries submitted by my 
office indicates the Department of State lacks a coherent plan of 
action to process these cases. This is unsatisfactory and disgraceful, 
particularly to those of us who served in Afghanistan. In January 2023, 
the Department of State informed my office there was a backlog of over 
60,000 SIV applications awaiting Chief of Mission (COM) approval. While 
their cases await COM approval, our Afghan allies who fought alongside 
us now struggle to provide for themselves and their families, remain in 
hiding, and live in constant fear of being hunted down by the Taliban. 
Does the Department of State have a comprehensive plan to work the COM 
approval backlog? If so, what is that plan?

    Answer. The Department continues to prioritize processing cases 
through the Chief of Mission (COM) approval backlog by surging staffing 
in the office reviewing applications for COM approvals and prioritizing 
the most vulnerable Afghans. We continue to coordinate with interagency 
partners, such as the Department of Defense, to quickly provide missing 
documentation and evidence of qualifying employment. We are also 
improving both the efficiency and pace of processing applications for 
COM approval, including through bulk verification of applicant's 
employment under U.S. government contracts.

    Question. What is the estimated time period it will take the 
Department of State to clear the COM approval backlog?

    Answer. Increased staffing and resources directed towards the Chief 
of Mission (COM) approval backlog means in the near future we will be 
able to process significantly greater numbers of cases and make 
progress toward reducing the COM approval backlog. Because we have not 
finished surging staffing and resources, it is difficult to accurately 
estimate when the Department will be able to clear the COM approval 
backlog. We are certainly available to discuss in more detail with you.

    Question. Are there additional resources the United States Congress 
can work to provide the Department of State to assist them in working 
through the COM approval backlog?

    Answer. I am personally committed to keeping our promises to those 
who stood by us in Afghanistan. We have surged resources and increased 
staff dedicated to SIV processing. The efficient processing and 
ultimate resettlement of Afghans continues apace and remains among my 
highest priorities. Congress's continued support of our efforts to 
resource and staff our team working through the Chief of Mission 
approval will help the Department to sustain these efforts.

    Question. Since July 2022, my office has been told the United 
States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is in the process of 
establishing a new Resettlement Support Center (RSC) in Pakistan to 
process Afghan P1 and P2 cases. As of December 2022, 7,500 Afghan P1/P2 
applicants have relocated to more than 50 countries, and of the 7,500 
number, several thousand of those cases are for Afghans in Pakistan. 
What is the Department of State doing to process Afghan P1/P2 cases in 
Pakistan while they wait for the RSC to become operational?

    Answer. The Department remains committed to processing U.S. Refugee 
Admissions Program (USRAP) cases for Afghans in third countries, 
including Pakistan. We continue to engage at senior levels with 
Pakistani officials frequently, both in Islamabad and Washington, on 
this issue, and we are actively pursuing all potentially viable options 
to enable USRAP processing in Pakistan.

    Question. How much longer does the Department of State expect it to 
be before the Government of Pakistan grants final approval for the RSC 
to become operational?

    Answer. We cannot forecast a precise timeline for Pakistan's 
approval to begin U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) processing 
for Afghan applicants. This remains a priority for me, and we continue 
to work with our Pakistani counterparts as they evaluate the request, 
so we can address any concerns and underscore the benefits of approving 
USRAP processing. The Department of State would be happy to brief you 
on these issues.

    Question. What specific actions is the Department of State taking 
to engage the Government of Pakistan on this issue?

    Answer. Thank you for your support. We are available to discuss 
details with you.

    Question. The Department of State has stated they anticipate the 
processing of Afghan P1/P2 cases to take approximately 12-18 months. Is 
the Department of State exploring options to speed up the processing 
times for P1/P2 cases? If so, what are these options?

    Answer. The Department's Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) 
Bureau and partners have worked hard to expedite processing of Afghan 
P1/P2 cases, particularly at Camp As Sayliyah, where processing times 
are now down to 30 to 45 days for individuals without serious medical 
conditions or security vetting delays. PRM is working to increase 
efficiencies and reduce processing times for USRAP cases globally, with 
a goal of reducing processing times from the 12-18-month average down 
to 6 months.

    Question. Please provide the following information regarding 
evacuation flights from Kabul: What is the status of evacuation flights 
from Kabul? Are they ongoing, or will they be restarted? If restarting, 
when are such flights expected to resume?

    Answer. The Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts 
(SCA/CARE) carries out regular movements to relocate eligible Afghans 
out of Afghanistan by air and overland routes. Despite a range of 
obstacles, CARE's relocation movements have become more consistent and 
repeatable over time.

    Question. What are/will be the frequency of such flights out of 
Kabul?

    Answer. Multiple flights take place per week; however, these 
movements are sensitive because of the operating environments in 
Afghanistan and are subject to conditions and rules in downstream 
locations.

    Question. How will Afghans be able to manifest themselves onto such 
flights?

    Answer. The Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts 
(SCA/CARE) immediately manifests every U.S. citizen and Legal Permanent 
Resident (LPR) who requests relocation assistance. CARE also manifests 
for relocation each post-Chief of Mission (COM) interview-ready SIV 
case, eligible interview-ready IV case, and eligible refugee case, 
provided that every individual on the case is ready and willing to 
relocate. These individuals must have a valid passport, must be 
successfully contacted, and must clear pre-travel vetting. Travelers 
are contacted by CARE's contact center (in English, Dari, and Pashto) 
before a flight.

    Question. What will be the number of people these flights will be 
able to manifest, on a per flight basis?

    Answer. Given the operational sensitivity and the safety of these 
travelers, we are available to discuss these numbers with you in 
another setting.

are not able to provide a processing timeline. We can provide you a 
briefing about this case.

    Question. In 2019, travelers spent $16.9 billion in South Carolina, 
which supported nearly 140,000 jobs. Currently, overseas visitation to 
South Carolina remains 21 percent below 2019 levels, in part due to 
long visa interview wait times. Expanding this to apply to the United 
States, 35 million (43 percent) of international visitors and $120 
billion in spending (50 percent) came from countries where a visa is 
required to enter the United States in 2019. In 2023, Tourism Economics 
forecasts that American businesses would attract 2.6 million fewer 
international visitors and $7 billion less in spending as a result of 
international travelers being unable to obtain a visitor visa in time 
to travel to the United States. Is the Department of State tracking at 
which consulates and in what countries it takes the longest to get a 
visa interview? If so, can you explain what the Department of State is 
doing to improve the situation at those consulates and in those 
countries that are experiencing wait times above 180 days?

    Answer. Long wait times for interviews apply only to first-time 
tourist visa applicants--a very small percentage of entries to the 
United States. In all other categories important to the U.S. economy--
students, temporary workers, repeat travelers, and maritime crew--wait 
times are at prepandemic levels or lower. We are available to discuss 
further with you.

    Question. Can the Department of State provide an assessment as to 
what impact long interview wait times have on the recovery of 
international inbound travel?

    Answer. Only eight of the top 20 inbound visitor nationalities 
require a U.S. tourist visa. In the first 5 months of fiscal year 2023, 
we issued 18 percent more nonimmigrant visas (NIV) globally than during 
the same period in fiscal year 2019. Today there are almost 60 million 
valid multiple-entry visitor visas and border crossing cards in 
circulation worldwide. This huge pool of prospective travelers with 
valid visas, and our continued visa issuance trends suggest the reasons 
for the slow recovery of inbound travel are complex--for example, there 
are reduced levels of inbound travel by citizens of Visa Waiver Program 
countries, who make up the majority of U.S. tourists.

    Question. What resources does the Department of State need to lower 
interview wait times?

    Answer. Since early 2022, the Department reduced gaps in consular 
staffing overseas caused by the drop in fee revenue due to the 
pandemic's near-shutdown of international travel. With the resurgence 
of travel, the Bureau of Consular Affairs' financial situation has 
improved. The Department is striving to ensure that as many 
adjudicators as possible are assigned to overseas positions to reach 
worldwide pre-pandemic staffing by the end of this year. Maintaining 
expanded spending authorities and additional fee flexibilities would 
help allow for continued innovation and additional hiring.

    Question. The Department of State is currently facing an 
unprecedented backlog of passport applications while at the same time 
experiencing passport processing times that are close to reaching a 
historic high. As a result, many citizens are missing travel, or in 
certain cases, unable to make emergency travel, due to a lack of 
counter service walkthrough appointments. Looking at the Southern 
United States, the Atlanta Passport Agency is the only agency to offer 
in-person counter service walkthrough appointments near Georgia, South 
Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama. The population of 
these 5 States that the Atlanta Passport Agency has to service is 
roughly 38.5 million. Meanwhile, California alone has three passport 
agencies in their State to service their roughly equivalent population 
of 39.2 million. To alleviate this problem, I proposed language in the 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2023 that required the Secretary of State to 
consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the operations of the 
Charleston Passport Center, particularly the need for in-person 
constituent appointments. During this consultation, the Department of 
State informed the Committee that opening up the Charleston Passport 
Center for in-person counter service walkthrough appointments would 
present a number of challenges. Please provide the following, in a 
timely manner: A detailed explanation of why opening up the Charleston 
Passport Center for in-person counter service walkthrough appointments 
presents challenges to the Department of State, including an 
enumeration of such challenges.

    Answer. The Charleston Passport Center (CPC) is located on a secure 
government compound, home to non-public-facing operations of eight 
State Department offices. Opening counter operations at CPC would 
divert resources from other Passport priorities and divert CPC's focus 
from specialized service (for Federal and military employees and their 
families) and existing economies of scale. Construction to add counter 
service would disrupt CPC operations for years. In 2021, we calculated 
that 99.4 percent of the U.S. public resided within 25 miles of an 
acceptance facility. We are available to answer any other questions you 
have about the CPC.

    Question. Please provide the following, in a timely manner: A 
detailed plan addressing how in-person counter service walkthrough 
appointments passport appointment backlogs can be prevented in the 
Southern United States, particularly at the Atlanta Passport Agency.

    Answer. The Department's modernization efforts, including Online 
Passport Renewal and other initiatives, will offer faster processing 
for emergency cases and potentially spare customers an agency visit 
altogether. In 2021, we calculated that 99.4 percent of the U.S. public 
resided within 25 miles of an acceptance facility. Travelers who can 
plan ahead do not need to visit a passport agency; they may apply by 
mail or at an acceptance facility. While we anticipate moving the 
Atlanta Passport Agency to larger space in a few years, systems 
modernization will benefit your constituents more.

    Question. Please provide the following, in a timely manner: An 
estimate of the number of United States citizens who will be unable to 
have their passport processed before their scheduled overseas trip due 
to the failure to open up an additional processing center for in-person 
counter service walkthrough appointments in the Southern United States.

    Answer. We do not collect or verify data on the number of U.S. 
citizens who may have potentially missed their trip. From January 1 to 
April 6, our staff served more than 269,000 customers with emergency or 
urgent travel at our counters and issued more than 4.7 million 
passports for customers who applied through the mail. We strongly 
recommend customers apply early, and by mail or at an acceptance 
facility, and undertake public messaging campaigns to this effect.

              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
    Question. According to the World Food Programme, Ukraine produced 
enough to feed 400 million people prior to the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has not only caused tragic loss of life and 
catastrophic damage, but has also fueled the global food crisis, 
leaving those millions of people dependent on Ukraine's food supply 
vulnerable to starvation. The Black Sea grain deal has been integral to 
vulnerable countries, and was recently extended 60 days. However, the 
deal faces renewal again shortly, in mid-May. Can you elaborate on how 
the negotiations to renew are proceeding, and if this is a State 
Department priority?

    Answer. Our position has always been clear: The world needs the 
Black Sea Grain Initiative (BGSI). The United States strongly supports 
the efforts of Secretary-General Guterres, in partnership with Turkiye, 
to expand and extend this life-saving Initiative. Russia continues to 
use global food supplies as a weapon of war by threatening the future 
of the BSGI, and this must be resisted. The United States welcomed the 
UN's announcement on March 18 that the Initiative had been extended and 
we continue to work with the UN and other countries to extend and 
expand the grain deal.

    Question. Additionally, can you explain the biggest obstacles 
facing a long-term renewal?

    Answer. The Black Sea Grain Initiative renews automatically for 
120-day terms unless one of the parties' objects. We have seen comments 
from Russian officials casting doubt on their interest in sustaining 
the Initiative; we have also seen Russia obstruct operations and, once, 
suspend its participation in the Initiative. Russia has consistently 
spread misinformation about the agreement's impact on global food 
security. We have worked extensively to combat correct Russia's false 
claims, including that its food and fertilizer are impeded by Western 
sanctions.

    Question. Food Security East Africa: Last fall, I traveled to East 
Africa and saw the impact firsthand of conflict in the Horn of Africa, 
which leads many to seek refuge in Kenya and other surrounding 
countries. However, the unrelenting drought in this region means all 
countries face a significant food shortage. These and other vulnerable 
countries depend on UN humanitarian response agencies such as the World 
Food Program and US foreign hunger assistance programs be able to feed 
their people during a crisis. What programs, tools, and partnerships 
are the State Department and USAID relying on now to address this 
global hunger crisis, and what so far has been most effective?

    Answer. The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID) use a multi-tool approach to direct interventions 
to address global food insecurity. A combination of short-term 
emergency assistance and longer-term systemic support, through programs 
like Feed the Future, are designed to alleviate the acute suffering and 
contribute to sustainable farming practices in the Horn of Africa and 
throughout the Global South. State and USAID depend on our investments 
through the UN system and our partnerships with the African Union to 
implement programs and encourage other major donor countries to provide 
funding. The combination of all our efforts is the most effective 
response.

    Question. As you know, Hunger causes civil instability and drives 
conflict, and is a national security concern. For example, China has 
made significant investments in Africa through the Belt and Road 
Initiative. I hear from many leaders in Africa that they want to work 
with the U.S., but we are never at the negotiating table, unlike China. 
Has China used the global food crisis as an opportunity to make deals 
with vulnerable countries, both in Africa and elsewhere, that could 
threaten national security? If so, what has been the administration's 
response?

    Answer. The PRC's efforts to increase its presence and influence in 
Africa are intended to advance and ultimately export its domestic 
political, security, information, and economic goals as well as justify 
its domestic agenda on the world stage. We push back on corrupt or 
coercive practices that damage our interests and those of our African 
partners while offering alternatives in collaboration with our African 
and other partners. We do not ask our partners to choose between the 
United States and the PRC. Instead, we give them choices on how to 
deliver results to their citizens.

    Question. As you also know, the renewal of our Compacts of Free 
Association is due this year. Arkansas has the largest population of 
Marshallese than anywhere else in the U.S. Can you provide an update on 
how those negotiations are proceeding?

    Answer. The Compact-related negotiations with the Freely Associated 
States are crucial to deepening these strategic partnerships in support 
of a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific. Having signed Memoranda of 
Understanding reflecting the levels and types of future U.S. assistance 
for each country that we intend to request, we are now focused on 
negotiating the agreement texts. The administration then expects to 
submit a proposal for implementing legislation with necessary 
authorities and mandatory appropriations to fund the costs of future 
Compact assistance for the expected 20-year period.

    Question. Additionally, can you elaborate on other programs and 
plans the administration is planning to implement in the Indo-Pacific, 
and how it would lower China's influence?

    Answer. The fiscal year 2024 budget request advances partnerships 
in the Indo-Pacific and supports initiatives to out-compete the 
People's Republic of China. The request includes $2.1 billion in 
discretionary funding for the Indo-Pacific, $7.1 billion for funding 
related to the Compacts of Free Association, which includes $6.5 
billion in economic assistance and $0.6 billion to support provision of 
postal services, and $2 billion over 5 years in mandatory funding to 
support game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific and support 
partners' efforts to push back against predatory activities.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Bill Hagerty
    Question. U.S. energy, especially natural gas, played an outsized 
role in preventing the worst case outcomes for European energy markets 
last year. The U.S. is the world's largest producer of natural gas, the 
largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, and as of last year, the 
largest supplier of LNG to Europe. In March of last year, the Biden 
administration and the E.U. Commission issued a joint commitment 
focused on enhancing energy security, which included many commitments 
from the United States to remain a reliable long-term supplier of 
energy to our allies overseas. One of those Commitments was to maintain 
``an enabling regulatory environment'' for natural gas infrastructure 
projects. Similar commitments have been made to the UK and Japan. In 
fact, it is quite difficult to build energy infrastructure projects 
here in the United States. Do you agree that U.S. LNG has been critical 
to the world's energy security, and do you believe it will remain 
critical going forward?

    Answer. U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) has played a pivotal role 
in Europe's energy security. Our LNG exports to the EU and the UK 
increased by 140 percent over the full year of 2022 to over 70 billion 
cubic meters. Additionally, about 64 percent of total U.S. LNG exports 
went to the UK and EU in 2022--and this represented about half of the 
region's LNG imports. LNG supplies from the United States and other 
reliable suppliers, and Europe's increasing focus on energy efficiency, 
will help Europe meet next winter's demand peak. U.S. LNG will continue 
to play an important role in Europe's energy security.

    Question. What has the administration done, or planned to do, to 
ensure we can meet our commitments to our allies?

    Answer. We are engaging our allies multilaterally through entities 
such as the International Energy Agency, regionally through forums such 
as the U.S.--EU Energy Council, and bilaterally through initiatives 
like the U.S.--Japan Energy Security Dialogue, to advance energy 
security and the energy transition. The United States also became the 
world's largest LNG exporter in 2022, sending record amounts of gas to 
Europe, and we are working with our EU partners to advance energy 
efficiency and to accelerate the energy transition. We will continue to 
support the energy security of our allies and partners.

    Question. When you last appeared before the Senate Appropriations 
Committee in April 2022, we discussed the importance of reliable access 
to cost-effective sources of energy for like-minded partners in the 
Quad. You said that was an interesting idea and that you would come 
back to me. Since then, Japan has brought up energy security and 
investment with, only to be rebuffed by many G7 members like Germany, 
who are pursuing the exact same strategy. Has the State Department 
created an energy security working group within the Quad since your 
answer last year?

    Answer. The Department of State is working with Quad partners to 
increase our collective energy security by focusing efforts to develop 
and diversify critical minerals and energy supply chains, while 
promoting greater investment to advance the energy transition that will 
increase access to cost-effective sources of energy. These efforts 
complement G7 and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework priorities to enhance 
energy security, decarbonization, and access.

    Question. Does the Biden administration support having energy 
security as part of this year's G7 agenda, including the role of U.S. 
natural gas in strengthening that energy security?

    Answer. The United States is working closely with Japan, the G7 
President, on enhancing global energy security, which includes a role 
for U.S. natural gas, particularly in the context of Russia's ongoing 
war of aggression against Ukraine. The administration is in close 
consultation with Japan and other G7 partners to advance global energy 
security and the clean energy transition simultaneously. Japan, as both 
a major energy consumer and technological innovator, will play a vital 
role in these closely intertwined global efforts.

    Question. Wouldn't the G7's refusal to expand LNG investment 
prolong Europe's and India's dependence on Russian energy and help 
finance President Putin's war against Ukraine?

    Answer. G7 Leaders will meet in Hiroshima May 19-21. We are in 
close consultation with Japan and other G7 partners to advance global 
energy security and the clean energy transition simultaneously. Japan, 
as both a major energy consumer and technological innovator, will play 
a vital role in these closely intertwined global efforts. There is a 
role for LNG, particularly in the context of Russia's ongoing war of 
aggression against Ukraine.

    Question. Chinese carriers currently use Russian airspace to arrive 
and depart from the United States. Chinese carriers pay the Russian 
government to access Russian airspace. The use of Russian airspace 
presents safety concerns for U.S. passengers on these flights in the 
case of a diversion for mechanical, medical, or other reasons. 
Moreover, Chinese use of Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers 
significant competitive advantages over U.S. passenger carriers and 
workers as the use of Russian airspace significantly reduces flying 
time, costs, fuel, and allows Chinese carriers to load their planes to 
maximum capacity. The use of Russian airspace also provides funding for 
the war in Ukraine. Under a Department of Transportation Order from 
2021 current flights between the United States and China are limited to 
eight roundtrips per side. If the existing U.S.-China bilateral 
agreement comes back into full effect, Chinese carriers would be 
entitled to 180 weekly roundtrips from three major cities in China to 
the U.S., whereas U.S. carriers would have 154 weekly roundtrips. What 
are the State Department's plans on this issue?

    Answer. The Department is concerned about third country air 
carriers that operate flights to and from the United States via Russian 
airspace. We continue to track and coordinate closely with interagency 
colleagues to identify potential responses consistent with domestic and 
international legal obligations. We continue to pursue a measured 
approach to the increase of flights in the U.S.-PRC aviation market 
that ensures parity and a level playing field for both countries' 
carriers.

    Question. Will you commit not to increase flights from China above 
the current limits until the Chinese government agrees not to utilize 
Russian airspace to or from the United States?

    Answer. We continue to track this issue closely with interagency 
colleagues and maintain a measured approach to any increase of flights 
in the U.S.-PRC aviation market. Our goal is to ensure parity and a 
level playing field so that any increase in flights equally benefits 
U.S. carriers.

    Question. U.S. officials were publicly talking about ``victory'' 
and inflicting a ``strategic defeat'' on Russia that would leave it 
``weakened.'' President Biden has repeatedly vowed to support Ukraine 
``as long as it takes.'' However, in November, the NYT reported that 
the administration was privately encouraging Ukraine's leaders to 
negotiate with Russia. In December, you suggested that Crimea and the 
Donbas be resolved later. In January, the NYT reported the 
administration softened its hard line against providing Ukraine 
offensive weapons and assessed that Ukrainian pressure on Crimea would 
strengthen Kyiv's position in any future negotiations. What is the 
Biden administration's desired end state for this conflict? To restore 
the status quo ante before Putin's invasion or to force Putin to return 
territory he seized in 2014, including Crimea?

    Answer. Our desired end state for this conflict is a Ukraine that 
is sovereign, independent, and secure within its internationally-
recognized borders. That includes all territory of Ukraine currently 
occupied by Russia--Crimea, Zaporizhzhya, Kherson, Luhansk, and Donetsk 
oblasts. We have said repeatedly that this war must end in negotiated 
settlement, but the ``end state'' is ultimately a decision for Ukraine 
to make. We will continue to support Ukraine on the battlefield and 
through our economic and humanitarian assistance.

    Question. What is your assessment on what conditions be required 
for Putin to accept a negotiated peace?

    Answer. President Putin started this war with the aim to 
effectively erase Ukraine's independence and sovereignty, and control 
over Ukraine remains the Kremlin's ultimate objective. Short of that 
goal, Putin may consider as an interim step consolidating control of 
occupied Ukrainian territory, resting and refitting his forces, and 
resuming his aggression against Ukraine when able. He has shown no 
willingness to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war he 
started. It is imperative that Ukraine possess the means to effectively 
deter and defend itself against further Russian aggression.

    Question. What is your assessment on Putin's willingness to use 
nuclear weapons as the war drags on?

    Answer. Russia has resorted to irresponsible and unacceptable 
nuclear rhetoric throughout its unprovoked and brutal full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine. The United States, however, has not seen 
indications or preparations that Russia is planning imminent nuclear 
use. Whether that will change over time is uncertain. The costs of such 
use have been made clear by the international community. The United 
States and its fellow G7 members have stated any Russian use of nuclear 
weapons would be met with severe consequences.I would defer to the 
Intelligence Community for a classified assessment.

    Question. Would Ukraine's attempt to seize Crimea or the Donbas 
prompt Putin to consider using nuclear weapons?

    Answer. What exactly would prompt Putin to consider using nuclear 
weapons would be a matter of speculation. The costs of any such use 
have been made clear to Russia by the international community. The 
United States and its fellow G7 members have stated any Russian use of 
nuclear weapons would be met with severe consequences. I would defer to 
the Intelligence Community for a classified assessment.

    Question. What is your assessment on how stable Vladimir Putin's 
hold on power is in the Kremlin?

    Answer. Though the Russian government's forced partial mobilization 
last fall provoked criticism and alarm from many Russians, Putin 
controls the main levers of security and information in Russia. The 
Kremlin ruthlessly represses dissent and opposition voices and 
promulgates false narratives about the war against Ukraine to maintain 
power.

    Question. Taiwan's arms backlog remains roughly $19 billion despite 
senior Pentagon officials' assessment that China will be capable of 
invading Taiwan by 2027. The fiscal year 2023 National Defense 
Authorization Act authorizes up-to-$2 billion in grants of Foreign 
Military Financing to Taiwan between now and 2027. It also authorizes 
$1 billion per year in Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to 
transfer defense articles to Taiwan in the event of an emergency. This 
is the same authorization that President Joe Biden used to send 
billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine for defense against Russia's 
invasion; indeed, since February 2022, the Biden administration has 
directed 30 drawdowns under PDA totaling approximately $18.3 billion in 
weaponry from the Department of Defense, including HIMARS, Stingers, 
and Javelins. In your hearing, you claimed that the State Department's 
budget request did not seek an appropriation to fully fund foreign 
military financing and PDA to support Taiwan because the problem with 
foreign military sales was one of defense industry ``capacity.'' Why 
did the State Department budget request for Fiscal Year 2024 not 
include a request to fund the up-to-$2 billion in grants of Foreign 
Military Financing to Taiwan between now and 2027 that was authorized 
in SFRC Chairman Robert Menendez's Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act 
(``TERA'')?

    Answer. The Department appreciates the authorizations in the Taiwan 
Enhanced Resilience Act of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant 
assistance to Taiwan, and continues to explore options for Taiwan. This 
budget request includes $113 million to address emerging priorities 
globally, which may include Taiwan. A strategic allocation of FMF could 
be accomplished with increased flexibility within the annual 
appropriations bill.

    Question. Why did the State Department budget request for Fiscal 
Year 2024 not include a request to fund the $1 billion in PDA to 
support Taiwan that was authorized in TERA to proactively provide arms 
necessary for Taiwan to deter a possible Chinese invasion of the 
island?

    Answer. The Department recognizes the drawdown authority is one of 
the U.S. government's most valuable tools to quickly provide defense 
articles to foreign partners. There are numerous policy and national 
security implications the United States must consider before the 
President decides whether to authorize a drawdown. Any decision to 
exercise the new drawdown authority would not require a corresponding 
appropriation as it is an authority to draw down from existing DoD 
stocks.

    Question. To what extent has the United States sent weapons to 
Ukraine via PDA that could also be used for an asymmetric defense of 
Taiwan?

    Answer. Support to Ukraine and support to Taiwan are not mutually 
exclusive. There are similarities and differences to our partners' 
defense needs, and capabilities prioritized for Taiwan are often the 
same systems that enhance the capabilities of many partners and allies. 
Some of the systems transferred to Ukraine under the military 
assistance drawdown authority align with some of Taiwan's priorities 
for acquisition, though the specific variant may be different.

    Question. Given the threat and stakes, will the administration 
commit to prioritizing delivering weapons to Taiwan ahead other 
countries? If so, how will you ensure this is done quickly and 
effectively? If the administration believes it is unable to deliver 
weapons to Taiwan ahead of other countries for legal reasons, please 
explain why.

    Answer. The U.S. government has limited flexibility to influence 
the order in which Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requests are fulfilled, 
and individual foreign partners are not automatically prioritized 
within the FMS process. Numerous factors determine the production 
queue, including the order that customers finalize and fund contracts, 
current DoD requirements, and the system and specific variant ordered. 
Prioritizing one partner would result in significant cost increases to 
that partner and likely cause the United States to miss contractual 
obligations with other partners.

    Question. What steps is the administration taking to ensure the 
U.S. defense industrial base is prepared to replenish depleted U.S. 
weapons stockpiles and ramp up production to prepare for a possible 
major regional conflict in the Indo-Pacific?

    Answer. I refer you to the Department of Defense, which holds the 
authority for contracting with U.S. companies for maintenance and 
potential contingency stockpiling.

    Question. Could our European allies provide more military 
assistance to Ukraine?

    Answer. More than 50 of our Allies and partners have publicly 
committed over $24.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 
February 2022 and we continue to work closely with them to increase 
military equipment provisions to Ukraine. Additionally, several of 
these countries have provided training.

    Question. What are we doing to pressure our European allies to do 
more?

    Answer. We continue to encourage our Allies and partners to provide 
the necessary military equipment Ukraine needs. I and other Department 
officials regularly raise Ukraine's needs with foreign counterparts in-
person, on calls, and in multilateral settings, and will continue to do 
so for as long as it takes to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia's 
further invasion.

    Question. Would a greater and more rapid European contribution of 
security assistance to Ukraine allow the United States to devote more 
of its strained defense industrial capacity to arming Taiwan?

    Answer. Most European partners have supported Ukraine 
diplomatically, economically, and with military hardware and training. 
For example, at nearly 1 percent of GDP, Latvia's total assistance 
commitment is proportionally nearly four times that of the United 
States, while Estonia has donated the equivalent of nearly half of its 
annual defense budget to Ukraine. Efforts to support the timely 
delivery of defense articles to Taiwan need to prioritize expanding 
production capacity.

    Question. The U.S. intelligence community reportedly estimated back 
in 2018 that Mexican drug cartels controlled more than 20 percent of 
Mexican territory--a percentage I'm certain has grown. The cartels also 
control large swathes of terrain across our southern border. Moreover, 
these cartels are responsible for almost all illicit drugs coming 
across our border. President Biden's Executive Order 14059 authorizes 
sanctions against foreign persons who provide--or facilitate the 
provision of--material support to the cartels. Why hasn't the Biden 
administration used existing sanctions authorities against Mexican 
government officials, including governors, who help the cartels?

    Answer. The Department coordinates with the Department of the 
Treasury in support of Executive Order 14059. We have and will continue 
to use existing sanctions authorities against those involved in 
trafficking drugs into the United States.

    Question. Is it acceptable that President Lopez Obrador is not 
taking aggressive action to degrade the drug cartels?

    Answer. Through the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public 
Health, and Safe Communities, we work closely with Mexican counterparts 
to address our shared security challenges, most notably the 
transnational criminal organizations responsible for trafficking 
illicit drugs into the United States and the associated violence in 
Mexico. I led two High Level Security Dialogues (in 2021 and 2022), 
along with my colleagues from the Departments of Justice and Homeland 
Security, where I urged the Mexican government to strengthen its 
efforts to curb fentanyl production and trafficking.

    Question. What other tools is the Biden administration using to 
compel the Mexican government to take decisive action?

    Answer. For years, the United States and Mexico have worked as 
partners to combat transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Through 
the Bicentennial Framework, the United States and Mexico have increased 
joint efforts to combat production of synthetic and other illicit 
drugs, increase drug interdictions, pursue prosecutions of TCOs and 
their finances, and reduce the amount of illicit goods crossing the 
U.S.-Mexico border. We also committed to implement a joint synthetic 
drug action plan at the 2022 High-Level Security Dialogue to complement 
ongoing cooperation.

    Question. Do you assess that Mexico is at risk of becoming a narco-
state?

    Answer. No. Mexico is a long-standing partner in the fight against 
transnational crime. During the two High Level Security Dialogues I led 
in 2021 and 2022, the United States and Mexico committed to increasing 
our efforts to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal 
organizations, and to strengthen Mexican capacity to improve the rule 
of law and curb fentanyl production and trafficking through the 
Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe 
Communities.

    Question. Please provide a list of all non-governmental 
organizations, including prime awardees and sub awardees, in Israel, 
West Bank, and Gaza that have received any funding from the U.S. 
government, including but not limited to the State Dept., NED, and MEPI 
beginning January 1, 2021 to the present day. The list should include 
the names of the prime awardees and sub awardees receiving any U.S. 
funding, the date and duration of the funding provided, the total 
amount of funding that has been and will be provided, the 
instrumentality of the United States government that is providing the 
funding, and the stated propose of the funding.

    Answer. The Department is working to assemble and provide the 
requested information. We would refer you to NED for information on 
their programming.

    Question. The Biden administration has dramatically expanded U.S. 
assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in spite of substantial evidence that 
indicates that UNRWA has contributed to Palestinian extremism and that 
Palestinian schools administered by UNRWA, have used textbooks and 
allowed the presence of materials that delegitimize Israel, denigrate 
Jews, and venerate martyrdom. In spite of the likelihood that UNRWA 
employs individuals affiliated with U.S.--designated terrorist 
organization Hamas, the United States does not condition aid to UNRWA 
on counter-terrorism vetting for staff, contractors, and recipients of 
UNRWA funds. Unlike USAID, where all grants must pass counter-terrorism 
vetting before funds are received, no similar mechanism is in place to 
ensure funds allocated to UNRWA do not get into the hands of people 
affiliated with Hamas and other terrorist organizations. Right now 
there is no accountability on this front: taking UNRWA's word for it is 
not a substitute for an independent audit. When was the last time the 
State Department conducted an audit of UNRWA?

    Answer. I unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to violence 
and antisemitism. The United States provides vigorous oversight of 
UNRWA's commitment to neutrality and to prevent funds from benefitting 
terrorists via our U.S.--UNRWA Framework for Cooperation. Department 
oversight includes site visits, weekly meetings with UNRWA, quarterly 
checks of UNRWA contractors receiving more than $10,000, and following 
up on UNRWA and UN audit findings and UNRWA's extensive reporting. We 
take oversight seriously and meet with stakeholders--including the 
government of Israel--to resolve concerns.

    Question. Are you in favor of conditioning UNRWA funds on the 
completion of an independently conducted and verified counter-terrorism 
vetting process--similar to the protocol followed for staff of USAID 
aid recipients--that ensures that recipients of funds, or at minimum 
the staff and contractors of institutions receiving funds, are not 
being affiliated with terrorist organizations such as Hamas? Please 
begin your answer with a yes or no. If not, on what grounds do you find 
it acceptable that the United States taxpayer funds are going to 
organizations that contribute to the perpetuation of violent extremism 
and anti-Semitism and are not willing to undergo counter-terrorism 
vetting.

    Answer. Antisemitism and incitement to violence are unacceptable. 
The State Department monitors the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's (UNRWA) adherence to 
stringent policies to uphold neutrality and prevent funds from 
benefiting terrorists. This includes UNRWA screening all staff and 
beneficiaries for terrorism and terrorist financing concerns; sharing 
staff lists with host authorities including Israel and the Palestinian 
Authority; prohibiting UNRWA staff participation in political 
activities; and reviewing all host country curricula and instructing 
teachers how to address issues inconsistent with UN values and its 
neutrality framework.

    Question. Last year, the United States seemingly spared no expense 
and utilized every resource to bring Brittney Griner home from Russia. 
How do you explain the difference in the urgency with which the 
administration approached for the Griner case compared to the urgency 
it has approached other cases of wrongful detention?

    Answer. The President's and my commitment to this issue is clear: 
there is no higher priority than the safety and security of all U.S. 
citizens around the world, and that includes seeking the release of 
those who are wrongfully detained or held hostage. We treat all 
wrongful detention cases with the urgency they deserve and have brought 
home dozens of U.S. nationals so far.

    Question. What message do you have for other families who continue 
to wait for their own wrongfully detained loved ones to return home, 
have yet to meet with the President despite attempts to do so, and feel 
as though the administration is not prioritizing their own cases in the 
same way?

    Answer. Whether someone receives a meeting with the President or 
not, the administration is always working equally hard to resolve each 
of these cases. I realize that meeting the President himself is an 
important event for these families, and I know that the President is 
aware of all U.S. national wrongful detention cases and feels 
passionately about bringing wrongful detainees home.

    Question. Do you believe these individuals should meet with the 
President?

    Answer. Whether someone receives a meeting with the President or 
not, the administration is always working equally hard to resolve each 
of these cases. I realize that meeting the President himself is an 
important event for these families, and I know that the President is 
aware of all U.S. national wrongful detention cases and feels 
passionately about bringing wrongful detainees home.

    Question. What can you commit to for these families?

    Answer. This administration is committed to the return of every 
U.S. national hostage and wrongful detainee and has brought home dozens 
of Americans so far. We have two critical imperatives in this space: 
securing the release of U.S. nationals while also promoting 
accountability and deterring those who would engage in this practice. 
Our goal is also to support the families; we aim to ensure families of 
wrongful detainees have access to the support they need. We are 
confident we can do all three, and our record speaks to that.

    Question. In April 2021, the State Department invited organizations 
to compete for funding to support projects that promote and defend 
atheism around the world. According to the State Department's official 
announcement, its ``goal is to ensure everyone enjoys religious 
freedom, including freedom to dissent from religious belief and to not 
practice or adhere to a religion.'' The announcement described a 
competitive process for awarding grants of $500,000 to organizations 
committed to specifically to the practice and spread of atheism and 
humanism in South and Central Asia and in the Middle East and North 
Africa (excluding Libya, Syria, and Yemen). Did the bureau of 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) receive an official opinion 
letter or memorandum from the Office of the Legal Advisor (L) 
confirming that the proposed grants are constitutional?

    Answer. I am firmly committed to defending the right to freedom of 
religion or belief for all. Consistent with the Biden administration's 
mandate under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as 
amended, this policy applies equally to people of any religion or 
belief, including atheists, agnostics, humanists, or non-theists. 
Consistent with the First Amendment, Department of State programs never 
promote specific religious beliefs; rather, they promote the ability of 
all individuals to have or adopt the religion or beliefs of their 
choice, free from discrimination and violence.

    Question. What specific U.S. foreign policy interests does this 
program advance?

    Answer. As noted in the annual International Religious Freedom 
reports, the prevalence of abuses or discrimination against members of 
one minority group is often indicative of the existence of similar 
discrimination and abuses against members of other minorities. 
Supporting efforts to safeguard the rights of members of one persecuted 
group helps address broader abuses and restrictions experienced by 
members of many or all religious groups in that society.

    Question. Which implementing partners, if any, were chosen for 
funding after the NOFO in April 2021?

    Answer. In accordance with longstanding practice, and to protect 
the ability of rights advocacy organizations to accomplish their 
objectives in highly sensitive international settings, the Department 
does not make public the results of these grant awards. However, the 
Department offers briefings for Congress to discuss these awards when 
requested.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Senator Marco Rubio
    Question. General Secretary Xi Jinping is correctly regarded as the 
most ideological Chinese Communist Party leader since Mao Zedong. He 
has personally tasked the Party with ``liberating all of humanity'' and 
serving as the ``gravediggers of capitalism.'' He is pushing the 
People's Liberation Army (PLA) to focus its efforts on countering the 
``powerful enemy adversary,'' which the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic 
and Security Review Commission argues is a code word for the U.S. Do 
you believe General Secretary Xi when he says he wants the Party to 
serve as a ``gravedigger of capitalism?''

    Answer. The PRC is the only country with both the intent to reshape 
the international order and, increasingly, the power to do it. The 
PRC's own modernization benefitted from the stability and opportunity 
that the international order provides. But rather than using its power 
to reinforce and revitalize the laws, agreements, principles, and 
institutions that enabled its success, Beijing is undermining them. The 
PRC has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad. We 
continue to work with allies and partners to shape the strategic 
environment around Beijing to advance our vision of an open and 
inclusive international system.

    Question. Do you think General Secretary Xi is a partner the U.S. 
can trust?

    Answer. Under President Xi, the Chinese Communist Party has become 
more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad in challenging the 
rules--based international order. We will continue to defend U.S. 
interests, our values, and our affirmative vision for the world. At the 
same time, we recognize that how the United States and PRC manage our 
relationship has consequences for the entire world. That is why we will 
continue to explore possible efforts to partner with the PRC on 
transnational challenges, such as climate change, counternarcotics, 
non-proliferation, and global health.

    Question. At what point will the administration stop downplaying 
Chinese support for Russia ``as a marriage of convenience'' and instead 
denounce the Chinese Communist Party as working against our interests 
in Ukraine?

    Answer. Under President Xi, the Chinese Communist Party has become 
more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad. We will defend U.S. 
national security and advance our values and prosperity. We have 
repeatedly warned the PRC that assistance to Russia's war effort, 
including help evading sanctions, would have serious consequences, and 
have sanctioned or designed PRC entities that have aided Russia's war.

    Question. You say we need to counter Beijing's actions with 
diplomacy. Your department has supplanted or conflated national 
security objectives with progressive social policy by funding a 
Colombian LGBTQI group supporting prostitution, a film festival 
featuring incest and pedophilia in Portugal, and producing a diversity, 
equity, and inclusion declaration with Canada and Mexico while the 
immigration crisis rages at the border. How much of the $4 billion you 
have requested for the Indo-Pacific to achieve national security 
objectives is going to be used on woke projects?

    Answer. The fiscal year 2024 President's budget requests resources 
to out-compete the PRC and advance American prosperity globally. The 
budget includes $2.3 billion in discretionary funding to support 
implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, including by strengthening 
our alliances and partnerships, as well as $2 billion in mandatory 
funding to make game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific to 
strengthen economies and support our partners in pushing back against 
coercive PRC efforts.

    Question. Will you guarantee to this committee, and the American 
people, the proposed funding for the Indo-Pacific will be utilized to 
advance American prosperity and national security and not on a 
progressive social agenda?

    Answer. The proposed funding for the Indo-Pacific, both the 
mandatory and discretionary components, included in the fiscal year 
2024 President's budget request will advance American prosperity and 
national security. This funding is a critical investment that must be 
made for the United States to advance relationships with partners in 
the Indo-Pacific where competition with the PRC is most pronounced.

    Question. The claim that the United States ``does not seek to 
change China's system'' is especially wrongheaded and far from a slip-
up. It echoes a line in the Biden administration's February Indo-
Pacific strategy: ``Our objective is not to change the PRC but to shape 
the strategic environment in which it operates.'' This sounds exactly 
like the defeatism that I feared when I warned in November 2020 that 
Biden would bring back the ``caretakers of American decline.'' 
Additionally, recent reports of Chinese companies supplying Russian 
companies with body armor, rifle ammunition, and jet repair parts to 
Russia have come to light. What exactly does winning look like in a 
``strategic competition'' if China's political system--a system that 
commits genocide, that covers up the origins of COVID-19, and that 
systematically steals our intellectual property and technology--does 
not change?

    Answer. The PRC is the only country with both the intent to reshape 
the international order and, increasingly, the power to do it. The 
United States will compete and unapologetically stand up for our values 
and interests, but we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not 
seeking a new Cold War. We will vigorously defend and strengthen our 
national security as well as the international law, institutions, and 
agreements that protect the rights of individuals and sovereign 
nations, and maintain the peace and security that makes it possible for 
all countries to coexist.

    Question. How can U.S. leadership be maintained unless our 
worldview continues to shape the global order, and the Party's 
worldview--what it calls ``Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics for a New Era''--is tossed onto the ash heap of history 
where it belongs?

    Answer. The PRC is the greatest geopolitical challenge facing the 
United States because it is the only competitor with the intent and, 
increasingly, the capability to remake the international order. The 
United States will continue to compete vigorously with the PRC to 
defend our values and vision of the world. At the same time, as we have 
said, we do not seek conflict with the PRC. The United States will 
manage competition responsibly and maintain open lines of communication 
with the PRC.

    Question. How can we paper over General Secretary Xi's statements 
that he wants the Chinese Communist Party to ``liberate all of 
humanity'' and serve as the ``gravediggers of capitalism'' as just a 
difference of opinion that can be constrained?

    Answer. The PRC is the greatest geopolitical challenge facing the 
United States because it is the only competitor with the intent and, 
increasingly, the capability to remake the international order. The PRC 
is more repressive at home and aggressive abroad in challenging the 
interests and values of the United States and our allies and partners. 
We will continue to advance our vision for an open and inclusive 
international system. The United States will also manage competition 
responsibly and maintain open lines of communication with the PRC.

    Question. Why is this administration so prone to timidity when 
confronted by what is nothing less than an existential threat?

    Answer. The Biden administration will continue to compete 
vigorously with the PRC to uphold our values and advance our interests 
and our affirmative vision of the world.We have introduced a record-
setting number of sanctions, export controls, and other competitive 
actions. For example, we added more than 200 PRC and Hong Kong entities 
to the Entity List; pushed back publicly against PRC claims in the 
South China Sea; held the PRC to account for its egregious abuses of 
human rights; and demonstrated unprecedented support for human rights 
and religious freedom in Tibet.

    Question. When will the administration impose sanctions on Chinese 
support for the invasion of Ukraine?

    Answer. We have already sanctioned a number of PRC firms under our 
Russia sanctions regime, including Spacety for providing synthetic 
aperture radar satellite imagery over locations in Ukraine. In my 
meeting with PRC Director Wang Yi on the margins of the Munich Security 
Conference on February 18, I reinforced our concern and potential 
repercussions of the PRC materially supporting Russia's war effort. We 
have made it clear to the PRC there would be real consequences to our 
relationship if the PRC were to provide Russia lethal assistance or 
systematic support to evade sanctions. We will continue to monitor this 
issue very closely.

    Question. What is the administration doing to hold the Chinese 
Communist Party accountable for its continued refusal to stop the 
production of fentanyl precursor chemicals?

    Answer. The Department continues to press Beijing and expand 
efforts to strengthen international cooperation with the PRC and other 
partners to stop the criminal diversion of unscheduled chemicals to 
illicit synthetic drug production. Among other efforts, the Department 
provides foreign policy guidance to the Department of the Treasury in 
support of designations pursuant to the Kingpin Act and E.O. 14059 and 
continually evaluates potential targets for the Department of State 
Transnational Organized Crime and Narcotics Rewards Programs.

    Question. I remain skeptical that you traveling to Beijing is a net 
positive for our Nation given the brazen violation of U.S. sovereignty 
by its spy balloon, the CCP's continued detention of U.S. citizens, and 
ongoing acts of genocide, to name a few. Should it be rescheduled, this 
administration would be perceived as bailing out General Secretary Xi 
Jinping, providing him with an audience after China's ``two sessions,'' 
which have confirmed his consolidation over the Party and Chinese 
society. Do you still plan to visit Beijing?

    Answer. I am prepared to visit Beijing when conditions allow. If I 
do so, I will carry a clear message, as I always do in my engagements 
with PRC leaders, that Beijing must live up to its responsibilities as 
a global power. We will continue to manage this relationship 
responsibly and maintain open lines of communication.

    Question. Under what conditions do you think a trip is appropriate?

    Answer. We will assess the most opportune time to visit to advance 
U.S. interests. From the U.S. perspective, it's important that the PRC 
make meaningful progress on some of the most high-priority issues as 
outlined by President Biden. During any meeting with PRC leaders, I 
intend to carry a clear message, as I always do in my engagements, that 
Beijing must live up to its responsibilities as a global power.

    Question. Would you, at a minimum, require the release of American 
citizens, like Mark Swidan, Zhou Deyong, and Harrison Li, as a 
prerequisite for any meeting with your counterparts in Beijing? Why or 
why not?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by the PRC's continued use of 
wrongful detentions and coercive exit bans without a fair and 
transparent process in U.S. citizens' cases. There is no higher 
priority for the U.S. government. The administration raises individual 
U.S. citizen cases with the PRC government at every opportunity and at 
the highest levels. We call on the PRC to immediately release 
wrongfully detained individuals, lift coercive travel restrictions on 
U.S. citizens, and refrain from such measures in the future. I commit 
to keeping Congress informed, consistent with privacy concerns.

    Question. Will you raise the issue of the PRC's systematic arrests 
and detentions of the family members of American citizens of Uyghur 
descent in order to silence their advocacy? For example, the families 
of Nury Turkel, the Chairman of the U.S. Commission on International 
Religious Freedom, Gulchehra Hoja, a reporter at Radio Free Asia, and 
Rushan Abbas, a prominent NGO leader, are all either under detention or 
travel bans.

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by ongoing reports of PRC attempting 
to silence human rights advocates in the United States by retaliating 
against their relatives in China. We continue to call for the immediate 
and unconditional release of PRC nationals who are unjustly detained. 
We also urge the PRC to lift coercive exit bans affecting family 
members of U.S. citizens. The Department raises priority cases of 
concern directly with the PRC government at the highest levels, 
including cases concerning relatives of U.S. citizens and residents.

    Question. Do you pledge to hold the Chinese Communist Party 
accountable for its use of slave labor, unfair trade practices, and 
aggression in the region?

    Answer. We will continue to take strong action to counter PRC human 
rights abuses and unfair trade practices. To this end, we have deployed 
tools to promote accountability for PRC individuals and entities 
responsible for human rights abuses. While we were disappointed with 
the outcome of the 2022 Human Rights Council vote not to discuss 
Xinjiang, it successfully made clear the PRC is not above scrutiny. We 
are working with likeminded allies on next steps to promote 
accountability for the PRC's human rights abuses and unfair trade 
practices, and to uphold the rules-based international order.

    Question. Since the start of the Biden administration, it appears 
its China policy has been flawed. On the one hand, the Biden 
administration says Beijing is the only regime that has the intention 
and capacity to reshape the international order. On the other hand, the 
administration still insists on cooperating with the Chinese government 
where ``our interests align.'' For example, John Kerry is still 
championing a climate deal, even though the number of Chinese coal 
plants continues to rise and Beijing eagerly buys up Iranian and 
Russian oil. Do you believe a government that routinely violates its 
commitments to international agreements, and has no interest in slowing 
down its industrial capacity, will negotiate with us in good faith?

    Answer. The Biden administration holds the PRC accountable to its 
bilateral and international commitments. We do not hesitate to call out 
the PRC when it has failed to uphold these commitments, such as in the 
most recent Annual Report on China's WTO Compliance. As the largest 
carbon dioxide emitter, the PRC must accelerate efforts to limit global 
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Confronting the climate crisis is a 
global and existential issue. The world expects China and the United 
States to work together when it comes to transnational challenges such 
as climate, including on energy transition, methane emission 
reductions, and ending illegal deforestation.

    Question. What do you base that belief on?

    Answer. The Biden administration holds the PRC accountable to its 
bilateral and international commitments. We do not hesitate to call out 
the PRC when it has failed to uphold these commitments, such as in the 
most recent Annual Report on China's WTO Compliance. As the largest 
carbon dioxide emitter, the PRC must accelerate efforts to limit global 
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Confronting the climate crisis is a 
global and existential issue. The world expects China and the United 
States to work together when it comes to transnational challenges such 
as climate, including on energy transition, methane emission 
reductions, and ending illegal deforestation.

    Question. A few months ago, a report by the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies concluded that the war in Ukraine has 
severely depleted both American and European stocks of munitions 
critical for a conventional war. This is especially cause for concern 
given that the Chinese Communist Party is stepping up its aggressive 
behavior in the Indo-Pacific, including towards Taiwan and India. It is 
my belief that deterring Beijing in the region must be the top priority 
for the U.S., and our assistance to Ukraine--though important--should 
not come at the cost of leaving us unprepared to deter China or degrade 
the ability of the U.S. to defend ourselves at home. Have the 
militaries of Taiwan, or our other allies and partners in the Indo-
Pacific region, requested any of the capabilities and equipment we are 
providing Ukraine?

    Answer. Support to Ukraine and support to Taiwan and our other 
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific are not mutually exclusive. It 
is correct that there are similarities and differences to our partners' 
defense needs, and capabilities provided to a particular customer are 
often the same systems that enhance the capabilities of other partners 
and allies. Many of the capabilities we have provided Ukraine via the 
drawdown authority are similar to capabilities that would support 
Taiwan's defense requirements, though these often include different 
variants to systems our Indo-Pacific partners are procuring through 
Foreign Military Sales.

    Question. If so, how is the department handling competing Foreign 
Military Sales requests between our Indo-Pacific allies and partners 
and our European allies? Which is being prioritized for fulfillment?

    Answer. Numerous factors determine the production queue, including 
the order in which customers finalize and fund contracts, current DoD 
requirements, and the system and specific variant ordered. Prioritizing 
one partner would result in significant cost increases to that partner 
and likely cause the United States to miss contractual obligations with 
other partners. That said, we are looking at ways to prioritize urgent 
needs for our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe.

    Question. Chinese-produced fentanyl and fentanyl precursors 
continue to enter the U.S. illicitly and kill American adults and 
children. It is a tragedy that many of Florida's, and America's, 
families are all too familiar with. Despite this, last fall, the Biden 
administration did not list China as a Major Drug Transit or Major 
Illicit Drug Producing Country for Fiscal Year 2023. This is an insult 
to the pain and suffering so many Americans are facing due to Chinese-
produced fentanyl and fentanyl precursors. The law is clear: any 
country ``that is a significant direct source of covered synthetic 
drugs or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, including 
precursor chemicals when those chemicals are used in the production of 
such drugs and substances, significantly affecting the United States'' 
should be designated. China clearly meets that definition. Why did you 
leave it off the list?

    Answer. The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2023 amended the definition of Major Drug and Major Illicit 
Drug Producing Countries to include synthetic drugs and precursor 
chemicals. It was enacted into law by President Biden on December 23, 
2022. This legislative change occurred following President Biden's last 
determination identifying Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for fiscal year 2023 in September 2022. The fiscal 
year 2024 determination of countries is required under law by September 
15, 2023.

    Question. Has the department considered sanctioning Chinese persons 
and entities involved with producing fentanyl and fentanyl precursors 
through the Kingpin Act? If not, why?

    Answer. The Department of State provides foreign policy guidance to 
the Department of the Treasury in support of designations pursuant to 
the Kingpin Act and the more recent Executive Order 14059. The 
Department remains committed to continued close collaboration in 
support of the Kingpin Act and other sanctions programs targeting the 
fentanyl supply chain. For further specifics on potential targets, I 
recommend questions be directed to the Department of the Treasury.

    Question. Which threshold needs to be crossed in order for the 
department to use tools currently available to sanction these foreign 
persons and entities?

    Answer. The Department utilizes available sanctions tools 
consistent with the terms of the specific authorities being used. The 
Department works with the Department of the Treasury to support the 
implementation of relevant sanctions, including EO 14059, which 
implements the fentanyl sanctions act, and the Foreign Narcotics 
Kingpin Designation Act. For specifics on further implementation 
details, I refer you to the Department of the Treasury.

    Question. On February 27, pursuant to Congress' enactment of the No 
TikTok on Government Devices Act, the Biden administration ordered a 
ban on TikTok on most government devices in 30 days, which would be 
March 30. Do you agree that TikTok represents a national security 
threat to the United States?

    Answer. Since July 2021, the State Department prohibits the use of 
TikTok on Department-owned devices and the creation of official 
Department of State TikTok accounts. In addition, our policy states 
that U.S. Embassies and Consulates should not hire contractors nor 
third-party vendors to create or manage TikTok accounts of behalf of 
Department organizations and personnel.

    Question. Do you agree that TikTok should not be installed on U.S. 
government devices?

    Answer. The State Department has prohibited the use of TikTok on 
Department-owned devices since July 2021 and has prohibited the 
creation of official Department of State TikTok accounts. Additionally, 
we are working to ensure compliance with the February 2023 OMB 
memorandum ``No TikTok on Government Devices'' Implementation Guidance.

    Question. Why is the Biden administration showcasing TikTok 
influencers instead of clearly articulating the national security 
threat the app poses to U.S. citizens?

    Answer. The Department does not manage any TikTok accounts and is 
taking necessary measures to safeguard government infrastructure and 
data. The Department, however, is committed to engaging global 
audiences, including meeting young people where they are, and promoting 
U.S. foreign policy while ensuring we do not cede this space to our 
adversaries and competitors. Methods used may include collaboration 
with individuals on platforms where we do not currently have a digital 
presence.

    Question. Your fiscal year 2024 budget request identifies two 
budget and policy priorities in the top three, and they are the 
implementation of an Indo-Pacific strategy to strengthen alliances and 
partnerships and out-compete the CCP by providing alternatives to the 
CCP's predatory and coercive practices and has requested $4 billion for 
this national security priority. However, you have requested $6.4 
billion for what can only be called pet social policy projects that 
only a narrow section of American society support, such as LGBTQI 
advocacy initiatives, the U.N. Green Climate Fund, a Clean Technology 
Fund, and Family Planning and Reproductive Health--essentially abortion 
advocacy. This disparity highlights where the administration's 
priorities truly are, progressive social policy over American 
prosperity and stated national security priorities. This 
administration's obsession with promoting a woke agenda is destructive 
in its own right, but even more so when placed in the context of great 
power competition. Currently, your department has more than 100 vacant 
and unfilled Foreign Service Generalist and Specialist positions in the 
Indo-Pacific. How many Foreign and Civil service staff are employed in 
the Diversity offices of State and USAID?

    Answer. The Department's Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
currently has authorization for 12 full-time equivalent (FTE) 
positions. One Senior Leader position will be added in fiscal year 
2023. USAID's Office of the Chief DEIA Officer currently has 10 FTE 
positions: eight Civil Service staff and two Foreign Service staff.

    Question. In your proposed budget request, you have proposed 56 new 
positions for State in the Indo-Pacific. Why should Congress authorize 
additional positions when you cannot fill current positions and when 
the department fills Diversity offices ahead of staffing a region the 
President and yourself have stated is the priority?

    Answer. The Department continues to make hiring and filling 
positions a top priority. In fiscal year 2022, the Department executed 
the largest intake of Foreign Service professionals in a decade and 
fiscal year 2023 numbers will be even larger. We remain committed to 
protecting and promoting U.S. interests, including in the Indo-Pacific, 
by ensuring the Department is staffed appropriately.

    Question. The administration's fiscal year 2024 budget request 
includes $532.1 million for the Western Hemisphere. This request 
supports many initiatives for the security of the Caribbean, including 
the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), to help fight crime and 
violence in these nations. Senator Kaine and I introduced legislation 
to codify the CBSI to require the State Department to promote 
cooperation with Caribbean nations and address the crisis in Haiti, 
which isn't a beneficiary country. What steps has the State Department 
taken to address the ongoing security crisis in Haiti?

    Answer. The Department provided over $90 million since July 2021 to 
help the Haitian National Police (HNP) expand its anti-gang capacity by 
training, equipping, and vetting specialized units and supporting 
community policing programs. The Department worked with U.S. and 
Canadian militaries to expeditiously deliver Haitian-purchased armored 
vehicles and provide real-time advice so the HNP could retake the 
Varreux fuel terminal from the gangs in November 2022. The Department's 
CBSI programs address firearms trafficking and other regional problems 
that affect Haiti.

    Question. Why hasn't the administration submitted a resolution to 
the United Nations Security Council calling for international support 
for Haiti, which Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield promised last 
October?

    Answer. As a result of U.S. advocacy, the UN Security Council 
adopted a resolution that extended the mandate of the UN Integrated 
Office in Haiti (BINUH) to 1 year, increased the number of police 
advisors, dedicated capacity to address sexual and gender-based 
violence in BINUH's human rights unit, and established the first UN 
sanctions regime ever in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to 
increasing our bilateral assistance to the Haitian National Police, we 
continue our intensive diplomatic outreach to identify partners to lead 
a non-UN multinational force (MNF).

    Question. What is the status on identifying a country to lead an 
international response to the Haitian government's October 2022 request 
for help?

    Answer. We continue to evaluate options and work with international 
partners to respond to Haiti's request for an international security 
force. In addition, the Department is intensifying its efforts to 
support the Haitian National Police (HNP), including through increased 
training and equipment.

    Question. How many Haitian migrants have to undertake the dangerous 
journey from Haiti to Florida and across the southern U.S. border 
before the administration takes the initiative in quelling gang 
violence in Haiti?

    Answer. The administration remains deeply concerned about Haiti's 
gang violence and irregular migration. Since July 2021, we have 
provided over $90 million for Haitian National Police anti-gang 
capacity building. We continue to lead measures to promote an end to 
the violence, including imposing sanctions and visa restrictions on 
over 50 individuals involved in corruption and criminal organizations 
since October 2022. The Department supports safe, orderly, and humane 
migration from Haiti and the region, including through the expanded 
parole process launched in January 2023.

    Question. The President's request includes $430 million to support 
hemispheric migration management and proposes additional funding for 
programs aimed at improving the lives of migrants and refugees, 
including an allocation for the Inter-American Development Bank's fund 
to invest in the private sector in the Western Hemisphere, which would 
help these economies provide opportunities to their people and keep 
them from migrating here. What guardrails are in place to prevent 
Beijing-controlled companies from accessing these funds?

    Answer. Companies domiciled in the People's Republic of China, as a 
non-borrowing member of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), are 
eligible to bid on projects under IDB financing. The United States 
continues to advocate for reforms and procurement policies at the 
multilateral development banks (MDBs) that focus more on the best value 
for life-cycle costs, which showcases U.S.-based firms' strengths, 
rather than lowest bids. I refer you to the U.S. Treasury Department, 
the lead agency for the MDBs, for more detailed questions on MDB 
procurement.

    Question. In addition to funding supported by the bank, how else 
are we supporting U.S. private investment in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, including upper-middle-income and high-income countries that 
are not eligible for DFC funding?

    Answer. DFC is authorized to work in upper-middle-income countries 
on projects that advance infrastructure, human needs, and USAID 
priorities. EXIM, which operates without income restriction, and USTDA, 
which can work in countries up to middle-income, are able to facilitate 
U.S. exports and private investment throughout the region. We are 
implementing the Blue Dot Network initiative to certify quality 
infrastructure projects and help close the infrastructure gap around 
the world by attracting greater private sector investment regardless of 
income level.

    Question. On October 7, 2022, the UN Human Rights Council voted to 
adopt a U.S.-supported resolution renewing the mandate of the UN Fact-
Finding Mission on Venezuela. Prior to the Council's vote, the mission 
released a report which concluded that ``Nicolas Maduro, supported by 
other high-level authorities, stand out as the main architects in the 
design, implementation and maintenance of a machinery with the purpose 
of repressing dissent.'' How is the State Department supporting efforts 
to hold the Maduro regime accountable for their systematic violations 
of human rights, as documented by the UN Fact Finding mission?

    Answer. The State Department continues to hold the Maduro regime 
accountable for its human rights abuses, including those documented in 
the UN Fact Finding Mission (FFM). As part of these efforts, the U.S. 
Government supports democratic actors, including civil society and the 
opposition, coordinating with democratic countries to demand democracy 
and call out the regime's violations. We have also welcomed the 
International Criminal Court`s investigation into abuses, supported the 
UN FFM's mandate renewal, and imposed sanctions on the Maduro regime.

    Question. Is the administration considering a prisoner exchange 
involving Alex Saab, who is wanted for counter-terrorism charges, for 
innocent Americans who are wrongly detained in Venezuela?

    Answer. The Biden-Harris administration has made it a priority to 
protect Americans abroad and bring home all U.S. nationals wrongfully 
detained or held hostage abroad. We, as always, do not comment on the 
specifics of any particular ongoing case.

    Question. Following the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) vote in 
October, Venezuela lost its seat on the Council, and was replaced by 
Costa Rica--a democracy with a good human rights record. This was a 
positive development for the Council and the international community's 
rejection of the Maduro regime's human rights record. How can we apply 
the same support to keep other countries with human rights violations 
off of the Council in the future?

    Answer. The United States continues to seek reforms of the UN Human 
Rights Council (HRC), particularly with respect to its membership. The 
United States actively engages with allies and partners to encourage 
countries with good human rights records to challenge countries with 
poor records for seats on the Council. The United States also presses 
member states to more carefully consider human rights records of 
countries running for HRC election.

    Question. The human rights situation in Nicaragua has deteriorated 
significantly in recent years. The Daniel Ortega regime has suppressed 
dissent, shuttered independent media, arbitrarily detained political 
opponents, and carried out fraudulent presidential elections. U.S. law, 
specifically the RENACER Act, requires the Secretary of State to impose 
sanctions against human rights violators and those obstructing the 
establishment of conditions that advances free, fair, transparent and 
democratic elections in Nicaragua. What actions have you taken to 
advance democratic elections in Nicaragua, as stated in the RENACER 
Act?

    Answer. The Ortega-Murillo regime continues to trample democratic 
institutions and block democracy's return to Nicaragua. The United 
States has imposed financial sanctions on 48 individuals and 11 
entities and has taken steps to place visa restrictions on nearly 1,000 
Nicaraguans and their family members who fuel repression and 
corruption. No member of the Nicaraguan government nor anyone who 
facilitates the Ortega-Murillo regime's abuses should believe they can 
travel freely to the United States or avoid accountability for their 
actions.

    Question. How is the State Department highlighting the human rights 
situation in Nicaragua at the UNHRC and other international forums?

    Answer. The Department of State works with allies and partners in 
international fora, including the UNHRC and the OAS, to focus global 
attention on the Ortega-Murillo regime's human rights abuses. On April 
3, the UNHRC adopted a U.S.-cosponsored resolution on Nicaragua and 
renewed the mandate of the Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua 
for an additional 2 years. On March 29, U.S. Ambassador Mora 
highlighted former political prisoner Tamara Davila's testimony before 
the OAS Permanent Council, reminding everyone what is at stake in 
Nicaragua.

    Question. A few weeks ago, several Nicaraguan officials visited the 
United States for the World Baseball Classic. The Nicaraguan community 
in Florida identified some of these officials as members of the 
Nicaraguan National Police, which is subject to visa sanctions mandated 
by the NICA and RENACER Acts. Can you confirm if those officials are 
members of the Nicaraguan National Police, which the U.S. has found 
responsible for numerous cases of human rights abuses in Nicaragua, 
issued visas to enter the country?

    Answer. Visa records are confidential under U.S. law and therefore 
we cannot provide details on individual visa cases. The Department has 
taken steps to impose visa restrictions on nearly 1,000 Nicaraguans who 
have contributed to the regime's human rights abuses and actions to 
undermine democracy. The Department continues to gather information and 
review visa applications to identify individuals covered by the 
sanctions described in the NICA and RENACER Act, as well as those 
ineligible under other visa restriction authorities.

    Question. When should we expect the next announcement of sanctions 
on Nicaragua?

    Answer. We do not preview sanctions actions. U.S. sanctions are 
designed to encourage the regime to change course. As the regime has 
not yet shown willingness to do so, we continue to explore additional 
coordinated, multilateral pressure using the diplomatic and economic 
tools at our disposal.

    Question. Last month, officials from Cuba's Ministry of the 
Interior, an entity under U.S. human rights sanctions, were invited to 
visit the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters and a Coast Guard facility in 
North Carolina. Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism. It has sponsored 
terrorism for years in South America, and it continues to shield 
criminals responsible for horrific attacks on U.S. citizens from the 
reach of our judicial system. Do you agree that Cuba should remain on 
the list of state sponsors of terrorism?

    Answer. The Department of State designated Cuba as an SST on 
January 12, 2021, for repeatedly providing support for acts of 
international terrorism. Under U.S. law, specific statutory criteria 
must be met to rescind SST designations. The Department carefully 
reviews available information, from many sources, to determine if a 
country meets the statutory criteria for designation or rescission. Any 
review of Cuba's SST designation would be based on the law, including 
the criteria established by Congress.

    Question. Are you aware of any other program where we invite North 
Korea, Iran, or Syria, the other designated state sponsors of 
terrorism, to tour our military facilities?

    Answer. The Departments of State and Homeland Security, including 
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), jointly planned the Cuba Port Security 
visit in support of the USCG International Port Security (IPS) 
Program's mission. The IPS Program fulfills the mandate to protect the 
U.S. Maritime Transportation System (MTS) through security assessments 
of international ports. The USCG IPS Program has not invited North 
Korea, Iran, or Syria to tour port facilities in the U.S. or USCG 
units. I refer you to the Department of Defense for any questions 
regarding visits to military facilities.

    Question. A few weeks ago, Senator Menendez and I sent a letter 
urging you to increase efforts to stop the expansion or resumption of 
programs in Latin America that makes use of Cuba's foreign medical 
missions. I was pleased to see in the recent release of the annual 
human rights report that the department again pointed out these 
missions as a form of forced labor and noted that it's more than just 
doctors. The regime is forcing sailors, athletes, musicians, 
architects, and teachers into forced labor programs abroad. What is the 
Department doing to encourage countries like Mexico, Brazil, and 
Colombia to stop from using Cuban medical missions?

    Answer. The administration seeks every opportunity to bring abuses 
in Cuba's labor export program to light, raising our concerns with 
senior foreign officials around the world. In recent weeks, U.S. 
embassies engaged officials in Mexico and Brazil to share our concerns 
with Cuba's labor export program to mitigate exploitation and 
trafficking of government-affiliated Cuban workers, and we will 
continue to raise this important issue. The Department has documented 
strong indicators of forced labor in Cuba's labor export program in 
each annual Trafficking in Persons Report since 2010.

    Question. Should these countries start using Cuban Medical 
Missions, what will be the U.S. response?

    Answer. The Department will continue to raise concerns regarding 
forced labor in Cuba's labor export programs with international 
partners and in multilateral fora. We will urge countries to 
proactively screen government-affiliated Cuban workers for trafficking 
and forced labor indicators, protect identified victims, seek 
transparency on their contractual agreements, and respect their human 
rights and labor rights. The Department continues to call on other 
governments to curb coercive labor practices and ensure compliance with 
international labor standards.

    Question. Since assuming office, the new administration of Gustavo 
Petro has embarked on an ambitious ``Paz Total'' or ``Total Peace'' 
plan by launching negotiations with dozens of armed groups. These are 
quite different from the talks launched in previous years with the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)--many of the groups 
participating in Paz Total, like Clan de Golfo, are literally just drug 
cartels with no other motive than the pursuit of profit. Is Colombia's 
pursuit of Paz Total with drug cartels beneficial for the safety of 
Americans?

    Answer. While the outcome of the Petro administration's 
conversations with criminal groups is uncertain and there is much 
skepticism that ``Total Peace'' is achievable, if talks lead to those 
groups disbanding and giving up drug trafficking and other criminal 
activities, the safety and well-being of U.S. citizens should improve. 
The level of violence within Colombia would presumably decrease and, so 
long as other groups do not step in to fill the void, negotiated 
agreements could result in a decrease in Colombian cocaine trafficked 
to the United States.

    Question. Has the Department raised concerns with the Petro 
administration regarding participants in the Paz Total talks?

    Answer. Yes. We have urged extreme caution in dealing with 
terrorists and narcotraffickers, especially those who seek concessions 
to allow them to continue criminal operations and seek impunity. While 
we support the pursuit of peace in Colombia and President Petro's 
desire to address ongoing threats from insurgent, terrorist, and drug 
trafficking groups, our goal remains to bring drug traffickers and 
terrorists who violate U.S. laws to justice, to avoid impunity for 
serious crime, and to reduce coca cultivation, and drug production and 
trafficking.

    Question. Do you anticipate that Colombia will not honor its 
extradition treaty obligations with the United States, as some Paz 
Total participants are demanding as part of the talks?

    Answer. To date, President Petro has not denied a single U.S. 
extradition request and approved almost 40 extraditions. We expect to 
work with Colombia to ensure that extraditions continue, to advance our 
shared law enforcement goals.

    Question. My office has received multiple requests from U.S. 
citizens whose family members are waiting for approval for their visas 
to legally travel to the United States. Since the start of the 
pandemic, the consular backlog has been a constant source of 
frustration for my constituents. What steps has the administration 
taken to alleviate this backlog of cases?

    Answer. We are focused on getting posts back to pre-pandemic 
staffing levels to eliminate immigrant visa backlogs and reduce 
nonimmigrant visa interview appointment wait times. As scheduling 
capacity at posts has increased, the National Visa Center forwards 
interview-ready-cases; posts have reduced IV scheduling backlogs by 27 
percent since July 2021. The Department uses data-driven analyses to 
help posts adjudicate visas more efficiently, schedule more applicants, 
and develop backlog-elimination plans for the posts with the largest 
pandemic-driven backlogs.

    Question. What explains the continued delay in resolving the 
backlog?

    Answer. The Department is focused on eliminating the backlog of 
interview-ready immigrant visa cases that accrued during the pandemic. 
The National Visa Center continues to schedule as many interviews as 
posts' capacities allow. The Department has dedicated significant 
resources to rebuild staffing and reduce visa backlogs and appointment 
wait times. We are focused on helping all our posts around the world 
get the tools, resources, and support they need to bring wait times 
down. We continue to see significant progress in 2023.

    Question. Honduras recently cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan 
and officially established diplomatic relations with the People's 
Republic of China. V This means that yet another country in our region 
turns its back to our democratic ally, despite Taiwan's years long 
support for development in Honduras. Earlier this year, Taiwan launched 
an education program in Honduras under the Global Cooperation and 
Training Framework jointly administered with the United States. What's 
the administration reaction to this concerning news?

    Answer. Countries make their own sovereign decisions in their 
international relationships. However, countries often find promises 
exchanged for diplomatic recognition go unfulfilled. The U.S. one-China 
policy remains unchanged. Taiwan's investments in Honduras reflected 
its lasting and sustainable commitment to the prosperity of the 
Honduran people. Taiwan is a reliable, likeminded, and democratic 
partner and all who value democracy, good governance, transparency, the 
rule of law, and economic prosperity for their people should seek to 
expand engagement with Taiwan.

    Question. How is the administration demonstrating the detrimental 
effect of this decision on Honduras?

    Answer. Special Presidential Advisor for the Americas Chris Dodd 
spoke with President Castro on March 20, and U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa 
has carried out sustained engagement to express our concern over the 
Honduran government's decision. U.S. diplomats explained the risks to 
Honduran sovereignty, transparency, accountability, and sustainable 
financing that come with partnership with the PRC. Special Presidential 
Advisor Dodd and the Embassy also underscored the many expected 
benefits from partnership with the PRC that other countries never saw 
come to fruition.

    Question. Why is Honduras invited to participate at the second 
Summit for Democracy, when it continues to mistreat American companies 
and choose to stand with the genocidal regime in Beijing?

    Answer. A Summit invitation does not imply that all aspects of a 
country's democracy are perfect. It shows commitment to partners 
willing to strengthen democratic governance. Honduras held free/fair 
elections in 2021 that led to a peaceful transfer of power. The Castro 
administration continues to express commitment to democratic 
governance. We support companies and investments that promote good 
governance and jobs and will convey our concerns about the PRC's 
troubling trade, environmental, and human rights practices with 
Honduras.

  STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS FOR 
                            FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              


                       WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met at 10:01 a.m., in room SD-138, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Christopher A. Coons (Chairman), 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Coons, Shaheen, Merkley, Murphy, Van 
Hollen, Schatz, Collins, Graham, Moran, and Hagerty.

           UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHRISTOPHER A. COONS

    Senator Coons. I call this hearing to order. Today, the 
Subcommittee on State, and Foreign Operations, Related Programs 
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, meets to review the 
fiscal year 2024 budget request, for the United States Agency 
for International Development.
    We are honored to have Administrator Samantha Power with 
us. Administrative Power, it is always an honor and a privilege 
to have you before us. We have a lot to cover. You have a lot 
going on and a lot of responsibilities, so we appreciate your 
making yourself available.
    It is unfortunate that we have two, at least two, other 
compelling hearings on similar or related topics. So please be 
understanding that a number of our colleagues intend to come in 
and out.
    I am grateful, the Vice Chair of the Full Committee, my 
friend and colleague from Maine, Susan Collins, is serving as 
the Ranking for this hearing, and will help open the hearing. I 
know that the Ranking Member of the subcommittee, Senator 
Graham, will join us in just a few minutes.
    The fiscal year 2024 request for this subcommittee's budget 
including staff and programs of, State, USAID, MCC, DFC, and 
other agencies, is in total $68.6 billion, 6.8 billion, or 11 
percent above the fiscal year 2023 enacted level, still not 
even one penny on the dollar of U.S. Defense spending. If you 
include the supplemental funding that was provided in 2023, to 
address Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the fiscal year 
2024 request would actually be a 15 percent cut over the 
overall expenditures.
    With this relatively modest funding, Administrator Power, 
you are being asked to confront an historic confluence of 
complex global challenges. A record number of refugees, and 
internally displaced persons, more than 100 million people 
forcibly uprooted. Food insecurity steadily on the rise, with 
an expected 345 million people projected to experience intense 
food insecurity this year, more than double the level just 3 
years ago. Sustained democratic backsliding, marked by 
corruption and increased repression. A global debt crisis 
amongst the poorer countries coming out of COVID-19. Economic 
competition and coercion from authoritarian actors, like the 
PRC.
    And while we continue to focus on Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine, there are many other humanitarian crises around the 
world: the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, 
and many others.
    USAID is tasked with a leading role in the U.S. 
Government's response to these many challenges, which is also 
critical to bolstering U.S. national security, our reputation, 
and our place in the world. I am grateful for the service of 
all the development professionals at USAID, who I have had the 
opportunity to visit in a dozen countries in the last few 
months.
    I am proud of the work we have done here, on a bipartisan 
basis on this Subcommittee, and Full Committee, to help you 
better grow, equip, and support USAID's workforce, to apply 
lessons learned from your predecessors, and adapt the Agency to 
strengthen locally led development, and cooperation with the 
American private sector. I know we have a lot more to do 
together.
    I look forward to hearing from you this morning about your 
proposals for how we can best leverage our development tools to 
advance our national interests, how you define those interests, 
where USAID fits in, and what you are doing to better tell the 
story, globally, of USAID's vital work.
    I will say to you at the outset what I said in our previous 
hearing to Secretary Blinken. Your task is daunting, and this 
subcommittee must both rigorously oversee your work, and ensure 
you have the support and resources you need to protect and 
advance our national security and our national values. You 
cannot be asked to do more with less.
    That is why I am encouraged by the fiscal year 2024 budget 
request for your Agency, and the rest of the State and Foreign 
Operations budget, as the challenges of our time demand bold 
investments.
    Thank you Administrator Power, for joining us. I look 
forward to your testimony.
    And I will now turn to Vice Chair Collins.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SUSAN M. COLLINS

    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Chairman Coons. I am 
delighted to join you today. As is sometimes the case in the 
Senate, there is a conflict for the Ranking Member, Lindsey 
Graham, with the Judiciary Committee hearing this morning. He 
will be attending a little later, but in the meantime he has 
asked me to help open this hearing, and serve in the role as 
Ranking Member.
    I do want to welcome Administrator Power. I know that the 
subcommittee looks forward to hearing your testimony on USAID's 
fiscal year 2024 budget request, and moving quickly to 
questions on such a wide range of issues that you deal with.
    I will have questions for you regarding the Reach Every 
Mother and Child Act, which Chairman Coons and I intend to 
reintroduce soon, along with the others in the Senate. It sets 
a goal of the Ending Preventable Maternal and Child Deaths 
through such affordable and simple practices as nutritional 
supplements, clean birthing practices, and vaccines.
    I am also eager to hear your assessment of the situation 
for women and girls in Afghanistan, which I view as dire. And 
also, your comments on recent steps the Afghan Government has 
taken to exclude women from working in international aid 
programs and for NGOs. As I look at the situation in 
Afghanistan, it appears evident that we are on the verge of 
extreme food shortages, and we all know who will be most 
affected by that, and that is women and girls.
    I also think that there is a very interesting debate on the 
best way to help people around the world who are struggling 
with hunger: Is it to provide them with food, or is it to teach 
them how to grow their own food, so that they can become more 
sustained in meeting their needs?
    So thank you, again, for being with us today. And I 
appreciate the Chairman's leadership.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Vice Chair Collins. We just spent 
several days together, thinking about, talking about, and 
debating the future of food assistance and humanitarian relief, 
and how to make that more efficient. And the opportunity to 
work with Senator Collins on the REACH Act, is something that I 
welcome.
    We now look forward to your testimony, Administrator, and 
then we will move to 5-minute rounds of questioning.
STATEMENT OF HON. SAMANTHA POWER, ADMINISTRATOR, UNITED 
            STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
    Ms. Power. Thank you so much Chairman Coons. Thank you, 
Vice Chair Collins for your leadership of the entire 
Appropriations Committee, and for filling in here today. I look 
forward to seeing Ranking Member Graham, and other Members of 
the Committee.
    But I know how important, as well, the other activities are 
that are going on here today--in a way it is a metaphor for the 
world, the State of the world. The subjects of the other 
hearings that are underway are very near and dear to my heart 
and that of the Agency.
    Look, the challenge the world faces today is clear, that 
decades of development gains that have laid the foundation for 
an era of relative peace, stability, and prosperity, are now at 
serious risk. During our lifetimes, the U.S. has played an 
absolutely critical role in accelerating tremendous progress in 
reducing extreme poverty, in fighting disease, in addressing 
hunger, and getting kids, especially girls to school, and in 
fueling democracy's rise.
    But for now, at least, many of these trends have moved into 
reverse. The pandemic decimated health systems, leading to a 
resurgence in diseases, from measles, to tuberculosis. It also 
battered many countries' finances. And after a decade of heavy 
borrowing, and more recently rising inflation exacerbated by 
Putin's war, 60 percent of the world's poorest countries are at 
or near debt distress. And this is a phenomenon that really is 
a new, exacerbating dynamic in today's world.
    Natural disasters, of course, just as here in the United 
States, are increasing in frequency and intensity, leading to a 
sharp rise in humanitarian needs. The upshot of it all, is 
stark. For the first time in decades, human life expectancy is 
on the decline. And again, that is a composite indicator of all 
of the crises that are interlocking, for the first time since 
the 1950s, life expectancy is going down globally.
    At the same time, of course, democracies are under attack. 
Our rivals are using transnational corruption, digital 
repression, disinformation, and in Ukraine, actual artillery 
and missile fire to undermine freedom, and elevate autocrats.
    It is a daunting list of challenges. And I know some 
question whether the United States should be taking on these 
challenges through our development investments, or whether the 
scope of these challenges is just too great to make a 
meaningful dent.
    But the fact is, our national security hinges on this work. 
Deprivation and indignity abroad can fuel resource competition, 
political fragility, and extremism that endanger us here at 
home. Disease outbreaks, as we well know, can cross oceans, and 
recessions in foreign markets can threaten our own economic 
growth.
    If we don't lead efforts to take on these challenges, the 
People's Republic of China and Putin are ready to step in, 
whether through opaque loans on unfavorable terms, or with 
mercenaries in tow.
    An international order that values democracy and human 
rights, and respects international borders is not a given. 
Indeed, authoritarian actors are challenging and aiming to 
reshape it. We have to invest in the stable and humane world 
that we know the American people need.
    USAID is privileged to have a leading role in tackling the 
most significant challenges of our time, in close coordination 
with our interagency partners, advancing diplomacy and defense. 
And we are very, very grateful to the American people, and to 
you, for giving us the resources to make such a difference.
    That said, we know that to drive progress on the scale we 
need, we have got to be catalytic. We have got to bring other 
donors, including non-traditional donors, we have to use our 
resources to bring in the private sector, we have to work with 
and through multilateral institutions, foundations, and local 
organizations in our partner countries.
    So USAID has set a new reform agenda aimed at delivering 
progress beyond our development programs, beyond the resources 
that you all provide. That means using our expertise, our 
convening power, our hustle, our advocacy to draw in others, to 
leverage additional resources, to spark innovation, and to 
inspire broader movements for change.
    The Biden-Harris Administration's fiscal year 2024 request 
of $32 billion for USAID's fully- and partially managed 
accounts will allow us to make more of that transformative 
impact.
    We will invest in countries experiencing democratic 
openings, helping them show that democracy delivers tangible 
economic results for citizens. We will work with nations to 
attract private sector investment, and drive broadly shared 
economic growth. We will support countries that are rebuilding 
their decimated health systems, and we will meet growing 
humanitarian needs, not just with emergency assistance, as Vice 
Chair Collins was speaking to, but longer term investments in 
resilience, and with their--in their ability to grow for 
themselves.
    And crucially, we will invest in USAID's workforce to carry 
out this ambitious agenda. Since 2019, our Operating Expenses 
funds have increased at half the rate that our programming has 
grown, giving us more to do with fewer people and resources. 
But this budget will help us invest in the people and the 
systems that we need to power an Agency that is nimble, and 
responsive, and critical for our foreign policy.
    We know that with the United States leading the way, the 
world can drive meaningful progress against our toughest 
challenges, because we have decades of gains in global health, 
in education, and in fueling prosperity to prove it. It is on 
us now to resume that progress.
    And with that, I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

    Thank you Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished 
members of the subcommittee.
    The challenge the world faces today is clear: The decades of 
development gains that have laid the foundation for an era of relative

freedom, elevate autocrats, and curry favor.
    It's a daunting list of challenges. And I know some question

grateful to the American people--and to you--for giving us the 
resources to make a major difference.
    That said, we know that to drive progress on the scale we need, we 
have to bring other donor countries, the private sector, multilateral 
institutions, foundations, and local organizations in our partner 
countries along with us.
    So USAID has set a new reform agenda aimed at delivering progress 
beyond our development programs--using our expertise, convening power, 
and advocacy to draw in others, leverage more resources, spark 
innovation, and inspire broader movements for change.
    The Biden-Harris Administration's FY 2024 request of $32 billion 
for USAID's fully- and partially-managed accounts will allow us to make 
more of that transformative impact.
    Alongside our partners, we'll invest in countries experiencing 
democratic openings, helping them show that democracy delivers tangible 
results for citizens. We'll work with nations to attract private sector 
investment and drive broadly shared economic growth. We'll support 
countries that are rebuilding their decimated health systems. And we'll

prove it. It's on us, now, to resume that progress.
    A few months ago, President George W. Bush posed a question. 
``What's the role of a great country in the world? Is it to look 
inward? Is it to think about how to solve big problems?'' As he said, 
``We all decided to work together to solve big problems.'' Let's 
continue that legacy. Thank you.

   Prepared Statement of Acting Inspector, Nicole L. Angarella, U.S. 
                  Agency for International Development
Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the Subcommittee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to provide a written statement for 
the subcommittee's hearing on USAID's fiscal year 2024 budget request. 
The USAID Office of Inspector General's (OIG) mission is to safeguard 
and strengthen U.S. foreign assistance through timely, relevant, and 
impactful oversight. We appreciate the opportunity to share our views 
on challenges facing USAID's programs and operations.
    USAID is called upon more than ever to deliver worldwide support on 
behalf of the American people. It has been the primary agency providing 
non-security assistance to Ukraine, while continuing its mission of 
providing humanitarian and development assistance in over 100 countries 
across five continents. In fiscal year 2022, USAID processed grants and 
contracts with $36.4 billion obligated through more than 22,000 
acquisition and assistance actions.
    USAID OIG's independent audits, evaluations, inspections, and 
investigations help identify USAID's current challenges in 
administering programs and operations. This statement draws from our 
annual Top Management Challenges report and aligns with our priority 
oversight areas.\1\ The following four Top Management Challenges that 
we identified for USAID in November 2022 ring true today:

    1. Establishing optimal conditions for Agency staff and programs to 
succeed;
    2. Mitigating risk in Agency operations;
    3. Countering corruption, abuse, and malign influence; and
    4. Maximizing the impact of monitoring and quality data. Each of 
these challenges is expanded upon below.

    \1\ USAID OIG, Top Management Challenges Facing USAID in Fiscal 
Year 2023, November 16, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   establishing optimal conditions for agency staff and programs to 
                                succeed
    Strategic workforce planning is a challenge for USAID and has been 
noted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) as a high-risk 
issue across the U.S. government.\2\ Our recent oversight work 
highlights constraints within USAID operations that inhibit adequate 
staffing and workforce support for humanitarian and development 
assistance programming.
    These constraints include hiring impediments, increased reliance on 
contractors, and various skills gaps among staff. USAID faces a 
critical shortage of contracting and agreement officers that adds risk 
to awards management. In addition, our work has shown that the Agency 
lacks guidance and tools for a comprehensive approach to human capital 
management and needs an effective central mechanism to track and close 
skills gaps.\3\
    USAID's reliance on short-term, limited-capacity contract staff is 
of particular concern in the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance and 
Office of Transition Initiatives.\4\ While the Agency has expanded its 
humanitarian assistance programming in recent years to respond to 
disasters and other catastrophes worldwide, USAID's staffing levels 
have not kept pace with the shift. The long-lasting nature of the 
crises these offices respond to would benefit from staffing stability 
and longer-term personnel. Still, efforts to address these staffing 
challenges are hindered by budget constraints, lack of data, and the 
absence of human capital metrics for managing contractors.
    Another aspect of strategic workforce planning is initiatives to 
improve diversity. USAID's diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility efforts aim to improve diversity in its workforce, but 
current processes do not include data on contract staff. The required 
diversity reporting only includes civil service and Foreign Service 
staff, making up just 40 percent of USAID's workforce. Capturing 
additional data could inform efforts to improve diversity in the 
Agency's workforce and cultivate more positive outcomes for its staff 
and beneficiaries around the world.
    We have provided the Agency with recommendations to improve its 
strategic workforce planning, contract staff management, and diversity 
efforts, including the need for USAID to conduct an assessment and 
develop a comprehensive plan to create a sustainable workforce. In 
response to this audit, the Agency has provided a multi-year plan to 
address our recommendations in strategic workforce planning.
                  mitigating risk in agency operations
    Our oversight work has highlighted the importance of USAID 
identifying, documenting, and responding to risks to its programming. 
This is particularly relevant as the Agency attempts to provide more 
funds through local organizations and respond to complex emergencies. 
In addition, continued vigilance is required to address risks tied to 
information technology (IT) and further supply chain management.

Responses: USAID Is Constrained by Funding Structure but Better Data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While localization remains a top priority for USAID, the pool of 
capable, eligible local partners must grow for the Agency to achieve 
its goals. For example, our recent audit of the U.S. President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) programs found that only a 
limited number of local partners were ready to implement USAID 
programs, which delayed the benefits of transitioning HIV programming 
to these partners.\5\ Bureaucratic hurdles, budget cuts in capacity 
development for local partners, and inconsistent compliance with award 
provisions are also challenges to localization efforts. In addition, 
managing risks in localization requires metrics for tracking success, 
increased staff capacity, and more oversight and support than currently 
provided via large and established international nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs).\6\
    USAID must also address risk from the outset of complex 
emergencies. Our oversight work on USAID's humanitarian responses 
highlights the need for greater attention to planning for and managing 
risks in its programming. Past audits of programming in Yemen\7\ and 
the response to the Venezuela migrant crisis\8\ found the Agency lacked 
a process to respond to diversions to sanctioned groups, environmental 
hazards, partner safety and theft, and misuse of cash assistance. Time 
and again, we have seen new and dynamic complex emergencies and 
conflict environments pose challenges for USAID, including in 
Afghanistan and recently in Ukraine, where lessons learned from 
previous complex emergencies should better prepare USAID to plan for 
continuity of operations in the complex environments in which they 
operate with small, rotational staff.
    IT and supply chain management pose other risks to the Agency that 
require further vigilance. Our previous audit work points to issues 
such as the use of unauthorized applications on mobile devices.\9\ GAO 
noted that risks of reliance on IT include attacks by foreign 
adversaries and the introduction of counterfeit products in the supply 
chain.
           countering corruption, abuse, and malign influence
    Corruption, sexual exploitation and abuse, and malign influence 
threaten to undermine USAID's objectives as it provides assistance in 
challenging environments. This is especially relevant as the Agency 
increasingly uses multi-donor mechanisms, such as UN agencies, with 
fewer safeguards than traditional assistance programming. The Agency 
can address these threats by tightening controls, strengthening 
processes that facilitate reporting of possible criminal activity, and 
ensuring accountability of Agency partners, whether NGOs, contractors, 
or multilateral organizations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Corruption and abuse by bad actors are a risk in USAID programs 
with a large outflow of assistance, such as in Ukraine. To safeguard 
programming, USAID can improve its pre-award certification process\10\ 
to capture whether prospective award recipients have engaged with 
actors sanctioned by the U.S. government for corrupt activity. In a 
recent audit, USAID made progress in mechanisms to prevent the risk of 
sexual exploitation and abuse in their development activities but has 
yet to take action on several related recommendations.\11\
    USAID increasingly relies on UN agencies and other international 
organizations to furnish assistance to beneficiaries. To date, the 
Agency has appropriated $22.9 billion in direct budget support via the 
World Bank's multi-donor trust fund to the government of Ukraine to 
support non-security general budget expenses, including salaries for 
civil servants, teachers, healthcare workers, and other government 
employees, and social spending needs, including pension expenses and 
payments to internally displaced persons. Our January and March 
evaluations found that the agreement between the World Bank and the 
Ukrainian government contained provisions enabling the World Bank to 
respond to credible and material allegations of fraud and corruption 
and to request reimbursement for expenditures that were used in a 
manner inconsistent with the grant agreement.\12\ We will continue to 
test the effectiveness of these established mechanisms.
    To ensure accountability and prevent criminal activity and abuse, 
USAID needs to improve its processes for obtaining timely and 
transparent reporting by its implementing partners, including UN 
agencies. Inconsistent and infrequent reporting of allegations of fraud 
and abuse despite increases in Agency support in high-risk areas 
indicate the need for more oversight and additional outreach to educate 
partners about reporting tools. Additionally, the Agency should take 
actions to strengthen the government's ability to prosecute foreign-
based NGOs; particularly by creating a forum consent clause in its 
awards that enhance USAID's ability to recover taxpayer funds misused 
or fraudulently obtained.\13\
    USAID also faces challenges within its programming to UN agencies. 
USAID OIG's access rights to UN documents, records, and other 
information extend only so far as USAID's contractual agreements. 
Access limitations to information held by the UN can delay or restrict 
our audit and investigative work and preclude USAID from making 
informed decisions regarding ongoing or future funding to UN agencies. 
With one quarter of USAID's program funds going to the UN World Food 
Programme, and significant funding through other UN agencies, such 
programs must be subject to oversight by my office.
    Finally, USAID is challenged to counter influence from foreign 
actors such as Russia and the People's Republic of China. From our 
audit work in countering malign Kremlin influence, we recommended the 
Agency implement a process for monitoring risks and engaging with 
relevant

    stakeholders.\14\ USAID continues efforts to counter increasing 
levels of China's influence in developing countries, given concerns of 
conflict with U.S. values. We have an ongoing audit that will assess 
the extent that the Agency has shifted programming to counter China's 
influence in Africa.
          maximizing the impact of monitoring and quality data
    Gathering, reporting, and acting on reliable data represents an 
ongoing challenge for USAID, particularly in locations with access 
limitations. Improving data quality is critical to keeping programs on 
track and ensuring top-notch, data-driven decisionmaking.
    USAID can address vulnerabilities by monitoring programming 
throughout the development lifecycle, particularly in complex operating 
environments. Monitoring helps USAID track progress towards meeting the 
development goals of its programs, but the process is constrained and 
sometimes not as effective as intended. Recent oversight work 
highlights shortfalls with third-party monitors, such as concerns with 
the quality of their products and lack of guidance on how to use their 
services. Additionally, USAID access to sites in non-permissive 
environments, such as Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq, constrains the 
capacity to monitor effectively.
    Recent audit work also illustrates the need for USAID to ensure 
reliable financial and performance data. Specifically, the reports 
noted weaknesses with reporting data to USAspending.gov and 
PaymentAccuracy.gov, and the need to take corrective action related to 
validating data between its Development Information System (DIS) and 
the State Department's foreign assistance data system.15 Additionally, 
we noted weaknesses in quality control measures in PEPFAR's data system 
in select African missions.
                        concluding observations
    As this Committee considers USAID's fiscal year 2024 budget 
request, USAID OIG remains committed to briefing Congress on its 
independent oversight of USAID's programming. Our planned and ongoing 
audits, evaluations, inspections, and investigations are designed to 
improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in USAID's 
foreign assistance programs, and deter fraud, waste, and abuse that can 
jeopardize program success. We appreciate the opportunity to provide 
this statement.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Administrator Power. Without 
objection, I am going to actually have 7-minute rounds here, 
and that means we may do one round. We will see how many 
members come back from the other hearings.
    Let me start, Administrator, if I could with a comment you 
just made about the reform agenda at USAID, with a goal I think 
I am quoting, ``To leverage resources and spark innovation.'' 
Private sector engagement is something many of us have urged 
that USAID take more seriously, engage more actively on, 
whether it is in food security, global health, conservation.
    There is, today, a huge amount of philanthropic and private 
sector funding, a big change from 50 years ago when the vast 
majority of development was direct U.S. Government grants. 
Today, we have got iconic foundations, we have got significant 
private sector investment, and many of the countries in the 
Global South would welcome U.S. private sector engagement and 
investment as much as direct assistance through USAID.
    Something the Ranking Member and I are working on, the U.S. 
Foundation for International Conservation, would leverage and 
mobilize philanthropic and private sector investment. The 
Development Finance Corporation is, of course, another way that 
we are trying to crowd in private sector investment. Your 
budget request includes some specific programs intended to 
enhance your engagement with the private sector, but I would be 
interested--sort of more broadly speaking, you are the Vice 
Chair of the DFC Board: What more could we be doing to unlock 
the DFC and to use its leveraging power?
    Give us a little more detail on this reform agenda, and 
what are the areas where you think you have been most 
successful? Where are there some lessons learned in terms of 
partnering with the private sector? What are the reasons the 
private sector might be hesitant or resistant to partner with 
USAID? And what, if any, issues are there that we could help 
address around your authorities, your staffing, culture, other 
issues?
    Ms. Power. Thank you so much. Well, I think as you and I 
have discussed, there is probably the most substantial gap 
right now, between what countries are asking for and what we 
provide is in the economic growth domain. And if you contrast, 
for example, the resources that we invest with the tremendously 
impactful PEPFAR program, where, you know, you are looking at 
billions of dollars every year, more than $6 billion, you know, 
spread across a number of countries, again, doing enormous 
good.
    Contrast that with the fairly modest investments in 
economic growth and economic development. And every time you 
travel around you hear from leaders, what do we want: we want 
to go from aid to trade, we want jobs, jobs, jobs for our 
burgeoning young populations, and so forth.
    And I think there is--I don't want to speak for everybody, 
but I think this is a broad view--a broad embrace, broad 
support for investments in economic growth, and economic 
investment in trade facilitation, in assistance right now for 
debt, you know, debt technical assistance as countries seek to 
restructure debt at very vulnerable times.
    So I don't sense a lot of opposition to this agenda, but 
because USAID now, is more than 90 percent earmarked, it 
doesn't leave a lot of give for that kind of programming, and 
there is not the same constituency for economic growth, 
economic development, trade facilitation, banging down the door 
up here, as there is for some of these other incredibly 
important programs that we have, like Feed the Future, like 
PEPFAR, et cetera.
    So I think that as we move to a progress beyond programs' 
mindset, one that also looks to bring to USAID people who have 
experience either in the private sector or working with the 
private sector, as we seek to take advantage of being the Vice 
Chair of the Board of the DFC, as we work with Treasury, for 
example, on MDB reform or evolution, to try to get more out of 
those institutions to manage, for example, agricultural 
resilience, climate resilience and the like, that USAID really 
needs to build out its capacity in this domain, and we have 
taken modest steps.
    With your support, we created this year, an EDGE Fund which 
is just $50 million, $50 million is a lot of money, but I think 
we could do a lot more in that space. EDGE is, the idea is that 
instead of looking to the private sector to do philanthropic or 
corporate social responsibility work, we are actually thinking: 
What is their comparative advantage?
    You know, are they, in fact, a bank that could provide 
microfinance to a young female smallholder farmer? Is it a 
tourism business that might go to a very underdeveloped area 
where indigenous people are living and where development gains 
are very far behind elsewhere in the country?
    But they are a little nervous that it won't be productive, 
so maybe USAID can work with that tourism operator to do the 
assessment to show that, in fact, that investment will be 
worthwhile. So modest infusions of resources in order to de-
risk, in order to provide loan guarantees, in order to do 
assessments that private sector actors that--where the barriers 
to entry may be ones that weaken lower, in essence.
    So I think this is a really exciting area for us to go, it 
is also again, probably the most aligned with where the United 
States is interested in advancing its standing, as well as it 
is stability and prosperity, it is what we are hearing the most 
about. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. I am about to run out of time, apparently. 
So I am just going to pose a second question. We will come back 
to it. I suspect others will be interested in the same topic.
    If what we hear in country after country is: we welcome 
U.S. investment, we welcome U.S. companies, we want help 
transforming our economy--the agriculture sector is one that is 
particularly critical, particularly in Africa. There is a huge 
amount of potential for future growth, but in many countries 
they are net food importers. You are requesting a significant 
amount, again for humanitarian aid, there are hundreds of 
millions of people knocking on famine's door.
    I am interested in talking at some point about Feed the 
Future, and how we strengthen its resiliency, and its Ag system 
transformation capabilities. And in Food for Peace which is 
going to be part of the Farm Bill, we have other folks who I 
suspect are also interested in the topic. But in general, I 
want us to, by the end of this hearing have had a conversation 
about the future of Feed the Future.
    I am going to defer now to my Vice Chair--the Vice Chair of 
the Full Committee, and my Ranking for this hearing, Senator 
Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to return to the issue I mentioned in my opening 
statement about the fact that millions of lives are 
unnecessarily lost each year, globally, due to preventable 
maternal and child deaths. While progress has been made in 
reducing maternal mortality rates, recent data suggests that 
these improvements are slowing.
    In response, the Chairman and I, in the last Congress, 
introduced the REACH Act, the Reach Every Mother and Child Act. 
We are going to be, shortly, reintroducing that bipartisan 
bill. It proposes critical reforms to increase the 
effectiveness and impact of USAID's maternal and child survival 
programs.
    It would require a clear, coordinated, government-wide 
strategy for ending these preventable deaths and ensuring that 
USAID focuses quickly on scaling up the highest impact, 
evidence-based interventions. I mentioned three of those: clean 
birthing practices, vaccines, and nutritional supplements. The 
bill would also require the appointment of a maternal and child 
health coordinator.
    My question is: Do you support those goals? Do you think 
legislation along the lines of the REACH Act would be helpful?
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Senator. Let me add to just something 
I said in my opening comment about debt, and the devastating 
effects of debt, just with one statistic. African countries are 
going to spend $70 billion in debt service payments this year, 
which is more than the total that they will receive in 
development assistance.
    Which, why do I mention that in the context of your 
question? That is not a non sequitur. It means that, again, 
these health systems that have been decimated by COVID, it is 
precisely on areas like maternal and child health, that we see 
that their inability now, to have the budget space to restore 
those systems, or to make more substantial investments, it is 
precisely on areas like maternal and child health where we see 
the effects on lives lost.
    In the fiscal year 2024 request, there is $910 million 
included specifically for cost-effective and proven life-saving 
interventions to strengthen delivery systems, to accelerate the 
reduction of maternal newborn and child health. This, unlike 
some areas in development, is a very gratifying one to work in 
because you really see the impact. We know what works. Your 
bill, I think speaks to much of this. It is a question of 
resourcing those investments, scaling them, getting to the 
``Last Mile'', and to more remote areas.
    I think the bill, we are very grateful to you for your 
leadership in this domain; thankful, not only for your 
introducing this legislation, but your whole career of really 
being emphasizing maternal, and child survival.
    Our Bureau for Global Health is looking at the bill. We 
think it is broadly aligned with our efforts. We are taking a 
close look at the idea of the coordinator position, sometimes 
we can layer our efforts in a way that actually slows us down, 
but we would love to just work with you and your staff to see 
this through. And you know, anything we do that deepens our 
work in a domain where we know, dollar-for-dollar that we can 
save lives in this way, is very worthwhile. So thank you.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. Turning to Afghanistan, since 
the United States' disastrous withdrawal, and the Taliban 
takeover in August of 2021, the United States has provided 
Afghanistan with an estimated $1 billion in humanitarian 
assistance through international organizations and to aid 
implementers.
    The President's budget request includes a total of $143 
million for health, education, and demining programs for 
Afghanistan. My concern is this: is that money really going to 
get to women and children?
    Senator Shaheen, Senator Ernst, and I, went to the U.N. 
shortly after the Taliban prohibited education for girls past 
the sixth grade, and believe it or not, one of the officials we 
met with said that she was shocked, shocked that the Taliban 
broke its promise. How anyone could be shocked that the Taliban 
resumed its extraordinary harsh measures against children, and 
against girls and women, is beyond me.
    But it has gotten worse since then. The Taliban issued an 
edict last year to prohibit women's participation in the 
delivery of assistance in Afghanistan, and last week took a 
step further by saying that female Afghan staffers employed 
with the U.N. can no longer report for work.
    What does all this mean for the delivery of assistance to 
women and girls in Afghanistan? Are we really going to be able 
to reach them?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, obviously our assistance 
posture in Afghanistan is radically different today, even 
before these edicts, it was radically different than it was 
when the Ghani government ran large parts of the country, or 
controlled large parts of the country.
    So we have moved, you know, much more into an emergency 
assistance posture. We are still the largest humanitarian 
donor, you know, especially with all of the investments that 
the American people, and American soldiers, and others have 
made over the years, not wanting to see full-scale famine in 
Afghanistan was a major objective of ours over the course of 
last year, and we have had broad support up here for that.
    We have worked through international partners so that the 
benefits do not accrue to the Taliban, and that the resource--
the food, particularly, goes directly to the Afghan people. But 
that is not--really, the direction of your question is on 
educational gains, on health. I think what we see with these 
edicts, it is just how unbelievably counterproductive they are, 
particularly in the health sector.
    So many of the partners that USAID and the U.S. Government 
support, rely on women to be providing health services, that is 
actually required because of Taliban laws, and so when you then 
say health--you know, females can't be health workers, what 
does that mean for health services altogether.
    So I will say this. We are in the health sector, working 
where women are still able to serve their clientele, 
enforcement and implementation of these edicts has been uneven 
across the country, so there are still provinces where we have 
been able to maintain our programs but a number of our partners 
have suspended programs because, again, they don't work without 
women actually being able to do--to perform those services.
    In the education area it is even more tortured, but we are 
ramping up our online programs for girls who are not able to 
attend school in person, and I do think that can be a major 
growth area for USAID over time.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Vice Chair Collins.
    Senator Merkley.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And welcome to you 
Administrator Power. And thank you for your assistance in 
lobbying for us to complete a trip to look at USAID programs in 
Vietnam and in Indonesia. The delegation had a powerful 
experience and I will ask a couple questions related to that.
    In Vietnam we really wanted to reinforce support for the 
Leahy programs to heal the wounds of war. And in the 
President's budget, it has a $197 million, potentially, to be 
used for remediation of dioxin. And this would really be the 
Bien Hoa Base, where there is a huge hotspot, and it is a 
massive, massive cleanup effort. And if anyone has seen the 
pictures of the mountains of barrels of Agent Orange, and how 
they leaked into the land there, would understand the 
importance of this.
    And also when we have a program for children with 
disabilities that stemmed from dioxin effects, and it is a 
moral responsibility, it is a big program. But also, later in 
the President's budget, it says that there will be $20 million 
for dioxin remediation, and it is a little confusing. Is the 
President's team planning to or proposing that we allocate $197 
million? Or proposing that we are allocating $20 million?
    Ms. Power. I would have to get back to you on those two----
    Senator Merkley. Okay. We will follow up.
    Ms. Power [continuing]. Line items in the Excel sheet, but 
certainly our investments are much more substantial than $20 
million, I mean, given that the air base that you and I both 
visited, the part that we have remediated, is a very small part 
of what we intend to remediate, we are bringing in very heavy 
machinery, it is a multi-year effort.
    So I think it is the first number, but maybe it is a 
combination. But we will get back to you.
    Senator Merkley. I really salute the administration's 
commitment to those--to the four programs: So one is the dioxin 
cleanup, one is the disabilities with children, and a third is 
continuing the demining, and the fourth is the Wartime 
Accounting Initiative, in which we bring the best data 
management and the best DNA analysis to help return martyrs to 
Vietnamese families.
    These four programs are so deeply valued in Vietnam and 
they have created a foundation for a relationship where we work 
on many other missions--other economic missions, and so forth, 
so, well done.
    It is exciting, as someone who grew up during the Vietnam 
War, to see the positive relationship that we now have with 
Vietnam, and hoping to build on that.
    I want to turn to Indonesia, the palm oil plantations and 
the coal companies are engaging in pretty steady deforestation. 
The Government doesn't really like to talk about that, and 
tells us not to worry, but there is iconic species there, 
including our very close cousins, the orangutans. And they 
could be a powerful economic development instrument for 
Indonesia, in terms of drawing the world to visit these 
amazing, amazing creatures, and ensuring that they are saved.
    And so I just want to encourage USAID who is trying to 
negotiate with Indonesian Government to secure more support for 
those programs. It has been a tough negotiation. I am hoping 
that it can be completed.
    But I want to turn to a different piece, which is the 
USAID's Climate Strategy says it seeks to promote a safe and 
secure political environment for indigenous peoples, human 
rights, and environmental defenders. We have seen more and more 
environmental defenders slaughtered across the globe, 1,733 
environmental defenders killed in the last decade.
    And how do we actually weigh in, in a positive way, to 
enhance safety for environmental defenders?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. And just on your first point about 
the orangutan in Indonesia. I mean, this is something USA tries 
to do in every country. If we see, and do a market analysis 
about tourism potential, particularly as a way of diversifying 
economies that are often dependent on particular commodities, 
or resources, or services, we leap, and I think that you have 
given a great example of that.
    I think we are working on the MOU with the Ministry, I 
think that you all might have met with on your trip. It is not 
there yet. It has been a little bit bureaucratic and a little 
bit slower than it should be, given the opportunity and the 
need to conserve that population. But we are on it.
    On environmental defenders, couldn't agree more. The trend 
lines are devastating. I think, as you see, the environmental 
movement gain even more traction, globally, and more and more 
people want to defend the land, want to conserve nature; that 
poses a threat to people who are often well armed, and well 
resourced in their own right.
    All I can really say is that, depending on the country, we 
sometimes have dedicated Human Rights Defender funds under 
which environmental defenders would fall, because sometimes it 
is not just physical threats, but also legal injunctions, and 
so forth.
    Our diplomacy here is key, the work that INL does with 
court systems, often in partnership with USAID is key, when you 
have judicial integrity, when you have legal systems that work, 
then that is when you actually see a deterrent to this kind of 
vigilante violence against people who are standing up for 
nature. But needless to say, again, the rule of law in so many 
of the countries in which we work lags far behind what it needs 
to be. And so those environmental defenders are taking their 
lives into their own hands in some cases, and there is not the 
punishment and the accountability that is needed for them to 
feel security in many countries in the work that they do. And 
that is also true in this hemisphere, obviously in Brazil, in 
Central America, and beyond.
    Senator Merkley. I have submitted a request for this budget 
to include some dedicated funds for supporting folks who 
advocate for, and support environmental defenders, we are just 
trying to understand better how it can be most effective.
    I have a lot of other questions. It is a big, complicated 
world, and there is a million programs USAID is involved in, 
but so I will just use my remaining seconds to note on the 
orangutan front.
    The more you know about their behavior, the more you feel 
connected to them. They spend 8 years raising their children; 
which is extraordinary in the world of animals, they have 
powerful mothering instincts. I remember the first time I saw 
an orangutan it was leaning against a wall looking up and 
holding its hand up, and spotting its baby that was just 
learning to climb, and making sure that if the baby fell she 
would catch it.
    And there have been so many powerful stories about our 
cousins, the orangutans, and we cannot be the last generation 
that sees them having a real life in real forests, and so I 
keep hoping we can work closely with Indonesia to seize that 
responsibility for the human race. And thank you for all the 
great work USAID does.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Merkley.
    Ranking Member Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you. I think the best thing we can do 
to help the orangutans is make sure they don't watch cable news 
to change all of their instincts. So count me in for helping 
the orangutans.
    Senator Merkley. We will pass that on to the researchers.
    Senator Graham. Very good.
    Senator Merkley. So thank you.
    Senator Graham. How many people are receiving some form of 
food assistance due to food insecurity in the world; do you 
know, Ms. Power?
    Ms. Power. At this moment I am not going to venture an 
answer to that.
    Senator Graham. Well, I have that number.
    Ms. Power. Your staff is better--better than me.
    Senator Graham. It is not a trick. There are 345.2 million 
people that participate in some food program because of food 
insecurity. That number has doubled since 2020. And I have my 
friend from Kansas next to me, and they know how to grow food 
in Kansas, for sure.
    Senator Coons and I really want to get ahead of this 
problem. Do you believe the Global Fund has been effective in 
combating AIDS and malaria?
    Ms. Power. It has been effective, sir.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Would you be willing to entertain a 
public-private partnership akin to the Global Fund for food 
security, where we bring the best and brightest minds 
throughout the world to work with our government and hopefully 
others, to increase food production? This would not be the 
World Food Program, but a more focused approach to increase 
food production in unstable regions.
    Ms. Power. I think, Senator, you and I have talked about 
this a little bit, and would love to go into a more detailed 
discussion with you. In principle, more resources, yes, in 
principle, private sector involvement at a scale that we don't 
yet see, absolutely for it.
    Senator Graham. Okay.
    Ms. Power. But if I could just--you know, we do have a 
number of multilateral funds for food that exist that Treasury 
mans.
    Senator Graham. Are they working?
    Ms. Power. Yes. I mean, here what--yes, in fact. I think 
working, but when one looks and sees so many hungry people, and 
when one looks and sees, what I think we would all agree, is an 
overweighting of resources toward emergency food assistance, 
instead of food security resilience which is what you are 
getting at.
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power. Yes, but----
    Senator Graham. Why has it doubled since 2020?
    Ms. Power. Well, I don't think it is a question of there 
not being a global fund, there is a set of factors that depend 
on----
    Senator Graham. No. No. I am saying: Why has the problem of 
food insecurity doubled? Why are there 345 million people 
needing food assistance? That is twice what it was in 2020.
    Ms. Power. Well, first of all, there is more conflict 
happening in the world since the end of the Cold War. The 
second, we are coming out of a once-in-a-century, if not more, 
pandemic. Third, the intensity of climate shocks, and so forth, 
and our resources are not keeping up. I mean our Feed the 
Future----
    Senator Graham. That is my point.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham. What I want the Committee to understand, 
and Senator Coons has been a great partner on this, we have a 
crisis in the world that is really challenging to put your arms 
around. You know, there are more people receiving food 
assistance because they can't feed themselves than exist in the 
United States as a whole.
    It has doubled since 2020, and it is going to double again. 
So what I would like to do with Senator Coons, in a bipartisan 
fashion, is to add capability we don't have today, and tap into 
the private sector--there are so many bright minds thinking 
about how to improve crop yields in different parts of the 
world that could go to unstable regions, fragile states.
    What I want is a global food security program that has 
metrics. In 5 years how much can we increase production in 
Zambia? Just pick your own country and have a focus of where we 
can set metrics for ourselves and try to achieve them; that we 
use private-public money; and we have more flexibility, more 
like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the U.S. 
International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), and the 
Global Fragility Act.
    The one thing I am proud of in this Committee is that we 
have put new programs on the table that are more metric based. 
Has the MCC been a successful program?
    Ms. Power. Absolutely.
    Senator Graham. The DFC?
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham. The Global Fragility Act.
    Ms. Power. We are working on it----
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power [continuing]. Its implementation, yes.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Okay. That is right. ``We are working 
on it.'' So what this Committee has done... and I want to thank 
you for your leadership, and I want to thank everyone at 
USAID,--you are literally doing the Lord's work--and it is 
national security in another form. But in the food insecurity 
space--somebody asked Elon Musk: Would you give a billion 
dollars to the World Food Program? And he said: Will that solve 
world hunger? No.
    But I can tell Mr. Musk: If you and some of your friends 
came up with some cash, and if we created a global food 
security fund, it would make a lot of difference. We could 
conduct research at Oxford University, at the Universities of 
Kansas, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and come up with an 
approach that is focused on the most vulnerable areas, 
particularly in Africa, and set metrics and use private-public 
money--get partners throughout the world to participate--and 
drive to better food production. Does that make sense to you?
    Ms. Power. It does. If I may, though, make just a plea as 
well, for bilateral programs. You see those on your travels, in 
an age where the PRC is coming in and causing countries to 
incur future debt----
    Senator Graham. It is not exclusive, yes, we can----
    Ms. Power. But given that resources do not seem to be 
expanding at the pace of food insecurity, except in the 
emergency area.
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power. What you are talking about is much more 
fundamental, and much more important in the long run, which is 
these investments in people's own ability to grow, unless the 
pie gets bigger, you are going to see something that is a 
global public good come at the expense, potentially, of some of 
the bilateral programs.
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power. So that is what I would love to work with you 
on, making sure that doesn't happen.
    Senator Graham. The bottom line is that the bilateral 
approach needs to be supplemented with something new because it 
is not working. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria worked, right?
    Ms. Power. But look at the difference between the 
investments that the United States has made in the global 
health domain, versus those in food. If we would wish to 
increase our investments, I assure you, even bilaterally, we 
could bring about far more substantial results.
    Senator Graham. Yes. But what I am saying is----
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. I would like to leverage our 
money.
    Ms. Power. Yes, I am for leveraging it too----
    Senator Graham. And I would like the Global Fund approach--
--
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Because it just wasn't all 
American dollars.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Contributions to the Global Fund came from 
the public sector and other countries. So what I want to do is 
create a global food security fund, modeled after the Global 
Fund, so we can get other countries helping us and helping 
people who are literally starving. We can get the private 
sector more involved, not less involved, and we can get 
outcomes that we can measure.
    So Mr. Chairman, no matter what happens the next election, 
who is in charge of this place, I want to try to get everybody 
on this Committee working together--and working with the Biden 
administration, private sector organizations, and academic 
institutions throughout the world--to establish the 
infrastructure this year or early next year for a global food 
security fund. If we don't do something, the 345 million can 
double in the next 4 or 5 years.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. If I could just respond to the 
Ranking Member; I agree with you that we need to get ahead of 
this problem, we need to strengthen productivity in the 
agricultural sector and employment in the agricultural sector. 
In the countries you and I recently visited, in Niger, in Cote 
d'Ivoire, in Botswana, South Africa, in Zambia, in particular, 
we have real potential.
    Feed the Future, which has expanded from 12 to 20 
countries, I think deserves a deep dive from us. There are 
other organizations the FAO, the World Food Program, AGRA. I 
think Feed the Future and finding a way to create a fund that 
helps incentivize agricultural transformation of systems, 
comparable to what we have accomplished through PEPFAR, are 
well worth an additional meeting, conversation, or even a 
hearing. We will see.
    Thank you, Administrator.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Power, great to see you. Let me start by 
thanking you your team, both in Washington and your team 
overseas, for all your good work. I know Senator Merkley 
mentioned to you our recent trip to Vietnam and Indonesia. 
Thank you for your trip, not that long ago, to Vietnam to 
reinforce our support for many of the War Legacy programs that 
Senator Leahy championed when he served on this Committee and 
in the Senate, including at Bien Hoa Air Force, and I know you 
were you were there.
    One of the things that came up in our meetings in Indonesia 
was the fact that we are trying to finalize this report to help 
assist with our biodiversity efforts, to prevent deforestation, 
which of course contributes to global climate change. And there 
was an agreement, as you know, which is being finalized. I know 
there are some issues on the Indonesian side. They did tell us 
that the agreement was also in your office awaiting your sign 
off. So I just wanted to get an update from you as to where 
that was, on our side, with respect to your sign off?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. It is in my office awaiting my sign 
off. That is my update. But nothing like a trip to Capitol Hill 
to focus the mind. So I think that it is more working through 
with the Indonesians. You know, I think there is some 
bureaucracy, and some permissions on that side. I don't think 
that we are holding it back. But I will get on this and get 
back to you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Right, it wasn't clear. 
There seemed to be a dance. And we just want to make sure that 
we are doing our part. So thank you for your efforts there.
    Let me also applaud you and the Biden administration for 
your help in providing human rights and other assistance to 
folks in the West Bank in Gaza under very, very difficult 
circumstances.
    I did want to ask you about a proposed law that is being 
discussed by the new very right-wing, extreme government, 
including by some of the most extreme members of that 
government, which is to essentially apply a very big tax to 
contributions from foreign governments to NGOs. Obviously some 
of the assistance that we provide flows through NGOs.
    I just want to quote to you from a Haaretz article, as to 
the impact that it would have. I am quoting Michael Sfard, who 
is human rights lawyer, an Israeli, there saying, quote, ``If 
this section passes, it will be a fatal blow to the human 
rights community in Israel.'' And points out that similar 
measures had been taken in other countries, where the United 
States has been strongly critical of efforts of other countries 
to clamp down on these kind of NGOs that do work in civil 
society.
    Number one, are you aware of this pending proposal? And 
two, does it concern you? And if so, have you communicated your 
concerns?
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Senator. I would say a couple things. 
I mean, first I think we have seen in recent weeks just the 
vibrancy of civil society, we have seen other things as well, 
very worrying developments including an uptick, a very 
significant uptick in violence, but NGOs are a critical part of 
the fabric of that that part of the world. We have seen NGO 
laws, so-called, all around the world and, you know, these 
are--this is part of a broader phenomenon of not ``rule of 
law'', but ``rule by law''.
    And it can deter. It can make operating in a country 
financially prohibitive. NGOs in Israel have raised their 
concerns about what this would mean, along the lines of what 
you have just described. And Ambassador Nides, I know has 
engaged on this in Israel. So you know, at this point I don't 
an update on the progress or the status of those laws, but we 
very much believe that a civil society able to operate is going 
to make for a healthier and more stable democracy over time.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, as you know, the U.S. Government, 
the Biden administration, has spoken out strongly when other 
countries attempt to pass laws that clamp down on civil 
society, including through NGOs. So I know Ambassador Nides is 
aware of this. Since a lot of our assistance flows through 
USAID, I would just ask that you also communicate your concerns 
to our counterparts in the Government of Israel. Can you do 
that?
    Ms. Power. Yes, sir.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that. Now, let me ask you 
about--I know one of our long-term objectives, and one of your 
personal objectives, has been to make more of our assistance 
accessible, equitable, and responsive, including going to local 
partners.
    More and more effort to transfer assistance to those who 
are on the ground, so that we can have a sustainable effort, so 
that at some point in time, obviously, we don't want AID to 
having to be, you know, continuing funding the same programs 
over and over, we want to build capacity of local partners.
    And I know that you have set a goal of 25 percent of 
USAID's funding going to local partners by 2025. I know it is 
an ambitious goal. I think in fiscal year 2021 it was 7 
percent, that is the baseline. So either now, or in follow-up, 
if you could just provide us with an update on how we are doing 
in achieving your goal?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. I know we don't have a lot of time. I 
would say we are, this year, going to be at 10.2 percent, that 
is a very small number compared to the 89.8 percent on the 
other side--let me not do the math--but it is 90 percent. But 
it is a 38 percent increase in investments in local 
organizations.
    You might say: Why can't we just turn a switch and change 
the way we do things? Working with USAID is hard, compliance 
with some of the requirements that come from here, that come 
from our own desire to stamp out and ensure we don't have 
fraud, waste, or abuse, requires lawyers, it requires 
infrastructure, sometimes accounting firms, contracts can run 
100-150 pages long.
    So we are trying to lower those barriers to entry, 
streamline our processes while not in any way sliding our 
compliance obligations. And so that is one of the reasons we 
have been so grateful for the staffing increases as we 
replenish our workforce, as we hire more contracting officers, 
we will have more people to work side by side, with these local 
organizations to get those numbers up toward our 25 percent 
target by 2025.
    I will also say that we have set a 50 percent target by the 
end of the decade, to be co-designing, co-evaluating, in a 
sense where, you know, even if the money isn't going directly 
to a local contracting partner or local grantee, there are 
still all kinds of ways where we can, you know, change the 
power dynamics, and really be following the lead of people who 
know best in the communities in which we work. So I want to 
keep an eye, again, on making progress in both directions.
    Senator Van Hollen. Okay. Thank you.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Administrator, at some point I am going to slip out to the 
PEPFAR hearing, that being such a significant part of the work 
that we do together, but I will return for the rest of this, if 
I can.
    Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you.
    Administrator, thank you for your presence this morning; I 
would reinstitute an invitation, in fact we came close to 
having a visit together to Kansas, and I would re-up that in 
your world. We would love to show you certainly things about 
production agriculture, but Feed the Future is a significant 
component of our university system, and we would welcome you to 
our State.
    I want to highlight just a couple of things and then ask a 
question. You indicated the importance, in the conversation 
with Senator Graham, about bilateral, and you also mentioned in 
your testimony about the desire of many countries to have a 
trade agreement or trade relationship with us. I would 
encourage you within the Biden administration, to encourage the 
Biden administration to be interested in trade agreements with 
countries.
    And we are we are not negotiating around the globe, and 
that long-term relationship in an economic trading circumstance 
has significant value, and value beyond food aid, and in some 
ways value beyond sustainability within that country. So just 
an opportunity for me to use this moment to highlight, perhaps 
to my colleagues, but to whoever is listening that we need to 
negotiate around the globe, for agreements to trade with 
countries, and even in a bilateral, if not a multilateral 
fashion.
    Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine of course 
was a key supplier, and met many of the needs, particularly in 
Africa and Asia, in food supply, I wanted to check in with you 
and find out what you could tell me about the Black Sea Grain 
Initiative, and what its status is. Is Russia abiding by it? Is 
Turkey helpful? What is the United States doing?
    And in the circumstance we find ourselves in with this lack 
of Ukrainian and Russian grain, any suggestions that you would 
provide to me into the subcommittee for how we can best promote 
and encourage the opportunity for American farmers and ranchers 
to help fill that gap? And--I will leave it there. And then I 
have one follow-up.
    Ms. Power. Thank you so much. So first let me say that what 
we are--and on your first comment: that USAID is very active, 
notwithstanding maybe the absence of a Free Trade Agreement, 
there is still a lot of trade going on, both vis-a-vis the 
United States, and regionally in many of the countries we work. 
And we do think there is still a ton to do in the area of trade 
facilitation. And that is one of the components of the economic 
growth and economic development initiative that we are trying 
to spearhead at USAID.
    And I think there is also a whole set of questions about 
the enabling environment, the regulatory environment, deeper 
bureaucratization, that would make it easier, and more 
attractive for whether American agricultural companies, or 
others in the private sector to invest. And so I do think USAID 
can be doing a lot more in that domain, and that will benefit 
American businesses, including agribusinesses.
    With regard to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, you know, 
signed back in July of 2022, I would say it is a mixed picture. 
It is the fact that it has basically freed the 20- to 25 
million metric tons of grains that were backed up at that time, 
has been incredibly helpful to the other countries, like 
Somalia, Egypt, Lebanon, that are dependent on grain from 
Ukraine.
    We just have a shipment going from Ukraine, in fact I think 
it arrived yesterday, or it will arrive today, to Yemen. Just a 
reminder again of Ukraine as the breadbasket of the world. The 
fact that Putin is not only killing Ukrainians, but weaponizing 
food for developing countries, is just a complete outrage. I 
think Turkey's diplomatic role, the UN's Diplomatic role was 
pivotal. We, of course, supported it behind the scenes. The 
voices from leaders in the Global South proved pivotal with 
Putin as well. I think that pressure from the Global South.
    And you now see, as you probably know better than anybody, 
you know, cereal price is down, I think for the fifteenth 
straight month. And you know, that there are many factors to 
that, but certainly getting more grain on the open market is 
going to be better for food inflation, writ large.
    Right now, Russia is saying that it only agreed to a 60-day 
extension, they are saying that publicly. We are hopeful that 
the agreement will proceed, as it is meant to, there really 
should be an infinite extension that should not be time bound. 
This is about food that needs to get to Hungry people all 
around the world.
    The last thing I would say, Senator, is USAID launched 
something called AGRI-Ukraine, that I am incredibly proud of, 
which is basically about expanding storage capacity, getting 
seeds to farmers, getting micro loans to farmers to replace 
equipment that might have been destroyed, but also enhancing 
use of rail, road, the Danube, to also be more diversified in 
terms of exports, and the means of export.
    So it isn't at all a solution, because the Black Sea is 
where material and commodities move at scale. But I do think, 
you know, on the--at the end of this war, Ukraine is going to 
end up much more integrated by road, rail, and river, than it 
would have been, had Putin not put in place this blockade. So 
this idea of building back better and greater resilience in the 
long term, I think is very important.
    Senator Moran. That raises--that at least reminds me of 
my--the most recent visit to Poland to take a look at Ukraine, 
and the Ukrainian plea was for support of infrastructure to get 
grain moving in other directions as you, I think, are 
describing. And secondly, the need for diesel fuel to get their 
equipment to be able to operate in to plant, and to harvest.
    And I don't know whether USAID is involved in assisting in 
the actual production and harvesting of crops in Ukraine, but 
you are shaking your head, yes, and it is encouraging.
    The final point I would make is, we have a new Ambassador, 
Ambassador McCain to the World Food Program. We wish Ambassador 
Beasley well, who I think did an exceptionally fine and 
wonderful job, a great human being. Is there anything that is 
changing in the relationship between USAID and the World Food 
Program, as a result in the change of leadership?
    Ms. Power. USAID is WFP's largest funder, thanks to you we 
are--I have already been in touch with Cindy last week and will 
again this week. Tragically, three WFP aid workers were 
murdered in Sudan with the latest outbreak of violence. And, 
you know, we look forward to having just the kind of 
relationship we had with Ambassador McCain as we did with 
Executive Director Beasley.
    I don't think we can say enough about the job that he did. 
Senator Graham mentioned the doubling of hungry people just in 
the last couple years. Well, this Congress stepped up, 
heroically, with these Ukraine supplementals and with the 
flexibility in those supplementals to be able to reach people 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Anybody who was indirectly affected by 
the Ukraine War, we were able to use some of those supplemental 
resources to reach.
    And I just, you know, will remain permanently grateful, 
forevermore, to David Beasley for his--for the relationships he 
built up here, the advocacy, and the partnership that we had, 
and we expect it to be just as strong with Ambassador McCain. 
Thank you.
    Senator Moran. We share that view of Ambassador Beasley, 
and we hope that is exactly the same with Ambassador McCain.
    Ms. Power. Should be, yes.
    Senator Moran. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Power. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Moran.
    And I will join those comments. I just had a chance to be 
with David Beasley, along with the Vice Chair, the group of us 
who spent last week looking at food security--this is a 
daunting prospect this year, humanitarian relief, sustaining it 
is going to be challenging, and then improving food systems to 
meet these needs. So I look forward to working with you, 
Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Related and not lengthy, is the drought 
situation across the grain producing portions of the United 
States of America. We have tremendous challenges. A farmer 
yesterday in the office: one-tenth of one-inch of rain in the 
last 223 days. And it is not just isolated, it is broad, and it 
has another consequence to our ability to feed the world.
    Senator Coons. We do have real challenges. I look forward 
to working with you on them.
    Senator Schatz. And I will return after going to the PEPFAR 
Hearing.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Chair Coons.
    Administrator Power, thank you for being here; thank you 
for your good work; I am glad to see more foreign assistance 
invested in the Pacific Islands, and look forward to hearing 
about the work that you plan to do with the larger program 
budget and more U.S. Government facilities in the region.
    But I do notice that the administration's roughly $80-
million fiscal year 2024 request for the Pacific Islands is far 
short of the appropriated amount from fiscal year 2023. Why did 
you request so much less than we appropriated in the last 
fiscal year?
    Ms. Power. Well, I mean certainly the direction that the 
President has sent is: more, more, more. We are trying to 
leverage our resources given the scarcity, globally, and given, 
you know, just what was just described in terms of drought, and 
in the case of the Pacific, of course, it is flooding and 
extreme weather events, more than drought. So we are opening up 
a mission in Fiji, reopening a mission in September probably. 
We are surging our staff presence in Papua New Guinea.
    And we have programs like the Climate Ready Program which, 
basically, allows us to help those countries apply, for 
example, for Green Climate Fund money, work with the DFC, and 
the MDBs, and others. So my understanding of our requests, as 
it relates to the Pacific is that it is more substantial than 
what you have just described, more than $122 million.
    But it may be that I am combining our climate requests, and 
that some of the money is coming into that rather than just our 
bilateral, but coming together, certainly we are going to end 
up with a much more--with, I think it is a 40 percent increase 
from where we were a year ago.
    Senator Schatz. So is it 80, or is it 100 or----
    Ms. Power. I will have to get back to you. I am not 
familiar with that number, but it may be again, that we are 
amalgamating our climate investments----
    Senator Schatz. Yes. And as you know, I am all for climate 
spending.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But helping people to apply for other money 
is a little bit different. I guess the question I have is: Is 
this just a question of finite resources available for a very 
challenging program, or are there problems with the ability of 
our Pacific Island friends and neighbors to expend the money 
responsibly; is that the issue?
    Ms. Power. As you know, that we work through implementing 
partners in the countries in which we work, so partly, it is 
that you can't go from 0 to 60, or from, you know, 30 to 120 
overnight. But you know, we also need the--we are building the 
staff on the ground. A lot of the Pacific Island countries, 
USAID doesn't have any presence at all, so we have to hire 
local staff, Foreign Service Nationals, at the very least, 
which we are in the process of doing. We manage all these 
programs right now out of the Philippines. So some of it is 
that it is--you know, it is not going to be----
    Senator Schatz. Throughput capacity problem?
    Ms. Power. Yes. The human capacity, but I wouldn't diminish 
the climate-ready approach, because I think that is why we are 
working with Australia, and New Zealand, Japan, other countries 
that are also surging investments, because if we can build out 
the capacity of the governments themselves, there are 
resources, at scale, available, there are private-sector 
partnerships, available, but without that staffing capacity, or 
human capacity, that ability to put forward a bankable project 
or a bankable deal, these countries are not going to be able to 
compete.
    Senator Schatz. Right.
    Ms. Power. So I actually think that program is very 
important.
    Senator Schatz. Let me move to telehealth; and I have a 
rather complicated question, but I am going to simplify it for 
you. What is going on with telehealth? You and I have had 
multiple conversations about telehealth, there is not a mention 
of it in your budget testimony, which I yes I am not trying to 
``gotcha you'' here.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But I would like to be reassured that we 
are moving forward. And I do, I am deeply sympathetic to the 
idea that you wake up every morning and telehealth sounds like 
a longer lead time item, a less urgent item than the 350-odd 
million people who are experiencing food insecurity. So I get 
that.
    However, we have seen a revolution in telehealth that that 
really does leverage the Federal taxpayer dollar, as well as 
private sector resources, and it seems to me in far-flung, 
places you can really provide high quality care for a lower 
cost, if we make the investment, and it is sort of never the 
right time to do these investments because there is always 
something more urgent on deck.
    So can you just sort of tell me where we are with 
telehealth, and how you sort out the immediate and urgent 
versus the long term, and sort of theoretically smart thing to 
do.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But given your day-to-day, it sort of--it 
may get pushed off your calendar every week.
    Ms. Power. Thank you. I think the last time we had an 
exchange on this, I pivoted a little bit to talking about 
health workers, and investments in health workers, and that 
seemed unresponsive I gather. But part of what is true about 
USAID's work in the global health area is that by virtue of 
earmarks, we are disease-based, by and large, in our 
orientation.
    That is we have our PEPFAR allocation, we have our HIV/AIDS 
allocation, we have our TB allocation, we have our malaria 
allocation, we have our Global Health Security, mercifully, 
that has gone up in terms of pandemic preparedness. So what we 
need to do is we need to integrate attention to telehealth 
across these kinds of programs, and that is what Atul Gawande, 
you know, again where appropriate, who is our Global Health 
leader at USAID, is working to do.
    But as well, we are shifting in order to have more of an 
emphasis on primary health systems, including healthcare worker 
training, who are the foundation for all of this. Now, to be 
more responsive, let me say that I will give you a couple 
examples of things that we are actually doing in telemedicine 
already. In the Middle East and North Africa we have just 
launched a program where, in circumstances where stigmatized 
populations may not feel comfortable coming into a health 
facility, we are piloting our program, for example, for LGBTQI+ 
individuals who might be stigmatized to be able to secure 
online health care, or online consultation. It is just a pilot. 
It is not at scale. We are not there yet.
    Second, in order to do digital health, you know, a lot of 
the areas we work are super remote, don't have 5G, don't have 
the--you know, everyone has a smartphone, or a cell phone at 
the very least, but we also have what is called the digital--
USAID's Digital Health Vision, which is creating digital 
health-enabling environments that are kind of a precursor for 
being in a position to actually have health workers care for 
patients, or at least consult with patients online.
    So I hope, next time I see you at a hearing, that I will 
have more to report, but I think mainstreaming this through 
our, what amounts to, again, highly earmarked disease-based, 
very important life-saving programming is where we need to take 
this next.
    Senator Schatz. Yes. I understand this is hard, but the one 
thing I would add for your--or the people who run these various 
programs is, they don't actually have to invent or curate 
something brand new now, telehealth is all across the country, 
all across the planet. Hospital systems are doing it, 
healthcare systems are doing it. And so they don't need to 
invent anything at all, they just need to adopt what is already 
occurring, and systems, and software, and training, already 
exists for telehealth, so it is no longer a mystery on how to 
integrate it into an existing program. And that is what we are 
going to need to do. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Senator Schatz.
    And welcome, Ambassador, it is good to see you again. A 
couple of points to cover with you today, Ambassador Power; 
first, I would like to just start out with a point of concern 
that I have regarding USAID funding to Palestinian 
organizations that foment hate, that celebrate terrorism, and I 
would like to come back to a GAO report, that in March 2021, 
found significant gaps in USAID's counterterrorism vetting of 
Palestinian groups.
    USAID agreed with the report's recommendation, and agreed 
to address the shortcomings there. I just wanted to ask you: 
what steps you have taken to implement the GAO's 
recommendations, and to ensure that USAID funds don't go to 
support the activity of Palestinian terrorist groups, or anti-
Semitic organizations?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, we take very seriously our 
stewardship of taxpayer resources, and the generous allocations 
that you all have made to USAID. We have very elaborate vetting 
systems in place, including working with an FBI-run terrorism 
center to run through all the databases to make sure no 
connection between the organizations that we are considering 
funding and, you know, terrorism or terrorists.
    You know, I think if you have something specific in mind, 
which it sounds like you might, happy to talk about it 
specifically.
    In terms of additional measures put in place we now, as you 
know, USAID often works through a contractor, and then a 
subcontractor, and sometimes there is a sub to the sub. In this 
region we also run our subs to the subs, you know, through this 
third layer of verification to make sure, again, no extremist 
or terrorist affiliation.
    Senator Hagerty. I do think we can do better. I have got a 
couple of examples I would like to share with you and perhaps 
we can get them addressed. USAID has awarded a grant to a 
Palestinian group, whose leaders have attended an anniversary 
event celebrating the founding of a terrorist group. USAID has 
ordered a grant to a Palestinian group whose leaders praised 
the murderer of the U.S. Military attache, called that 
murderer, ``a hero fighter''. We are funding them.
    USAID has awarded a grant to a Palestinian group whose 
Board Members have publicly lauded convicted terrorists as 
heroes, and applauded the missile attacks on Israel by Hamas. 
Again, these are areas where I can't imagine you would be 
supportive of it, but I hope that we can take a deeper dive and 
a more critical look.
    Ms. Power. Let me just get on the record in condemning and 
deploring comments, and actions like that in the strongest 
terms. And if you, again, could come back to us and we could 
talk about this in detail. I can describe our system in detail, 
walk you through the process, and then we can talk about those 
specific organizations and what might be afoot.
    Senator Hagerty. Yes. It is the vetting process that I am 
concerned about. I feel like the vetting process remains 
seriously flawed. A couple of other activities that, November 
2022, USAID announced a $78,000 grant to a Palestinian activist 
group, it is called the Community Development and Continuing 
Education Institute. Their leaders have done all the things 
that we talked about just a moment ago.
    Terrorist glorification of USAID-funded Palestinian 
institutions at schools, and other organizations, it is just, 
it is happening, and it needs to come to an end. And I 
appreciate your focus on that. Specifically, Section 7039(b) of 
the annual SFOPS Appropriations, all mandates that USAID take 
appropriate steps to ensure that foreign assistance is not 
provided to any individual or entity that has a principal 
officer who has advocated for terrorism. So it is happening, 
and I think there are opportunities to do better here.
    And let us turn now, to the broader approach that AID takes 
to development. In my view, I think we really need to talk 
about getting back to basics. I have traveled and visited with 
leaders in developing countries. They are struggling 
significantly right now to overcome the impact of the COVID-19 
shutdowns. Their economies are struggling, crime is through the 
roof in many of these countries, they are seriously challenged.
    And as I ask myself: What are we doing to alleviate global 
poverty, particularly in these situations? What are we doing to 
put these countries on a pathway to some sort of sustainable 
economic growth? I see a real disconnect between what I feel 
like these countries need, and what we are doing.
    And what I would like to refer to is this Climate Strategy 
Program that has been put out by USAID. It seems to be matters 
that are focused on issues that are not the priorities of these 
countries. I think about the best and highest use of our 
taxpayer dollars to help these countries where they are today.
    And I find myself really scratching my head about what this 
document calls for. We specifically have included in this 
document using U.S. taxpayers to address--I am going to use a 
few quotes here, ``The growing importance of young people 
suffering from eco-anxiety.'' And I just wondered, if you 
support using U.S. taxpayer funds to alleviate climate anxiety 
among foreign children activists.
    Ms. Power. Well, first let me say that--I am not sure if 
you were here when we had--I had with Chairman Coons, an 
exchange about the demand signal we get from other countries 
around economic growth and economic development, including 
agricultural development, which you and I have talked about in 
the past.
    Senator Hagerty. Mm-hmm.
    Ms. Power. That and climate adaptation resourcing are the 
number one and number two asks, often in competition with each 
other, and often related since economies around the world are 
being so threatened, and in some cases decimated, including 
agricultural economies, by extreme weather events, along the 
lines of what Senator Moran was talking about here in the 
United States.
    Senator Hagerty. Climate anxiety by children though. I 
mean, I am trying to get to the best----
    Ms. Power. Well, I mean, we are not talking about--we are 
not talking about, yes, first of all the balance of our 
resources goes, for example, to help health clinics get 
electrified in places where they are getting to leapfrog other 
forms of energy. We are talking about, again, adaptation, 
climate adaptation, seeds that are drought resistant, drip 
irrigation systems that can work in light of. So the lion's 
share of our funding, again, is going to help countries adapt. 
And the demand signals are coming from them.
    Senator Hagerty. And to, because I am running out of time--
--
    Ms. Power. If I may, just on--just because you talked about 
that single program; if I may say, again, the investment in 
something like that would be extremely modest, but we are not--
this threat is existential for many of the communities in which 
we are working. So it actually is the case that when 
pastoralists can no longer raise livestock, we are seeing 
massive spikes in suicide, if you can believe it. In those 
families, in the Horn of Africa, 9 million livestock have died. 
What do those pastoralists do, who have been doing that for 
generations?
    Senator Hagerty. My suggestion is, we focus on how we help 
the pastoralists directly, rather than trying----
    Ms. Power. Well, I think we----
    Senator Hagerty [continuing]. To fight this with some 
psychiatric program.
    Ms. Power [continuing]. Well, we also don't want them to 
commit suicide in the meantime.
    Senator Hagerty. Absolutely, we don't want them to do that, 
but focus on the basics.
    Ms. Power. Right. So actually, working with communities who 
are suffering life and death consequences of climate change, it 
matters to us, in the same way that life and death food 
insecurity matters to us.
    Senator Hagerty. Children anxiety programs over climate 
anxiety, I just don't get the connection between the basic 
fundamental platform--the bottom part of Maslow's hierarchy of 
needs, is trying to be addressed here. That is what we should 
be focused on.
    Ms. Power. We are very active----
    Senator Hagerty. How could the best----
    Ms. Power [continuing]. At the bottom as well.
    Senator Hagerty [continuing]. Way to use taxpayers' funds 
be on providing programs like this. And when we have a void 
China steps in to fill that void, Ambassador. We need to be in 
the game, we need to be looking at the basic needs. That is 
what I am encouraging you to do.
    Ms. Power. Understood. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Administrator Power.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Administrator, so nice to have 
you here. Thank you for what you; and everyone at USAID--does 
on a daily basis to help people around the world.
    I just returned from a trip, with a number of other 
senators, to Panama, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil. One of 
the things we were trying to assess is the Chinese influence in 
that region. We heard a lot of concerns, in Panama 
particularly, about migrants, and the Darien Gap, in Colombia 
about refugees from Venezuela. But can you speak to how--what 
USAID does, helps to counter that Chinese influence in the 
region. And do you have any specific examples in those four 
countries that you think we should particularly be aware of?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, let me say that as is happening 
in many parts of the world, there is a fair amount of buyer's 
remorse that is growing as well, in our own hemisphere.
    Senator Shaheen. We have heard that.
    Ms. Power. I am sure you did hear that. And there is 
actually a barometer survey, a Latin American survey that shows 
that trust, in fact, in the PRC has dropped 20 percent in the 
last decade, and is below 38 percent last year; trust in the 
U.S. has gone up actually, comparably, 20 percent, up to 57 
percent, according to the latest survey, and we will get more 
data on that.
    I think that stems from--those numbers stem from the fact 
that our objective, as USAID, is to help countries work 
themselves out of an assistance relationship, and out of any 
dependence, our investments are people-to-people investments, 
they are about working with, for example, those Venezuelan 
refugees or migrants in Colombia to help both them and the 
Colombian communities who host them, get access to livelihoods.
    There is no faking that, you know, whether you actually 
care about the communities, whether you are in the communities, 
in northern Central America, working with women who have been 
subjected to gender-based violence at the community level, 
working with youth who are at risk of being recruited into 
gangs at the community level.
    So just the contrast I think between these large 
infrastructure investments which can matter, of course, 
provision of infrastructure is very important. The United 
States Government is going to be doing more and more of that 
with the DFC, and millennium--multilateral development banks, 
and others.
    But it is these investments in dignity, in independence, in 
the environment in a non-extractive approach. And of course, in 
a climate-smart approach, given that that is what the 
communities most need, given the changing elements. You know, I 
think all of these points of distinction really register with 
communities. And we are trying to ensure that jobs get created 
for the communities in which we work, rather than bringing in 
our own workers in, you know, kind of development bubbles along 
the lines of what our competitors are doing.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, certainly, I think South America 
offers a tremendous opportunity for us, and it is a place where 
we should pay more attention in the future than we have in 
recent past. So I am pleased to hear that that is an area of 
focus for USAID.
    Last spring, Senator Murphy, Tillis, and I, were in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, and we visited one of the USAID development 
efforts with a small business, and saw the impact that that was 
having. We also heard about corruption, and good governance, 
and the issues that they present for the people of--not only 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the entire region.
    So can you talk about what USAID is doing to address 
corruption, and good governance, particularly in the Western 
Balkans?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, USAID has done an awful lot in 
the independent media sector over the years as you know. Again 
thanks, in part, to your support. That work has now shifted a 
little bit, also to an effort to really dig in on media 
viability, because again we want these independent newspapers 
like Oslobodenje, or whomever, to be viable in a digital age.
    So working with them, and they are the leading exposures, 
often, of corruption, not just that newspaper, but many of the 
others that USAID has supported, similarly, civil society 
organizations. But the heartbreaking aspect, as you know, of 
the situation--there are many, many heartbreaking aspects in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina--but is the poor governance, and 
paralyzed governance, and governance in which individuals look 
out more for themselves, and more for self-dealing than they do 
for the young people in the country who continue to flee in 
droves.
    And here, I think we have shifted in the last year or two 
toward looking to see whether there is more to be done, less at 
the central or Federation level, and more at the local level. 
You know, working with auditors, working with prosecutors, 
working in fact with clean governments that, you know, 
themselves are putting in place checks and balance--checks and 
balances are responsive to them.
    So it is sad in a way that one has to forum shop to find 
willing partners, but I do think we have made progress; and I 
will commend, also, the State Department and Treasury because I 
think the sanctions designations taking advantage of the 
corruption prong, of the Magnitsky Sanctions, and other 
mechanisms. But those have made a real difference, I think, in 
deterring this kind of conduct.
    Senator Shaheen. I certainly agree, and I hope we will 
continue to stay focused on other areas where--on individuals 
where sanctions can help make a difference.
    Finally, I wanted to ask you about Women, Peace and 
Security because that makes it a priority, legislation to 
protect and support women's roles in peace negotiations, and 
conflict resolution. And I know that this is something that 
USAID is still implementing. What else do you need in order to 
successfully implement that legislation, and how do you see 
that helping with the work that you are doing?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, I think, or the budget request 
includes $16 million in order to help implement the Women, 
Peace and Security Plan and its modalities around the world, 
but if you actually, you know, look more broadly at Women, 
Peace and Security, broadly, define less about the plan, per 
se, but are programs that are responsive.
    I think we are, you know, spending somewhere around $250 
million in, I think, we have 80,000 females that we have 
brought into mediation roles, peace building roles, you know, 
through that programming. It is also something I again credit 
the State Department and DOD.
    Now, really pushing that the results remain elusive in many 
domains, but as a design feature of any negotiation for women 
to be involved, you know, we are both heartbroken by events in 
Sudan. Those discussions, again, pushing even now for women to 
be involved in discussing, first the ceasefire, and then the 
longer term transition.
    So just whenever something unfolds, you know, it isn't just 
a program that lives over here, it has to be a design feature 
of our diplomacy, and our engagement. And I think that is at 
least what we are trying to put in place.
    Senator Shaheen. Good. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Shaheen, and thank you 
Administrator. I am going to go question at the end of the 
PEPFAR hearing. So I may or may not return.
    Senator Murphy, to you. And if I don't return before you 
conclude questioning, if you would close out the hearing I 
would appreciate it.
    Senator Murphy. Will do. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Good to see you, Administrator. Administrator Power, I 
wanted to turn your attention to Tunisia, a small country in 
North Africa, but one that has had outsized attention, and 
importance given the fact that it was one of the few relative 
democratic success stories coming out of the Arab Spring. I 
have a specific question, and then a more general question.
    The specific one is this. The budget suggests preserving, 
military aid for Tunisia, but also a pretty dramatic cut to 
economic aid and to--aid to civil society groups. That is 
worrying, because as you know, this is a moment of real crisis 
in Tunisia. President Saied has turned his back on democratic 
norms, has engaged in a pretty repressive and overwhelming 
crackdown on dissent.
    And this seems like a moment where it would be important 
for us to send a signal to civil society that we are, you know, 
going to increase our support for their work, not decrease it. 
And so I wondered if, just on the specific question of how we 
look at our aid budget, trying to help give some oxygen to 
those that are trying to fight back against this slide away 
from democracy in Tunisia, how this budget is going to do that? 
And why we envision a cut to civil society money for Tunisia?
    Ms. Power. Well, I think the 2024 request is for $14.5 
million, but that is a lower number, in part, again because so 
many of the avenues in which we were engaging, the government 
at least, 2 years ago, have been for foreclosed by the actions 
by the government. So I would want to dig into whether or not 
your premise is right about actual cuts to civil society. I 
would certainly agree with you that even when governments are 
backsliding, that that can become cause just to shift resources 
from what you might have wished to do with a judicial body, or 
with a ministry, you know, to make sure that accountability, 
you know, doesn't suffer as well. Or at least doesn't suffer a 
shortage of resources, it is certainly suffering.
    The other thing I would note, Senator, is that for the 
first time this administration is coming forward with a 
proposal for an ``Opportunity Fund for the Middle East and 
North Africa.'' I don't know if that caught your attention. I 
think it is a $90-million fund, and the idea there is to be 
more opportunistic. Again we don't see right now, the 
likelihood of a democratic opening, or reverse of the 
backsliding in Tunisia; but if that were to happen, to be in a 
position to draw from that fund to meet the moment, whether 
through support for civil society, or for the government.
    But let me get back to you on the specifics of what the cut 
from the $22.5 million fiscal year 2022 level, to a $14.5 
million request, sort of what the modalities of that would be.
    Senator Murphy. Yes. Listen I worry that--I think you are 
right, some of it was driven by a lack of avenue. You have got 
a Minister of Interior who, you know, is working hand in hand 
with Saied's crackdown. But I worry that this is kind of an 
excuse to not get thoughtful and creative about how to find 
avenues to support civil society, and look forward to hearing 
back.
    Here is my more general question. You know, I have been a 
critic of continuing the level of aid to Saied's Government, 
and one of the answers I get back is, China, right. That 
becomes the excuse as to why we should be heavily invested in 
repressive regimes all over North Africa, and the Middle East: 
that if we are not there, China will be.
    I know you have talked a lot about China here today, but on 
this sort of specific question, about what I think many people 
here are inviting, a human rights and democracy race to the 
bottom with China, in which, just because they are willing to 
fund repressive regimes, and economically backwards regimes we 
should as well.
    And my sense is that the way that we compete with China 
successfully, is to not be China. Is to bring our values and 
our standards to these conversations, and to have a walk away 
moment, where the cost is just too high if a government is 
engaged in massive repression, or their economy is such a mess 
that it doesn't make sense for us to be involved in the long 
run.
    We haven't done that much despite, you know--despite the 
President talking about putting human rights and democracy 
first, you know, we still stay engaged with a lot of countries 
that have been moving the wrong way pretty fast. But not 
litigating that specific question of policy, what do you think 
about this idea that there is a risk of being engaged in a 
human rights, democracy race to the bottom with China? There 
has got to be a point at which we walk away.
    Ms. Power. Well, let me just take that question if I could 
from my vantage point as Administrator of USAID, where we have 
significantly increased our investments in democracy and human 
rights, where I very much agree with you that those investments 
that support, including by voice, but also by programming, is a 
key distinguishing feature, you know.
    The PRC does government-to-government this and that, the 
PRC brings its own workers in to make substantial investments, 
the debt distress that so many countries are suffering, it 
comes about in part because they are so busy servicing debt, 
and don't have an ability to invest those revenue in the 
livelihoods of their citizens, the lives of their citizens.
    You know, we are, under President Biden, very significantly 
expanding those investments in these distinguishing features, 
our attention to marginalized people, our attention to 
indigenous communities, our attention to LGBTQI individuals who 
are being persecuted across Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle 
East, and beyond.
    So you know, I actually think that governments are seeing, 
across the board, much more substantial investments, not only 
than the previous administration, which may not be unexpected, 
but even then the Obama administration. I mean, I think the 
years of underinvestment in those groups that are holding 
governments accountable, you know, we are trying to make up for 
lost time.
    That 17 years of democratic backsliding occurred, you know, 
without an effort to really buck, you know, or halt the 
momentum that the autocrats and others were having. You know, I 
will say putting to one side the--you know, the walk away 
aspect of your question if I may. You know, we are doing a lot 
of business with a lot of countries. I mean, if there are 
places where there is democratic backsliding, where we are 
dramatically, expanding our civil society programming 
resources, but we are also urgently working with them to curb 
emissions at the same time.
    And so, you know, for USAID, you know, even in a place like 
Afghanistan where the Taliban is doing, you know, one week just 
something just more monstrous than the thing that was done 
before, and more self-defeating from the standpoint of the 
economy of the country, even there, we are not walking away 
because we want to help citizens meet basic needs.
    We want to support girls through online learning if we 
can't reach them in the classroom like we were able to do a 
couple years ago. So, you know, it is this question of walking 
away, versus engaging, and continuing to be in the scrum, even 
in governments that are repressive, to find reformist elements 
who want to liberalize. Maybe they want to liberalize aspects 
of the economy, and not yet liberalize independent--you know, 
press freedom.
    But sometimes, you know, history shows that you get a 
foothold in there, you open things up, the private sector comes 
in, and that can, you know, create openings that might not have 
existed otherwise.
    So I think on a case-by-case basis, one can discuss, you 
know, again, whether taking our marbles and going home is the 
right strategy. But I find that there is a real hunger right 
now for the American alternative, and that includes support for 
civil society, raising our voice for those who are being 
repressed, raising our voice for marginalized populations. And 
to lose that aspect of our foreign policy, really, would be to 
lose a comparative advantage.
    Senator Murphy. I don't know that I disagree with any of 
that. I think often the rationale for our continued economic, 
and security assistance, and maybe I am, you know, talking to 
the wrong person about security assistance, is often connected 
to our need to have a foothold inside these countries to 
compete with China. It is not always connected to our efforts 
to lift up democracy, and human rights.
    And that is why Tunisia, for me, is an interesting example. 
A place where we have, you know, continued the same level of 
military assistance, despite the fact that the military is 
engaged in this crackdown, and we are cutting aid that, you 
know, arguably is channeled through to civil society. And my 
guess is, the reason we have done that is to try to have some 
influence with the Tunisian regime because, China is knocking 
at the door. And the way we get that influence is through 
economic aid, and military aid that the government has a role 
in. That troubles me side-by-side with these reductions, and in 
support for civil society. But I will look forward to 
continuing the conversation.
    All right; and I have got more questions, but I am going to 
stay on time, given that I am already over. And I am going to 
do my duty and close out the hearing.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
          Questions Submitted to Administrator Samantha Power
             Questions Submitted by Senator Jeanne Shaheen
    Question. Despite the Biden-Harris Administration's prioritization 
of the repeal of the Global Gag Rule shortly after taking office, I 
remained concerned by reports over the last 2 years that some 
implementing partners are still restricting the services that they 
provide. When we discussed this last year, you called it a 
``conservative application of this Administration's policies.'' 
According to a Government Accountability Office report issued last 
June, even after the policy has been rescinded, implementing partners 
struggle to rebuild lost partnerships, networks and programs while 
government and non-governmental organization stakeholders continue to 
experience confusion about what is permissible.

  --Can you describe what USAID is doing to ensure that all partners 
        and stakeholders understand that the global gag rule is not 
        currently in effect? How are you working to proactively rebuild 
        partnerships and communities harmed by the global gag rule?
  --Will you commit to meeting with organizations and communities 
        impacted by the global gag rule on future travel?

    Answer. USAID is committed to continuing to partner with 
governments, the private sector, and international and nongovernmental 
organizations to improve health outcomes and the empowerment of women 
and girls so that they can realize their full potential.
    USAID regularly communicates with Missions and partners on the 
longstanding requirements and statutory restrictions applicable to 
their programs. In addition to communicating the revocation of the 
Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy through the 
Agency's Implementing Partner Notices (IPN) Portal, the Bureau for 
Global Health has conducted outreach to USAID/Washington, Mission, and 
implementing partner staff to communicate directly that the PLGHA 
requirements were no longer in effect for prime awards and all existing 
and future subawards.

    Question. According to the most recent U.S. Government Strategy on 
International Basic Education, girls are more likely to be out of 
school than boys. The problem of keeping girls in school is especially 
challenging in conflict-affected countries where girls are 90% more 
likely to be out of secondary school than girls in stable countries.
    The U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls addresses the 
barriers that prevent girls from staying in school to ensure adolescent 
girls are educated, healthy, economically and socially empowered and 
free from violence and discrimination. Does USAID have any plans to 
update the implementation plans for this 2016 strategy or to publicly 
report on the implementation of this strategy?

    Answer. USAID has been involved in interagency discussions on the 
U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls (the Strategy) and 
will continue to focus on implementation of the Strategy rather than 
revision of the implementation plans. A publicly available report on 
the progress under the Strategy was released in April 2023 and is 
available on the U.S. Department of State website. The Department of 
State is the interagency lead on the Strategy.

    Question. In the last 5 years, how have USAID programs increased 
access to education for girls in both conflict-affected and stable 
countries?

    Answer. USAID remains committed to advancing gender equality in and 
through education around the world and to strengthening resilient 
education systems that support access to quality education, 
particularly for the most marginalized. In FY 2022, USAID programs in 
more than 50 countries worked to advance gender equality in and through 
education, reaching more than 11.8 million girls and women across the 
education continuum.
    Over the last 5 years, the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and crises 
have negatively impacted access to education for girls and women. USAID 
programs have worked to address barriers to quality education by 
supporting programs that prevent and respond to school-related gender-
based violence, ensure educational materials and instruction empower 
all learners, provide safe learning opportunities for women and girls 
facing adversity, and holistically support adolescent girls to overcome 
their unique set of challenges.
    USAID is committed to this programming and has pledged under the 
National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality to reach 15 million 
girls and young women across the education continuum with education 
assistance by 2025.
    Examples of USAID's programs that have increased access to 
education for girls in both conflict-affected and stable countries over 
the past 5 years include:

  --Pakistan.--In September 2022, USAID launched the Improving Girls' 
        Education Activity to support public-private partnerships that 
        will improve school management in public girls' schools in 
        Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, boost school enrollment, and 
        strengthen the quality of education. On March 7, the U.S. 
        Ambassador to Pakistan also announced 500 university 
        scholarships for flood-affected students, with 50 percent of 
        the scholarships reserved for women.
  --Mali.--USAID's Girls Leadership and Empowerment through Education 
        program creates tangible opportunities for adolescent girls to 
        pursue their academic goals. It decreases educational barriers 
        for adolescent girls, improves their safety in schools and 
        communities, and increases knowledge of positive health 
        behaviors amongst them and their families. Programming provides 
        accelerated learning to girls, and supports their transition to 
        Mali public schools to continue their formal education.
  --Mozambique.--USAID's Advancing Girls' Education activity empowers 
        adolescent girls and promotes girls' school attendance in 
        Zambezia and Nampula where girls' school enrollment is low. In 
        addition to equipping learners with literacy, numeracy, social, 
        and life skills, the activity also expands girls' safe access 
        to quality education and improves learning outcomes by 
        educating learners about malnutrition, menstrual hygiene 
        management, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.

    Question. The FY23 omnibus included report language encouraging 
USAID to allocate resources through the International Disaster 
Assistance account to provide safe, inclusive, and quality education 
for refugee and internally displaced children.

    What is the Biden administration's FY24 plan to support education 
and flexible learning to maintain continuity across situations of 
crisis?

    Answer. USAID supports child protection and education in crisis and 
conflict along the humanitarian development continuum with both 
International Disaster Assistance and Development Assistance funds. In 
fiscal year 2024, USAID's programs, leveraged with resources from 
bilateral and multilateral partnerships, the private sector, and 
external stakeholders, will build on the foundation set by the U.S. 
Government Strategy on International Basic Education and continue to 
help partner countries to strengthen the resilience of education 
systems, mitigate disruptions to education, prepare for heightened 
uncertainty and instability, provide safe spaces to learn, and improve 
educational outcomes.
    USAID is the largest bilateral donor of basic education development 
assistance in the world and is uniquely positioned to support learners, 
educators, and education systems in partner countries to prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from crises quickly and efficiently. In fiscal 
year 2022, USAID basic education programs reached 28 million children 
and youth in 56 countries, including 31 countries affected by conflict 
or crisis.
    USAID's education programs in crisis- and conflict-affected 
environments work to provide safe learning opportunities for students 
and teachers, rebuild education systems, and prevent and mitigate 
further conflict and crisis through conflict-sensitive education 
programs, community engagement, and disaster-risk reduction activities. 
Programs also work with national government leadership in the education 
sector to support integration of refugees into host country systems, 
serve internally-displaced children and youth, and support external 
coordination groups to increase coherence between humanitarian and 
development efforts in education.
    As one of its original contributors, USAID is also proud to 
continue to support Education Cannot Wait, the only global fund for 
education in emergencies. ECW ensures that the most marginalized child 
and youth in experiencing emergencies and protracted crises have access 
to lifesaving and life-sustaining education services. USAID's 
contributions also support ECW in its role to coordinate among donors, 
the private sector, and humanitarian and development actors to meet the 
needs of the next generation and ensure this growing population has the 
skills and abilities to sustain themselves while engaging as productive 
citizens in their communities. The United States, through USAID and the 
Department of State's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration, 
plans to contribute $25 million to ECW in FY 2023, bringing the total 
of U.S. government contributions to ECW to $145.3 million to date since 
2017.
    USAID's International Disaster Assistance funding is intended to 
save lives, alleviate human suffering, and reduce the impact of 
humanitarian crises. USAID recognizes education is protective and life-
saving in crises. Humanitarian child protection programs support 
education in emergencies through the Safe Healing and Learning Spaces 
methodology, psychosocial support and coping tools for caregivers and 
teachers, temporary shelters to enable damaged schools to resume 
education, and contextualized learning materials for displaced 
children. USAID child protection and education in emergencies experts 
collaborate closely to maintain continuity across the humanitarian-
development nexus.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Susan M. Collins
    Question. Recent years have truly been historic for Israel's 
relationships with regional Arab neighbors. The UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, 
and Sudan joined Egypt and Jordan in establishing diplomatic relations 
with Israel--paving the path to peace through recognition and 
engagement rather than isolation and boycotts of Israel.

  --Please describe the work USAID is undertaking to further expand and 
        strengthen the Arab world's normalization of relations with 
        Israel.
  --Is there more that USAID can do on this front?

    Answer. Advancing Middle East peace, regional integration, and 
normalization between Israel and its neighbors is a priority of this 
Administration and this agency. USAID continues to advance trilateral 
and regional USAID-Israel cooperation, particularly with Israel's 
neighbors and with Abraham Accords countries. USAID actively 
participates in five of the six Negev Forum Working Groups aimed at 
improving Israel's integration into the region. USAID serves as the USG 
lead for the Negev Forum's Tourism and Food Security and Water 
Technology Working Groups. Working closely with the interagency, USAID 
continues engaging international counterparts to achieve tangible 
progress in each Working Group it is a part of.
    In August 2019, USAID and MASHAV--the Israeli government's 
international development agency within its Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs--signed a global Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for 
development cooperation to identify opportunities for collaboration and 
partnership. Most recently, USAID utilized $2 million in FY 21 funding 
to partner with MASHAV in Albania, Northern Central America, and 
through a special call for agriculture, climate, and water 
sustainability proposals with the agency's Middle East Regional 
Cooperation (MERC) program.
    In addition, through MERC, USAID manages a portfolio of over 40 
active Arab-Israeli applied research grants focused on topics crucial 
to the region, such as natural resources management and public health. 
Examples of those projects include:

  --Israeli and Jordanian scientists are developing advanced methods to 
        treat municipal wastewater that may assist with irrigation in 
        Israel and Jordan.
  --Palestinian and Israeli scientists are generating evidence of the 
        presence, transport, and effects of lead on soils, plants, 
        water, animals, and individuals near sites in the West Bank 
        where electronics waste and cables are burned for recycling and 
        disposal. This research is informing how this issue is managed, 
        and is promoting recycling.

    Question. To enhance regional prosperity and stability, the United 
States joined Israel, Egypt, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco in 
establishing the Negev Forum. I understand USAID has been an active 
participant in the Working Groups established by the Forum.

  --Can you update us on what USAID is doing with regard to the Forum 
        and what outcomes you hope to achieve?

    Answer. USAID continues to advance trilateral and regional 
cooperation with Israel, particularly with Israel's neighbors and 
Abraham Accords countries. USAID's support to the Negev Forum is a 
prime example of these efforts. USAID serves as the U.S. government 
lead for two of the Negev Forum Working Groups--Food Security and Water 
Technology (FSWT) and Tourism, and also provides expertise to the 
Health, Clean Energy, and Education and Coexistence Working Groups.
    A USAID delegation attended the inaugural Working Group meetings in 
Abu Dhabi in January of 2023, and Agency experts continue to work 
closely coordinating with interagency and regional partners ahead of an 
upcoming Ministerial expected in early summer 2023 in Morocco. For 
example, USAID is working with other Negev members to advance joint 
tourism projects to boost economic development, improve capacity of 
tourism operators, and convene experts to share best practices and 
opportunities as determined by the Tourism Working Group. The FSWT 
plans to gather at the working level in the coming months to further 
hone its deliverables for the Ministerial. USAID hopes that the 
deliverables identified and announced at the Ministerial will promote 
further regional integration between Israel and all involved countries.

    Question. The World Food Program is actively investigating the 
large-scale theft of USAID-provided humanitarian food aid in Ethiopia, 
where protracted conflict and drought have left more than 20 million 
people reliant on aid. The amount of food aid stolen is reportedly 
enough to feed 100,000 people. Meanwhile, Secretary Blinken announced 
an additional $331 million in new humanitarian assistance for Ethiopia 
last month.

    Can you provide an update on the investigation into this situation 
and tell us what steps are you taking to ensure that U.S.-funded 
humanitarian assistance is not stolen or diverted from its intended 
recipients?

    Answer. USAID recently uncovered that food aid intended for the 
people of Tigray suffering under famine-like conditions was being 
diverted post-distribution and sold on the local market by 
beneficiaries who were either coerced or misled into selling their food 
aid at cut-rate prices. Immediately upon discovery of this post-
distribution diversion in Ethiopia, USAID reported the incident to 
USAID's Office of Inspector General (OIG). It is our understanding that 
both the USAID OIG and investigatory units from USAID implementing 
partners in Ethiopia are investigating the matter. As of March 21, when 
the post-distribution diversion was initially discovered, nearly $315 
million (out of $319.5 million allocated to BHA) of the announced 
funding had been obligated. In response to this situation and in 
cooperation with implementing partners, USAID has proactively 
implemented strong mitigating measures against further diversion.
    Effective April 20, 2023, we have decided to pause all USAID-
supported humanitarian food assistance to Tigray until we can work with 
our partners to ensure that this assistance can be provided without 
further diversion. USAID humanitarian food assistance is continuing in 
other regions of Ethiopia at this time. The pause is limited to food 
assistance and is intended to immediately resume once we are assured 
that safeguards are in place to ensure that aid is reaching and being 
utilized by its intended recipients in order to minimize humanitarian 
impact to the extent possible. Pausing food assistance is not a 
decision we take lightly given the immense suffering in the region. 
However, USAID believes that upholding the integrity of humanitarian 
assistance is critical to meeting needs and reaching the most 
vulnerable, both in Northern Ethiopia and around the world. USAID 
Administrator Samantha Power met with WFP Executive Director Cindy 
McCain on April 6 and directly raised the concerns surrounding this 
diversion.
    USAID is exploring all viable programmatic options in Ethiopia as 
part of global efforts to mitigate waste, fraud, or diversion of 
assistance. USAID will also continue pressing for system-wide changes 
throughout the country, such as enhanced beneficiary identification, 
improved targeting, and strengthened monitoring of assistance.
    Wherever we work, USAID continually reviews the risks associated 
with our programming to ensure that our partners are able to 
effectively carry out USAID-supported activities in line with 
humanitarian principles, while also acting in compliance with the terms 
and conditions of their awards. In parallel, we work closely with our 
food assistance partners to ensure they have robust risk mitigation 
systems in place. We are committed to ensuring U.S. taxpayer-funded 
humanitarian assistance is reaching and being utilized by the intended 
beneficiaries and commit to informing Congress as more information 
becomes available.

    Question. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction 
John Sopko recently testified that he cannot assure Congress ``that we 
are not currently funding the Taliban.''

  --Are USAID implementers providing funding to the Taliban, including 
        through government registration, customs, or other fees? If so, 
        under what specific authority?

    Answer. USAID does not provide assistance to the Taliban. All USAID 
humanitarian and development assistance funds the work of UN agencies 
and experienced, carefully chosen international NGOs and local Afghan 
partners. In some cases, USAID partners may be required to conduct 
incidental transactions with the Taliban that are necessary for the 
provision of assistance, such as fees, import duties, purchase or 
receipt of permits or licenses, purchase of fuel, or payment for public 
utility or telecommunication services. These types of critical 
transactions are authorized under General Licenses issued by the 
Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). 
Direct financial transfers to the Taliban (or Haqqani Network) are 
prohibited.

    Question. How does USAID ensure that its humanitarian assistance is 
reaching intended recipients, namely ``the poor Afghan people,'' and 
what is your response to SIGAR's concerns that the Taliban is profiting 
or benefiting from such assistance?

    Answer. USAID has a track record of ensuring that our assistance 
does not benefit terrorists or other blocked persons. USAID utilized 
robust anti-terrorism vetting to mitigate the risk of diversion of our 
funds and resources to terrorist entities during program 
implementation. USAID also employs risk analytic processes that include 
an examination of the risks associated with the diversion of assistance 
to the Taliban and Haqqani Network in Afghanistan. We require our 
humanitarian and development partners to have proper safeguards and 
risk-mitigation systems in place to ensure that principled development 
and humanitarian aid reaches those who need it most. When there is any 
cause for concern related to the delivery of this assistance, we have 
plans and protocols in place to respond.
    USAID and our implementing partners have extensive experience 
working in challenging operating environments and we have systems to 
enable aid to reach its intended recipients--over 17 million people in 
FY 2022--through numerous monitoring methods, including remote, post-
distribution, and third-party monitoring, to provide continuous 
oversight of awards. Over the last 20 years, the security situation in 
Afghanistan has often required remote and third-party monitoring 
methods. The Taliban takeover in August 2021 has required more frequent 
use of these methods. USAID partners are also required to report all 
incidents of fraud, waste, and abuse, including diversion, to USAID's 
Office of Inspector General (OIG).
    USAID staff continually communicate and coordinate with our 
implementing partners and our third-party monitoring contractor to 
ensure both that our assistance is reaching those for which it is 
intended and that our partners have effective systems and mitigation 
measures in place to help safeguard against and promptly report and 
respond to fraud, waste, and abuse, including Taliban attempts to 
influence or interfere with the provision of assistance. USAID staff 
regularly meet with partners, as well as review programmatic and 
financial reports corresponding with their respective awards, to obtain 
key contextual and programmatic updates, including updates related to 
their access to beneficiary populations, safety and security, and any 
attempted Taliban interference.

    Question. Are you aware of any U.S. taxpayer funds being diverted 
by the Taliban, including away from specific ethnic groups the Taliban 
does not support or to the families of Taliban local leaders? How does 
USAID ensure that no U.S. taxpayer funds are diverted by the Taliban?

    Answer. The Taliban has occasionally tried to divert humanitarian 
assistance in various geographic areas for personal gain or towards 
public works projects such as road construction. In these cases, 
humanitarian organizations have decided, on their own, to suspend 
assistance until local Taliban authorities agree to abide by 
humanitarian principles and not seek to influence or interfere with 
programming.
    USAID has risk management systems in place to safeguard against 
diversion of U.S. taxpayer funds to the Taliban. As part of funding 
applications, USAID requires that partners develop Risk Assessment and 
Management Plans (RAMPs), which USAID uses to inform its internal 
assessments on how applicants will mitigate the risk of assistance 
benefiting sanctioned entities, among other risks.
    The Taliban's December 24, 2022, edict and April 4, 2023, verbal 
declaration prohibiting Afghan female staff from working in NGOs and 
the UN in Afghanistan has further complicated the fragile operational 
climate in Afghanistan. To date, USAID partners report that they are 
able to continue providing principled humanitarian assistance to 
Afghans in need but are increasingly confronted with access challenges 
as these edicts are not uniformly enforced. USAID is continuing to 
engage with partners to understand these challenges and how they impact 
access for different regions, individuals, and groups.

              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
    Question. Coffee is incredibly important to the U.S. economy. The 
coffee industry supports nearly 1.7 million American jobs and adds $225 
billion in economic activity every year according to the National 
Coffee Association. Coffee is also important to Arkansas. Arkansas 
companies in the coffee industry depend on a steady supply of coffee 
grown by smallholders mostly in low-income countries, some of which are 
countries where Feed the Future operates.

  --As the risk to coffee production grows, from things including soil 
        fertility issues and pests and disease, what is USAID doing to 
        help smallholder coffee producers in low-income countries 
        become more resilient to the challenges they are facing growing 
        coffee?

    Answer. USAID works in partnership with U.S. and international 
coffee companies, other sector actors and non-profit organizations to 
enable the world's at-risk coffee producers to improve their 
livelihoods while providing a reliable supply of high-quality coffee. 
USAID's work in coffee spans many countries on three continents. 
Together with our partners, we are combating threats posed by the 
climate crisis that endanger global coffee crops while ensuring that 
coffee production protects forests and the climate. Through 
partnerships with the private sector, we are working to drive 
investment in sustainable production, and improve the environmental and 
economic benefits of conservation for local communities.

  --USAID has funded numerous activities that help smallholder coffee 
        producers become more resilient to production challenges 
        (including soil infertility and increased pest and disease 
        pressure). To cite two examples, one from Mexico and one from 
        Peru:

    --Cooperative Development Project.--(2018-2024) Equal Exchange's 
            Cooperative Development Project, funded by USAID, is 
            working with the coffee association Finca Triunfo Verde 
            coffee association in Mexico to improve the quality and 
            productivity of organic, specialty coffee. Equal Exchange 
            is supporting the association in facilitating exchanges 
            between producers to model best practices in shade 
            diversification, soil conservation, and pest and disease 
            control. Additionally, Equal Exchange is working with Finca 
            Triunfo Verde to foster young people's interest in coffee 
            production by extending technical training to youth and 
            assisting them in establishing their own model farms.
    --In September 2020, USAID and Conservation International signed an 
            agreement in partnership with Starbucks to implement the 
            Amazon Business Alliance (2020-2027) to facilitate and 
            promote sustainable investments in the Peruvian Amazon by 
            scaling-out and scaling-up their impact to support 
            conservation business models and enabling conditions. The 
            purpose of the activity is to ensure that families in the 
            short term improve their incomes and help restore and 
            conserve forests on their farms and in the broader 
            landscape. The project is promoting agroforestry systems 
            and increasing shade-tree densities in existing coffee and 
            cacao plots and diversifying production through non-timber 
            species such as peppers, bananas, among others; likewise, 
            families are installing plantations and managing timber 
            species in secondary forests as well as restoring degraded 
            soils with organic fertilizers made from farm residues and 
            composting.

    Question. Are there any long-term solutions and innovations USAID 
is investing in, such as agricultural research in the development of 
coffee?

    Answer. Yes, USAID investments in soil health research are 
generating improved practices which could readily be applicable in 
coffee-producing regions. Coffee producers also face challenges around 
soil fertility and diversified production within coffee-based systems.
    USAID also invests in the long-term sustainability of coffee 
through initiatives that create economic opportunities for producers--
including access to markets, connections with buyers, and access to 
finance. The Farmfit Fund, for which coffee is an important commodity, 
offers affordable financial resources to start, sustain, and grow 
businesses that sustainably engage with smallholders. Farmfit Fund 
transactions benefit from a USAID sponsored DFC guarantee facility (up 
to USD $250 million). The fund runs until 2036.
    USAID also supported Green Invest Asia, an innovative project 
targeting mid-growth agriculture and forestry companies in Indonesia 
and Vietnam with business strategies, environmental assessments, and 
advice to improve their sustainable commodity production and business 
practices. The focus of GIA was on key commodities linked to 
deforestation in Southeast Asia, including coffee. Green Invest Asia 
facilitates increased sustainability in the transforming coffee sector 
through a carbon baseline study. The results influenced companies to 
strategically develop plans and policies that contribute to global 
sustainability and reduced emissions. Through GIA, USAID supported top 
global buyers JDE Peet's and Nestle to meet their corporate carbon 
commitments to source carbon-neutral coffee from their regional supply 
chains, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the entire sector. 
These systemic industry shifts improve smallholder supplier 
livelihoods, supply chain transparency and traceability while 
mitigating climate change impacts and preventing deforestation.

    Question. The war in Ukraine is causing widespread destruction to 
both civilians and infrastructure. At the same time, Russia's invasion 
of Ukraine has led to the worst food crisis since WWII. Grain and 
fertilizer exports remain low, leading to higher costs of food 
production and less food to consume. Addressing the global food crisis 
remains a top issue, especially in the Horn of Africa where hunger and 
starvation is driving conflict.

    How will USAID's FY24 budget address the global food crisis and 
help ensure that we are efficiently aiding starving countries and food 
scarcity is not driving conflicts in these regions?

    Answer. USAID remains deeply committed to providing lifesaving 
humanitarian assistance to populations affected by the global food 
security crisis. Underscoring the historic proportions of the current 
crisis, USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network estimates that 
acute food insecurity has increased by 70 percent when compared to pre-
pandemic levels. This crisis will be a long-term one--thus, we need to 
prepare ourselves for a long-term response. The powerful, combined 
effects of climate change, the COVID-19 post-pandemic effect, 
protracted complex emergencies, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine will 
create elevated levels of emergency needs for years to come.
    Generous funding from Congress and the American people, including 
through supplemental appropriations, allowed the United States to scale 
up humanitarian assistance to meet unprecedented needs--especially in 
Ukraine and in the Horn of Africa--during FY 2022 and FY 2023. The FY 
2024 request includes $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance for 
USAID.
    To prioritize USG humanitarian resources, USAID will focus on 
addressing the most life-threatening needs in each context. In 
addition, USAID will work with partners to deliver assistance in the 
most efficient way possible. In some cases, this means potentially 
switching or re-emphasizing a particular modality such as cash, local 
purchase, or U.S. Food for Peace Title II in-kind assistance to find 
the optimal mix within and between partners to reach the most people we 
can with the resources available.
    While we will continue to prioritize available resources for the 
most acute emergencies and needs, significant resources are needed to 
address unprecedented humanitarian needs worldwide. Humanitarian needs 
are far outpacing global resources and face difficult trade-offs for 
concurrent emergencies. As a result, USAID will continue to advocate 
with other donors to increase their contributions to responses, with a 
particular focus on the Horn of Africa.

    Question. What is USAID doing to promote the growth of sustainable 
agriculture in these vulnerable regions given the global food crisis, 
and is there more you need from us?

    Answer. USAID is leveraging the full weight of its Bureau for 
Resilience and Food Security to address this crisis. USAID recently 
expanded the number of target countries within Feed the Future from 12 
to 20, in light of growing need and growing demand for food security 
investments that address the underlying weaknesses in food systems. 
When selected as a target country, USAID aims to prioritize Feed the 
Future funding to go to that country. Target countries also create 
country plans which are written in conjunction with USAID missions and 
partner governments. This includes much more robust monitoring and 
evaluation reporting than is required in non-target Feed the Future 
countries.
    In addition, we have a set of resilience focus countries, and zones 
within countries that are areas of chronic poverty and recurrent 
shocks, (for example, the arid lands of Kenya which are now 
experiencing historic drought.) Our programs in these areas are 
designed to build the capacities of communities to withstand climate 
and other related shocks and help avert the need for year-on-year 
humanitarian assistance.
    These programs are bearing fruit. We have seen the reduction of 
poverty and malnutrition by 20-25 percent in areas where we work, the 
improvement in children's diets and the doubling of women's empowerment 
as measured by our innovative Women's Empower in Agriculture Index. 
Data also indicates that even without access to additional resources, 
according to the World Bank, Feed the Future zones of influence were 
more resilient to the economic impacts of COVID-19 than households 
living outside of these areas. Our programs doubled the number of 
people we reached with access to finance during that period, 
demonstrating our ability to pivot even without additional resources.
    In response to the current crisis, USAID scaled up and accelerated 
such Feed the Future activities, building on our strong global 
platform, to respond to immediate, rising food insecurity within three 
lines of effort: mitigating the fertilizer shortage, increasing 
investments in agricultural capacity and resilience to sustain crop 
production in spite of rising input costs; and cushioning the 
macroeconomic shocks and impact on vulnerable communities. We 
accelerated farmer's access to improved seed in order to ensure 
harvests are productive as farmers face difficult markets and USAID is 
supporting, at scale, fertilizer use efficiency and other agronomic 
practices to reduce the impact of fertilizer shortfalls.
    In order to address this crisis, USAID both pivoted existing 
investments and also rapidly distributed supplemental funds to meet 
these objectives. Funds were used on a variety of critical programming. 
In particular, it was used to launch a unique market-based response to 
the crisis called the Accelerated Innovation Delivery Initiative.
    The Accelerated Innovation Delivery Initiative (AID-I) is a $117-
million, two-year rapid response effort that connects farmers to 
innovative tools and information they need to manage the high input 
costs and supply disruptions over the coming seasons. AID-I works with 
and through market actors such as the private sector and local 
extension to drive efficiency and scale, an approach that also will 
help sustain this work and build long-term resilience. AID-I focuses on 
areas where the need and potential is greatest: Southern Africa 
(Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia) and the Great Lakes region (Burundi, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda). It provides 
targeted assistance to up to six million African smallholder farmers by 
improving soil health and fertilizer management, strengthening local 
seed systems, connecting to financial products and services, and 
delivering extension and advisory services.
    Response options made possible with the supplemental funds to Feed 
the Future demonstrated both the power of the platform to rapidly 
respond to the crisis and the potential to do more for smallholder 
farmers to build their resilience. Funding for Feed the Future 
investments have been relatively the same since 2009 at roughly $1 
billion per year. Recognizing these needs, the President's budget 
requests an increase to $1.2 billion in FY2024.

    Question. Virginia Tech released its 2022 Global Agricultural 
Productivity report last Fall, and found ag productivity growing at 
only 1.12% annually, falling short of the annual global rate of 1.73% 
needed to feed our projected global population approaching 10 billion 
by 2050.

    If this shortfall in agricultural productivity continues in the 
coming years, what will it mean for global food security?

    Answer. The impact of sustained declines in agricultural 
productivity could mean an increasingly hungry world if output 
continues to stagnate as well. Investments in global agriculture 
production continue to fall short of the need. The world--public, 
private, and civil society sectors alike--must take far more aggressive 
action and make deeper investments to accelerate agricultural 
transformation. As the report points out, current efforts are 
inadequate to the challenges faced, including climate and other shocks. 
As an example, the U.S. government global hunger initiative, Feed the 
Future, has had the same base appropriation since its creation, and 
that funding goes considerably less far than it did 13 years ago.
    Like you, USAID is concerned about the slow pace of agricultural 
transformation in certain parts of the world and the report revealed 
important regional differences in agricultural productivity growth. 
Most troubling is that agricultural productivity declined, on average, 
across Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). To clarify, while agricultural output 
grew a healthy 2.98 percent per year (2011-2020) in SSA, most of the 
growth was driven by opening up new land for cultivation and pasture. 
Land productivity therefore contracted by 0.12 percent, meaning that 
gains were made through ``extensification'', or expansion on to new 
lands, rather than on improved productivity on the land already under 
cultivation. Converting grasslands, forests, and other wildlands to 
agricultural production can decrease biodiversity and wildlife habitat 
and increase soil degradation and erosion and is not a sustainable way 
to feed a growing global population.
    To accelerate agricultural productivity growth, investments are 
needed to address fundamental constraints limiting gains in Africa. 
These include investments in climate smart innovations such as improved 
seed, soil health, resource use efficiency (e.g., on farm water 
management) and sustainable intensification of the major farming 
systems that contribute up to 80% of the continent's food supplies. 
Through its extensive agricultural research portfolio, USAID is 
investing in the development of improved crop varieties more resilient 
to extreme weather, soil health and fertilizer management 
recommendations, water management strategies (including small-scale 
irrigation), and nutrient-dense horticulture and livestock production 
systems. These areas of investment have been proven to increase 
agricultural productivity and increase resilience to the many shocks 
farmers face.
    In addition, extreme and unpredictable weather has required 
expanded access to, and adoption of, innovations that are derived from 
recent advances in crop and livestock improvement, including resistance 
to pests and diseases as well as higher temperatures. Along with 
development of new innovations (technologies and climate-smart 
management practices), African countries and regional organizations 
need to embrace and implement policies that provide positive incentives 
for investment by both the public and private sectors, on-farm and 
across the food system. There are bright spots in Sub Saharan Africa 
where countries are advancing business-enabling environment policies 
and technological innovations that would drive agricultural 
productivity gains. For example, through the Zambia Growth 
Opportunities (ZAMGRO) Program, a US$300 million effort funded by the 
World Bank, the Government of Zambia is prioritizing policy and 
institutional reforms to increase growth in the agri-food sector. 
Zambia is redirecting public expenditures on agricultural subsidies to 
expanding agricultural infrastructure and extension to increase 
productivity and growth in the sector. Zambia is also committed to 
expanding private sector-led, market-driven reforms in grain marketing 
and increasing regional food trade.

    Question. What more can be done to address this issue?

    Answer. USAID agrees with the key policy recommendations in this 
report. In fact, Feed the Future currently invests in a majority of the 
solutions it identifies, from investing in research and innovation as 
well as commercialization of solutions, championing science informed 
policy reforms, improving access to markets for agricultural inputs and 
outputs, and boosting regional trade. The US government's Feed the 
Future Initiative has increased its attention as well to many forms of 
investments that focus not just on efficiency, but also the resilience 
of the food system. Recently, the Initiative has evolved to do more in 
early warning systems to mitigate agricultural risks from climate 
change and emerging pests and diseases, for example, and food loss and 
waste (especially post-harvest loss) to ensure that the food we do grow 
reaches the table.
    The urgency of the food crisis demands more creative strategic 
partnerships, as USAID and USDA have promoted through the ongoing 
Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate Initiative which to date 
has generated $13 billion of public and private investment in climate 
smart research and innovation in agriculture. Increasingly, USAID with 
its public sector investments, works through broad public and private 
partnerships to achieve results that promote increased productivity 
(more output from the same or fewer inputs), making farming more 
profitable and food more affordable and nutritious for low-income 
households.
    Key to utilizing these broad public and private partnerships are 
rigorous analyses identifying the priority areas where the development 
community, working hand in hand with national government partners, can 
have the greatest impact on poverty and hunger through agricultural led 
economic growth.

    Question. In recent decades, nutritious, biofortified products such 
as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and iron-fortified green beans were 
introduced into the African and Asian agricultural sectors to address 
nutrient deficiencies. As of late 2019, it is estimated that more than 
6 million households in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries were regularly 
producing and consuming orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.

  --What has USAID been doing to support agricultural research efforts 
        like these to improve nutritious outcomes and boost smallholder 
        farmers in countries where the Feed the Future Initiative is 
        active?
  --Are there any new biofortified products or other nutrition-related 
        interventions that are expected to be ready for introduction 
        soon in USAID's programming?

    Answer. Improving nutrition outcomes in Feed the Future (FTF) Zones 
of Influence is a key part of the Global Food Security Strategy, which 
the Administration updated in 2021. The new strategy elevates nutrition 
to a key pillar for FTF activities. This includes the agricultural 
research we do on biofortification. In addition, USAID prioritizes 
large-scale food fortification (LSFF) of staple foods and condiments as 
a proven low-cost, high-impact intervention to ensure that vulnerable 
populations are able to consume a diet with the necessary vitamins and 
minerals. Launched in September 2022, USAID Advancing Food 
Fortification Opportunities to Reinforce Diets (USAID AFFORD) will 
program up to $75m in funding to increase the scale and quality of LSFF 
to provide a dietary safety net to vulnerable populations by addressing 
rising dietary inadequacies.
    USAID and some of its missions funded work done by HarvestPlus and 
the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health 
(A4NH) which created the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. USAID also 
supports the development and deployment of biofortified nutritious crop 
varieties, as well as legumes as protein source.
    For example, smallholder farmers are growing biofortified maize and 
wheat varieties developed by CGIAR centers. Seven seed companies in 
four countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
Malawi, and Tanzania) are commercializing 10 pro-vitamin A (PVA) maize 
hybrid varieties, benefitting 52,705 households (approx. 331,600 
people) alone in 2022. In Guatemala, 20,500 families used biofortified 
(high-Zn) maize seed in 2022, and it is expected that high-Zn maize 
will cover at least 10% of the improved maize market in 2023. Twenty 
high zinc wheat varieties have been released in South Asia and Latin 
America, and early generation seed production is taking place in Nepal 
and India. In Pakistan, the number of households growing zinc-enriched 
wheat has risen rapidly across the country from 218,000 in 2018 to over 
2.1 million in 2022.
    One tool to combat Vitamin A malnutrition, Golden Rice 
(biofortified with higher levels of pro-vitamin A using Genetic 
Engineering), received biosafety regulatory approval for farmer 
cultivation in the Philippines in July 2021. Initial seed production 
has started, and preliminary market research suggests that golden rice 
is accepted by local markets. Within the next 5-7 years, the project 
aims for Golden Rice to meet the rice requirement of vitamin A 
deficient households in the Philippines--and ultimately its developers 
aim to provide 30 to 50 percent of the estimated average requirement 
(EAR) of vitamin A for pregnant women and young children in Southeast 
Asia.
    In addition to CGIAR centers, Feed the Future (FTF) Innovation Labs 
on Sorghum and Millets, and Crop Improvement are also contributing to 
biofortified/nutrition related activities. USAID/RFS is also supporting 
the improvements of legume crops such as soybean, beans, cowpeas and 
peanut, which are a source of low-cost protein and minerals, and also 
improve soil health. For instance, the Soybean Innovation Lab has 
developed the Complementary Food for Africa (COMFA) that combines the 
high-quality protein of soybean with the high-energy of orange flesh 
sweet potato as an early childhood nutritious food.

    Question. The U.S. has provided aid to the Palestinians over the 
years through humanitarian assistance. Congress has insisted on 
oversight of any funds to ensure that they are properly spent and do 
not go to support terrorism. The Taylor Force Act prohibits assistance 
to the Palestinian Authority until they stop the inexcusable practice 
of paying convicted terrorists and their families.

  --What are you doing to ensure strict oversight of USAID projects and 
        grantees, and ensuring no funds are directed to terrorists and 
        their supporters?
  --It has been widely reported that Palestinian schools funded by U.S. 
        taxpayers through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
        promote hatred in their schoolbooks. What has the 
        Administration done to ensure these materials are not present 
        at these schools, and has the Palestinian Authority taken any 
        meaningful steps?

    Answer. USAID takes the Taylor Force Act very seriously and 
provides all U.S. assistance in a manner compliant with all relevant 
laws, including the Taylor Force Act.
    USAID also takes counterterrorism vetting of programmatic partners 
and beneficiaries in the West Bank and Gaza very seriously to prevent 
American taxpayer funds, and the activities we finance, from providing 
support to entities or individuals that pose a risk to our national 
security.
    USAID West Bank and Gaza's Mission Order 21 requires the vetting of 
key individuals of partner organizations at the prime and first-tier 
sub-awardee levels regardless of nationality, including U.S. citizens. 
USAID also requires the vetting of individual beneficiaries/trainees at 
specific thresholds, as outlined in Mission Order 21. Vetting typically 
covers the directors, officers, or other employees considered ``key 
individuals,'' of non-Federal entities and for-profit entities that 
apply for contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other funding 
from USAID. USAID also requires vetting of recipients and beneficiaries 
(including trainees) of assistance funds meeting certain thresholds.
    Vetting is conducted by trained counterterrorism experts at the 
National Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The TSC is a FBI-managed 
facility that permits the sharing of terrorism-related information 
across the U.S. government and with other law enforcement agencies. The 
TSC manages the consolidated watchlist, which has information on people 
reasonably suspected to be involved in terrorism or related activities. 
All vetting requests submitted to USAID undergo a thorough review by 
trained counterterrorism experts at the TSC. This review includes both 
public and non-public database searches against the personally 
identifiable information provided. The vetting process is rooted in 
intelligence and complemented, as applicable, by other data points.
    In WBG, the counterterrorism partner vetting program also includes 
an additional ``second-step'' level of scrutiny whereby recipients of 
assistance awards or beneficiaries of cash or in-kind assistance are 
reviewed by the Office of Palestinian Affairs at Embassy Jerusalem.
    USAID does not fund the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and 
would refer you to the Department of State, which manages related 
funding.

    Question. Iranians continue to protest the death of Mahsa Amini, 
calling for freedom and human rights all while facing violence from the 
Iranian regime. As you know, the U.S. has a proud history of supporting 
those who are struggling for freedom.

    Has USAID played any role in helping the Iranian protesters, and is 
there anything we can do more of to support them?

    Answer. USAID stands with the brave women of Iran calling for 
change and standing up to the repressive Iranian regime. While USAID 
does not fund any activities in Iran or in support of Iranian protests, 
USAID has made public statements expressing solidarity and support in 
media interviews, public remarks, and social media For example, in 
Lebanon, Administrator Power said ``Let me just take this occasion to 
express great, great admiration for the courage of the young people, 
and the Iranian people really of all generations who have come out, 
wanting for themselves the same things all of us want and every human 
deserves, which is basic dignity, freedom, economic opportunity. And it 
has been both inspiring to see that courage and the bravery in the face 
of such repression, but also just heartbreaking to see so many lives 
snuffed out with such promise, and again, snuffed out for no other 
reason than seeking to live as they choose, live with just basic 
freedom.''
    Together with allies and partners, through multilateral measures 
and UN mechanisms, we continue to hold Iran accountable for employing 
violence against its own population, particularly women and girls.

                          SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS

    So thank you very much, Administrator Power, for joining

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met at 10:34 a.m., in room SD-124, Dirksen

  ADVANCING SECURITY AND PROSPERITY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHRISTOPHER A. COONS

    Senator Coons. This hearing of the Subcommittee on State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, will come to order.
    The subcommittee meets today to review strategies for 
advancing security and prosperity through international 
conservation.
    We have a terrific panel of witnesses, and I very much look 
forward to your testimony. Ms. Caldwell, Dr. Steer, Mr. 
Sebunya, I appreciate all three of you joining us today.
    I have had the chance to work with you, and to review your 
testimony, and I am very optimistic we will have a positive and 
constructive hearing today.
    I will note at the outset, some of my colleagues may be 
coming and going. There are conflicting hearings today. My 
Ranking Member on this subcommittee, Senator Graham of South 
Carolina, also happens to be the Ranking on the Full Senate 
Judiciary Committee, which is right now having a somewhat 
heated hearing. There is a chance I will step out to go to the 
end of that judiciary hearing, but I will only do so if another 
member comes to take over.
    I think it is critical that we have this hearing. It is the 
first after our budget review hearings in which both the 
Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID testified. I 
think this is a critical topic, critical for the United States' 
place in the world, critical for the relationship between the 
private sector, and philanthropy, and government.
    Those who have worked on, read about, or visited 
conservation programs know what progress on conservation means 
for indigenous communities, for efforts to curb wildlife 
trafficking, and illicit finance, and to improve security and 
for the benefit of livelihoods across the globe, including here 
in the United States. That is why there is robust bipartisan 
and bicameral support for that.
    Like many Members on this Committee, I have had the 
opportunity to visit protected and conserved spaces around the 
world, from Kenya, and Mozambique, and Rwanda, to Namibia, 
Colombia, and Ecuador. I have done them in partner with my 
colleagues, in partner with non-profit organizations, and have 
seen remarkable and impressive examples of what conservation 
that is human centered, that is done in close coordination with 
indigenous communities, and that is well planned, and well 
accounted for, can accomplish.
    We are losing the Earth's most vital spaces, the most 
remarkable parts of creation, at an alarming rate, because of 
logging, rapid human population expansion, the demand for 
agricultural space, for charcoal, for wildfires because of a 
changing climate.
    This is, in part, because the vast majority of gazetted 
parks of notionally protected spaces are underfunded, leaving 
lands at risk of degradation and wildlife at risk from 
poaching. Poaching which, as I have demonstrated in hearings, 
now many years ago, to lay the groundwork for the End Wildlife 
Trafficking Act, funds armed groups and global criminal 
networks that threaten national security, both here and in many 
countries around the world.
    USAID and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have long been 
critical partners in addressing conservation challenges, for 
which Senator Graham and I have worked to increase and sustain 
funding through this subcommittee over many years.
    We also recognize governments cannot possibly address this 
problem alone. I am encouraged; over recent years we have seen 
significant and growing commitments from philanthropic and 
private sector actors to support transnational conservation.
    I am looking forward to hearing, first about how USAID has 
applied lessons learned from its long history working on 
conservation, and how we can strengthen such efforts including 
in partnership with the private sector.
    Senator Graham, and I, along with a bipartisan and 
bicameral group of my colleagues, have proposed legislation to 
leverage these philanthropic commitments, the U.S. Foundation 
for International Conservation Act. This legislation would fund 
new public-private partnerships for the long-term management of 
protected and conserved areas, catalyzing substantial 
additional private investment with a sustained ongoing annual 
amount of additional public financing.
    We will discuss that legislation today and other steps we 
can be taking to advance our global conservation goals in more 
detail.
    Thank you for joining us. I look forward to your testimony. 
And my understanding from Senator Graham is that he will submit 
an opening statement for the record.
    Senator Coons. So with that, I would like to invite our 
three witnesses to begin with your opening statements.
    Ms. Caldwell, we look forward to your comments.
STATEMENT OF MS. GILLIAN CALDWELL, CHIEF CLIMATE 
            OFFICER AND DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR 
            FOR ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY, AND 
            INFRASTRUCTURE, UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR 
            INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
    Ms. Caldwell. Thank you so much, Chairman Coons. And I will 
recognize, in absentia, Ranking Member Graham and other 
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee.
    This hearing and consideration of the International 
Conservation Act come at an important time: nature is facing 
grave and accelerating threats. As you are well aware, alarming 
declines in wildlife populations and the deteriorating health 
of our oceans, forests, and grasslands are nothing short of a 
global crisis.
    We are deeply appreciative of your powerful leadership in 
this area and your recognition of the burning imperative to 
address unprecedented biodiversity loss, occurring at a speed 
and scale that is threatening to undermine the development 
gains that Congress and USAID have worked to secure over 
decades.
    As you explore how this proposed Foundation could help 
address this crisis, I would like to share three key lessons we 
at USAID have learned over more than 30 years about what works 
best for conservation.
    The first is one I know you are already deeply familiar 
with, and it is central to the Act: We must ensure long-term 
investment in priority places and habitats. The importance of 
long-term investment to specific protected areas and the 
communities that live in and around them cannot be understated. 
In key areas, USAID makes those sustained commitments, 
underpinned by rigorous measurement and evaluation. We have 
often funded the same partner for a decade or more, even while 
maintaining competitive procurement because it produces 
results.
    But we know that this kind of long-term conservation 
investment must also work for and with Indigenous Peoples and 
local communities, which is lesson number two. A prime example 
of this is USAID's work in Kenya, which began in the late 1990s 
in partnership with the African Wildlife Foundation and the 
Government of Kenya.
    I am very pleased to be speaking alongside Kaddu Sebunya of 
the Africa Wildlife Foundation today.
    From those early years to now, we focused on strengthening 
local organizations. Today, we support the local Northern 
Rangelands Trust as our lead partner in the area. This decades-
long partnership benefits 630,000 people in 39 community-owned 
and managed conservancies, covering nearly 63,000 square 
kilometers, an area approximately seven times the size of 
Yellowstone National Park.
    In addition, it has created jobs for more than 850 eco 
rangers, reducing poaching, and increasing the elephant, 
giraffe, wild dog, and buffalo populations.
    But as you know, communities, governments, and civil 
society organizations can't do this work alone, which leads me 
to lesson number three: broaden the funding base by engaging 
the private sector, another key proposed feature of your Act.
    We know firsthand that private sector collaboration is 
critical to success in conserving biodiversity and advancing 
development gains more broadly. As of fiscal year 2021, USAID 
had nearly 100 active public-private partnerships in the 
environment sector, with every 1 government dollar matched by 
an average of $3.7 from the private sector. We know your Act 
aims for a minimum of a one-to-one match, and based on our 
experience you should be able to exceed that.
    A prime example of this is USAID's HEARTH Initiative, 
standing for Health, Ecosystems, and Agriculture for Resilient 
Thriving Societies, which is generating cross-sectoral 
partnerships with private-sector partners such as Mars and 
Disney to conserve high biodiversity areas and improve the 
health, well-being, and prosperity of the communities that 
depend on them.
    Seventeen HEARTH activities have been awarded as of March 
2023, using 75 million in public dollars to leverage over $90 
million of private sector funds, with far-reaching benefits. 
For example, through the Gorilla Coffee Alliance in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, USAID, Nespresso, and Olam Food 
Ingredients will invest a combined $12.3 million over 5 years 
to support shade-grown coffee production, sustainable 
agriculture, rural enterprises, improved health, and landscape-
scale governance. Together, this will reduce drivers of 
poaching and deforestation in nearby Kahuzi-Biega National 
Park, home to most of the 6,800 eastern lowland gorillas.
    In conclusion, I hope I have given you an idea of how we 
are addressing long-term conservation efforts, and where our 
experience would be helpful and complementary to the additional 
support envisioned and the new initiatives and private sector 
investments stimulated by the International Conservation 
Foundation Act.
    Private investment needs to significantly outpace 
government investment due to the urgency and scale of the 
crisis. The biodiversity crisis is happening now and it is 
accelerating. The private sector, which relies on strong, 
global economies and vibrant societies, needs to increase its 
investment. The cost of inaction is simply too great.
    Thank you to the subcommittee and Congress for your 
continued support of USAID's efforts to tackle these critical 
conservation challenges. We need your partnership to continue 
to draw on over 30 years on the ground in our partner countries 
to address this existential threat.
    I look forward to answering your questions.
    [The statement follows:]
               Prepared Statement of Ms. Gillian Caldwell
                              introduction
Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, distinguished members of the 
Subcommittee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to testify about U.S. efforts to 
conserve biodiversity and forests, which USAID Administrator Samantha 
Power has called ``one of the most important steps we can take to 
mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss while reducing the risk 
of disease spillover and potential future pandemics.'' We are deeply 
appreciative of your leadership in this area and your continued 
partnership with us to address the biodiversity crisis.
    This hearing and consideration of the International Conservation 
Act (ICA) come at an important time. Nature is facing grave and 
accelerating threats. As you are well aware, alarming declines in 
wildlife populations and the deteriorating health of our oceans, 
forests, and grasslands are a global crisis.
    As you explore how this proposed foundation could help address this 
crisis, I'd like to share some of what we have learned works best for 
conservation. USAID's partners in the developing world are key 
stakeholders in this challenge and in potential solutions to this 
crisis. We focus on both long-term investment in protected and 
community-conserved areas, as well as supporting responses to urgent, 
changing threats. But the speed and scale of the biodiversity crisis is 
threatening to undermine development gains that Congress and USAID have 
worked to secure over decades.
    USAID looks forward to continuing to engage with the Committee on 
the ICA, and we welcome the potential to bring in much needed and 
additional large-scale investment from the private sector, foundations, 
and other philanthropies to address the current crisis.
    In my testimony, I want to underscore the importance of long-term 
investment and also touch on some areas where we would hope to advise 
on best practices to ensure that our actions, and those stimulated by 
this potential bill, would be additive to the global fight against 
biodiversity loss.
    Thanks to the generous support of Congress, USAID invests in 
approximately 60 countries to conserve biodiversity, support 
sustainable fisheries, and fight illegal logging, wildlife trafficking 
and other nature crimes. Over the past several decades, we have honed 
our approach to this crucial work, from supporting the development and 
management of protected areas, to partnering with Indigenous 
communities on community-led conservation efforts, to establishing 
large public-private partnerships to ensure sustainably sourced 
products and livelihoods for local communities. Along the way, we have 
sought balance between nimble action and a strategic, consultative 
process with appropriate safeguards. Our strategic approach to policies 
and programmatic investments has been informed--and refined--by 
experience and cutting-edge evidence and analysis.
    Today, the vast majority of USAID's biodiversity funding goes to 
direct bilateral programs on the ground with key country partners like 
Mozambique, Colombia, and the Philippines--or to regional initiatives 
in key biodiversity hotspots like the Congo Basin--because that is 
where we see the greatest impact and greatest return on investment of 
the funds invested by Congress.
    Given our 60 years on the ground in the countries where we work, 
USAID has a proven track record and longstanding relationships in these 
countries, from key ministries to Indigenous community organizations to 
community conservancies. We have well-established strategies and 
rigorous monitoring and evaluation systems to ensure results and 
accountability.
    We know that protected areas require three things to flourish: (1) 
long-term investment, (2) supported economic, livelihood and social 
opportunities for local communities, and (3) private- sector 
engagement. With these three pillars in place, protected areas provide 
conservation benefits, regional stability, food security, and economic 
growth.
    Let me give you a few examples of where we are seeing the greatest 
impacts, the best opportunities for lessons learned in long-term 
programming as well as opportunities for growth.
 lesson #1: ensure long-term investment in priority places and habitats
    The importance of long-term investment to specific protected areas, 
and for the communities that live in and around them that need to 
thrive for conservation to succeed, cannot be understated. USAID 
typically funds in five-year program increments. That ensures that we 
have the ability to measure, evaluate and learn before we invest 
further resources in a program. In key areas, we make a sustained 
commitment to particular places and challenges, and have often funded 
the same partner for a decade or more even while maintaining 
competitive procurement processes. We have also fostered the transition 
from international NGO project management to local NGO leadership, 
often supporting the same place for the long term, while shifting, when 
possible, from international to local partners for implementation.
    Nowhere is this long-term support more important than the Congo 
Basin in Africa, which contains the world's second largest contiguous 
rainforest and carbon reserve, and is home to a rich array of wildlife 
including four species of great apes and forest elephants as well as 
nearly 80 million people representing 150 distinct cultural groups. 
This critically important rainforest is under threat from unsustainable 
logging and competing land use for agricultural commodities.
    For over twenty years, USAID has invested in Congo Basin 
conservation at scale across 11 landscapes covering over 80 million 
hectares. In the 1990s, we developed a twenty-year vision for 
investment in these landscapes that started with a focus on management 
planning and ecological monitoring, the quintessential example of long-
term investment. Today we work with communities, businesses and 
governments to conserve landscapes anchored by well-managed protected 
areas, with much deeper and more extensive work to help rural people 
participate in and benefit from natural resource management. This 
includes policies and industry partnerships that help promote 
sustainable cocoa and coffee industries to lift people out of poverty 
and reduce pressure on forests and species.
    In FY 2022, USAID support to protected areas and community forests 
in the Congo Basin improved natural resource management of nearly 9 
million hectares--an area roughly the size of Indiana--and tripled the 
number of people benefiting from this work, from 30,205 in 2021 to 
96,331 in 2022. Support for training, equipment, and infrastructure 
facilitated 355,000 kilometers of patrols, which led to 207 arrests for 
wildlife crime. This law enforcement success depends on complementary 
investments in conservation-friendly enterprises to reduce local 
motivation to commit crime, as well as judicial sector capacity to 
ensure arrests turn into prosecutions and appropriate sentences.
    Our long-term initiative in the Congo has generated important 
lessons in protected area management, such as the best balance between 
core protected area management, community support and engagement; 
private sector partnerships and landscape planning. Each of these, 
intentionally monitored and assessed, are key components to conserving 
the Congolese landscape. FY 2021 funds supported work to strengthen at 
least 200 government-managed protected areas and 250 community-managed 
protected areas. The resulting protected areas, combined with land-use 
planning, trade, and other policy measures are working to provide the 
security, connectivity, and resilience needed to conserve strong 
functioning ecosystems into the future.
    A critical--and related--part of our programming is addressing the 
illegal harvest and collection of biodiversity. For example, we 
invested almost $56 million in FY 2021 funds to support the reduction 
of poaching and illegal trade in animals--including illegal extraction 
of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. USAID's comprehensive 
strategy is responsive to the constantly changing threats of poaching 
and wildlife trafficking, and it strengthens law enforcement from parks 
to ports, reduces consumer demand for illegal wildlife products, and 
builds international cooperation.
  lesson # 2: make conservation work for indigenous peoples and local 
                              communities
    Second, we know from experience that conservation work must be done 
in close collaboration with Indigenous Peoples and local communities 
that have coexisted with nature for millennia in these beautiful and 
diverse habitats. For more than 30 years, USAID has led on community-
based conservation, growing areas under conservation and linking 
government protected areas with community conserved areas. Good 
conservation is good development. Many communities depend on 
biodiversity for their food, water, housing, livelihoods and cultural 
way of life.
    For example, in the late 1990s we started work in northern Kenya in 
partnership with the Kenyan government and African Wildlife Foundation 
and I am pleased to join Kaddu Sebunya at this hearing today. That work 
focused on community-led conservation and building local leadership in 
conservation action. Today we continue that work with one such local 
organization, the Northern Rangelands Trust. This innovative 
partnership benefits 630,000 people in 39 community-owned and managed 
conservancies covering nearly 63,000 square kilometers (approximately 
seven times the size of Yellowstone National Park). This partnership is 
creating space for the 65 percent of Kenya's wildlife populations that 
utilize community lands outside of protected areas. The partnership 
also develops new economic opportunities, adding value to the livestock 
market chain with an average $1-1.5 million annual revenue generated, 
empowering more than 1,000 women through beadwork enterprises, 
diversifying tourism opportunities that produce an average $900,000 
income annually, and generating market- based conservation financing 
options for conservancies. I visited this project last Fall and was 
able to witness the benefits first hand. I broke ground on a new 
maternity clinic in an area that was suffering from unnecessary deaths 
during childbirth due to the distance women had to travel for care, and 
I saw solar powered wells in operation. Now this community is 
benefiting from conservation finance, with conservation funding paying 
for the maternity clinic. That is the power of community-led efforts.
    This partnership with the Northern Rangelands Trust has helped to 
employ 858 eco-rangers, reducing poaching and increasing the elephant, 
giraffe, wild dog, and buffalo populations across the 39 conservancies. 
The partnership has also trained hundreds of community rangers 
responsible for the protection of 45,000 square kilometers. The 
organization empowers communities to manage sustainable businesses 
linked to conservation. Challenges continue to exist, for example--the 
current severe drought is impacting communities, and the survival of 
livestock and wildlife. Finding solutions to new and existing issues is 
a work in progress and emphasizes the need for our continued prolonged 
engagement, social and natural science monitoring, and continued 
adjustment and collaboration with communities to achieve long term 
results.
    We also work in marine protected areas that are critical for food 
security. For example, over the past three decades, USAID and the 
Philippines have worked together to address illegal, unreported and 
unregulated (IUU) fishing to protect the country's aquatic resources to 
ensure long-term sustainable use of the area's resources and strengthen 
livelihoods for local fishers and communities. Since 2018, USAID 
programs have helped protect over 2.5 million hectares of oceans, an 
area about as big as Lake Erie. Efforts also include expanding habitat 
and fisheries of municipal marine waters. In 2022, USAID and the 
Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resource developed the 
country's first IUU Fishing Index and Threat Assessment Tool in 
municipal waters and in the fisheries management areas of the South 
China Sea, where violation of the Philippines exclusive economic zone 
by People's Republic of China fishing vessels has been occurring. The 
tool has been used by 28 percent of local government units nationwide 
in assessing IUU fishing. USAID's decades-long partnerships in the 
Philippines have also focused on strengthening the rights of Indigenous 
Peoples with ancestral domains, helping to ensure long-term sustainable 
use of the area's resources.
  lesson # 3: broaden the funding base by engaging the private sector
    We know that communities, governments, and civil society 
organizations can't do this alone. Private sector collaboration is 
critical to success in this area, so I want to highlight some of the 
success that USAID has had as part of our approach. As of FY 2021, 
USAID had nearly 100 active Public Private Partnerships in the 
environment sector, with every one government dollar matched by an 
average of 3.7 dollars from private sector actors.
    American companies depend on well-managed natural resources in 
developing countries for stable and sustainable supply chains, but 
there are extensive threats to the resource base: unsustainable 
expansion for agriculture and livestock, climate change-influenced 
rainfall and temperature fluctuations, unsustainable over-harvesting of 
fish, illegal logging, wildlife poaching, and other nature crime, and 
illegal or unsustainable extraction of resources in and around 
protected areas.
    USAID's HEARTH initiative (Health, Ecosystems, and Agriculture for 
Resilient, Thriving Societies) is generating cross-sectoral 
partnerships with private sector actors to conserve high- biodiversity 
areas and improve the health, well-being, and prosperity of the 
communities that depend on them. By working together through HEARTH, 
USAID and the private sector can more effectively achieve our shared 
goals for a healthier and more prosperous world. Other private sector 
partners include large global brands such as Mars, Olam, and Disney, as 
well as smaller companies working in and around important biodiversity 
landscapes.
    Seventeen HEARTH activities have been awarded as of March 2023, 
using $75 million in public dollars to leverage over $90 million of 
private sector funds, with far-reaching benefits. In West Africa, the 
HEARTH RESTORE activity is increasing tree cover in cocoa landscapes in 
Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire while improving farmer livelihoods. These 
investments, supported by a combined $14 million from USAID and its 
private sector partners, will reduce pressure on wildlife and protected 
areas while restoring forest corridors for improved connectivity. The 
activity will support 15,000 smallholder cocoa farmers by 2027 to use 
more resilient agricultural practices, of which at least 50 percent 
will be women and youth. Through the Gorilla Coffee Alliance, a HEARTH 
partnership with Nespresso and Olam Food Ingredients in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, we will invest a combined $12.3 million over 5 years 
to support sustainable agriculture, rural enterprise, improved health, 
and landscape-scale governance. These actions aim to reduce drivers of 
poaching and deforestation in nearby Kahuzi-Biega National Park, home 
to most of the world's 6,800 eastern lowland gorillas. In 2022, its 
first year, the Alliance produced over 1 million coffee seedlings, 
distributed 431,000 seedlings to 1,500 farmers, and trained nearly 
5,000 farmers (nearly half women) in regenerative agriculture 
practices.
    USAID has also funded conservation in Guatemala's Maya Biosphere 
Reserve, the largest protected area in Central America and a seat of 
ancient Mayan civilization, for more than three decades. This work, 
which is ongoing, strengthens the conservation of biodiversity, 
protected area management, environmental governance, civil society, and 
Indigenous communities' participation in the Mesoamerican tropical 
humid forest of Guatemala-Belize-Mexico, a trinational region 
recognized as the ``Selva Maya.'' Conservation efforts in the Selva 
Maya continue to be threatened by illegal logging and unmanaged 
agricultural expansion.
    Despite these pressures in this critical conservation area, over 
the last decade, USAID and our partners created more than 25,000 
permanent and seasonal jobs, generated over $55 million in sales of 
products and services, and invested up to 30 percent of profits into 
local schools, rural infrastructure, healthcare, and scholarships--all 
while reporting a net-zero deforestation rate. In total, communities 
we've worked with on sustainable forestry across Guatemala have made 
about $200 million. The model of community forestry concessions has 
been so successful at reducing deforestation that the Government of 
Guatemala recently renewed them for another 25-year term while 
expanding the area under community management.
    USAID's partnerships with the private sector are informed by our 
long-term presence and understanding of the local context. We tailor 
our approach to meet the scale of the opportunity, from supporting 
locally-owned enterprises around protected areas to greening global 
supply chains. We are always seeking partners whose core business 
interests align with opportunities to contribute to economic 
development while better conserving biodiversity in critical landscapes 
and seascapes.
                               conclusion
    In conclusion, the biodiversity crisis is happening now and it is 
accelerating--and the private sector, which relies on strong global 
economies and vibrant societies, needs to increase its investment. 
USAID has been and continues to invest in the long-term conservation 
efforts necessary for the sustainability of protected and community 
conserved areas and the communities that depend on them. We look 
forward to continuing to work with the Committee to maximize private 
sector investment in conservation. In fact, we believe there is 
potential for even more than a 1:1 match to truly harness the power of 
the private sector. The cost of inaction is simply too great.
    We look forward to engaging with Congress on the Act and on our 
Biodiversity policy which will be released this fall. The policy builds 
on USAID's deep commitment to support strong, more resilient landscapes 
and seascapes for long-term conservation for the benefit of local 
communities and the global good. We look forward to our continued 
dialogue to discuss how our work can best address the global 
biodiversity crisis.
    Thank you to the Subcommittee and Congress for your continued 
support of USAID's efforts to tackle these critical conservation 
challenges, and I look forward to answering your questions. We need 
your partnership to address this existential threat.
    I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, so much Ms. Caldwell.
    Mr. Sebunya.
STATEMENT OF MR. KADDU SEBUNYA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF 
            EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AFRICAN WILDLIFE 
            FOUNDATION
    Mr. Sebunya. Thank you, Chairman Coons. I recognize the 
Ranking Member, Senator Graham, and the distinguished Members 
of the Subcommittee. I am grateful for the opportunity.
    More than 3 million square miles managed as Africa's 
protected and conserved areas provide clean air, water, flood 
control, disease control, climate regulation, and a host of 
other life support services, to billions of Africans on the 
Continent.
    American support for balancing conservation and development 
on the Continent is welcome and important; however, for this 
support to be effective it must be tied to African 
perspectives, priorities, and aspirations. Experience has shown 
us that conservation characterized by isolated interventions 
parachuted in with well-meaning but extremely driven--
externally driven has been insufficient.
    African conservation requires investments in solutions that 
address complex realities, and rapidly emerging conservation 
challenges facing the Continent and its leaders. Addressing 
these challenges requires building African practitioners who 
are rooted in their communities, landscapes, and socio-
political contexts, leaders who can develop locally relevant 
solutions, and national movements that, correctively, have the 
potential to bring large-scale change. These leaders can be 
your partners.
    It is my conviction that the survival of a health ecosystem 
in Africa hinges largely on one factor, linking Africa's 
conservation agenda in meaningful ways to the aspirations and 
mindsets of African people.
    I believe that the solution to conservation in Africa is in 
finding the balance between conservation and development. I am 
certain that effective conservation must reinforce and 
complement economic development. Support for conservation 
shouldn't be only for animals and their habitats, but for 
putting in place sustainable economic models that empower 
people, and allow nature to thrive.
    Therefore, the conservation money on the ground in Africa 
should promote democracy, reduce threats to terrorism, provide 
natural-based solutions to climate change, advanced green 
growth and economies, and increase state security. The good 
news is Africa is already aligned to conservation approaches to 
deliver this.
    In July last year, at the first ever, Africa Protected 
Areas Congress, Africa agreed to an African-led conservation 
plan that provides unparalleled opportunity and means for the 
U.S. to engage with Africa and hold us accountable for 
conservation and development at a continental level.
    I believe that to secure protected areas, you need an 
investment ratio of $1 to $2, meaning for every dollar spent 
inside a protected area you need to spend another two outside, 
that investment in communities around protected areas, is how 
AWF has been successful in securing wildlife habitats.
    Protected areas across Africa are the size of Australia, 
largely the budgets are ineffective, mostly are managed at 50 
U.S. dollars per square mile, in comparison to Yellowstone 
managed at $3,700 per square kilometer.
    I have personally worked on the U.S.-funded programs that 
build lasting, impactful, African environmental institutions, 
with the USAID, Peace Corps, State Department, and other U.S. 
entities. We created the environmental authorities across 
Africa in 1990s, creation of ministries of environment in the 
1980s, national park services, and wetland authorities. Those 
investments are what helped in protecting 30 percent of the 
global biodiversity now under threat on the Continent.
    Thank you, because we need U.S. to continue to lead. It 
allows us to put nature at the center of cooperation on 
economic growth, climate mitigation, and adaptation, a 
sustainable energy transition, conflict resolution, prevention 
of future pandemic, and the reduction of terrorism.
    I would like to thank the Subcommittee on the State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for this opportunity. 
The U.S. Foundation for International Cooperation Act has a 
potential to be a transformative influence in international 
conservation landscape.
    But for this new mechanism to truly succeed, it mustn't 
perpetuate past mistakes. The African Wildlife Foundation looks 
forward to continuing the partnership of this ambition by 
promising the journey together.
    I thank you for the opportunity. And I wait to answer your 
questions, sir. Thank you.
    [The statement follows:]
              Prepared Statement of Mr. Kaddu Kiwe Sebunya
    On behalf of the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), I thank the 
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for 
this opportunity to submit testimony. We are grateful for your 
continued leadership and championing support towards International 
Conservation.
    Over 6 million square kilometers managed as Africa's protected and 
conserved areas provide clean air and water, flood control, disease 
control, climate regulation, and other life support services for the 
billions of Africans on the continent of all humanity. They are 
reservoirs of biodiversity, part of the toolkit for addressing climate 
change, sources of spiritual and cultural value, and a natural heritage 
for all.
    Climate change is threatening food security, health, and well-being 
with related displacement and forced migration for countries hardest 
hit by desertification, floods, rising sea levels, and other natural 
disasters. The East African region, for example, has been facing the 
worst drought in decades, predicted to impact over 36.1 million people 
in the Horn of Africa alone. For Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, this 
entails over USD 2.68 billion to support critical sectoral needs 
(water, food, and pasture) up to July 2023. All these have significant 
implications for arable and habitable land, and access to water, 
especially as the region continues to urbanize.
    Diseases of high risk to humans are on the rise as globalization 
and an increase in unsustainable land and resource use continue to put 
humans into close contact with each other and wildlife. The COVID-19 
pandemic has demonstrated that emerging infectious diseases are a 
threat to economies and lives across the globe and that the status quo 
of disease response is inadequate. While the spectrum of emerging 
diseases is large, the majority have origins in wild animals. Efforts 
to address the socioeconomic impacts of emerging diseases have 
primarily focused on mitigation after emergence rather than containing 
diseases closer to their source in wild animals. Conservation of 
wildlife and natural areas presents an opportunity to prevent the 
transmission of diseases from wildlife to humans at the local scale.
                 importance of locally led-conservation
    American support for balancing conservation and development on the 
continent is welcome and vital. However, for this support to be 
effective, it must be tied to African perspectives, priorities, and 
aspirations. Conservation characterized by isolated interventions 
parachuted with well-meaning but externally driven motives is 
insufficient and counter-productive. African conservation requires 
investment in solutions that address the complex realities and rapidly 
emerging conservation challenges facing the African continent and its 
leaders. Addressing these challenges requires leaders rooted in their 
communities, landscapes, and social and political contexts. Leaders who 
can develop locally relevant solutions and national movements that 
collectively have the potential to bring large-scale change. These 
leaders can be your partners.
    The long-term success of balancing conservation and development on 
the continent can be better achieved with the continued support of 
partners in the U.S. who play a critical role in ensuring Africa 
thoughtfully conserves its wildlife and wildlands. For example, the 
Africa Protected Areas Congress (APAC) is an African-led initiative 
coming at a critical juncture. APAC provides an unparalleled 
opportunity for the U.S. and other development partners to learn of 
African priorities and a continental engagement on conservation and 
development.
                 supporting people-centred conservation
    Putting people at the center of effective and equitable 
conservation is a concept AWF has proven to live by through our more 
than 60 years of experience in conservation on the continent. This is 
why recommend that U.S. support for International Conservation must 
uplift Indigenous Peoples, local communities, women, and youth, working 
in partnership with governments, civil society, and private actors to 
sustain the scientific and traditional knowledge, and customary 
approaches that will result in effective conservation and the long-term 
resilience of nature, culture, livelihoods, and human well-being. Over 
the decades, the United States support for International Conservation 
was critical in promoting the engagement of local communities in 
conservation through the development of community conservation areas in 
many African countries. Through support from U.S. agencies, AWF was at 
the forefront of establishing community conservancies in Kenya and 
Namibia, Wildlife Management Areas in Tanzania, wildlife ranches in 
Uganda, community forest reserves in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
and other community natural resources management programs across the 
continent.
        a holistic integrated landscape approach to conservation
    It has become increasingly apparent that conservation cannot be 
done without other land use activities and development goals. The 
failures of the fortress approach to conservation in Africa are evident 
reminders of the need to forge a uniquely African development model 
that safeguards biodiversity, secures ecosystem services, and delivers 
economic benefits to communities and local and national economies. 
United States support can help advance a holistic, integrated approach 
to conservation through multifaceted and well-coordinated partnerships 
and consortiums formed and driven by experienced entities with local 
trust and international influence and relationships, the capacity to 
attract and manage large budgets, and access to skills and technologies 
necessary for planning and execution.
                      building wildlife economies
    Intact landscapes and thriving wildlife populations have vast 
potential to contribute to socioeconomic development. However, wildlife 
conservation is frequently seen as a cost to governments, resulting in 
little investment in wildlife resources despite the extensive 
contributions that the wildlife economy can make. Wildlife conservation 
does contribute to local, national, and regional economies in terms of 
employment and revenues, as well as in terms of livelihoods and 
subsistence. The wildlife economy offers the opportunity to turn 
conservation into a growth industry, attracting young, inspired 
leaders, increasing private sector investment in wildlife resources and 
related businesses, involving communities, and increasing their 
benefits and nature/wildlife becoming more abundant. Governments must 
see wildlife as a critical strategic asset, investing in this asset, 
creating an enabling environment for the wildlife economy and, 
therefore, resulting in the conservation of related wildlife resources.
    Importantly, wildlife economies provide avenues to ensure 
conservation in Africa is sustainable through generating revenues for 
livelihoods and reinvestment into conservation programs. U.S. support 
is critical to stimulate the growth of wildlife economies on the 
continent. Five essential areas for investment are crucial to unlocking 
and growing wildlife economies across the continent, including--
strengthening policy, legal and regulatory provisions governing natural 
resources, particularly property rights over wildlife, forests, and 
fisheries; improving the overall business environment to attract 
investment; promoting collaborations and partnerships; improving 
transparency and data collection; and building capacity of all 
stakeholders to engage in, and manage, the wildlife economy.
        combatting wildlife trafficking and other nature crimes
    U.S. Congress-directed funding to combat illegal wildlife 
trafficking has enabled African countries to combat poaching on the 
ground and the trafficking of wildlife. The U.S. support through 
instruments such as the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) 
Wildlife Trafficking Act in 2016 and other measures has allowed for 
innovative and collaborative approaches that strengthened in-country, 
regional, and continental level enforcement. The removal of two African 
countries, Kenya and Uganda, from the 'gang of eight' countries can be 
partly attributed to the support afforded by the United States. 
Although much has been achieved, wildlife poaching and trafficking 
remain challenging in Africa. It is imperative to protect and build on 
the gains achieved so far in combatting wildlife trafficking in Africa.
    Although much has been achieved, wildlife poaching and trafficking 
remain challenging in Africa and cannot be addressed in isolation. 
Wildlife crimes are frequently associated with other nature crimes, 
including criminal forms of mining, logging, fishing, and land 
conversion. The challenge is that current efforts to combat these 
crimes are highly fragmented and can only bring incremental gains 
instead of transformative interventions. Therefore, efforts by 
governments and law enforcement bodies, civil society, donors, 
companies and financial institutions, and local communities must be 
coordinated and collaborative across these types of crimes. Fundamental 
to these efforts is continued investment in community awareness and 
working with communities for their buy-in in protecting wildlife 
resources.
 mainstreaming conservation in delivery of the u.s.-africa partnership
    U.S. support for African conservation through International 
Conservation is critical but cannot guarantee success. Development 
approaches in other sectors, such as agriculture, mining, health, 
security, manufacturing, and industry, pose severe threats to Africa's 
ecosystems and wildlife. Thus, unless Africa assumes a sustainable 
development pathway, biodiversity loss will continue undermining our 
global success in addressing climate change, pandemics, and pollution, 
among other crises. We must acknowledge that global targets cannot be 
met unless Africa defines a different path than ``develop now and clean 
up later.'' President Biden's efforts to reinvigorate the U.S.-Africa 
partnership provide a pivotal platform to confront modern challenges, 
putting nature at the centre of cooperation toward economic growth, 
climate mitigation, adaptation, just energy transition, conflict 
resolution, and global health that contributes to preventing future 
pandemics. Conservation of Africa's natural infrastructure must be 
integrated into investment, trade, and development programs under the 
reimagined U.S.-Africa partnership.
                  sustainable finance for conservation
    Funding shortfalls are a source of the problems plaguing African 
protected area systems. Currently, African-protected and conserved 
areas receive only 10% of what is needed for effective management. Most 
African protected and conserved areas are under-resourced, managed on 
$50 per km\2\ rather than the $1,000 per km\2\ needed. A survey 
conducted by AWF found severe budget shortfalls among 70% of the 700 
protected and conserved areas consulted, and an astonishing 9% don't 
have a budget at all. To reverse this trend and effectively manage all 
protected and conserved regions on the African continent, $2.6-$6.7 
billion is needed annually. If this shortfall is not addressed 
urgently, the consequences will be dire with at least 70 percent of 
people depending on natural resources for their livelihoods, living in 
poverty.
    Committing to ambitious targets such as conserving 30% of land and 
30% of oceans under the new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity 
Framework, Africa needs to protect critical habitats and halt 
biodiversity loss and extinction while advancing benefits to people, 
economic growth, and recovery. Significant well-structured investment 
is required for adequate financing for protected areas and effective 
management to achieve these multiple objectives. The U.S. government 
has supported several African countries' protected areas management and 
advanced other effective area-based measures, such as conservancies and 
other community natural resource management programs. However, a more 
sustainable mechanism for financing Africa's natural infrastructure is 
more critical now than ever.
    The U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act has the 
makings to be an influential wheel in the international conservation 
landscape. It has long been evident that government funding is 
insufficient to meet global conservation challenges and opportunities. 
Incentivizing and challenging philanthropy to match U.S. government 
financing to provide long-term, predictable funding for effective 
management of protected and conserved areas will be crucial in building 
the river of conservation financing to ensure that these strongholds of 
biodiversity continue to provide economic, environmental, social, and 
cultural benefits locally and globally. The Foundation must be built on 
the premise that it prioritizes projects with host-country government 
and local community support and that creates economic opportunities.
    For this new mechanism to truly succeed in supporting the long-term 
conservation of critical landscapes, it mustn't perpetuate past 
mistakes. Firstly, the Foundation needs to advance holistic 
conservation approaches to ensure protected areas do not increasingly 
become islands isolated from other conservation areas and alienate 
people from nature. Secondly, resources for conservation need to reach 
where they are required most--the communities that live side by side 
with wildlife. Lastly, we can scale impact from limited resources only 
if we work collaboratively with stakeholders. Focusing resources on a 
few parks will bring gains but will not be transformative or reach the 
scale required.
    In closing, we encourage continued robust U.S. investments in 
international conservation to respond to pressing and intertwined 
challenges--the rapid loss of nature and biodiversity on a global 
scale, the global climate crisis, and the threat to global health and 
the economy posed by the spillover and spread of zoonotic diseases that 
can lead to future pandemics. These challenges have roots in the loss, 
degradation, and over-exploitation of nature. The United States is 
central in helping galvanize global action, ambition, and investments 
to address these problems. International conservation investments are 
among the most straightforward and cost-effective solutions to 
addressing them and their threats to the United States and U.S. 
interests abroad. Developed countries like the United States are 
critical partners in this respect.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Sebunya.
    Last, we turn to Dr. Andrew Steer, President and CEO of the 
Bezos Earth Fund.
STATEMENT OF DR. ANDREW STEER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF 
            EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BEZOS EARTH FUND
    Dr. Steer. Thank you very much, Chairman Coons, Senator 
Schatz, it is an honor to be with you today. I am Andrew Steer, 
the president CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund, prior to this I was 
president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.
    The Earth Fund is a philanthropy founded by Jeff Bezos in 
2020. Our mission is to allocate boldly and wisely, $10 billion 
in grants by 2030, to reverse the loss of nature and address 
climate change. So far, we have pledged $3 billion in grants 
for nature; $1 billion to conserve the nature we still have, $1 
billion to restore what is lost, and $1 billion to help 
transform agriculture to increase food whilst taking pressure 
off the land.
    We look forward to working in partnership with the exciting 
proposed U.S. Foundation for International Conservation, we are 
discussing today.
    We are all very familiar with the accelerating loss of our 
beautiful planet, aren't we? The facts are stunning consider 
this, since 1970 one species, Homo sapiens, which is us, has 
doubled our population. During the same period, the total 
population of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, 
has fallen by more than half. We can do much better than this.
    There is good news. A large amount of our globally 
significant biodiversity can be founded--found in a limited 
number of places which makes conserving it easier.
    There is more good news. Last year, almost all of the 
nations of the world, including the United States, agreed to a 
global goal of protecting 30 percent of all the land and ocean 
by 2030. If implemented, this could be a game changer.
    We are learning how critical conservation can be in 
promoting security. Healthy ecosystems can withstand 
disturbances, such as droughts, floods, and storms, which can 
lead to crop failures, and other problems that can destabilize 
a country. Conservation can help reduce the risk of conflict 
over natural resources. Many conflicts throughout history have 
been driven by competition over resources, such as water and 
land.
    Conservation can also prevent illegal exploitation of 
nature which funds conflict and threatens security. Today, 
illegal wildlife trade is funding criminal networks, and 
militias, and poaching is destabilizing economies, decimating 
iconic species, contributing to the spread of zoonotic 
diseases, such as Ebola and SARS.
    There are numerous examples of how conservation can help 
create more stable and secure countries. In my written 
testimony I give examples from Costa Rica, Rwanda, Namibia, and 
the Congo Basin.
    So conservation is a rare win-win-win. Why is it not 
happening faster and better?
    Let me suggest three things that are necessary to unlock 
more progress: Finance, political engagement, and genuine 
partnerships between the public and private sector.
    The proposed bipartisan bill, introduced by Senator Coons 
and Senator Graham, offers all three. First Finance, there 
remains an urgent shortage of funding, addressing this shortage 
by leveraging public with private finance is one of the best 
opportunities for the U.S. Government to enhance its leadership 
in protecting nature and improving security.
    Second, political engagement, while most countries have 
made commitments to increase conservation, many face major 
headwinds from vested interests. In our experience it is highly 
valuable for such leaders to know of the support of the United 
States, and to regularly participate in dialogue with senior 
U.S. politicians.
    Whilst the proposed fund would be formally independent of 
the U.S. Government, it would have government leaders on its 
Board, and would benefit from regular engagement from leaders, 
such as yourself.
    Third, partnership with the private and philanthropic 
sectors, private philanthropy is willing to commit significant 
resources to conservation and plays a highly complementary role 
to public funding. They also like to work in partnership. For 
example, 2 years ago 11 philanthropies, including the Bezos 
Earth Fund, came together to put $5 billion on the table to 
show our seriousness in advancing conservation.
    The work of these and other private funders can be even 
more effective if done in partnership with a proposed 
initiative. Both public and private can reach different places, 
and influence different actors, and both will be more effective 
in the presence of the other.
    Conservation, of course, must be done right. It must be 
owned and driven by host countries, by local inhabitants and 
indigenous people. Too many efforts have failed due to top-down 
measures, and a perception that conservation is imposed from 
Western countries. Conservation programs must focus on jobs and 
livelihoods. The proposed legislation would insist, we believe, 
on best practice.
    In conclusion, the United States has been a global leader 
in conservation for 150 years. When Yellowstone became the 
first national park in 1872, it was also the first such park in 
the entire world.
    When President Teddy Roosevelt created five national parks, 
18 national monuments, 51 bird sanctuaries, and established the 
National Wildlife Refuge System, other countries took notice, 
and the best of them sought to emulate this leadership. The 
best of them still do today.
    There is a big opportunity today for U.S. leadership 
through the proposed U.S. Foundation for International 
Conservation. It can help reduce conflict, and migration, it 
can improve economic opportunity, and can enhance good 
governance, and democracy. It can do this by conserving 
irreplaceable natural beauty, the diversity of life, and the 
goodness of God's creation.
    Thank you.
    [The statement follows:]
                 Prepared Statement of Dr. Andrew Steer
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, Members of the Senate State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee, 
thank you for convening this hearing on international conservation and 
the opportunity to testify. I'm Dr. Andrew Steer, President & CEO of 
the Bezos Earth Fund. Prior to this I was President and CEO of the 
World Resources Institute.
    The Earth Fund is a philanthropy founded by Jeff Bezos in 2020. Our 
mission is to allocate $10 billion in grants by 2030 to protect nature 
and address climate change. We have pledged $3 billion to nature--
including $1 billion to conserving the nature we still have, $1 billion 
to restore what we have lost, and $1 billion to help transform food and 
agriculture to alleviate pressure on nature. In the past 2 years we 
have disbursed $550 million for conservation and restoration.
    We plan to do much more, and we look forward to working in close 
partnership with the proposed Fund we are discussing today.
                     the challenge and opportunity
    We are losing nature at a dangerous rate. The facts are stunning. 
Consider this: since 1970, one species--homo sapiens--has doubled its 
population. (That's us.) During the same period, the total population 
of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians has fallen by more 
than half.\1\
    We all are familiar with the accelerating loss of our beautiful 
planet. Biodiversity loss is everywhere and is accelerating. Nearly 75% 
of land surface and over 85% of wetlands have been altered or lost, and 
more than one million species may be in danger of extinction this 
century, creating grave threats to human health, well-being, food 
security, regional stability, and continued economic success. The world 
has years, not decades, to address biodiversity loss. This means we 
need to find dynamic avenues that create pathways for more conservation 
efforts in some of the most biodiverse and vulnerable parts of the 
world.

Accessed on April 28, 2023. https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is good news. A large amount of our globally significant 
biodiversity can be found in a limited number of places, which makes 
conserving it easier. Over the past decade there has been real 
progress. Globally protected areas have been doubled to 16% of the land 
and 7% of the ocean. But this is not enough. Protected and conserved 
areas have been shown to be one of the most effective tools to conserve 
nature and support the wellbeing of millions of people, when well-
managed and designed to respect the needs and rights of Indigenous 
People and local communities. Protected and conserved areas provide 
benefits to local communities--including fresh water, clean air and 
fertile soil for food production, and poverty alleviation, as well as 
stability and regional security. Additionally, protected areas serve as 
a backbone for the larger landscape scale conservation and restoration 
that is needed.
    Globally, there is growing political momentum in support of 
conservation. Last year almost all the nations of the world, including 
the United States, agreed to protect 30% of the terrestrial, 
freshwater, and marine ecosystems most important for biodiversity by 
2030. This marked a remarkable increase in ambition and, if 
implemented, could be game-changing. Research indicates that sound 
guardianship of 30% of the planet in the most important places for 
biodiversity could protect up to 80% of plant and animal species, and 
secure 60% of the planet's carbon stocks and 66% of the planet's clean 
water.
    It is important to note that to be successful conservation must be 
done right. Most important it must involve and be owned by local 
inhabitants and indigenous peoples. Too many efforts have failed due to 
top-down measures. It must also be scientifically driven, drawing upon 
the highest quality biological and social sciences.
                 conservation, resilience and security
    We are also learning how critical conservation can be in promoting 
security--for communities, countries, and the United States.
    First, conservation helps to protect and preserve ecosystems. 
Healthy and diverse ecosystems maintain soil fertility and provide food 
and clean water. When these ecosystems are healthy, they are better 
able to withstand environmental disturbances such as droughts, floods, 
and storms, which can lead to crop failures, water shortages, and other 
problems that can cause social strife and dislocation and can 
destabilize a country.
    Second, conservation can help to reduce the risk of conflict over 
natural resources. Many conflicts throughout history have been driven 
by competition over resources such as water, land, and timber. By 
conserving these resources and using them sustainably, countries can 
reduce the likelihood of such conflicts arising.
    Third, illegal exploitation of nature can fund conflict and 
threaten stability. Illegal wildlife trade, for example, is funding 
criminal networks and militias. Ivory and rhino horns are a source of 
income for armed groups in Africa. Poaching is destabilizing economies, 
undermining good governance, and decimating iconic species. Illegal 
wildlife trafficking may also contribute to the spread of zoonotic 
diseases, such as Ebola and SARS.
    There are numerous examples of how conservation can help create 
more stable and secure countries. A few examples:

  --Costa Rica\2\.--Costa Rica is known for its commitment to 
        conservation, having protected over 25% of its land area in 
        national parks and reserves. This has helped to create a 
        thriving ecotourism industry, which has become a major source 
        of revenue for the country. By preserving its natural 
        resources, Costa Rica has been able to build a sustainable 
        economy that benefits both the environment and the people.
  --Rwanda\3\.--After the genocide in 1994, Rwanda faced significant 
        challenges in rebuilding its economy and society. The country 
        has made significant progress in recent years, in part due to 
        its focus on conservation. Rwanda has established several 
        national parks and protected areas, including Volcanoes 
        National Park, which is home to the endangered mountain 
        gorilla. This has helped to attract tourists and generate 
        revenue, creating jobs for tens of thousands of people.
  --Namibia\4\.--Namibia has implemented a community-based natural 
        resource management program, which gives local communities the 
        right to manage and benefit from wildlife and other natural 
        resources. This has helped to reduce conflict over resources, 
        while also providing economic opportunities for local 
        communities. As a result, Namibia has seen a significant 
        increase in wildlife populations, including elephants and 
        lions, promoting jobs and stability.
  --Congo Basin\5\.--The Congo Basin is a region of immense ecological 
        importance, home to some of the world's most biodiverse forests 
        and a significant proportion of Africa's wildlife. However, the 
        region is facing significant threats from deforestation, 
        mining, and other human activities. Conservation efforts in the 
        Congo Basin have focused on protecting key areas of forest and 
        wildlife habitat, as well as supporting sustainable livelihoods 
        for local communities. Through these efforts, conservation has 
        helped to reduce conflict over natural resources, promote 
        sustainable economic development, and preserve the rich 
        biodiversity of the Congo Basin.

                            what's missing?
    Conservation is a rare win-win-win. So why is it not happening 
faster and better? Let me suggest three things that are necessary to 
unlock more progress: finance, political engagement, and genuine 
partnerships between public and private sectors. The proposed 
bipartisan bill, introduced by Senator Coons and Senator Graham, offers 
all three.
    Finance.--The lack of funding is a major obstacle to the effective 
management of protected and conserved areas. Addressing the lack of 
financial resources--especially long-term funding--by creating a new 
public-private partnership is one of the best opportunities for the 
U.S. government to enhance its role in protecting biodiversity and 
improving security. A new public-private partnership can mobilize 
significant new funding from both public and private sources to address 
the funding gap and provide the long-term funding required for the 
effective management of protected and conserved areas.
    This common-sense bill would empower a new entity to leverage 
private funding toward the goal of conserving the most vulnerable parts 
of the world. By passing this legislation, the U.S. Congress would 
advance its leadership in enabling more public-private investment in 
global conservation.
    Political Engagement.--While most countries in the world have made 
a commitment to increase conservation under the ``30x30'' pledge, many 
face major headwinds from vested interests. In our experience it is 
highly valuable for such leaders to know of the support of the U.S., 
and to regularly participate in dialog with senior U.S. politicians. 
While the proposed fund would be formally independent of the U.S. 
government, it would be partially funded by it, and would, we expect, 
benefit from regular engagement, including in-country visits which 
would engage at the highest levels. This would be a vital complement to 
any financial contributions.
    Partnership with the Private and Philanthropic Sectors.--Private 
philanthropy is committing significant resources to conservation and 
plays a highly complementary role to public funding. One way 
philanthropy has contributed to this agenda is through innovative 
partnership models supporting specific goals. For example, the 
Protecting our Planet (POP) challenge is the largest-ever private 
funding commitment to biodiversity conservation. Eleven 
organizations\6\ have pledged $5 billion in grants to help achieve the 
``30 by 30'' initiative.
    This coalition of philanthropists committing $5 billion has not 
created a new fund. Rather they seek to closely coordinate their work, 
share analysis, and mix funding for specific programs. We prioritize 
efforts with indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as local 
and Federal governments. These private funders are supporting projects 
around the globe that will help achieve the 30x30 initiative as 
proposed by the High Ambition Coalition (HAC) for Nature and People, a 
group of 70 nations. The work of these and other private funders can be 
even more effective if done in partnership with the proposed 
initiative. Leverage will come both from increased financial flows, but 
also from the synergies that arise from public and private actors. Both 
``public'' and ``private'' can reach different places and influence 
different actors, and both will be more effective in the presence of 
the other.
    There are examples of other governments doing similar investments. 
An analogous program, developed by the German government, the Legacy 
Landscape Fund, is successfully providing sustainable funding for the 
effective management of protected and conserved areas in developing 
countries. Importantly, it has unlocked large amounts of private 
dollars and unleashed an entrepreneurial and cost-effective approach to 
conservation. This is critical to closing critical gaps to identify and 
financially support implementation-ready projects.

                               conclusion
    Effectively managed protected and conserved areas that improve 
natural resource management, and restoration of degraded lands have 
been shown to reduce conflict and migration in response to food 
insecurity and drought. They have also protected irreplaceable natural 
beauty and the diversity of life. In addition, the involvement of local 
communities with the effective management of conserved areas, improves 
their economic opportunity and even instills good governance and 
democracy.
    With a focus on protected and conserved areas, this new entity will 
create synergies with efforts by USAID, USFWS, and others to focus on 
other effective conservation measures that are needed to achieve 
landscape scale conservation. These investments collectively represent 
smart U.S. foreign policy and aid. Durable U.S. government funding, 
that leverages private sector resources, will help ensure this 
leadership is valued and our core economic and national security 
interests are advanced.
    Thank you.

    Senator Coons. Thank you very much and thank you to our 
panel.
    We are going to start with a round of questions. I have one 
colleague with me now. We will see whether we have others join. 
In the absence of others, I will simply indulge myself in the 
second round, of unlimited length I suspect.
    [LAUGHS]
    Dr. Steer, if I might, with you. You cited some really 
remarkable, impressive numbers there, of billions of dollars of 
philanthropy dedicated to conservation into protecting 
biodiversity. What is the best argument for why there needs to 
be a partnership between government, philanthropy, and the 
private sector? Why is there a role for government in doing 
this? Why not simply rely on a handful of visionary donors, 
unrestrained by the vagaries of politics, and the accounting 
and auditing requirements of spending public dollars?
    Dr. Steer. Senator, I believe that the--I believe the 
public sector can reach where the private sector can't. When I 
listen to the kinds of visits that you and your colleagues 
make, how wonderful it would be if those conversations that you 
have, which are already very effective, were backed up by 
serious resources that bring both the private and the public 
together.
    We are very, very good at financing non-governmental 
organizations, they have an amazing role to play, as we heard 
today from Mr. Sebunya, you know, and there are many others 
doing world-class work. But the plain fact of the matter is if 
we are going to be effective we need to aim at every single 
level, including the very highest levels of government. And 
that is where you come in, and you are so very, very effective.
    And as I said in my statement, the United States has been a 
leader, and engaging at a senior level makes a huge difference. 
Also, I should say, that you have the capacity by putting 
relatively modest amounts of money in to attract more private 
sector. And that is what the Germans have figured out in their 
Legacy Landscape Program, where they actually match the 
resources that the private philanthropy and private companies 
bring in, and it is really very effective.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Sebunya, you referenced the Africa 
Protected Areas Congress in Kigali, a critical convening in 
which you played a central role, that called for increased 
funding for locally led conservation projects. And it is my 
sense, and all three of you have either referenced or directly 
testified to this, that the gap, the funding gap for 
conservation is dramatic. It outstrips the capacity of any one 
government, even the United States Government, any one national 
government in the developing world, or in the Global South, and 
any particular philanthropy.
    You also pointed to the critical role of indigenous 
communities in identifying, prioritizing, and leading human-
centered development. I think in your testimony you said: The 
fortress model of conservation has demonstrably failed, and we 
need a human-centered and indigenously informed model.
    How do you think we should come up with a valuation plan, a 
selection plan that ensures local ownership? Not just a seat at 
the table, but a driving role in terms of how sites are 
designed, projects are selected, they are prioritized, and they 
are maintained, and then delivered over many years?
    Mr. Sebunya. Thank you, Senator. I think that it is going 
to start by meeting the people where they are. In my travels in 
Africa, and in my discussion with African leaders, and the 
community leaders, they really spend most of the time dealing 
with their human aspirations, dealing with their livelihoods, 
looking at their ambitions. And I think tying the agenda we 
have for conservation as part of the aspirations and outlining 
that is going to be very, very critical.
    At the moment here, most of the discussions on conservation 
are political and economic. And so the role of--and that is 
where the role of private sector and government is critical in 
reaching our goals.
    It is going to be the economy, and that is why we are 
suggesting, if we are to secure a protected area, you are going 
to invest a dollar, but that 2 dollars have to go to meet the 
economic aspirations of the people dealing with wildlife 
economies.
    And we are not talking about tourism alone but: How they 
are going to feed this huge population? How do we invest in 
sustainable agriculture? What value chains can we bring? What 
types of economies are compatible to these wildlife areas? And 
I think that those 2 dollars are most--best suited to come from 
private sector, from impact investors to support those value 
chains.
    But the government has a role in regulating, in creating 
policies that are aligned to community participation, building 
the right governance systems, the deals we want formulated. So 
it is that empowerment through economic and social discussions 
that are going to get us to where we are, and I think it is 
critical that this partnership, this foundation under the 
private sector is going to be extremely helpful in what we are 
trying to achieve.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Ms. Caldwell, you laid out in 
your testimony three critical points. One, broaden the base by 
engaging the private sector to partner closely with indigenous 
communities, but in some ways the central and long-term 
investments, investments informed by rigorous metrics and 
evaluation, USAID has not always been known for the ability to 
sustain across administrations, you know, long-term contracts, 
but you cited several very promising examples, where you have 
accomplished exactly that.
    What, if any, challenges are there, contractually, 
structurally, statutorily, for USAID to do 5- and 10-year 
commitments, that is part of what this foundation model is 
designed to help facilitate, both the metrics and the long 
term?
    In discussing this with Senator Graham, and with others on 
this Committee, and in the House, they have often cited the MCC 
as an example of something that through the Compact process has 
rigorous metrics and long-term engagement.
    I couldn't agree more with your three central points. Help 
me understand what, if any, constraints there are on USAID 
being able to deliver on those long-term investments?
    Ms. Caldwell. Thanks so much, Senator Coons. There is 
nothing that prohibits reinvesting after what is, typically, a 
5-year investment in the programs that we are engaged with. We 
do believe strongly in the importance of competitive 
procurements. We also believe strongly in the importance of 
monitoring, evaluation, and learning.
    So funding in 5-year increments really allows us to kind of 
assess best practice, understand the impact, and make sure our 
investment is well placed. When and if that investment is well 
placed, they are, obviously, likely to succeed in procurement, 
and that investment continues in many instances.
    You also referenced swings in Congress, and that challenge. 
Thankfully, our biodiversity funding has typically been able to 
maintain support through various administrations, but it is a 
real risk. There is nothing more important, I think, for us in 
terms of ensuring longevity as predictability. And many of our 
Missions face highly unpredictable budget levels. So even while 
we may be able to sustain overall support under a given 
earmark, there may be Congressional directives and top lines 
which skew investment into new directions, where there may or 
may not be existing capacity immediately available to deploy.
    So I think, thinking about not just sustaining and 
increasing this kind of biodiversity funding over time, but 
also enabling us to continue to invest in the Missions that are 
really effectively delivering this biodiversity programming, in 
some of the most biodiverse regions of the world is critically 
important.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Senator Schatz.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, all for being here to testify. I am really 
interested in the testimony that talks about the fortress model 
of conservation. One of my proudest achievements, in 
partnership with President Obama's administration, and many, 
many others is the establishment of Papahanaumokuakea Marine 
Monument, and it is, you know, almost 600,000 square miles, and 
I worry very much that it will be a paper monument.
    And so what worries me a bit about the ``30 by 30'' is 
exactly that, is that the sort of geopolitical, diplomatic 
impetus for an announceable will cause a bunch of people to 
declare a bunch of things off limits, and will lack sufficient 
resources to actually manage those terrestrial ecosystems, or 
ocean ecosystems. And I am just wondering how we think about--I 
do think we should have these goals, but I could see a scenario 
where we, superficially, meet that goal and don't actually 
change conditions on the ground.
    And so I would like each one of you to comment on that as 
quickly as you can. I will start on my right, with Dr. Steer.
    Dr. Steer. I agree with you wholeheartedly, Senator Schatz. 
The political attractiveness of 30 by 30 is useful, but it is 
useless unless it is followed up well, and the best examples of 
those need to be replicated. So, for example, in the marine 
area, the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape, where four 
Presidents, Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Panama, got 
together last year and they said: Let us do this, let us use 
this 30 by 30 as a way of getting political and other momentum.
    What happened is, a lot of us were willing to sit down with 
them for, literally, weeks to design something, led by them, 
led by including by the fishing industry.
    And it was so cool at the Biodiversity Convention, up in 
Montreal, to see the Minister of Environment of Ecuador, 
together with the Minister of Fisheries, which is extremely 
rare, announcing the expansion.
    Senator Schatz. Oh. I know. I was the--when I was a 
freshman legislator a hundred years ago, I was the Vice Chair 
of the Ocean and Marine Resources Committee, and I got the--I 
got the baptism in fisheries politics. So I understand what an 
achievement that is.
    And in Papahanaumokuakea, I think is a great example of 
doing it right. I would also, just before I move on to Mr. 
Sebunya, point out the emphasis on stakeholders who are 
indigenous, is really important. I am the Chairman of the 
Senate Committee that has jurisdiction called the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, and its Jurisdiction over Native 
People across the United States.
    But I do want to emphasize that stakeholders are 
stakeholders whether they are indigenous or not. And I don't 
want to get into the blood quantum question, or the question of 
whether you are a lineal descendant of the original people of a 
place. In all seriousness, it can become this dichotomy between 
indigenous and non-indigenous; just as, for example, when we 
established the Northwest Hawaiian Islands Marine Monument in 
Hawaii, we worked with a lot of the fishing community, not all 
of whom are Native Hawaiian. A lot of them are Japanese-
Americans, or Filipino-Americans, and Caucasian-Americans, and 
all the rest of it.
    And so I just want to make sure that when we think about 
stakeholder engagement, it is not just indigenous, non-
indigenous, it is anyone who is a stakeholder who may make a 
living doing something that is going to have to change.
    So Mr. Sebunya, I actually want to ask you a slightly 
different question. Is there a sort of curated list of projects 
that were done right? Because I think that is maybe the most 
important thing. Rather than call out the projects that are 
done wrong, the model that Dr. Steer is talking about, 
Papahanaumokuakea is a good example, I am sure across the 
African Continent there are examples.
    But I think it would be useful to the State Department and 
to the Committee to kind of say: What is the model here, and 
what do they all have in common? And I am wondering if anyone 
has already done that work.
    Mr. Sebunya. Thank you, Senator. And yes, there are a 
number of examples of projects that have gone--done very well. 
And the issue now we are trying to deal with for 60 years work 
in Africa, is how do you scale that up at a level that is 
really impactful on the Continent, for an issue that is not 
only national, but Pan-African, to have that high level impact.
    I will give you an example of the work we have done with 
the USAID, in partnership with the Government of Rwanda and 
Uganda, around the Virungas, around the mountain gorillas, 4 
years ago we have been working there protecting the endangered 
mountain gorilla. We started by protection, that fortress idea, 
training rangers, park management systems, inventories of 
mountain gorillas, then we started introducing tourism as an 
aspect to that.
    We, together with the USAID, we built the first high-end 
lodge in Rwanda and Uganda around the mountain gorillas; these 
two lodges are owned by communities. We raised the bar in terms 
of community participation. At that time community 
participation meant getting African communities to dance for 
tourists, or sell a few crafts, and that was called Eco 
Tourism.
    We built lodges with community equity in it, and then we 
brought in private sector as a management partner of these 
lodges. These two exist, the lodge in Rwanda pumps half-a-
million dollars in the rural economy, in Rwanda around the 
mountain gorillas.
    Rwanda has picked--as a model--Rwanda has picked up 
mountain gorillas as part of their green economies in the 
country as a model.
    Now, what have we achieved? Conservation of mountain 
gorillas; for the last 4 years there is no single mountain 
gorilla that has been killed in both Uganda and the Rwanda, 
except recently, during the COVID, which was in self-defense. 
That is a very good example where we have tied the economy of 
the rural people to be matched by the conservation aspects of 
that National Park, and the identification of their aspirations 
as a people, in line with what is going on, what the ecology, 
ecological systems of this area is.
    Now, we are dealing with the value chains. We are 
introducing bamboo economies in these areas so that people stop 
growing a World Bank project which was passed from another--
agricultural products to start growing bamboo as an agriculture 
economy, which is food for the mountain gorillas, but they are 
going to produce furniture, building materials.
    Senator Schatz. It is $6 a square foot, you know, it is 
very valuable.
    Mr. Sebunya. So that is a very, very good example of what 
it is, right from the national level economy, to the community 
level economy.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, sir. My time is up. Ms. 
Caldwell, I will reduce my question for you, to writing, and 
submit it for the record. Thank you very much.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Schatz.
    Senator Van Hollen, we had a memorable trip to view a 
community conservancy in Kenya, outside of the Maasai Mara, and 
frankly, had one of the most impressive visits I have ever had, 
to see that model, and then a chance to talk to then President 
Kenyatta, about the importance of supporting and preserving 
community conservancy. So thank you for joining us. And I look 
forward to your questions.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, we did. And thank you, Senator 
Coons, for holding this hearing on this important subject, 
international conservation and the connection between 
conservation and security, and prosperity; and thank all of you 
for being here today.
    I am actually going to come back to the issue Senator Coons 
raised. But first, let me just say, we are focused on 
international conservation efforts, and of course it is 
important around the world and in our backyards. I represent 
the State of Maryland, and the Chesapeake Bay is an example of 
an ongoing restoration effort that we have to keep at, and we 
need to bring that same determination to some of these other 
challenges around the world, which is why I am pleased to have 
led the letter seeking support for USAID's budget request for 
biodiversity. And look forward to working with the Chairman and 
the Ranking Member to achieve the budget resources that we need 
to meet the strategy.
    And I do want to say, I know there is been lots of 
conversation, important conversation about what happens when we 
destroy forests, and put biodiversity at risk, from increasing 
the chances of triggering pandemics, and then spreading 
pandemics. To, obviously, the challenge of climate change, and 
what it means when you, you know, cut down trees that provide 
sinks.
    I do want to mention one other thing, because it is another 
practical connection between protecting biodiversity and the 
health and welfare of people around the world, which is the 
development of drugs.
    And I would like to ask you, Ms. Caldwell, just to comment 
on that for a moment. Because as I look at the figures, if you 
look at the--there are about 11 percent of the drugs considered 
basic and essential by the World Health Organization, 
originated in flowering plants. And in the United States 56 
percent of the 150 most-popular prescribed drugs are linked to 
discoveries of natural compounds found in the wild.
    At the current extinction rate experts estimate the Earth 
is losing one major drug every 2 years. So could you just 
comment on this piece of the importance of biodiversity?
    Ms. Caldwell. Well, I think you have already cited some 
statistics which strongly underscore the importance of 
biodiversity. Of course, Western medicine hasn't always 
acknowledged the relevance of traditional medicine, or of 
nature for that matter, in biomimicry in the context of 
responding to disease, and really in terms of articulating 
solutions to so many challenges we face all over the world 
every day.
    There is also the major challenge that the loss of 
biodiversity of course decimates pollinator populations which, 
in turn, has catastrophic impacts on agriculture, so to those 
senators that may be concerned that these biodiversity 
investments overseas don't hit home here, I think it is just so 
important to recognize that we are a globally interconnected 
community; that with the loss of habitat, we will see an 
increase in pandemics; as temperatures rise, we will see 
increasingly virulent viruses; and we will lose the 
biodiversity that our health and ecosystems depend on.
    Senator Van Hollen. Now, I appreciate that. Let me ask you 
about one particular USAID investment. I asked USAID 
Administrator Power about this when she was here. I was on a 
recent trip that Senator Merkley organized, and one of the 
places we stopped was Indonesia, where we have an MOU in the 
works, I am hoping it is going to be finalized, or has been 
finalized. Can you provide an update to the Committee on that?
    Ms. Caldwell. Yes. So since you raised that question with 
Administrator Power, she did--what the Minister of Environment 
and Forest was asking for was a review and acknowledgment that 
the MOU was something the Administrator was prepared to sign. 
She did convey that preparedness and we are now awaiting a 
signature. There was a small edit that the Ministry wanted, 
that has now been made, and we are hopeful that will be 
resolved very soon.
    I, likewise, had the opportunity to visit Indonesia and to 
see the important work we are doing in action, not just with 
the centrally--with the government-managed protected areas, but 
also with the set-asides within the palm oil plantations, to 
ensure sustainability. And of course saw orangutans in the wild 
that are benefiting from, you know, that very intervention.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, I appreciate that. And, you know, 
I hadn't fully realized, before that trip, that Indonesia was 
the only place on earth that is the home to orangutans on two 
of their islands.
    Mr. Sebunya, you were talking about the importance of 
preserving mountain gorillas, and I say: Amen to that. This was 
another example of working to protect biodiversity, generally, 
but also to make sure we protect this very important species, 
that is a fairly close cousin of ours.
    Let me just follow up with some of the issues that you 
raised, and came up on the trip that Senator Coons and I took, 
as well as the issue with respect to Indonesia, and other 
places around the world. Which is, in order to make sure that 
we discourage poaching, and we discourage wildlife trafficking, 
we need to make sure that local populations have alternatives.
    And that means that they are benefiting financially and 
economically from the alternatives we provide. In Kenya, where 
we visited, they adapted a mechanism to make sure that the 
local population was benefiting from tourism, right. That not 
all the--not all the, you know, monies from tourism were 
flowing to a few people, but that the benefits were more widely 
dispersed within the community, which it seems to me an 
essential model if we are going to have a sustainable 
protection of biodiversity.
    Can you talk about some of the more--number one, do you 
agree with that premise? And number two, could you highlight a 
couple of what you think are the most successful examples of 
local communities benefiting from international conservation 
efforts?
    Mr. Sebunya. Thank you, Senator. Yes. I agree with you that 
unless people benefit, unless people lead our efforts, unless 
people are a part of the management systems of our efforts, it 
is going to be very, very expensive for us to secure. The model 
we have that is being practiced in other areas, other than 
Maasai Mara, where we are building forts, islands, or areas, is 
heavily expensive. There is no government, or NGO, or any 
partner who can run a protected area successfully without 
communities.
    From our research tells us that with the poaching, if you 
disrupt the information poachers rely on at the local 
destination, it is going to be very, very hard for them to be 
successful in poaching.
    But also, in order to disrupt that we would need to work 
and increase the value of wildlife, in the eyes of the 
communities near these national parks. Currently, on average in 
Africa, a majority of Africans, value a chicken more than a 
mountain gorilla, or a chicken more than a rhino, simply 
because they can pay school fees with a chicken, they can pay 
their medical bills by selling a chicken. They can't do that 
with a leopard, currently, in many of the areas. They can't do 
that with the lions of the areas. So the more we do programs 
that tie those economies, like you saw in your visits, the more 
successful we can be.
    Maasai Mara is one of the examples, but there are several 
others that tourism, as a business, has helped communities 
benefit directly from wildlife. The challenge with the tourism 
is what we saw during COVID, it can shut down momentarily.
    And, therefore, the diversification of those economies that 
rely on nature is critical for our success. We have seen that 
with tying agriculture products to the sources of water for 
that agriculture as critical elements in some of the 
discussions we are having. Tying the local employment into 
maintaining some of the parks is critical to the--to 
sustainability of wildlife economies in these areas.
    The regulatory regimes to--for that, that allows private 
sector land owners to manage wildlife profitably is also 
critical in those areas. And there are several examples across 
the Continent, Senator.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank all of you.
    And Ms. Caldwell, thank you and the Administrator for 
finalizing the deal on Indonesia. Thank you, all very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    I would like, if I could, just for a moment, Mr. Sebunya, 
to follow up on that point. I was struck at Akagera, Akagera 
National Park in Eastern Rwanda, on a bipartisan bicameral trip 
I led last August, at the number of Rwandans who were visiting 
that National Park, transforming it from a park that had 
initially been a gazetted and established under colonialism, 
but in its current leadership, in its current structure both 
the fee structure, the programming, the outreach, the 
engagement was designed to drive--and during COVID, a vast 
majority of the visitors were Rwandans, and that had been 
holding up even as the pandemic had receded.
    They also had a whole range of innovative programs whether 
it was around aquaculture, beekeeping, harvesting mushrooms, a 
whole series of agricultural initiatives so that it was not 
just employment in the park.
    The other the thing that impressed me in Gorongosa, which 
really, was in some ways, the most significant model I have 
been tracking over more than a dozen years, was the profound 
investment in Mozambican leadership, not just being engaged on 
the periphery, or at the entry level, but training a new 
generation of wildlife conservationists, of managers, of 
leaders, through a world-class training center.
    So I would be interested if you would just comment on--I 
have been to conservancies in countries where the benefits to 
the folks of that country seemed modest, at best. Or more talk 
than reality. And I have been to some where it seemed to me 
that the local community really was directly benefiting, 
driving, prioritizing the activities happening there. How do we 
ensure that is what happens going forward?
    Mr. Sebunya. Thank you, Senator. I think that that model 
you have just mentioned, that the Akagera, Gorongosa, is one of 
the models that has worked. And I think, going forward, is 
really that leadership element you have just mentioned, 
capacity element that needs to be accompanied by the--foreign 
investments in these areas.
    The role of governments in building the value chains that 
support those investments it is going to be critical going 
forward. The idea that these areas are part of the economic 
ecosystem of these areas, managing these areas as landscapes, 
as part of other entities within these regions is also 
critical.
    We have done work in Tanzania where the areas of 
sugarcane--producers of sugarcane that are found miles away 
from the national park, there is a realization that their 
sources of water is from this national park, and tying that 
sugar economy through the management part, is so critical for 
sustainability of financing of these areas.
    So I think that future is really, of those kind of models, 
is I would say in three--mostly in three--summarize them in 
three areas: One, capacity of Africans to play that role they 
should play is critical. The role of government in regulation, 
in policies, in creating financial systems that allow private 
sector, environment that allows private sector to play their 
role is critical.
    And the other one is really for an entity, like us, NGOs, 
or private sector, or government, to have an exit strategy so 
that when you train, when do you engage communities, there is 
also a plan to exit, and they see the future, especially the 
young Africans, that are the majority of--on the Continent. 
That is what they would like to see. They would like to see an 
end, and them taking control over these elements.
    Senator Coons. I couldn't agree with you more. That the 
core challenges today, the vast majority of the population 
looks at a chicken, and says: I see value, I can sell eggs, I 
can eat the chicken, I can sell the chicken. And no value at 
all in things that are considered sort of iconic wildlife that 
seem to inspire the imagination and engagement of those who 
live thousands of miles away, marrying those two, so that there 
is real value that begins with local communities, is critical.
    And over the dozen years I have been communicating with 
Greg Carr, and others at Gorongosa, it has become an initiative 
that really focuses on people, and is driven by people, and it 
benefits wildlife as secondary consequence, not the other way 
around.
    One of the ways I first got involved in this, Ms. Caldwell, 
was a concern about wildlife trafficking, and its consequences 
for security. It is something I know my Ranking Member is also 
quite concerned about. He and I traveled to Rwanda, and one of 
the things that we were talking with the national leadership 
there about was how in Eastern DRC, in Rwanda, and other parts 
of the world, wildlife trafficking really funds lots of other 
trafficking, trafficking of weapons, of drugs, of people, and 
the financing of terrorism.
    The law that Senator Flake and I worked on in 2016, the End 
Wildlife Trafficking Act, authorized the Presidential Task 
Force on Wildlife Trafficking. Senator Portman and I got 
passed, a bill, that the President signed into law last year, 
reauthorizing and extending that.
    Tell me about USAID's investments in protected areas, and 
its work and its partnership with the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, to reduce wildlife trafficking flows, particularly to 
countries like China, and Vietnam, elsewhere in Southeast Asia. 
What more do you think we could do to combat wildlife 
trafficking? And how does that connect with the rest of this 
focus on biodiversity?
    Ms. Caldwell. Absolutely. Well, we were very pleased that 
the End Wildlife Trafficking Act was reauthorized in December 
of 2022, and very much appreciate your leadership on that 
front. For fiscal year 2022, approximately $75 million, or 20 
percent of our budget, our biodiversity budget, was allocated 
to addressing wildlife trafficking.
    Our focus area is largely on building law enforcement 
capacity, so ensuring that the rangers are well trained, 
ensuring that the forensic scientists have the ability they 
need, supporting prosecutors and judges to understand best 
practice in these cases, addressing corruption and 
transparency, which of course are critical issues, and demand 
reduction.
    When it comes to demand reduction, and there was a 
reference, I think, from Senator Schatz, to this effect, China, 
of course, looms large, as do other Asian countries.
    So we have done some very innovative work. In Vietnam, for 
example, we worked with the business community to ensure that 
they were messaging to their own colleagues, that gifts of 
rhino horn do not convey elevated status, that there are other 
ways to convey that status and that appreciation.
    In Thailand we worked with monks to ensure that they were 
communicating with their--you know, with their congregations 
about the fact that tigers won't ensure the protection that 
Thais presumed they would.
    Also, working on a publicly oriented campaign in Thailand, 
called Only Elephants Wear Ivory; and then again in PRC 
addressing rhino, ivory, and pangolin.
    So we try to take a pretty comprehensive look at these 
problems. And as you have mentioned, it relates very much, of 
course, to biodiversity because these are--this is wildlife 
that is on the market, unless we reduce the demand and address 
the crimes as they take place, you know, that kind of activity 
will continue. Likewise, it emphasizes the importance of local 
livelihoods, which have been so heavily underscored.
    I, myself, also had an opportunity to visit Greg Carr in 
Gorongosa, and would absolutely highlight that as best 
practice. I mean there is a community of 200,000 people 
surrounding that park who are getting health care, and 
education, and training, and again, that sort of one-of-a-kind 
investment in leadership. So we, really, have parks that are 
managed by and for Africans is so critical.
    Senator Coons. Let me ask one brief follow-up question, 
then I am going to defer to my Ranking Member.
    In terms of implementers of that law enforcement training, 
that is a key piece of countering poaching, and ending wildlife 
trafficking. The SFOPS Bill requires more active oversight. How 
is that playing out? How is that working out, oversight of 
those who are implementing law enforcement activities?
    A lot of this happens in very difficult, unstable 
locations, Eastern DRC, for example, is a difficult place in 
which to conduct counter-poaching activities, because there is 
a lack of central government control, there is a lot of 
different warring factions, it is mountainous, and remote. How 
is that oversight going?
    And then I will defer to Senator Graham.
    Ms. Caldwell. Sure, I can give you a brief response, but I 
will give you a fuller one for the record. What I know is that 
there, of course, has been a history at times of the rangers 
and law enforcement surrounding these parks engage themselves 
in human rights abuses, and we do quite a lot of training to 
ensure that that kind of activity doesn't take place.
    Needless to say, that will undermine community confidence 
in these parks. And it is critically necessary that we get that 
right. I also alluded to the work we do to address corruption 
which, you know, fuels this kind of activity, and that is 
another critical form of oversight.
    We have a very strong anti-corruption initiative at USAID 
that is really focused on elevating best practice and 
addressing corruption, but also ensuring that we are investing 
in democratic bright spots to avoid the kind of corruption that 
really enables wildlife crime.
    I actually, first had my own exposure to this, when I was 
approached by someone who was investigating the trade in 
Siberian tiger pelts, and they offered to sell him women in the 
1990s. And I got involved in an undercover campaign on the 
Russian mafia's involvement.
    So it also underscores your earlier point, which is that 
these networks diversify their so-called ``product base'', and 
really represent a threat to national security.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, very much.
    Let me defer to Senator Graham. Glad to have you join us.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Of all the things 
the Committee could be focusing on, this is sort of top of our 
list for a good reason.
    We just got back from Africa on our CODEL, and what I 
learned was these parks, are sort of sanctuaries of governance, 
and law and order, surrounded by a lot of upheaval. So if it 
were up to me, I would have a string of parks, conservation 
parks all over Africa because it may be the only place a 
community can reside with some level of peace, and certainty in 
terms of the rule of law.
    Do all of you support the U.S. Foundation for International 
Conservation Act introduced by Senator Coons and myself?
    Dr. Steer. Yes, sir.
    Ms. Caldwell. Yes, we do.
    Mr. Sebunya. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. Good; probably why you are here. Now, the 
goal, of Chris and myself, is to create a public-private 
relationship where the private sector sort of leads and puts 
their money where their mouth is, collaborating with the United 
States Government, and other people, hopefully other 
governments, to make sure that these parks are well managed, 
that we deal with poaching by force, and that the communities 
surrounding these parks benefit.
    Mr. Steer, is that right--Dr. Steer?
    Dr. Steer. Absolutely right, Senator. We believe this 
initiative is a very good one. The way you describe it is 
absolutely right, and there are certain components that will 
make this very successful. It is if the private sector, as you 
say, comes in and works together with the public funding, if 
the emphasis is on long term, if we think precisely the way you 
are talking about, and good governance, but also thinking about 
citizens who live outside the area, who maybe are not able to 
get the incomes they used to get before.
    So we have got to be pretty imaginative in order to make 
sure there are alternative livelihoods. And then we need to 
monitor very carefully. We now have the capacity, using 
satellite technology, to see almost every tree falling, that is 
very, very valuable information. And we need to be very 
disciplined.
    We, in the Bezos Earth Fund, are very highly engaged in 
that space and we are very interested in partnering with you in 
this new proposed fund.
    Senator Graham. Well, Dr. Steer, I appreciate that, and to 
other groups like yours, I would love to work with you. The 
goal here, I guess, is to have the local community feel like 
the park is an asset. Is that correct, everybody?
    You are nodding your head. Protecting the animals is better 
business than allowing them to be poached. Everybody is nodding 
their head, right?
    Ms. Caldwell. Yes, absolutely. Before your arrival we 
discussed the importance of community engagement; couldn't 
agree more.
    Senator Graham. Yes. And so when we collect fees for people 
who visit these parks, we want to make sure that the local 
community feels the benefit of that; is that correct?
    Ms. Caldwell. Yes, sir.
    Dr. Steer. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. Okay. So what I would suggest to my 
colleagues in Congress, if you want to do something to bring 
about better governance, and a semblance of the rule of law in 
this part of the world, in these ungoverned spaces, the parks 
are your best opportunity.
    Dr. Steer, the Africa Parks; are you familiar with that 
group?
    Dr. Steer. Yes, indeed. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Okay.
    Dr. Steer. So, yes, we believe they are a very expert--I 
mean, in Africa there are some very, very good groups, some 
international non-governmental organizations, many based, you 
know, headquarters are in the United States.
    Senator Graham. Well, let us explain for the public if we 
can, Mr.--how do you say your last name, sir?
    Mr. Sebunya. Sebunya, sir.
    Senator Graham. Okay. So let us walk through, real quickly, 
how this works. A group called Africa Parks will take over the 
park. They will provide security; is that right?
    Mr. Sebunya. That is correct, sir.
    Senator Graham. Okay. And they will have the capability to 
fight the poachers, right?
    Mr. Sebunya. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. And their emphasis is on helping the local 
community surrounding the park.
    Mr. Sebunya. I don't know. I don't work for Africa Parks, 
Senator, but yes, in some cases.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Dr. Steer, is that sort of, 
generally, the way Africa Parks works?
    Dr. Steer. I believe so. Yes, indeed.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Well, the reason I mentioned it, it 
is a private sector group, right, non-profit.
    Dr. Steer. It is a foundation.
    Senator Graham. And so what we want to do, is that where 
the government is failing in some of these countries, due to 
corruption, or whatever, is to bring something new to the 
table, and hopefully get the government buying what we are 
doing.
    So like Botswana, they have got great parks. The government 
seems to be buying into this public-private partnership. What I 
would suggest to the Chairman here, is not only we pass our 
bill, but we put the countries in question on notice, we expect 
you to up your game, we expect you to make sure that the money 
being generated for all this activity, some of it actually goes 
to the people.
    So I am really excited about how this effort to conserve 
nature, and protect animals actually, is probably one of the 
best antidotes to the spread of terrorism, and international 
criminality.
    The biggest benefit from this, beyond protecting the 
wildlife itself, I think is to have a system that can make it 
harder not only for illegal traffickers and wild--poachers, but 
also people involved in radical activity.
    And, Mr. Chairman, I think we are onto something here, I 
think this is a--USAID, is that right Ms. Caldwell?
    Ms. Caldwell. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. Do you consider this a threat to what you 
do?
    Ms. Caldwell. No, I don't. I understand you are working to 
ensure this is additional funding, and of course we are 
absolutely supportive of ensuring a further $200 million a year 
for 10 years for biodiversity conservation.
    Senator Graham. So it is additional funding, but it is not 
just additional funding, it is a fundamentally new approach.
    Dr. Steer if you could just wrap this up for us. How do you 
think the private sector will respond to this idea? And should 
we be optimistic that we are on the right track, in terms of 
the public-private partnerships?
    Dr. Steer. I think the private sector, both the 
philanthropic private sector, and even the for-profit private 
sector would respond very, very well to this. And the reason 
for that is that we are more effective if we work with the 
public sector.
    So it is not actually just dollars that we hope you will be 
putting into this fund, it is actually, influence and 
engagement, and even now, clearly, when you, Senator Graham, 
and you, Senator Coons, go on these visits, you meet at the 
Head of State level, you engage. That is incredibly useful.
    It will be even more useful if we could do it in 
partnership, whereby, when you go, you not only have public 
money, but actually you are engaged with something much bigger 
than that, where the private sector is. So whilst we are very, 
very good at putting money into NGOs, you are very, very at 
doing that, plus you are very good at engaging at the very--the 
Head of State.
    So that is why we are interested in working with you. And 
it is certainly not just me, in my written testimony I talked 
about a group of philanthropists, $5 billion put on the table, 
not particularly specifically for this--this particular 
initiative, but would be very interested in working with you in 
the design and the implementation.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Graham.
    And thank you to the witnesses. We are going to conclude in 
just a moment, if I could.
    One of the examples that Senator Graham and I have talked 
about is Park W--an area that is at the intersection, roughly, 
of northwestern, Benin, and Togo, and Southeastern Burkina 
Faso, thus his comments about national parks being a sort of an 
area of potential stability and governance in a region troubled 
by significant extremism and violence, that is, I think, the 
concrete example he had in mind there.
    Obviously, in different countries, the role of the central 
government, the role of the park and the community, and the 
intensity of violence or extremism, varies wildly across a 
massive continent, with many different examples.
    Gorongosa was initially destroyed, denuded by an ongoing 
civil war between FRELIMO and RENAMO; and as recently as the 
last visit I made there, there was renewed violence around the 
periphery of the park; although at a much, much smaller level 
than anything we are seeing in Benin.
    I do think it is important for us to focus on how we would 
select and prioritize, there are many potential NGO 
implementing partners, African Parks is one that has a strong 
record, but there are many others, not just in Africa, but 
throughout the Global South.
    And the design elements that, frankly, all three of you 
testified to and agreed on: The importance of long-term 
funding; the importance of clear metrics and accountability 
that have conservation and biodiversity goals, as well as 
economic, improvement, and stability goals. The importance of 
engaging the public, private, and philanthropic sectors, so 
that the power of the U.S. government, and potentially other 
close Allied Partner governments, in terms of providing 
security assistance and advice, mobilizing national leadership 
in partner countries, can't be overstated.
    And then as we have talked about throughout this hearing 
today, the critical role of having, not just a seat at the 
table, but a driving part of how things are designed and led. 
African voices, to the extent we are talking about the African 
continent, as well as indigenous communities in the rest of the 
world.
    One last point, Senator Schatz referenced a marine park. 
Bazaruto Archipelago, off of Southeastern Mozambique, is 
another I've visited. It is important to be clear that--I am 
imagining this as not just land, but also sea, and at the 
intersection there are critical challenges, in terms of pirate 
fishing, or IUU fishing, marine debris, plastic debris, that 
USAID is also making real contributions--is taking a real 
leadership position on, and there is so much more we could talk 
about.
    I must go to question, and vote.
    I will invite each of you, if you would choose to, make a 
brief concluding comment and then I will conclude this hearing.
    Ms. Caldwell, a closing comment of any kind?
    Ms. Caldwell. Sure. Without reiterating anything I have 
already said, I just want to underscore the power and potential 
of this--of the government partnership as a critical component 
of this nexus.
    When you go on your CODELs, ensuring that you are bringing 
the ministers of finance, and economic development, and tourism 
into the conversation, since this is all too often sequestered 
in the environment ministry, which doesn't have the funding or 
the power that many of those others do.
    And of course USAID's history of six decades on the ground; 
and having built those very strong partnerships with government 
that traverse various administrations, the work we do on the 
enabling environment to ensure the appropriate policies and 
regulations that would enable the success of an investment the 
Conservation Foundation might make, is so important.
    So I appreciate the fact that the Act calls for seats on 
the board from a range of U.S. government entities, including 
State and USAID, who have on-the-ground contacts that can be 
very relevant in helping ensure the success of your 
investments, and evaluating the potential of them before they 
are made. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. I might also add, the ministries of health, 
education, and agriculture.
    Ms. Caldwell. Of course.
    Senator Coons. Because focusing on human development also 
means bringing those on board as well.
    Ms. Caldwell. Yes, I agree.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, ma'am.
    Mr. Sebunya.
    Mr. Sebunya. Thank you, Senator. I think I would just, 
again, repeat our support to the Foundation for International 
Conservation Act, and that we believe that it has a potential 
to be a transformative influence to the international 
conservation landscape, and especially the things that you--
Senator, you touched on, and the Ranking Member also touched 
on, that really conservation is not about--is not a name in 
itself, that conservation needs to meet the aspirations of 
people.
    On the African continent, it is a political and a cultural 
heritage issue, and the leadership of, and the voices, and the 
perspectives of the Africans is going to be so critical in the 
success of this entity.
    The last thing I will say, is the role of the private 
sector; I really, personally, believe that, in the long run, 
the NGOs are going give way to the private sector in running, 
and managing the entities of wildlife--our wildlife. And within 
the protected areas and outside the protected areas; it is 
very, very critical.
    Senator Coons. I think it is essential that, in the long 
run, conservation, the protection of biodiversity, wildlife, be 
seen as a central part of competent development strategies, by 
nations all over the world, if that ultimately, not in 
competition, but really reinforcing each other. If we can 
achieve that, we can have done something significant.
    Dr. Steer, close us out, if you would.
    Dr. Steer. This is a historic opportunity. Never has the 
need been greater, but also never have we known as much about 
what works and what doesn't work. We actually do know how to do 
this, and it requires a very unusual type of partnership, 
ranging from those who are indigenous people in the forest, to 
those who are trying to make are living outside the forest, to 
politicians at the highest level, to the business community, we 
now have a business community, globally, that is very 
interested in this issue.
    We have philanthropists that are very interested in this 
issue. The fact that we have you, Senator, and a bipartisan 
initiative in the U.S. Congress, is a great blessing, and we 
really, we really are honored to be your partner in this.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Thank you, all. I look forward to 
our ongoing partnership in this. You have given us great input 
about how to think about this as we move forward with this 
legislation, and with writing the fiscal year 2024 
Appropriations Bill for the Subcommittee.

               ENHANCING AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH

                   THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

                          FINANCE CORPORATION

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHRISTOPHER A. COONS

    Senator Coons. This Hearing of the Subcommittee on State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the United States 
Senate Appropriations Committee will come to order.
    Mr. Nathan, we are grateful that you are joining us today. 
We will have one witness today, Scott Nathan, CEO of the 
Development Finance Corporation.
    I will make some brief opening remarks. I believe my 
Ranking Member will join us by then, but if not we will then 
proceed with your opening testimony, and then proceed to a 
round of questions of the Members of the subcommittee.
    We meet in a moment when, nationally, we are facing the 
challenge of: How do we sustain American competitiveness, how 
do we strengthen our place in the world, and how do we respond 
to recovery from the pandemic, to economic growth opportunities 
all across the world, and how do we sharpen and modernize 
America's development tools?
    This hearing is an opportunity to review the successes, 
challenges, and lessons learned for the Development Finance 
Corporation, and to discuss ways we can help strengthen the 
DFC's implementation of its mandate.
    I have also invited the DFC Inspector General to submit 
testimony, which I will review and will be included in the 
hearing record.
    Some of our colleagues have scheduling conflicts, but I 
thought it was critical we hold this hearing today as we are 
working on drafting Appropriations bills, and other critically 
relevant legislation for the Development Finance Corporation.
    First, a quick word on the House Appropriations Committee 
allocations which concern many of us given the proposed deep 
cuts across agencies, including those funded by this 
subcommittee. I have worked with Chair Granger in the past, and 
I am looking forward to working with Chair Diaz-Balart in his 
new role as the House SFOPS Chair. They are serious 
appropriators and we share many priorities. We don't yet have 
the full picture of the resources or legislative provisions 
that may be included in the House SFOPS Bill, but we do know 
the initial allocations include deep cuts, a cut of about 33 
percent to the SFOPS allocation.
    The consequences of that I think would be grave. Under-
investing in our global, diplomatic, and development 
professional workforce. Failing to pay our treaty dues on time. 
Failing to provide credible alternatives to countries seeking 
development finance, investment, and infrastructure, and 
modernization. Stepping back from our global leadership in 
confronting Russian aggression, countering PRC economic 
coercion, and addressing, truly, global threats to stability, 
like terrorism, corruption, and climate change.
    I don't think we can compete globally and do our job by the 
American people by slashing funding and turning inward, this 
will make for a particularly challenging and engaging 
Appropriations process between the House and the Senate.
    Moving on to today's topic. The DFC was established through 
strong bipartisan support for modernizing U.S. foreign 
assistance. It was broadly recognized at the time many of us 
worked on the BUILD Act, that by expanding the tools we have 
for leveraging private-sector capital, we could achieve a 
greater impact on development, and advance our broader foreign 
policy objectives.
    We also thought it was important to provide more 
opportunities for higher quality investment so that partner 
countries would not be susceptible to relying on coercive 
lending from other countries, principally the PRC, which across 
dozens of countries, has too often been the only choice in 
emerging markets for rapid financing or access to large 
infrastructure investments.
    I am optimistic about the DFC's trajectory in seeking to 
meet these objectives as you approach your fifth year in 2024. 
Over the relatively brief time that the DFC has been 
operational with its current authorities, and mission, and 
mandate, including under two administrations with some 
significant differences in the administration's priorities, I 
have been impressed with the DFC's progress in using the new 
tools provided by Congress.
    Fiscal year 2022 set a record for DFC investment, with over 
$7 billion committed to offer values-driven and high quality 
alternatives, and to drive investment in economic growth and 
development where it is most needed in the world.
    And what matters more than the dollars are the projects 
themselves. You have worked to ensure that there is a critical 
investment in energy transitions, in critical mineral supply 
chains, tackling food insecurity, facilitating responses to the 
COVID-19 pandemic globally by making available vaccines and 
investing in vaccine production, increasing capital access in 
countries plagued by economic crisis like Sri Lanka and in 
Ukraine, where Russia's War has had a devastating impact on its 
economy. There are so many more, and we look forward to hearing 
from you about them.
    To be clear, I didn't play a role in creating the DFC 
imagining it would be a panacea to all of our global 
challenges, I have no illusions about the complexity of your 
work, but we look forward to working with you to take the next 
steps required to strengthen the DFC.
    I do hope to hear from you about planned internal 
reorganization, and how you are working to strengthen the 
overall strategic direction of the Corporation, and 
communicating your priorities, and your response to those who 
feel the DFC has been too slow to engage in either critical 
sectors, or regions, including, in particular, the Indo-
Pacific.
    I look forward to getting your perspective on some of the 
specific legislative reforms that I am pursuing with 
colleagues, such as ensuring you can fully leverage your equity 
investments as Congress intended and, potentially, expanding 
country eligibility.
    So Mr. Nathan, thank you for joining us. We have a great 
deal to discuss. I am not anticipating the imminent arrival of 
my Ranking Member, and so let me briefly introduce you to the 
other Member of the subcommittees who is with us.
    Scott Nathan you are someone who has served in public life 
for quite a period of time, educated at Harvard and Harvard Law 
School. We most recently met when you were working for the 
White House Office Presidential Personnel, helping manage the 
transition adroitly. I very much look forward to your 
testimony.
    And welcome the Members of the Committee who have joined 
us.
    Mr. Nathan, if you would address the subcommittee. Thank 
you.
STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT NATHAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
            OFFICER, UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL 
            DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you very much, Chairman Coons, Ranking 
Member Graham, and Members of the Committee, thank you for 
having me here today.
    I want to start by thanking Congress, and especially this 
Committee, for its continued support of DFC. You have helped 
strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission, drive positive 
development impact, and advance the foreign policy interests of 
the United States.
    I am proud of the progress DFC has made in increasing its 
investments and impact, both developmental and strategic.
    Last year, DFC committed over $7.4 billion through 183 
transactions in 111 countries. That was a great result, but DFC 
can drive even greater impact as we build our capacity, execute 
on our strategy, and work more effectively with our partners.
    For fiscal year 2024, the Administration requests a budget 
of $1.023 billion for DFC, a 2.3 percent increase over last 
year's request. Included in that total is $780 million in 
program funds, unchanged from last year, and $243 million in 
administrative expenses, an increase of $23 million. The 
requested increase in administrative resources will allow DFC 
to meet critical staffing needs, bolster business development 
efforts, and increase our overseas engagement.
    DFC is also working to be more proactive across our 
operations, refocusing our efforts on our highest priority 
sectors where there are enduring needs: infrastructure, energy, 
health, and agriculture, and small business support.
    DFC focuses on working with the private sector because 
closing the $40 trillion global infrastructure financing gap is 
beyond the capacity of any single development finance 
institution or single state actor.
    The PRC focuses on lending at the sovereign level, 
frequently burdening communities with projects that are 
overpriced, poor quality, and unsuitable to local conditions. 
This often saddles developing countries with too much debt and 
disappointing results.
    DFC offers a choice. Our investments carry our values of 
openness, respect for local laws and conditions, and high 
environmental, labor, and quality standards. DFC's work 
enhances the long-term sustainability of our projects, 
amplifies development impact, and guards against the danger 
that projects will harm local populations.
    DFC is committed to making high-quality investments in 
seaports, airports, railways, and road networks that connect 
communities to the opportunities of a global marketplace.
    For example, earlier this year DFC invested $150 million in 
the expansion of the Yilport Terminal in Ecuador, and earlier 
this month, DFC's Board approved a loan that supports the 
expansion and modernization of an airport in Sierra Leone, 
providing one of the world's poorest countries stronger 
connections to its region and to the world.
    At the same time, DFC is also investing to strengthen 21st 
century infrastructure, working with the private sector to 
bolster digital connections, and networks that are secure, 
safe, and open.
    In Ghana, South Africa, and Kenya, DFC is investing with 
Africa Data Centres, a company investing in information 
technology infrastructure. And in the Indo-Pacific region, DFC 
worked with our Australian and Japanese counterparts to support 
Telstra's acquisition of cellular and digital networks in Papua 
New Guinea, and five other Pacific Island nations.
    DFC is also investing to secure supply chains for critical 
minerals. As you know, the PRC has made it a priority to 
attempt to control these supply chains, from mining to 
processing. With an additional $30 million equity investment 
into TechMet Limited, a U.S.-aligned critical minerals 
platform, DFC is helping to secure access to nickel and cobalt 
through an innovative project in Brazil. I am optimistic that 
our relationship with TechMet will lead to many additional 
opportunities.
    DFC is focused on providing affordable, reliable, and 
sustainable access to energy, a critical factor in development 
and economic security.
    In India, DFC is pursuing several transactions that will 
diversify the solar manufacturing supply chain away from PRC 
dominance. Last year, DFC provided $500 million in debt 
financing to First Solar for construction of a new plant.
    Across a range of technologies, DFC is working to provide 
reliable access to power for communities in countries ranging 
from Sierra Leone, and Malawi, to Nigeria, and Ecuador. We are 
pursuing new opportunities in nuclear energy, e-mobility 
businesses, and the supply chains that support them.
    In response to Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, DFC is 
also helping to drive greater diversity and resilience in 
energy supply in Central Europe and the Caucasus. In Bulgaria, 
Georgia, Moldova, and Poland, DFC has projects that will help 
diversify power supplies away from Russian gas and stabilize 
electricity grids.
    Russia's war against Ukraine has also endangered food 
security around the globe, and in response, last year DFC 
surged efforts in the food and agriculture sector.
    Investments in resilient health care systems provide a 
necessary foundation for the development of a vibrant private 
sector, and help prepare for future health crises. For example, 
in Vietnam, DFC is investing to help expand access to clinics 
and pharmaceutical products in rural areas.
    DFC is also committed to providing support for the small 
businesses that are the engines of so many economies. We have 
recently made investments focused on expanding access to 
capital for SMEs in Egypt, El Salvador, Honduras, Jordan, 
Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, amongst many others. And none 
of these deals are easy, but all of these countries and 
investments are strategically important to the United States.
    DFC has a unique complement of products and tools that can 
help drive the private sector investment to make development 
impact. However, current budgetary rules for equity scoring 
prevent DFC from taking full advantage of this important tool 
that Congress gave us in the BUILD Act. I imagine we will 
address this further during the questions. I want DFC to be 
strategic and focused where we make investments, and to be held 
accountable for our performance.
    The Administration's funding request allows us to build our 
workforce, grow our capacity, and align our organizational 
structure to drive greater impact.
    Thank you for your support which makes this work possible; 
and for your continued commitment to helping DFC achieve even 
more.
    I look forward to continuing to work with this Committee. 
And I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.

    [The statement follows:]
                 Prepared Statement of Scott A. Nathan
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for having me here today to discuss the 
Administration's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request for the U.S. 
International Development Finance Corporation.
    I want to thank Congress and especially this committee for its 
continued support of DFC. The resources and tools you provided DFC have 
helped to strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission, drive positive 
development impact, and advance the foreign policy interests of the 
United States.
    I am proud of the progress DFC has made in increasing its 
investments and impact, both developmental and strategic. In Fiscal 
Year 2022 alone, DFC committed over $7.4 billion through 183 
transactions, in 111 countries. This was a great result, but I know we 
can do more. DFC can drive even greater impact as we build our 
capacity, execute on our strategy, and work more effectively with our 
U.S. government partners and partners around the world.
    For FY 2024, the Administration requests a budget of $1.023 billion 
for DFC, a 2.3 percent increase over its FY 2023 request. Included in 
that total is $780 million in program funds, unchanged from our FY 2023 
request, and $243 million in administrative expenses, an increase of 
$23 million over the FY 2023 request.
    In response to what we've heard from our team, from clients, and 
from you, DFC is in the process of building our overall capacity to do 
more and do it faster. The requested increase in administrative 
resources will allow DFC to meet critical staffing needs, bolster 
business development efforts, and increase our overseas engagement.
    DFC is also working to be more proactive across our operations, 
refocusing efforts on our highest priority sectors where there are 
enduring needs: infrastructure, energy, health, food and agriculture, 
and small business support.
    DFC focuses on working with the private sector because closing the 
$40 trillion global infrastructure financing gap is beyond the capacity 
of any development finance institution or state actor to address alone. 
The People's Republic of China (PRC) focuses on lending at the 
sovereign level and often uses the demand for infrastructure investment 
for its purposes, frequently burdening communities with projects that 
are over-priced, poor quality, and unsuitable to local conditions. This 
often saddles developing countries with too much debt and disappointing 
results.
    DFC offers a choice. Our investments carry U.S. values of openness, 
respect for local laws and conditions, and high environmental, labor, 
and quality standards. DFC's work enhances the long-term sustainability 
of our projects, amplifies development impact, and guards against the 
danger that projects will harm local populations. Supporting high 
quality, sustainable projects has been a focus for DFC from the 
beginning, and we have continued to enhance our capacity to monitor and 
measure our impact.
    DFC is committed to making investments in seaports, airports, 
railways and road networks that connect communities to the 
opportunities of a global marketplace. For example, earlier this year 
DFC invested in the expansion of the Yilport Terminal in Puerto 
Bolivar, Ecuador, which after its modernization, will become one of the 
most advanced facilities of its kind on South America's Pacific Coast. 
And earlier this month, DFC's Board approved a loan that supports the 
expansion and modernization of an airport in Sierra Leone, providing 
one of the world's poorest countries stronger connections within West 
Africa, a region where populations and markets are rapidly growing.
    At the same time, DFC is also investing to strengthen 21st century 
infrastructure, working with the private sector to bolster digital 
connections and networks that are secure, safe, and open. In Ghana, 
South Africa, and Kenya, DFC is investing with Africa Data Centres in 
information technology infrastructure to help make these countries more 
attractive destinations for data-driven companies looking for a 
foothold in growing markets. And in the Indo-Pacific region, DFC worked 
with our Australian and Japanese counterparts to support Telstra in 
making an acquisition that allowed the company to provide secure, high 
quality mobile services to Papua New Guinea and several Pacific 
Islands.
    DFC is also investing to secure supply chains for critical 
minerals. As you know, the PRC has long made it a priority to attempt 
to control these supply chains, from mining to processing and 
manufacturing. With a $30 million equity investment into TechMet 
Limited, a U.S.-aligned critical minerals platform that DFC had 
previously supported, DFC is helping to secure access to nickel and 
cobalt through an innovative project in Brazil. I'm optimistic that our 
relationship with TechMet will lead to many additional opportunities. 
We are committed to pursuing additional projects that help diversify 
the supply and sourcing of these and other strategic resources 
important to the economic growth and national security of the United 
States.
    DFC is also focused on providing affordable, reliable and 
sustainable access to energy, a critical factor in development and 
economic security. In India, DFC is pursuing several transactions that 
can diversify the solar manufacturing supply chain away from PRC 
dominance. Last year DFC provided $500 million in debt financing to 
First Solar for construction of a new plant, which goes online in Tamil 
Nadu later this year. Additionally, the DFC Board approved financing 
last week for the development of Ecuador's first private sector owned, 
on-grid solar power plant. Supported by a $144 million DFC loan, this 
power plant will be the lowest cost electricity provider in all of 
Ecuador.
    Across a range of technologies, DFC is working to provide reliable 
access to power for communities that have never had it in countries 
ranging from Sierra Leone to Malawi to Nigeria. While we are working 
with developers to find more power projects in every region of the 
world, we are also pursuing new opportunities in nuclear energy and e-
mobility businesses and the supply chains that support them.
    In response to Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, and in keeping 
with the authorities provided to DFC under the European Energy Security 
and Diversification Act (EESDA), DFC is also helping to drive greater 
diversity and resilience in energy supply in Central and Eastern Europe 
and the Caucasus. In Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, and Poland, DFC has 
projects that will help diversify power supplies away from Russian gas 
and stabilize electricity grids.
    Russia's war against Ukraine has also put other critical supply 
chains at risk, and endangered food security for communities beyond the 
region. To respond to this potential crisis, DFC surged efforts in the 
food and agriculture sector, doubling the number of transactions to 
support food security in FY 2022, and we continue to actively look for 
more viable projects to support. We are committed for the long term to 
working with the private sector to improve agricultural yields, 
increase incomes for smallholder farmers, and foster innovation in food 
distribution networks. From Guatemala to Ghana, DFC is investing to 
help bring more produce to market and bolster food security for remote 
populations. And we want to do more of this critical work.
    Investments in resilient health systems, not unlike investments in 
food security, represent a commitment to the well-being of people and 
the stability of communities, providing a necessary foundation for the 
development of a vibrant private sector. The COVID-19 pandemic helped 
to underscore the need for these investments, particularly improvements 
to healthcare supply chains, which DFC is working with the private 
sector to address.
    In places like Vietnam, DFC is investing to help expand access to 
clinics and pharmaceutical products in rural areas. In Brazil, a DFC 
loan is helping to modernize a women's health diagnostic center and 
supporting its expansion into areas with minimal access to medical 
care. In India, we finance a chain of eye care clinics and are 
supporting a local company that provides much needed sanitary products 
for women, both with huge development impact. And across sub-Saharan 
Africa, DFC's investments are improving access to quality care, 
including through the provision of digital healthcare solutions.
    DFC is also committed to providing support for the small businesses 
that are the engines of so many dynamic economies. Our investments in 
the third quarter of this year alone demonstrate what an important 
priority this line of effort is to the organization. From a $476 
million guaranty that will provide working capital for thousands of 
Brazilian SMEs in an underbanked part of the economy, to support for 
women entrepreneurs in Honduras and small businesses in El Salvador 
addressing climate impacts, DFC is working to provide individuals the 
financial support they need to create jobs and opportunities in their 
communities. Since FY 2021, DFC has provided over $430 million in loans 
and loan portfolio guarantees to support small businesses and 
underserved populations in sub-Saharan Africa, a chronically under 
financed region. We have recently done investments in Egypt, Jordan, 
Mexico, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, and Vietnam and we will continue to scour 
the world in search of opportunities to invest in the small businesses 
that are the backbone of free enterprise.
    Small business support is one critical area where DFC's close 
partnership with USAID is helping to deliver opportunity in communities 
across the world. Because of transactions sourced jointly by DFC and 
DFC Liaisons at USAID, small business owners and smallholder farmers in 
the DRC have financing they need; entrepreneurs in Burkina Faso, Mali, 
and Guinea, and Sierra Leone are creating hundreds of jobs, and in 
Ukraine, Bank Lviv is able to provide loans that are a lifeline to 
small businesses that can continue operating during a difficult time of 
war. DFC's Mission Transaction Unit (MTU) has worked closely with USAID 
to identify communities where DFC can address a lack of financing 
through support for local institutions, with DFC/MTU helping to close 
more than $900 million in USAID sponsored commitments.
    DFC is also committed to driving impacts that cut across the 
priority sectors we have identified and using our tools to advance 
innovative transactions. For instance, DFC recently provided $656 
million in political risk insurance to support the largest debt for 
nature swap in history. This ground-breaking transaction helps to 
preserve the diverse ecosystem of the Galapagos, and protect it from 
illegal fishing, while at the same time significantly reducing 
Ecuador's sovereign debt.
    None of these deals are easy, but all of these countries and 
investments are strategically significant to the United States. DFC has 
a unique complement of products and tools that can help us drive 
private sector investment and development impact. However, current 
budgetary rules for equity scoring prevent DFC from taking full 
advantage of this important tool Congress gave us in the BUILD Act.
    One avenue for boosting DFC's equity investments is through a $2 
billion revolving fund that is included as part of the President's Out 
Compete China Proposal. I look forward to continued discussions with 
you on how DFC can make more robust use of our equity tool and the 
potential for changes to provide DFC working capital authority, 
allowing us the ability to use the fees we collect from private parties 
to share costs for due diligence with potential partners seeking 
investment.
    I want DFC to be strategic and focused in where we make investments 
and to be held accountable for our performance. The Administration's 
Funding request for DFC in FY 2024 allows us to build our workforce, 
grow our capacity, and align our organizational structure to drive 
greater impact across a number of strategically important sectors.
    In DFC's short history, we have made great progress. Funding for 
this request will support DFC's efforts to further unlock the power of 
private capital to create opportunity, alleviate poverty, and improve 
lives in communities across the world.
    Thank you for the support which makes this work possible and for 
your continued commitment to helping DFC achieve even more. I look 
forward to continuing to work with this Committee and welcome your 
questions.

                                 ______
                                 
 Prepared Statement of Anthony ``Tony'' Zakel, Inspector General, U.S. 
   International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector 
                                General
    Chairman Coons and Ranking Member Graham, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to provide 
written testimony for the record to discuss the U.S. International 
Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Office of Inspector General's 
(OIG) oversight work related to DFC.
                             about dfc oig
    DFC OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and deter fraud, waste, 
and abuse by conducting and supervising audits and investigations of 
DFC's programs and operations worldwide. Congress established DFC OIG 
in the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) 
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-254). Like other Offices of Inspector 
General, DFC OIG gets its authority from the Inspector General Act of 
1978, as amended (IG Act). I was appointed as DFC's first Inspector 
General in August 2020 and report directly to the DFC Board of 
Directors and Congress. DFC OIG is a lean office with 11 FTEs and a 
$5.5 million budget in FY 2023. However, we are tasked with overseeing 
a growing agency whose budget has increased to $1 billion, staff has 
grown to 513 employees, and has increased the number of new projects by 
about 132% between FY 2020 and FY 2022.
    DFC's development portfolio has reached almost $40 billion\1\ and 
is expected to grow in the coming years, especially in economies that 
may not have adequate safeguards to address fraud and corruption. DFC 
products include debt financing, equity investments, feasibility 
studies, investments funds, political risk insurance, and technical 
assistance.\2\ These products are essential to supporting key sectors, 
such as small business, energy, water, infrastructure, agriculture, and 
health, which improve the quality of life for millions and lay the 
groundwork for creating modern economies and providing financing for 
women or other borrowers who do not have sufficient access to 
commercial financing.
    DFC needs an effective OIG to safeguard American taxpayer dollars 
as DFC fulfills its dual mission to partner with the private sector to 
finance solutions to the most critical challenges facing the developing 
world today, while also advancing U.S. foreign policy priorities.
                              work to date
    In the last year, DFC OIG completed all four of its congressionally 
mandated audits, one performance audit, and eight investigations, four 
of which were referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 
prosecution. Some of our audit and investigative work is highlighted 
below and additional details can be found in our Spring FY 2023 
Semiannual Report to Congress and Fall FY 2022 Semiannual Report to 
Congress. Our semiannual reports to Congress, as well as our audit 
reports, Top Management Challenges Facing DFC,\3\ and other public 
documents and correspondence can be found on our external website, 
www.dfc.gov/oig.
                                 audits
    The Office of Audits conducts a variety of independent, statutorily 
mandated and discretionary performance audits assessing controls of DFC 
programs and operations to detect and deter waste and mismanagement. 
Mandatory audit work includes Financial Statements, Federal Information 
Security Modernization Act (FISMA), Risk Assessment of Government 
Charge Cards, and Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) audits. In 
addition to mandatory audits, the Office of Audits conducts performance 
audits of DFC programs or functions to determine if they are operating 
as intended to achieve stated goals. Two recent performance audits are 
highlighted below.

  --DFC Made Significant Progress Implementing Provisions of the BUILD 
        Act This audit revealed that DFC complied with and implemented 
        116 of the 118 subsections of the BUILD Act. The two 
        subsections not fully implemented were: (1) the roles, 
        responsibilities, and authorities of the Chief Development 
        Officer and Chief Risk Officer; and (2) DFC publicly reporting 
        performance metrics including development impact on a country-
        by-country basis. In addition, we noted two observations 
        regarding: (1) the methodology of calculating and tracking the 
        progress of investments in less developed countries; \4\ and 
        (2) the Annual Report timeliness.
  --We are wrapping up an audit of DFC-funded renewable energy and 
        finance projects in India. This was DFC OIG's first audit where 
        we had ``boots on the ground,'' allowing us an opportunity to 
        review projects and see DFC's impact in developing countries 
        firsthand. Our audit team, along with DFC staff, traveled to 
        India in February and March 2023 and visited eight DFC-financed 
        projects. We are discussing our findings with DFC management, 
        including issues regarding records management, waiver of 
        environmental and social standards, project monitoring, 
        reporting fatalities and serious injuries, and subordinate 
        loans policies. The final report of our audit findings and 
        recommendations will be published in early fall 2023.
                             investigations
    The Office of Investigations conducts proactive investigations and 
responds to allegations of fraud, abuse, and misconduct, which may 
result in criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions. DFC OIG 
investigations protect whistleblowers and address critical and 
sensitive issues supporting not only DFC's mission, but also U.S. 
foreign policy objectives and national security interests more broadly. 
The Office of Investigations seeks to foster the integrity of DFC 
employees, partners, and contractors, and encourages them to report 
suspected wrongdoing through outreach and training. To assist in this 
effort, DFC OIG provides training to new DFC employees and issues 
periodic newsletters to all DFC employees to promote understanding of 
our investigative mission and encourage reporting of suspected fraud, 
illegal activity, or misconduct.
    The OIG Hotline is available online or by phone, +1 833-OIG-4DFC, 
allowing information and complaints to be submitted to DFC OIG easily 
and confidentially from anywhere in the world. Since DFC OIG's 
inception, we have received 49 allegations, which have resulted in 28 
preliminary inquiries or investigations. During that time, we conducted 
six proactive initiatives to detect fraud and illegal conduct. Three 
recent investigations are highlighted below.

  --An investigation revealed a loan applicant submitted false 
        financial statements to DFC in support of a $41 million loan 
        for a construction project in the Middle East. Fortunately, the 
        loan commitment was cancelled before funds were dispersed. We 
        sent a report to DFC management detailing our findings and will 
        be referring the subjects of the investigation to DFC for 
        debarment.
  --As part of a proactive initiative, an OIG investigator visited a 
        solar power plant in India funded by a DFC loan to determine 
        the origins of the solar modules and inverters used to 
        construct the plant. We verified that although the solar 
        modules and inverters were manufactured by companies in the 
        PRC, the manufacturers were not linked to forced labor programs 
        as identified by a Federal interagency advisory.\5\
  --Last, we have investigated several complaints by whistleblowers 
        recently, including a whistleblower reprisal complaint, which 
        we referred to the Office of Special Counsel.
                      ukraine management advisory
    DFC OIG intends to proactively protect DFC's investments in 
Ukraine. To raise awareness of potential areas for fraud and abuse, we 
issued a management advisory, Key Considerations to Inform DFC's 
Response in Ukraine, to DFC management in June 2023. DFC plans to 
mobilize well over $1 billion in private sector capital to support the 
economy and people of Ukraine. While it has been reported that Ukraine 
has made significant improvements in its efforts to address corruption, 
it still faces challenges with implementing internal controls to ensure 
effective and efficient reconstruction efforts. DFC OIG is a member of 
the Ukraine Oversight Interagency Working Group; coordinating with 
other OIGs, international law enforcement entities, and various 
domestic and international stakeholders, and intends to commit 
resources to proactively monitor and evaluate DFC-funded projects in 
Ukraine.
                dfc top management challenges in fy2023
    Last fall, in collaboration with DFC, OIG published Top Management 
Challenges (TMCs) facing DFC in FY 2023 and discussed four challenges: 
\6\ (1) improving monitoring and evaluating actual development impact; 
(2) improving performance management, transparency, accuracy and 
availability of project data as DFC's commitments grow; (3) balancing 
heightened expectations of Congress and stakeholders while managing 
risks; and (4) managing organizational transition while building 
internal controls of core management systems. In particular, we 
identified that DFC needs to take action to make actual development 
impact achieved and promotion of our nation's foreign policy the 
primary metrics of its success. We look forward to working with DFC 
this coming fall in identifying the FY 2024 TMCs, which likely will be 
similar to those previously published.
                        memorandum of agreements
    DFC OIG has been actively establishing international partnerships 
to support anti-fraud and anti-corruption initiatives that will enrich 
our audit and investigative efforts. We recently executed Memoranda of 
Agreement (MOA) with the United Nations Office of Project Services 
(UNOPS) Internal Audit and Investigations Group, the European Anti-
Fraud Office (known by the acronym OLAF), and the World Bank Group 
Internal Audit (GIA). These MOAs are based on a common interest to 
enhance relationships that support sharing information and other 
resources with these international partners, which is critical given 
the international nature of our work.
                             looking ahead
    The BUILD Act authorizes DFC to grow its portfolio to $60 billion. 
To reach this goal, DFC plans to increase its staff level to 700 by 
September 2024. DFC has requested $1.023 billion for FY 2024 and $2 
billion in mandatory funds for an equity revolving fund.\7\ As DFC's 
portfolio and staff levels grow, the OIG also must grow. The OIG has 
requested $7.2 million for FY 2024, which includes increasing staff 
levels to support mobilizing an inspections and evaluations program and 
expanding our Office of Investigations (which currently has only two 
staff).
                increase oig staff to match dfc's growth
    To audit program and operational effectiveness, as well as 
investigate allegations of fraud, in a portfolio of DFC's size and 
complexity, the OIG must attract and retain skilled, experienced 
auditors, evaluators, investigators, attorneys, and other 
professionals. We also want to effectively monitor and evaluate DFC-
funded projects worldwide, which includes site visits, as a critical 
aspect of evaluating progress, assessing development impact, developing 
relationships, and identifying potentially fraudulent activity. The OIG 
proposes to hire an additional 9 FTEs in FY 2024, which will include 
auditors, evaluators, a data scientist, and an attorney to improve our 
audit and investigation capabilities. In addition to FTEs, the OIG has 
also recently hired two Pathways paid interns to support legal and 
audit functions.
                   need for law enforcement authority
    DFC OIG is hampered in its ability to independently conduct certain 
law enforcement activities because we do not have law enforcement 
authority. Our request for such authority has been pending with the 
U.S. Attorney General's Office for two and a half years. Prior to the 
BUILD Act, DFC's predecessor, the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC), was overseen by USAID OIG, which has law 
enforcement authority. Compared to OPIC, DFC has a significantly larger 
portfolio, a larger staff, expanded investment authority (including 
equity), and increased focus on development impact and promoting U.S. 
national interests. DFC OIG cannot properly oversee DFC without the 
same law enforcement authority that its predecessor OIG--and almost all 
other OIGs--have. Our lack of law enforcement authority has also 
hampered our ability to recruit and hire experienced investigators, who 
naturally want to continue their law enforcement careers. The OIG 
continues to work with key stakeholders, including Congress and DOJ, to 
obtain much-needed law enforcement authority.
                         future planned audits
    The OIG currently has two future audits it will conduct. The first 
is an audit of DFC's goods and services contracts. We plan to determine 
whether DFC complied with applicable goods and services contract 
regulations, policies, and procedures that contribute to being good 
stewards of government resources, ensuring Federal programs fulfill 
their intended purpose, effectively spending funds, and safeguarding 
assets. In the second audit, because of DFC's dramatic growth\8\ and 
the planned organization realignment, we plan to audit DFC's workforce 
planning efforts. We will assess if DFC is hiring the right people in 
the right places, how decisions were made, and explore current employee 
retention efforts. We will also review DFC's strategic human capital 
management as it positions the organization to be more effective and 
results-oriented by managing DFC's most valued resource--its people.
          inspections & evaluations of dfc projects worldwide
    DFC has a global reach and currently has development initiatives in 
four regions: Africa and the Middle East; Latin America and the 
Caribbean; Indo-Pacific; and Eastern Europe and Eurasia. DFC has also 
made investment commitments in Ukraine, which will likely increase in 
the future. To enhance our oversight efforts, DFC OIG intends to 
establish and mobilize an inspections and evaluations (I&E) program in 
FY 2024 to assess 8-10 DFC-funded projects around the world. We 
strongly believe that such a program is required to improve 
transparency and provide timely status of project progress and 
development impact as DFC's portfolio continues to grow. The I&E 
program will provide ``boots on the ground,'' giving DFC OIG the 
ability to provide real-time input regarding project status and 
effectiveness to help make timely recommendations for improvement and 
identify where administrative action might be necessary. The OIG's I&E 
program will incorporate lessons learned from our recent audit of DFC 
investments in India and we will also collaborate with DFC's Office of 
Accountability and DFC's Impact Management and Monitoring Division.
                               conclusion
    DFC has an important mission and makes significant contributions to 
promote economic growth, increase food security, build critical 
infrastructure, advance global health, and bolster connectivity in the 
developing world, while advancing U.S. foreign policy and providing 
financially sound alternatives to unsustainable and irresponsible 
state-directed initiatives. At the same time, in many parts of the 
world, extremism, instability, and open conflict make the jobs of 
development professionals working to achieve these goals much harder. 
Meeting these and other challenges requires serious commitment; a 
thoughtful, informed approach; and effective collaboration to curb 
risks and change course when necessary. DFC OIG will continue to be an 
independent voice and steadfast partner in helping chart improvements 
to U.S. foreign financial support, and I look forward to working with 
you in the years to come to ensure that we provide maximum value to 
decision-makers, stakeholders, and, above all, the American people.
    I appreciate the opportunity to provide you with this overview of 
our work and our needs. My staff and I are always available to brief 
you and your staff and look forward to working with you on prioritizing 
future oversight efforts.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Nathan. We are now going to 
move to, probably, one round of 7-minute questions, and if 
there are members who persist, I will be happy to do a second 
round.
    I wanted to ask, if I could, when we established the DFC in 
2019 it was with a mandate to mobilize private capital in 
support of development goals and sustainable economic growth, 
to help further our foreign policy interests. Some of the 
stakeholders of the DFC want you to focus more of your 
attention on poverty reduction in less developed countries, 
while others are urging a shift towards critical geostrategic 
investments.
    To what extent is this a zero-sum trade-off between poverty 
alleviation and strategic impact? Is that real, or is that a 
perception? And how are you ensuring the DFC is maximizing 
resources to deliver on the full scope of its mandate? How do 
you prioritize if this is, in fact, a real trade-off?
    Mr. Nathan. So the BUILD Act clearly gave us a dual mission 
to make development impact in the poorest countries of the 
world, and to advance the strategic and foreign policy 
interests of the United States. And I think we can do both. We 
can do both through all of our transactions.
    Both elements of our mission are mutually reinforcing, I 
don't see them as contradictory in any way.
    I see the two elements of our mission, as strongly 
reinforcing of one another. And you can see this through our 
projects. A project like I mentioned, Yilport, critically 
important from a strategic point of view to give Ecuador a 
deepwater port on the Pacific. It is important that we were 
there to finance that rather than our strategic competitors. 
But that project also produces 1,250 jobs locally, it provides 
connections to markets around the world for Ecuador which is a 
key to their economic growth.
    So even a project that can be viewed as purely strategic 
has huge developmental impact, and the same is true in terms of 
the small and very important, highly developmental projects we 
do, that make a difference in remote communities, that helps 
with economic growth and stability, that is good for the United 
States, that is good for our interest.
    Senator Coons. What I mostly hear when I travel to other 
countries, Senator Graham and I traveled to a number of 
countries in Africa together a few months ago, is they want 
more. They want more of the DFC, they want more of your 
leveraging American private capital, they want more of having 
an alternative to, as you put it, PRC investment that often 
produces too much debt and disappointing results.
    There are legislative changes, that a number of us are 
advocating for, that would allow you to leverage funds more 
effectively. One would fix the equity scoring issue. The other 
would expand country eligibility, rather than just relying on 
World Bank income categories. A similar change is being 
considered for the MCC.
    What would the impact of these two changes be? And could 
you provide some examples of equity investments you have had to 
have pass on which could have helped us geostrategically with 
countering the PRC, and with development, had the equity 
scoring problem been solved?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you for the question. It is very clear 
that in the BUILD Act the expansion of our toolkit to include 
equity was one of the key elements of making us be able to be 
more forward-leaning on risk. Our predecessor agencies, 
particularly OPIC, were constrained in their ability to take 
risk in projects, partially by the way that they were 
structured and funded, but also because they were unable to use 
equity as a tool.
    That made it difficult to partner with our colleagues at 
other development finance institutions, with the G7 and other 
allies. And it meant that there were projects that were earlier 
in the life cycle, or in countries, low-income countries there 
is reasons why there is not robust financing markets on the 
debt side, equity is a more long-term, patient tool.
    The way that I think equity, if we had the expanded ability 
to use it, would be valuable to our mission, in particular, we 
would be able to be earlier in projects, even infrastructure 
and energy projects, where we could support developers, help 
influence their choices of vendors and EPC contractors, other 
shareholders, or sources of finance to make sure they make the 
right choice.
    You are right, when I travel I hear like you did, that 
people want us to show up, they are looking for diversity in 
their relationships, they are looking for a choice, but if we 
don't have an offering that fits their needs, we won't be able 
to offer that kind of choice.
    I am struck that both the Millennium Challenge Corporation, 
which was an innovation of the Bush Administration, and 
approaches development with metrics, accountability, long-term 
goals, and the DFC whose principal goal is crowding in private 
capital and deploying the best of the American private sector, 
and delivering more transparent, more sustainable--are both 
funded at about a billion dollars, in a government, that in 
terms of our engagement with the world between defense, 
development, diplomacy, does hundreds of times more than that.
    I am excited to have a chance to work with you and my 
colleagues in trying to fix the equity scoring issue. What 
would that fix do to your leverage, and your reach, and your 
scope?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. So at the moment our ability to make 
equity investments, because they are accounted for on a dollar-
for dollar basis, as if immediately, it is as if we lost the 
money, it is accounted for more like a grant than an 
investment. We are not able to get the kind of leverage that we 
do with our debt transactions.
    On an appropriation last year, of $500 million of program 
funds, we made $7.4 billion of investments, but the amount of 
equity we could use was quite limited as a result.
    If we had a bigger pot of equity we could look at making 
$100 million, or $200 million investments in precisely the kind 
of projects that I mentioned: big infrastructure, mining of 
critical minerals, energy projects, where we could be early and 
influence the direction that those projects are taking, as 
opposed to coming all the way at the end with debt financing.
    Senator Coons. And just for those who may not be familiar 
with how the stacking and the structuring works, if you are 
equity, you help drive the deal.
    Mr. Nathan. That is right.
    Senator Coons. If you are debt, you are the caboose.
    Mr. Nathan. With equity we would have a seat at the table, 
we would be able to be far more patient, we would be able to 
operate in environments that are more difficult, more complex, 
and riskier.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. I appreciate your testimony.
    My Ranking Member, Senator Graham.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Number one, a 
brief opening statement here.
    If you are really serious about countering China, and we 
all are, you have to show up, you have to show up and offer to 
people in the world an alternative to Belt and Road. This 
program, the DFC, is sort of like the best thing we have going 
for us right now, and a billion dollars, it should be multiple 
times that, and what the Chairman is trying to do, and no 
matter who wins in 2024, we are going to be partners on this 
issue. Senator Shaheen has been great.
    All of our colleagues up here sort of get, that you are not 
going to compete with China through a lens of isolationism. Why 
are we spending money over there? Well, because people over 
there affect the quality of life over here. If you want to stop 
illegal immigration, let us improve the quality life in places 
where people are coming from.
    If you have forgotten 9/11 which was over there, I haven't. 
Taking your eye off the ball can really lead to a lot of money 
and lives being lost. So without some soft power, as General 
Mattis said, ``You had better buy a lot more bullets'', because 
if you don't show up and turn things around before it is too 
late, you wind up getting sucked into military conflict, or you 
lose influence in a world that China is trying to dominate.
    So the equity aspect of this makes perfect sense to me, Mr. 
Chairman. The goal is to run this more like a business, we have 
the former Ambassador to Japan here. We are going to have to 
redesign and reimagine foreign assistance, the MCC, the DFC, 
the fragile-state approach, the food security conservation 
fund, where you are having the private sector put serious money 
involved, and the government partners up, is the only way to 
get outcomes.
    So I want to applaud you, Mr. Chairman. You are trying to 
make this program more efficient, to get a better return on the 
taxpayer dollar and equity investment should be allowed.
    I am worried about the World Bank income classification 
being our guide, taking areas of the world off the table that 
it is in our strategic national security interest to be 
involved in. It should be about what is best for us, it is not 
what the World Bank does in terms income ratings. So I would 
like to change that.
    To my colleagues here, don't tell me about how tough you 
are on China if you are going to let Ukraine fail. You are not. 
If you don't see the need to support Ukraine, related to China, 
you are missing a lot. Don't tell me we are going to be tough 
on China if you don't have something like the DFC to compete 
with a Belt and Road Initiative.
    So this subcommittee I think has done really good work in 
this space. President Bush started it, President Trump 
continued along these lines, even though he cut the account 
dramatically, these are one of the programs he saw value in, 
and I want to support President Biden's effort to grow the 
footprint here.
    So the bottom line for me is that this is a program worth 
investing in at a higher level, taking some of the limitations 
off the program to get maximum benefit, should be our goal in 
2024. And I will end with one question, basically.
    Mr. Nathan, is China your chief competitor in the spaces 
that you deal in through the DFC portfolio? And what would 
happen if this program went away, vis-a-vis China's ability to 
influence the world at a greater level?
    Mr. Nathan. Senator, thank you for the question. And thank 
you, especially, for your comments before that. I 
wholeheartedly agree with what you said.
    So it is clear, in the markets where we operate, China is 
the major actor, the major source of finance, through the Belt 
and Road Initiative, through their development banks, the 
offering of finance at terms that often end up creating 
problems for the countries down the road that accepted them. It 
is clear.
    You can't blame countries for looking for financing to 
build their economies, and support the infrastructure in their 
countries, but it often comes with strings attached, or is 
inappropriate, poor quality.
    What we do at DFC is different than what China does. There 
are there are many reasons for that. The first is we support 
the private sector. I am a strong believer that the best engine 
for alleviating poverty around the world is a robust economy, 
and a robust private sector.
    We also adhere to extremely high standards. We are offering 
projects that countries want, that are appropriate for their 
local conditions, and their laws, that have passed through very 
important screening for labor conditions, environmental 
standards, for know your customer, we care about corruption.
    These are things where we offer something, not only that is 
a choice, but that is different, and I believe is better. And 
if we weren't on the playing field, I hear this all the time 
when I travel, that countries are impatient, they obviously are 
looking to support the welfare of their people, but they want a 
diversity of relationships.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Graham.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this 
hearing. And to you, Mr. Nathan, thank you for being here, and 
for the work you are doing every day.
    I share Senator Graham's sentiments about not limiting 
where we invest to just those countries that are designated by 
the World Bank, because there are places that both need 
investment and have strategic interests for the United States.
    One of those areas, I would argue, is the Western Balkans 
which I have been focused on for a number of years, and one of 
the places where I think we should consider opening a DFC 
office, somewhere in the region, because of its significance, 
both for a Europe that we want to see whole, free, and at 
peace, but also because it is an area that is ripe for 
interference by both the Russians and the Chinese.
    And one of the examples that I have here is from 
Montenegro, which signed a nearly billion-dollar Belt and Road 
deal with the China Road and Bridge Corporation, with funding 
from the Export-Import Bank of China, to build a road that 
would have connected the north and south of the country.
    [Poster on Display.]
    Senator Shaheen. Now, you can see the current status of the 
project in red, that is where the project is completed, but the 
blue parts highlight the still incomplete sections of the 
project, and I think this is a poster example of what you were 
talking about in your opening statement about the limits of the 
PRC's investments.
    Sadly, despite the fact that this project has not gone 
forward as it was supposed to, Montenegro has now signed yet 
another infrastructure deal with China. That happened in March 
when the government signed a deal worth $59 million with the 
PRC Consortium to build a new road.
    But it is my understanding that there were no U.S. or 
European firms who submitted bids. So can you talk about why 
that would have happened? That there were no other viable 
offers from the U.S., and what lessons we should take from this 
kind of situation?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you Senator. Well, I don't know the 
specifics of why the tender in Montenegro failed. I think I can 
generalize to the kind of situations that I see in many of the 
countries where DFC operates. You know, we focus on the private 
sector, so the projects that we fund need to be commercially 
viable, need to offer an opportunity for a return from the 
sponsors where we would provide debt financing or, potentially, 
make an equity investment.
    And I think what frequently happens in these government 
projects that are then tendered, is there is an opportunity--
and I don't know in this particular case--but in general, there 
is an opportunity for corruption, for projects that don't 
really fit the needs.
    What happens when Chinese firms come in is frequently, they 
use their own workers. They end up burdening the country at the 
sovereign level with debt that is difficult to manage. We are 
avoiding that by focusing on the private sector and viable 
projects. And I heard yesterday about a--you know, a South 
American country where Huawei had built the 911 Emergency Call 
System that needs to be rebooted every 4 hours, and so it goes 
offline for an hour, all the manuals are in Chinese, and the 
country can't use it, so they are launching a new tender.
    I am hopeful that American companies will step in, that 
companies from allied countries, and our partners will also 
step in, in order to provide these services. But it is true, 
particularly when I am in Africa, one of the things that you 
rarely see are U.S. companies that are there to compete, and 
that I think is a broader issue, but one, I would love to see 
EPC contractors, the firms that build infrastructure, be more 
broadly representative of America and Europe.
    Senator Shaheen. I agree. And one of the things we have got 
to do is to remind those countries that are looking for 
investments, the trap that the PRC can create for them as they 
did for Montenegro.
    Last year, the DFC announced a deal to provide up to 300 
million in financing to the Three Seas Investment Fund, which 
is supposed to invest in transportation, energy, digital 
infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. It is my 
understanding that despite the strong bipartisan support for 
this investment, that negotiations have still not been 
finalized; can you give us an update on where those are, and 
when you expect them to be completed?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. Thanks for the question. So I was 
delighted last year, I think it was in June, to lead the U.S. 
delegation to the Three Seas Initiative Summit, the Three Seas 
Initiative is incredibly important in terms of strengthening 
our partners and allies in Central Europe. It is about economic 
connectivity, something that I am a strong believer in.
    At that conference we announced that we would be making a 
commitment to the fund. We are already working with the fund 
and throughout the region to find investments that we can make 
directly. We are in the final stages of negotiation with the 
Fund Manager for that fund. There are still some sticking 
points in the negotiation that are important from our side in 
terms of protecting the taxpayer interests in how the fund is 
structured, but you know, I am hopeful that we can get that 
fund across the finish line in short order.
    The bigger picture is this is a Europe where--this is a 
region where we are actively looking for projects. The European 
Energy Security and Diversification Act authorizes us to focus 
on energy infrastructure, and we have some very good projects 
in the pipeline, and have already made a few in the region.
    Senator Shaheen. That is good to hear. One of the other 
areas, I chair the European Affairs Subcommittee of Foreign 
Relations, and so that is where I have been mostly focused. And 
one of the other areas I know that is ripe for investment is 
telecommunications, and we hear particularly from Eastern 
European countries about their interest in getting investment 
to help them so that they are not reliant on China or other 
countries for telecommunications.
    Is the DFC currently involved in any telecommunications 
projects in Eastern Europe?
    Mr. Nathan. So in the high-income countries of Eastern 
Europe, which is the vast majority of them, we are not 
currently authorized to work on telecommunication investments.
    Senator Shaheen. I actually have legislation that I 
introduced in 2022 that would authorize the DFC to invest in 
those kinds of telecommunications projects, because they are so 
critical. So hopefully we will revisit that legislation.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you to my colleague, Senator Shaheen, 
both for the way that you bring your experiences, and 
strengths, and skills, across several different committees, but 
also your persistent focus in a critical part of Eastern and 
Central Europe. It is greatly appreciated.
    Senator Hagerty, we very much look forward to your 
questioning.
    Senator Hagerty. Chairman Coons, thank you very much for 
your remarks. I think that all of you will find that I am in 
violent agreement with everything that has been said, and I 
look forward to working with you on making some continued 
improvements.
    And Senator Shaheen, I could not agree with you more about 
the criticality of telecommunications infrastructure, 
particularly given the difficulties that we have had with 
Huawei, ZTE, and others that are trying to invade the entire 5G 
infrastructure system.
    I would like to just step back for a moment, Mr. Nathan. I 
think you know a little bit of the history, but for my 
colleagues, I would like to share the fact that I have some 
parental pride in what you are doing, because the design of 
what has now become the Development Finance Corporation was 
something I was deeply involved, and as we transform from the 
old OPIC, to what you are leading right now.
    And at that point, we made some significant modifications 
in terms of what you are allowed to do, equity investment for 
example. I don't think any of us, particularly people with 
business background imagined that we got it exactly right, but 
I think that what we would hope to see is the ability to 
continue to improve. As you learn, as you try to deploy the 
funds that we have given you, and finding rules that will help 
make you more and more effective, so I am glad that this 
conversation is happening right now, in terms of how we can get 
it done.
    I will see another critical aspect of having the ability to 
improve, is having individuals like yourself who have the 
relevant private sector experience, and know-how to invest. And 
I think we benefit from your experience, your predecessors like 
Adam Boehler, and Ray Washburne, having that type of business 
DNA makes your organization much more effective. And I think it 
makes us much more inclined to work with you to improve the 
various parameters that you have been given to operate, so that 
you can become even more effective.
    One thing that you mentioned; is that the best recipe for 
alleviating poverty--and I don't want to put words in your 
mouth--was a robust economy and a robust private sector. And I 
would just add to that, that it is also the best means to 
ensure economic security and national security, when we have 
both of those elements.
    I hope that you will have that emblazoned, and put on the 
wall there at the Development Finance Corporation, because I 
admire your words and agree with them, with that slight 
addition.
    I would like to step back and share just some observations 
from a trip I recently took, and I think I spoke with you 
before I undertook the trip to Chile, to Uruguay, to Colombia. 
I just left, this morning, a conference, an ASEAN-U.S. Business 
Council Conference, everywhere we go talking to leaders, we 
realize something very basic. They are trying to recover from 
the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. Their economies 
are facing serious headwinds, their debt burdens have 
increased, social upheaval exists everywhere, frankly, crime is 
up in each of the countries that I speak with.
    These are very real challenges. And you have got countries 
that are operating at the bottom level of Maslow's hierarchy of 
needs. They are trying to put food on the table right now. And 
as I look at the DFC Investment Portfolio what I see are a 
number of projects that are oriented toward lofty goals but, 
you know, with ESG parameters on them, we are investing in, you 
know, billions of dollars in climate change projects, solar 
panels that require endless government subsidies, we are even 
doing a project in South Africa on equitable taxi 
transportation.
    So I am trying to understand how you prioritize projects, 
particularly given the competitive environment that we are in. 
And this has been mentioned, I think, very clearly. We are 
competing every day, you have acknowledged who our top 
competitor is, and that is the CCP, how do you prioritize these 
projects?
    Mr. Nathan. Well, thank you for your comments and for your 
question, Senator. So we have been engaged in a process at DFC 
of thinking about, now that DFC is fully launched its 3 years 
into operation, about how to refine our statement of 
priorities. And I mentioned them in my testimony, it reflects 
the areas that we have been working in, and I think they are 
broad and enduring enough that from administration to 
administration they should be in place.
    That is, infrastructure, energy, health care, agriculture 
and food, and support for small business. This is the five 
areas, that if you look across our portfolio, it is 85-90 
percent of the activity that we do, and it should be where we 
are focusing our business development efforts, our client 
management efforts, trying to bring our whole toolkit of 
solutions to clients in that area, to make a difference in 
infrastructure, energy, health care, food and AG, and small 
business support.
    Senator Hagerty. Well, I think that the countries that we 
are targeting to partner with, will be most receptive if you 
focus on the very basic deliverables here, and the aspirational 
projects that may have some benefit at the higher levels of 
Maslow's hierarchy, I think should be reprioritized. I just 
want to get that point across.
    The second point has been emphasized earlier before, and 
that is the utilization of income-based criteria for the 
countries that you work in. I had a very frustrating 
conversation with the President of Uruguay who really wants to 
work with us, yet our rules make it impossible for him to do 
so. So his only alternative is to, as he told me, is to turn to 
China.
    And I think it just underscored for me, the need to take a 
fresh look at this, and if you have any further comments on 
what we might be able to do in that regard, I would appreciate 
it.
    Mr. Nathan. Well, thank you for the question. The BUILD Act 
gave us eligibility to work in lower-income countries, lower- 
middle- and upper-middle income countries, and that is by 
income classification from the World Bank, a categorization 
that the World Bank doesn't even use for their lending.
    What we think might make more sense is a categorization 
based on the World Bank lending categories, which can take into 
account countries that haven't yet graduated, that haven't yet 
found the way to get to a position where commercial finance is 
the only option.
    Senator Hagerty. Well, I think that----
    Mr. Nathan. If we went to that category, Uruguay would 
become a country that we would be able to operate in.
    Senator Hagerty. I think we will look forward to working 
with you on taking a more strategic view, as opposed to sort of 
a dogmatic income approach.
    There is one last thing I would like to--just a comment I 
would like to have you take a look at it, and get back to my 
team, if you might. And that is to take a look at the Hanjin 
Port at Subic Bay in the Philippines, that project. I was 
deeply involved in that project in my previous role as U.S. 
Ambassador to Japan. I learned that CCP-affiliated entities 
were about to buy that shipyard out of bankruptcy. We were able 
to change that dynamic, put a U.S. private-sector company in 
play for the equity component.
    The DFC was not able to play as I had imagined they would 
be able to play. And if you could just take a look at that 
project, with your business perspective, and could get back to 
me and tell me what might have changed, if your toolset had 
been different, that would have allowed you to play; if I am 
asking that in a way that makes sense?
    I would really like to just take a hard look at that one 
lesson I am very, very familiar with, and understand how an 
improvement or a modification of your tools could have allowed 
you to play a more effective role.
    Mr. Nathan. I definitely will do that. Sea ports are an 
area of real emphasis for us, shipyards too. We just did a deal 
in Greece, we did a ship--a seaport in Ecuador, and we have a 
couple projects in our pipeline that I hope to be able to 
announce publicly later in the year that fit exactly the kind 
of strategic and developmental elements that you just 
referenced.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you. I look forward to hearing back 
from you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Hagerty, for bringing 
your previous experience and insights, both regionally and 
sectorally, to the questioning today.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, 
Mr. Nathan.
    I want to start by associating myself with the comments the 
Chairman made at the outset, and the comments that the Ranking 
Member made at the outset. And I am very concerned about what 
we saw emerge from the House of Representatives yesterday in 
terms of their 302(b) allocations for SFOPS.
    In my view that represents a retreat around the world at a 
time that we need to be more engaged, not less engaged. And I 
hope that--I know this Committee has had a bipartisan history 
in terms of recognizing America's role in the world, and the 
need to use all of our tools to engage around the world, 
especially when, as you have said, we are competing around the 
world.
    We have a good product to offer. China's investments often 
come with strings that result in bad things happening to those 
countries. But you can't do this on the cheap, and you can't do 
it with rhetoric and no resources. So it is going to be really 
important that we move forward, including the DFC.
    I want to commend the Chairman, not only for his role in 
establishing the DFC, but the legislation that I am proud to 
co-sponsor to fix this budgeting issue. It is absolutely nuts 
to account an equity investment as a PEER Grant, nobody in the 
private sector would think that makes any sense. And since 
these investments are appropriately public-private 
partnerships, we want to make sure that our dollars can travel 
as far as they can, and we are essentially handcuffing you in 
the DFC when we place that limitation through the Budget County 
Rules.
    I am pleased that yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee I chaired a nomination hearing for someone I hope 
will be your deputy, Nisha Desai Biswal, I hope we can move 
that confirmation forward as soon as possible.
    Let me ask you, Mr. Nathan, about the issue of critical 
minerals, and what role the DFC can play in this area. I 
appreciated our conversation after you returned from a visit to 
the Indo-Pacific, including Indonesia. But right now we know 
that we are way behind the game when it comes to critical 
minerals.
    China has secured access to lots of critical mineral 
deposits around the world, and is the world's largest processor 
of critical minerals, and the world's largest manufacturer of 
batteries for EVs, which is going to be a very important part 
of our future, and our future competitiveness globally.
    So can you speak to what kind of projects, investments the 
DFC has when it comes to securing our supply chain for critical 
minerals?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you for the question, and thanks for 
chairing yesterday's nomination hearing.
    So we are the owner of about, I think it is about, 12-13 
percent at the moment of a company called TechMet Limited which 
is a U.S.-aligned platform for investing in the mining of 
critical minerals. We made an initial $25 million investment; 
we have made a follow-on $30 million equity investment 
recently, so that they could pursue cobalt and nickel mining 
and processing in a more efficient way than the standard of the 
industry, in Brazil.
    We are going to have some follow-on projects with them 
elsewhere in Africa, focused on rare-earths, and other 
minerals, those two projects that we are currently working with 
them on.
    This is just an example with the difference that equity can 
make. In these kinds of projects the ability to make equity 
investments made them possible. We wouldn't have been able to--
at the early stage that we were involved, be able to use debt.
    But we are looking beyond just this relationship, there is 
a whole series of projects in other rare earths, in critical 
minerals, in the manufacturing of batteries, and even in 
graphite, we hope to be able to announce a deal later this year 
in that regard, graphite being a critical component of being 
able to manufacture batteries.
    This supply chain, you are right, is already very much 
dominated by PRC entities, but we have to begin chipping away 
at that, at the mining, at the processing, at the manufacturing 
level.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, I appreciate it, and I think 
right now you--you know, you are you are hamstrung a little bit 
in terms of the rules, because I think we need to do more than 
chipping away. I mean, I think we need a surge effort in this 
area. And I look forward to following up on the conversation we 
are having here.
    I worry that we, the United States, and even our allies are 
perceived in some cases of over-promising and under-delivering. 
The President and the G7 announced the partnership for Global 
Infrastructure Investment with the goal of investing $600 
billion in, by I think the year 2027, approximately.
    Can you talk about the DFC's role in that effort, and the 
extent of resources that you are investing at this time?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. So the areas of priority for DFC dovetail 
very nicely with the Partnership for Global Infrastructure 
Investment, and the effort that the G7 is making.
    Last year, out of our $7.4 billion of transactions $5.2 
billion of those qualified as PGII projects. This is helpful to 
have this more whole-of-government effort with our interagency 
partners, but beyond even the U.S. Government, our G7 partners 
are critical in helping amplify the amount of capital available 
for the kind of private-sector investing that we do.
    Under PGII we have made a great deal of effort to 
coordinate with our counterparts in the G7, and more broadly 
amongst our allies, particularly in Europe and in Asia. By 
working together we can create greater efficiency, bring more 
resources to bear on these projects, and really chip away at 
what is the thing that we hear, I hear constantly that DFC 
needs to do more, and do it faster. That is our effort. And 
this is a helpful part of that.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you. On the ``do it 
faster'' part, any suggestions you have as to how we can be 
helpful to you in that, or whether it is internal to the 
Executive Branch process? I would welcome any suggestions on 
that front. Because I think moving quickly is obviously very 
important in this global environment.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator. And thank you for your 
persistent interest and engagement on this issue, and on the 
balance between development and strategic priorities.
    Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you and Senator Graham for holding this very important hearing.
    We appreciate you, Mr. Nathan, for being here and all that 
you are doing. You have got a big job. I know in your 
testimony, you mentioned that the DFC has surged its efforts in 
the food and agricultural sector, food security is national 
security for all of our countries, and that you continue to 
actively look for more viable projects to support.
    Can you tell us what types of projects has the DFC 
supported in improving food security in developing countries?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you for the question, Senator. 
Particularly after Russia's illegal and brutal war on Ukraine, 
the issue of food security, globally, has become even more 
critical and highlighted. It has been one of the reasons why we 
have surged our effort, had a special focus on it.
    Our projects are often small in this area, because they are 
targeted at smallholder farmers, at rural communities, at 
finding ways to bring products to market more quickly, 
eliminating layers of middlemen. We have invested in companies 
that provide technology and financing to smallholder farmers. 
We have made investments with banks that then target their 
lending activity toward farming and agricultural businesses.
    I visited, when I was in Georgia, in the Republic of 
Georgia, I visited cold chain supply--cold chain logistics 
companies that help--that we have invested in, that help 
products--produce not spoil and get to market more quickly. I 
think there are a range of things we can do in aquaculture in 
Asia, and in other activities, focused on really bringing the 
farmer more directly to market.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. That is so important, you know, 
things, little things that are huge things getting countries, 
the regions at just the world food price, you know, as opposed 
to not having the competition, you know, it is so important.
    Mr. Nathan. If I could add. Even something like our 
investment in Yilport, and Puerto Bolivar in Ecuador, a Pacific 
deepwater container port, that has a food security element to 
it, because that helps Ecuador be more efficient in exporting 
bananas, and their--you know, their primary agricultural 
commodity to the rest of the world; so infrastructure is a 
critical component to also helping to promote food security.
    Senator Boozman. Right. Very good. Speaking of 
infrastructure I know that DFC is focusing on working with the 
private sector to promote infrastructure investment in an 
effort to offer a good alternative to Chinese predatory 
lending, can you elaborate on the specific actions the DFC has 
done to reduce Chinese predatory lending in developing 
countries, and what it intends to do moving forward?
    Mr. Nathan. Senator, we need to show up and offer a choice. 
That is the best way to compete. If we have a flow of deals, if 
we have the financing tools available to us, if we have the 
workforce and capacity to process those deals quickly, and to 
generate more deal flow, and deal with clients, that is how we 
are going to be able to properly compete with China.
    I can think of some recent examples of investments that we 
have made that are helpful in that. Our Board approved earlier 
this year our financial support for the expansion of an airport 
in Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries 
in the world, anything we can do to help connect them to their 
region, to the world, to help their economy.
    We are also financing the building of a power plant in 
Sierra Leone. This is a country with an extremely low level of 
electricity penetration. That is a key to development. At the 
moment the capital city, Freetown, is dependent on diesel 
generators on a barge that are owned by a Turkish businessman. 
It is unreliable, it is inefficient, it is unhealthy. By 
financing the construction of a power plant we are helping them 
have greater energy security, and promote development.
    Senator Boozman. In the 2024 budget, the State Department 
has a lot of money for infrastructure, ports, things like you 
are describing; do you all work together?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. We work very closely with our interagency 
partners. The Secretary of State is the Chair of our Board. We 
rely on posts around the world to help us with sourcing deals, 
with the vetting of our partners, with our Know Your Customer 
rules.
    The State Department helps us with thinking about 
certification for the strategic importance of our deals. And 
like with all of our interagency partners, USAID, the Treasury 
Department, Commerce, we work closely to help get our projects 
through the process more quickly, and to generate as many good 
ideas as we can for potential future transactions.
    Senator Boozman. And as far as critical, critical entities 
like biotechnology, do you--are you emphasizing things like 
that? Or how does that work?
    Mr. Nathan. So one of our priority areas is health care, 
helping developing countries build more resilient health 
systems, is an important element of that, that can include 
therapeutic clinics, but it can also be involved in the 
manufacturing of vaccines, or pharmaceuticals, the distribution 
of medicines to rural and underserved communities, those are 
the kind of opportunities that we are looking at.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Well, thank you. We appreciate 
you and your staff's hard work.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. And thank you, Senator Boozman, thank you 
for your great partnership, and development work in Africa, and 
around the world, over now so many years together. I think we 
have done this 13 years together.
    Senator Boozman. A long time.
    Senator Coons. It is hard to believe, thank you for coming 
today.
    If I might, while we wait to see if there is one more 
member who wants to join us, I am going to ask a few more 
follow-up questions. I am specifically interested in vaccine 
production, one of the things that was striking to me about the 
arc of the global pandemic was that we faced a moment where 
vaccine nationalism emerged, and a number of countries, in 
Europe, and the United States, prioritized the development of 
abundant available vaccines for their own population before 
meeting pledges that had been made to the developing world, 
partly because of developments in India.
    But it opened a critical window where both China and Russia 
offered vaccines that were less effective, on complex terms 
that were often not favorable to the recipient country, and 
there was a 6- to 9-month period where I received dozens of 
pointed, and sometimes desperate calls from heads of State 
pressing for access to vaccine technology.
    Vaccines are an important part of human development, and 
public health. We are also likely at some point in our lives to 
face a comparable global pandemic. I am wondering what 
initiatives have been taken to provide some investment or 
financing, or whether that it is credible, in places around the 
developing world so that there is a more distributed global 
network of vaccine manufacturing?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you, Senator. DFC, this is before I was 
there, but DFC pivoted and directed a huge amount of energy 
toward responding to the global pandemic, that did include 
supporting efforts for distributed vaccine manufacturing in 
Senegal, in South Africa, and in India.
    But now that the current pandemic has seemed to fade from 
the top of people's attention, we can't divert our focus from 
preparing for the next pandemic. Part of that is building 
resilient health care systems, and just the underlying 
development of countries I think is critical to that.
    But specifically on vaccines we are looking at broadening 
some of the investments that we previously made to be beyond 
COVID-19 response vaccines, but instead be funding available 
for a broader approach for the basic sort of health of 
societies for children, and for development.
    We worked with, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, we provided 
them with a revolver in order to place orders for vaccines 
prior to donor nation commitments coming in. And we are working 
with them again to think about how to reimagine that 
relationship to be broader in the way that you exactly referred 
to.
    Senator Coons. I would appreciate your keeping up with me 
on that development. One of the things we imagined when writing 
the BUILD Act, was that having equity investment capabilities, 
would also improve syndicating capabilities, partnering early 
stage with DFCs from the Nordic countries, from Japan, from 
South Korea, from our European partners; how is that 
proceeding? What are the limitations on it? Are there any 
additional supports you need either for the interagency or in 
terms of refunding, or legal authorities that would help make 
that real?
    Mr. Nathan. It is clear that that was one of the goals 
behind the BUILD Act, and we have worked hard to fulfill this. 
And I think we are doing a good job. There is a lot of work 
ahead though. Part of that is direct coordination. We have had 
numerous meetings with our counterparts at multiple levels, my 
level and at staff level to find ways that we can get 
efficiencies on due diligence, on deal sharing. This has been a 
productive activity.
    There are some examples of specific frameworks that I think 
could produce great results. One is focused on Ukraine, and I 
don't want to get ahead of an announcement but we announced in 
Japan, during the G7, a collaboration between EBRD, DFC, and 
the other DFIs in the G7, and I think there is opportunities to 
broaden this out.
    Another is a deal that I mentioned in my opening statement, 
which, along with our Japanese and Australian counterparts, we 
were able to fund the acquisition of digital assets in the 
South Pacific. These assets had received an unsolicited offer 
from a Chinese firm. It was important to the Australians, and 
as a result, clearly strategically important to the Japanese 
and to us, to support that effort.
    I think there is a lot more things like that we can do, it 
includes also some of the MDBs, so we are working closely with 
Inter-American Development Bank, with the EBRD, and others, to 
find ways to share deal flow, to get more efficiencies, and 
make greater impact.
    Senator Coons. As there is more and more conversation and 
there have been some actions to revise the World Bank, its risk 
tolerance, its structure, its prioritization, similarly in the 
IMF, I will be interested to have you keep me and others on the 
subcommittee up to date about that work in terms of the 
syndication.
    Two other quick questions, if I can, then I will turn to my 
friend and colleague, Senator Merkley. I think countering 
corruption is an absolutely critical part of what you are 
doing. I would welcome any input on how the offerings that you 
are making allow leaders in developing countries to not just 
have more transparency, better labor standards, better 
technology and skill transfer, but to push back on corruption, 
and what other supports, or partnership you need from either 
State Department, more broadly, Federal law enforcement, the 
private sector, to strengthen that piece of what you are 
bringing to the table?
    Because often the conversation about a large infrastructure 
project in a foreign country is complex, and there are some 
elements of a government that stand to benefit politically and 
professionally, and others that may stand to benefit 
personally. And those are very fraught conversations for a 
potential bidder, an American contractor to engage in, and it 
requires subtle and complex conversations. How are we doing at 
bringing the best of your capabilities, in terms of countering 
corruption, to the fore?
    Mr. Nathan. Thanks for the question. I believe that our 
adherence to high standards is one of our competitive 
advantages, actually. I think you are exactly right, that by 
having a commitment to high standards, labor, social, 
environmental, and integrity standards, it gives countries an 
opportunity to fight corruption, to highlight the problems they 
have, to contrast a difference.
    We work closely with post, our colleagues at embassies are 
critical for helping inform our work, on many questions, but 
particularly this one. We work closely with the intelligence 
community for our KYC, our Know your Customer, and other due 
diligence activities for vetting our potential partners. We 
have very high standards, and occasionally that means we have 
to pass on a deal, but more often than not it means that we are 
able to improve the structure of a deal, the partners we deal 
with, and provide an example in the countries where we operate, 
where working with the private sector, we can really set the 
tone in the way that you said.
    Senator Coons. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the 
DFC next year, I am interested in how you monitor that. Our 
ability to go around the world and say: We have got this great 
new tool, it has got great resources, it is delivering--is 
going to be tested. Folks will look back at some of the 
projects that have been financed and say, did they in fact 
meet, higher labor standards, higher skilled transfer, and 
higher transparency?
    How are you monitoring the outcomes of projects? And as you 
know, unfortunately, all too often in looking across a big 
portfolio, critics or the media are inclined to pull out one or 
two out of hundreds of projects that may have failed to meet 
the projected goals. How are you monitoring the actual 
implementation on the ground over these 5 years?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. Well, I think you are right mistakes do 
happen, and we need to be prepared to handle them well. That 
that is what makes the difference, right, by being open and 
transparent, by having process internally and externally for 
dealing with that. That is the key to mitigating the damage 
that a mistake, or some future problem could have.
    You know, this is one of the things that the resources, 
that this committee has provided us with has really helped 
bolster. Our Office of Development Policy is actually the 
biggest area in DFC. That is where our investment monitoring 
takes place. We don't just need to do screening and analysis of 
the development impact, and all of the various standard 
concerns we have before making the investment, we need to stay 
engaged and measure in precisely the way that you are 
mentioning.
    And when things happen, if we didn't catch them, we still 
need to have a mechanism whether it is our public 
accountability mechanism, our openness with our Office of 
Inspector General, or other channels with our interagency 
partners, to make sure that when deals go in a direction that 
we wouldn't have wanted, that we handle that as effectively and 
proactively as possible.
    Senator Coons. I look forward to staying in touch with you 
about that, because anyone who has supervised a large portfolio 
project knows there is always a tail, there is always a few 
that go sideways. But as you said, exactly, how you monitor, 
how you respond, and then how you change policies and practices 
are critical.
    Senator Merkley, thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Mr. Nathan for coming and sharing your insights.
    I want to focus on the DFC's role in supporting fossil fuel 
projects. The report from April 2021 through March 22 had $217 
million directed towards fossil fuel projects; when is DFC 
going to quit financing all fossil fuel projects?
    Mr. Nathan. Senator there are situations where the funding 
of fossil fuel projects is within our mandate. For example, in 
response to Russia's brutal war on Ukraine, and under the 
European Energy Security and Diversification Act, we have 
increased our effort to find projects in Central Europe that 
help with energy security.
    We provided $400 million in political risk insurance to an 
entity that is providing gas in Moldova so that they can 
diversify away from their dependence on Gazprom. This is in 
response to the emergency situation that Moldova was in because 
of the war in Ukraine.
    Furthermore, and I referenced it earlier, DFC is currently 
financing the building of a gas-fired power plant the small 
one, 83 megawatts, in Sierra Leone, this project is highly 
developmental in a country that is incredibly poor, where 
providing access to electricity is a critical component of 
development. And while the major emphasis for DFC in providing 
access to electricity is in providing renewables, solar, 
geothermal, wind, we are looking at many nuclear projects, in 
some circumstances where there is no alternative and a highly 
developmental situation that can help bring a country out of 
poverty, we will still consider those situations.
    Senator Merkley. Yes. Well, I would suggest that you are 
missing the bigger picture. The amount of fossils that can be 
burned by humankind across the globe, and keep us below 1.5 
degrees centigrade, is microscopic now. And all the identified 
projects around the world already account for more than two 
times the amount that can be burned and keep us below 1.5, and 
40 percent more than will keep us below 2 degrees.
    And yet here we are continuing to promote one project after 
another. For example, DFC is supporting the LNG Pipeline and 
project in Vietnam, the DFC supporting the project in 
Mozambique, and supporting intermediaries that are supporting 
fossil fuel projects, and I think it was called the Three Seas 
Initiative.
    So here we are in a situation where my State is burning up, 
we have a national Paris commitment, we have a notional 
understanding that we need to get zero, we are building more 
fossil fuel projects, and yes, I certainly understand that you 
can create jobs in the fossil fuel world, but I recall this 
conversation with the Energy Minister in New Delhi, and this 
occurred during actually a trip that Chris and I were on 
together, and I did a little side trip to meet with him.
    We had had a conversation with the legislators from India 
at the Paris talks in 2015. And he was intent on developing 
some 40 new coal plants, and the gist of it was, I asked him 
what does it cost for a new kilowatt hour of coal? And he said: 
Seven cents, about seven cents.
    I said, how about for a new kilowatt hour of solar energy? 
And he said: About two to three cents. And I said: And those 
costs don't reflect what is outside your window? And he looked 
outside his window but he couldn't really see anything because 
of the pollution from burning coal. And you take into the 
health impacts, then the discrepancy was not seven cents versus 
two cents; it was some much larger number.
    And so the world is at this crisis point, and yet the DFC 
is doing exactly what we have to not do. And there seems to be 
a philosophy deeply embedded in the organization that somehow 
fossil gas is better for the climate than fossil coal, and that 
is simply, scientifically, untrue.
    In its lifecycle, because methane is such a heat collector, 
it is as bad as coal. Now, it is a very powerful organization, 
the fossil fuel world, but we have the biggest challenge ever 
presented to humanity in terms of the devastation we are doing 
to this planet, and the DFC has blinders on, and is continuing 
to support all these fossil projects.
    And there may be super-rare exceptions, but even in a 
situation where there has been war, it is an opportunity to 
rebuild, not on the old model, but on a new model, a new model 
of renewable energy with wind and solar, and in other places, 
for example, in the Rift Valley of Africa, tremendous 
opportunity for geothermal.
    So DFC could be a leader on the pathway the world has to 
take, or they can be anchoring us to exactly the wrong strategy 
that that puts us deeply invested in fossil gas, for a 
generation to come. That is my concern. I really think it is 
time to say that DFC has to rethink this strategy doing far 
more harm than good. And think about how those rising 
temperatures are devastating our coastlines, devastating our 
forests, devastating our groundwater, producing more powerful 
storms, devastating cities across America.
    All those are impacts that have to be taken into account 
too. And those facts, by the way, are not just in America, they 
are all over the world. And if we talk about development in 
Africa, the expanding drought and climate impacts in Africa are 
having enormous impact. The climate impacts in Central America 
are a major driving force of loss bean and corn harvest, 
driving people in the cities, where people cannot find work, 
where they are subject to drug cartels, and they are coming 
north to our border.
    And so while it may look like creating some significant 
number of jobs here, or solving a short-term crisis there, it 
is really time to rethink this underlying strategy.
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you, Senator. I think our area of 
disagreement is actually pretty small. I think there is a large 
agreement between us, of finding ways of addressing the climate 
crisis is a priority for DFC. Last year we did $2.4 billion of 
climate-linked investments.
    Last week our Board approved $144 million loan to a company 
in Ecuador, called Solar Aromo to build a 200 megawatt on-grid 
solar plant that will be the cheapest electricity in Ecuador.
    So I completely agree with you on that. We are engaged in 
diversifying the solar panel supply chain for manufacturing, 
from PRC, so that it is easier to do development of solar 
projects. Even in Ukraine we are currently considering 
providing political risk insurance to a number of wind projects 
which, when I was there, I have been there several times this 
year, these projects are still under construction in the 
western part of the country.
    So this is a huge emphasis from e-mobility, to geothermal, 
wind, solar, nuclear for us. It is the rare exception that you 
mentioned. Some of the projects you mentioned I think are not 
actually projects that we are doing, there is no LNG pipeline 
in Vietnam that DFC is financing. The Mozambique project was 
initiated in 2020. Our major emphasis is in the areas that you 
mentioned, and it is----
    Senator Merkley. Well, let us talk about Vietnam for a 
moment. The Saigon Times reported, January 14, 2023, that the 
U.S. International Development Finance Corporation were going 
to help Vietnam's decarbonization by financing transition to 
LNG. And while the details were not published, that the 
assumption is that supporting the Chan May LNG project, a 4,000 
megawatt gas-fired power project, the energy transition 
partnership, found that Vietnam can transition to clean energy 
without any new LNG development. Transitioning to LNG is not 
decarbonization.
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. So I don't know what that article is 
referring to. I mean, I just have to be frank about that.
    Senator Merkley. Okay. We will explore that, and see if 
that was a typo in the article, but it is the type of thing 
that certainly concerns me. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Merkley. And thank you 
for your persistent engagement on critical issues that matter 
to all of us.
    Thank you, Mr. Nathan. I appreciate your testimony today. I 
look forward to staying in close touch. You have had a wide 
range of questions from a wide range of Members of the 
subcommittee, which I hope reflects the degree of interest. 
Across many of us the common theme is that we want to see the 
DFC succeed, and be strategic, and be effective, and help with 
development, and help with the United States' overarching 
strategic goals. So I look forward to continuing our 
conversation and appreciate your valuable input.
    This hearing, the record will remain open for written 
questions until 5:00 p.m., on Wednesday, June 21. And with 
that, thank you.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
  Questions Submitted to The Honorable Scott Nathan, Chief Executive 
      Officer, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation
              Questions Submitted by Senator Jeff Merkley
    Question 1. What steps has DFC taken to implement its timeline for 
reaching net zero emissions by the year 2040? What will you do to 
ensure that the DFC ends financing for fossil fuels from all sources, 
including financial intermediaries, as well as midstream and upstream 
fossil fuel projects?

    Answer. As potential investments are driven by market demand on the 
ground, DFC expects the net emissions of DFC's portfolio to decrease as 
the proportion of mitigation, resilience, and adaptation investments in 
DFC's pipeline increases and as it potentially supports more 
investments that sequester carbon from the atmosphere, including 
forestry and agriculture. DFC can support a diverse set of technologies 
on a case-by-case basis with an eye towards significant developmental 
and strategic benefits. However, DFC believes that the commercial 
viability of nature-based solutions will increase, allowing the 
Corporation to scale its financing in zero and negative emitting 
investments.
    DFC has seen demand for its support in the alternative energy 
sector increase since its establishment. For example, on June 6, DFC's 
Board of Directors approved a $144 million loan to support the 
construction of a 200 MW solar photovoltaic power plant in Ecuador, 
which is expected to be amongst the lowest cost electricity in the 
country. This investment will be the first large-scale solar power 
project in Ecuador, demonstrating the financial and operational 
viability of solar investments in the country.

    1a. Can you share background information on the projects that DFC 
is counting as contributions to climate adaptation? (i.e. basic project 
background, amount of DFC support that advances adaptation, amount 
leveraged for adaptation, etc.).

    Answer. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, DFC committed $393.75 million to 
11 investments with adaptation and resilience interests.
    Examples include:

  --MCE Empowering Sustainable Agriculture Fund LLC (DFC $10 million, 
        all source funding $40 million): This debt fund is providing 
        financing globally to agribusinesses and rural farmers, 
        improving long-term food security in lower income countries.
  --Leap Agri Logistics in India (DFC $6.7 million, all source funding 
        $8.9 million): Greenfield loan to construct modern, resilient 
        grain silos leased to Food Corporation of India to deliver on 
        their food security mission and reduce food loss yielding 
        positive environmental impacts by avoiding carbon emissions 
        that would have been associated with producing the wasted 
        grain.
  --responsAbility Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Fund (DFC 
        $19 million, all source funding $350 million): Climate smart 
        investments for global small and medium businesses operating 
        across the food system, including in production, processing and 
        logistics, retail, and technology.

    1b. DFC recently approved a $500 million LNG project in Poland that 
will run until 2030, which is also the year by which the EU aims to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% below 1990 levels. The pipeline 
will likely operate for decades after. This project stands to further 
widen the gap between President Biden's $11.4 billion annual pledge in 
international climate financing and the mere $1.057 billion in 
bilateral and multilateral authorized by Congress for this use in FY 
2023, as every dollar of new fossil fuel investment means more future 
climate financing needed to counter emissions to stay within the global 
carbon budget. Please explain the DFC's justification for financing 
this fossil fuel project given the administration's shortfall in 
renewable energy projects, its climate pledges, and security risks 
associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels.

    Answer. The referenced DFC investment in Poland is a guaranty 
covering derivative obligations that represents an important 
contribution to broader U.S. government support for Ukraine and 
European energy security and is in line with the U.S.-EU Task Force on 
Energy Security. By helping European countries meet their energy needs 
and reduce dependence on Russian energy, DFC is supporting a needed 
alternative to Russian supplied energy sources.
    While DFC is supporting energy supply diversification projects for 
strategic foreign policy reasons, the Corporation is committed to 
supporting mitigation, resilience, and adaptation efforts. In FY22, DFC 
committed significant financing to investments that respond to the 
climate crisis (more than $2.3 billion).

    Question 2. There has been concern that the DFC's emissions 
accounting fails to assess the emissions of DFC projects over their 
entire life cycle, thereby underestimating the real climate impact of 
DFC investments. How would you evaluate the DFC's current emissions 
accounting, and what measures could the DFC take to more fully account 
for its carbon footprint?

    Answer. DFC and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, DFC's 
predecessor organization, have been tracking and reporting direct 
emissions from its carbon intensive investment portfolio since 2010. 
That accounting approach follows the methodology established by the 
industry standard Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. As noted, in the GHG 
inventory reports published on the DFC website, the accounting approach 
adheres to statutory obligations.

    2a. Does the DFC contract third party monitors to objectively 
assess DFC's carbon footprint and lifecycle emissions?

    Answer. Yes, DFC currently retains an independent firm to verify 
portfolio carbon emissions. The firm's GHG inventory certification 
letters are publicly posted on the DFC website.

    2b. Does DFC's life cycle analysis take into consideration not only 
the gas that is burned downstream but the leakage that occurs 
throughout the supply chain? How is DFC dealing with new science that 
is finding that methane leakage is significantly higher than previously 
thought?

    Answer. Yes, as part of the due diligence process, DFC conducts 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments of all infrastructure 
investments. The Corporation follows current industry guidance in 
assessing potential GHG impact.

    2c. How are Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)-driven opportunities 
around US clean energy development and deployment being leveraged by 
DFC to support a diversified, global clean energy economy?

    Answer. One area where DFC can support Inflation Reduction Act 
goals is in critical minerals. DFC's tools can support efforts to 
diversify and secure critical minerals supply chains, which are 
important to meet increasing global demand. For example, DFC provided a 
$30 million equity investment in TechMet Limited, building upon 
existing DFC support for the development of critical minerals and 
bolstering of supply chain security for the renewable energy 
transition.
    DFC is collaborating with other U.S. government agencies to 
identify opportunities to leverage investments for greater impact.

    Question 3. A leaked diplomatic cable suggests that there is 
interim guidance in place for climate policy on international public 
finance for energy. While the cable appears to rule out U.S. bilateral 
support for unabated and partially abated coal and other carbon-
intensive projects, there appears to be loopholes that could facilitate 
continued large-scale support for fossil fuels, particularly for gas.

    3a. Is that guidance going to be published, and if not, why not?

    3b. Does the guidance include a prohibition on indirect support, 
such as lending through financial intermediaries that finance fossil 
fuel projects?

    3c. Does the guidance prohibit U.S. support to natural gas 
projects?

    Answer. We refer you to the Department of State for questions 
related to its cables and other internal communications.

    Question 4. How does DFC conduct due diligence with partners and 
engage in local consultation processes to obtain the free, prior, and 
informed consent of Indigenous communities before approving any 
projects affecting their lands and territories?

    4a. How has the establishment of an independent Office of 
Accountability improved transparency and addressed concerns about 
environmental and social issues that arise around DFC-supported 
projects?

    Answer. DFC's Environmental and Social Policy and Procedures 
incorporates the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance 
Standards, which in turn define client responsibilities for managing 
environmental and social risks. IFC Performance Standard 7 focuses 
directly on Indigenous Peoples and outlines specific engagement 
responsibilities when there are potential adverse impacts to Indigenous 
populations. DFC specialists assess and monitor the process as the 
client implements the requirements under Performance Standard 7.
    The DFC Office of Accountability can further provide affected 
communities an opportunity to have concerns related to the project 
independently reviewed and addressed.

    Question 5. How is DFC prioritizing projects to address forest loss 
in the Amazon region, and what are regional DFC staff doing to source 
and develop these kinds of deals? We are aware of a new Brazilian 
representative of DFC and would like to know how they will be charged 
to focus on nature-based deals.

    5a. President Biden announced during the Major Economies Forum on 
Energy and Climate Change potential DFC financing of $50 million to 
help mobilize $1 billion for the BTG Pactual Timberland Investment 
Group's (TIG) Latin American reforestation investment policy milestones 
are satisfactory--and how can DFC scale more sustainable forestry and 
conservation projects like this one?

    Answer. The Regional Managing Director based in Sao Paolo, Brazil 
will support DFC business development activities generally across Latin 
America and the Caribbean with a focus on nature-based solutions. The 
Brazil-based officer will work closely with counterparts in Washington, 
DC, including an investment officer focused on nature-based solutions.
    DFC is conducting ongoing due diligence of the BTG Pactual TIG 
project and structuring the commercial terms for the loan. DFC hopes to 
be able to reach commitment on the investment this year.
    DFC is now evaluating its approach to overseas staffing and working 
closely with interagency partners to develop and implement a strategic 
plan for placing officers abroad where DFC can achieve the greatest 
impact. Part of DFC's strategic vision is to expand its on-the-ground 
presence so that DFC can be closer to potential clients.
