 STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            VERMONT

    Senator Welch. I call the hearing of the U.S. Senate 
Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy to order. First of 
all, it is wonderful to have the witnesses here, and I just 
want to start off by acknowledging what is happening in 
Vermont. We have had tremendous flooding, a great deal of 
suffering, homes and businesses, and our water systems have 
been, in many cases, the town of Johnson I will speak about a 
little bit, a bit overwhelmed.
    It is a timely hearing because there is a lot of 
vulnerability in a lot of our water and septic systems, 
especially in rural America, all around the country. Many of 
our town--Johnson, Richmond, Woodstock, Morrisville, and 
Barre--are under boil-water orders right now, and that is 
pretty tough on folks.
    On Friday, with Senator Sanders and Congresswoman Balint we 
toured Johnson, Vermont, and the wastewater treatment plant was 
a complete loss. It was amazing. The plant was underwater for 
two days. They had eight feet of water on the first floor. That 
is after the basement was flooded. The plant typically takes in 
270,000 gallons in a day. It was taking in 1.25 million. The 
system was outdated. That is just one example where we had that 
terrible rain, but many of the communities that you all 
represent could probably report outdated systems as well.
    You know, these weather events, with climate change are 
getting more and more frequent, and it is more and more urgent 
that we try to make our systems resilient.
    If there was one bright spot in the flooding last week is 
that some of the resiliency work that was done after we had 
Tropical Storm Irene--that was in 2011--actually made a big 
difference. FEMA did something where we were able to build back 
to higher standards as opposed to just what we had. It is a 
real argument, I think, for resilience going forward, 
anticipating the scope of storms that we may have to contend 
with.
    These well-functioning water systems, as you all know, are 
absolutely essential to rural communities, the health and the 
safety and the economy of rural communities. Some of our rural 
communities have aging or insufficient systems. That is 
particularly true in lower-income communities, many of which 
have significant challenges facing, and in many cases, are 
communities of color. Many of these systems are facing 
obstacles, and this is true in all of our rural communities, 
where they have small systems, little funding, challenges make 
regular investments in infrastructure impossible in managing 
and governing capacity. All of those are big challenges, and 
when you do not have a tax base to be able to get the resources 
you need it makes it very, very tough.
    We have got some terrific witnesses here today. Joe Duncan, 
it is good to have you, President of Green Mountain Water 
Environment Association, and Jennifer Day, Director of 
Development. You have first-hand experience with these issues 
in Vermont, and we look forward to hearing from you. One of our 
witnesses today, Catherine Coleman Flowers, has spent years 
fighting for her own community in Lowndes County, Alabama.
    I just want to acknowledge your presence and the work you 
have done over all these years. What I understand is one of the 
incredible effects of not having proper water and septic 
systems is that there can be real illness, and I understand 34 
percent of the county residents tested positive for hookworm 
because of the pollution. That is a situation that we do not 
want anywhere.
    The USDA Rural Development Program has programs to help 
small and rural communities to maintain and improve their water 
systems. Among those programs is technical assistance, which is 
in real demand in these small communities, where they do not 
have the technical capacity, and it is helpful in evaluating 
and planning drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. 
There are also some grants and loans for construction, although 
not enough, and communities at every step of the process can 
benefit from the USDA water programming.
    In the farm bill I am hopeful that we can increase funding 
where we can and protect funding where we need to. There is a 
money issue here--how do you afford to do what needs to be 
done?
    We look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and before 
we do I want to turn it over to my colleague, the Ranking 
Member, Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Senator.

STATEMENT OF HON. TOMMY TUBERVILLE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
                           OF ALABAMA

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and first I 
would like to start by saying I want to send my condolences to 
people in Vermont and all of the Northeast. What a catastrophe 
that was last week. We all saw the pictures on TV, and 
sometimes even the pictures do not make it, you know, what it 
actually is. A lot of people out of their homes and it is 
tough.
    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Senator Tuberville. I always appreciate working with you 
here, and what an important topic this is today. We cannot do 
without water. It is so important that we probably should be 
spending more time on this than not.
    I want to extend a special welcome to two Alabamians, Mr. 
Rob White and Ms. Catherine Flowers. Thanks for being here 
today. I look forward to our discussion about ways to ensure 
Americans in rural areas have access to water infrastructure 
needed to keep them and their families safe and healthy, a 
topic which impacts constituents in Alabama and really all over 
the world, not just our country but all over the world.
    Every American deserves access to water that is clean and 
safe to drink, and a functioning water system that safely 
disposes of sewage and waste. It does not matter where you live 
or what background you have, clean drinking water and sanitary 
waste disposal systems are a necessity that are directly linked 
to better health outcomes for all Americans. However, 
communities across the Nation face constant threats to their 
water services, due to various contaminants, cybersecurity 
risk, work force challenges, aging infrastructure, and funding 
shortages.
    What is this Committee's role in the overall rural water 
discussion? To prioritize rural communities in the farm bill 
discussion we must help rural communities access the resources 
they need to achieve economic success, prosperity, and better 
health and educational outcomes, ensuring they are not left 
behind their urban counterparts.
    This is my goal as we continue to look at ways to improve 
and modernize the various funding and technical assistance 
programs within the USDA Water and Environmental Programs 
Division. In Alabama, there are 503 permitted community water 
systems. Out of over 500 systems in the State, 75 percent of 
these serve communities with a population of less than 10,000. 
Many of these are in what we call the Black Belt. However, all 
communities have access to public water or wastewater systems.
    In fact, Quality Water Association states that 
approximately 23 million households--23 million households--
across the country rely on private wells to deliver their 
water. In Alabama, over 212,000 households rely on private 
wells. Private Wells are a necessity for rural areas as a 
public water system, and they may not be feasible due to 
location or funding. Considering these private wells are not 
subject to the same regulatory oversight as public systems, we 
must ensure these rural areas have the same access to water 
treatment systems as the more populated areas.
    According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 21.7 
million households resort to using a septic tank or a 
decentralized system to remove sewage, as a public sewer system 
is unavailable. In Alabama, many residents throughout the Black 
Belt rely on these decentralized waste systems. We cannot 
forget these citizens. No matter your ZIP code, all Americans 
deserve the same access to safe drinking water and wastewater 
systems.
    I have heard the challenges from rural communities across 
Alabama who struggle to secure the necessary financing and 
technical assistance to continue operating their water and 
wastewater systems. In addition to funding concerns, I hear 
about work force challenges. Labor shortages continue to be top 
of mind across not only Alabama but across our Nation. Many 
certified water operators across the country are aging toward 
retirement, and there are not enough qualified applicants to 
fill the positions. We are facing a growing knowledge gap in 
the future of the water and wastewater industry. We need to 
close the gap.
    To comply with numerous Federal regulations, small and 
rural systems are being forced to outsource to private 
companies as they do not have the staffing capacities or 
knowledge to perform activities in-house. This is unacceptable.
    I will be looking for ways to modernize the regulatory 
environment at USDA so that water systems are able to safely 
serve all Americans while complying with regulations based on 
science, not politics or activism. We must find the delicate 
balance between updating and maintaining critical 
infrastructure, treating water to safe levels, preparing for 
natural disasters and cybersecurity threats, and maintaining a 
fiscal budget. I believe this Committee can find that balance.
    I look forward to this, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to 
talking to our witnesses today and learning as much as we 
possibly can about their areas. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Senator Tuberville, and I am 
delighted that the Chair of our Committee, Senator Stabenow, 
from Michigan, has joined us. Senator.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, let me just say thank you so 
much for this important hearing, and I am so appreciative of 
all the wonderful work the Subcommittee is doing. Thank you to 
you, Chairman Welch, and Ranking Member Tuberville. I very much 
appreciate it.
    I also just want to extend my deepest condolences to your 
home State of Vermont for the ongoing flooding conditions. It 
is just horrendous. I have not had the opportunity to be there, 
but looking at the picture it is unbelievable. I know you are 
going to continue to be a champion for the recovery in Vermont, 
and I know that my colleagues will join me in saying we will do 
everything we can to help.
    Senator Welch. Thank you so much. That matters. There is so 
much the USDA can do to help.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. So much.
    Senator Welch. I thank you very much for that.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. I am so appreciative of everyone who 
is here today. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Senator.
    Our witnesses, we will start with Jennifer Day, who has 
over two decades of experience in community and economic 
development, including capacity building, managing projects, 
water system operation. She and her organization provide very 
critical technical, financial, and managerial support in 
progress for sustainability of rural communities.
    We have Joseph Duncan, who is the General Manager of the 
Champlain Water District. It is a renowned regional water 
supplier, renowned for those of us in the community and those 
of us in Vermont, that received the first Excellence In Water 
Treatment Award in the United States, the very first. With a 
master's degree in environmental engineering, Joe is 
responsible for overseeing all operations and business 
activities in his district.
    Catherine Coleman Flowers, internationally recognized 
environmental activist, author, and MacArthur Genius Grant 
recipient. She has dedicated her life to advocating for 
environmental justice, particularly equal access to clean 
water, and functional sanitation for communities in the United 
States. Her work includes founding the Center for Rural 
Enterprise and Environmental Justice, serving on the boards of 
various organizations, and being appointed as Vice Chair of the 
White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. In 2023, 
she was recognized as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People 
in the World. That is pretty amazing.
    I will now turn to Senator Tuberville to introduce our 
other witnesses.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. First I would like to 
introduce Ms. Pauli Undesser. Did I pronounce that correct?
    Ms. Undesser. You did.
    Senator Tuberville. Awesome. She serves as the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Water Quality Association. She spent 
several years as WQA's Director of Regulatory and Technical 
Affairs before becoming the CEO, and is a recognized leader 
with a vast knowledge of water treatment technologies, 
standards codes, and regulations. Through WQA she works to 
promote the betterment of quality water around the globe.
    She is also the CEO of the Water Quality Research 
Foundation, a nonprofit that sponsors relevant academic and 
professional research to advance the knowledge and science of 
high-quality, sustainable water. In 2016, Ms. Undesser was 
named to the Association Forum's 40 Under 40 List, and in 2018, 
she was honored with the Association Forum's Inspiring Leader 
Award. Congratulations. She holds a bachelor's degree in 
chemistry from the University of Illinois, and a master's 
degree in biochemistry from Northern Illinois University. 
Thanks for being here today.
    Next is Mr. Rob White. Our next witness, he is from 
Wetumpka, Alabama. Rob is the Executive Director of the Alabama 
Rural Water Association, which represents over 450 water and 
wastewater utilities across our great State of Alabama. He was 
born in Troy, spent considerable time in the watergrass region 
of the State so he knows the ins and outs of rural Alabama. Rob 
has over two decades of experience in improving the water and 
wastewater industry and works hard to ensure all Alabamians 
have access to clean water.
    He is a certified specialist in many fields, including 
water and wastewater operations, a commercial efficiency 
auditor, and training specialist, and the FEMA National 
Incident Management System. For over a decade he has helped 
implement Alabama's rural waters and emergency response 
programs, which oversees response efforts across various 
natural disasters and pandemics. Additionally, he manages a 
loan program for water and wastewater utilities, helps 
utilities seek diverse funding sources, and provides technical 
assistance to hundreds of systems across the State.
    I am grateful for the hard work rob has done so far to 
deliver water and wastewater in our rural communities through 
Alabama, and I look forward to seeing his continued work. 
Thanks for being here today, Mr. White.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Ms. Jennifer Day, you are 
recognized for five minutes.

   STATEMENT OF JENNIFER DAY, DIRECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT, RCAP 
                    SOLUTIONS, WORCESTER, MA

    Ms. Day. Thank you, Chairman Welch, Ranking Member 
Tuberville, and members of the Subcommittee, for this 
opportunity to discuss the importance of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Rural Development suite of programs and services 
that foster rural economic development and prosperity. USDA-RD 
is the only Federal agency dedicated solely to rural America 
and plays a key role in improving access to capital to ensure 
rural areas remain great places to live and thrive.
    I also want to thank this Committee for their work on 
writing the next farm bill and for prioritizing water as part 
of your schedule today.
    My name is Jennifer Day, and I am the Director of 
Development with Rural Community Assistance Partnership (RCAP) 
Solutions, the Northeast and U.S. Caribbean RCAP. I am very 
proud of my five years both in the field and as the Director of 
Community and Environmental Resources, responsible for a team 
of 30 technical assistance providers serving rural communities 
across all New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
    RCAP is a national network of nonprofit partners working to 
provide technical assistance, training, and resources for rural 
communities in every State, territory, on Tribal lands, and in 
the colonias. Through our network of more than 350 technical 
assistance providers, they build capacity that leads to 
sustainable and resilient infrastructure and strengthens rural 
economies. Our approach is grounded in long-term, trusted 
relationships in those communities.
    For 50 years, this network has partnered with multiple 
Federal agencies, including USDA-Rural Development, to bridge 
the gap between Federal programs and the communities they 
serve. We help communities understand how to properly manage 
and operate their infrastructure in a fiscally sustainable 
manner and ensure that Federal borrowers meet the terms of 
their loans.
    RCAP supports robust reauthorization of USDA-Rural 
Development water, wastewater, and solid waste grant and loan 
programs and their associated technical assistance programs, 
including the Water and Environment Programs, or WEP, in the 
next farm bill, programs whose impact can be demonstrated in 
every State and territory, including in Vermont, where flooding 
last week and the major disaster declaration highlights the 
importance of the long-term, managerial, and financial work 
that is RCAP's specialty, enabling small systems to prepare for 
and recover from emergencies.
    In Vermont, the WEP funding allowed RCAP solutions to work 
directly with 25 communities in the past few years, on a range 
of critical water and wastewater needs. We helped board members 
who were previously proud of not having raised rates in over a 
decade see the light and understand the need to have 
sustainable rates that cover their true operating expenses. We 
work with water and wastewater system managers to document 
system failures, communicate the importance of system upgrades, 
and provide public education to ensure that all stakeholders 
can make informed decisions when it comes time to vote on 
measures.
    The need to plan for systems upgrades and comply with 
regulations does not discriminate based on system size, and 
technical assistance providers like RCAP help fill the capacity 
gap of the small rural systems.
    In most cases it takes multiple years of predevelopment 
planning and multiple funders to successfully implement each 
project. The small systems rely on federally funded 
predevelopment grants and technical assistance like USDA-Rural 
Development and the RCAP network provides. We assist with 
community engagement, application assistance, and affordability 
qualifications.
    Continued support, increased funding, and State office 
oversight of the SEARCH and WEP funds would increase 
applications to WEP to make sure that no rural systems are left 
behind.
    Our funding application assistance and other related tasks 
helps communities in the Northeast and Caribbean receive 57 
awards in Fiscal Year 2022 alone, resulting in over $88 million 
in grants and low-interest loans. Across the country we did 
$400 million in infrastructure funding.
    I want to thank the Committee for their work to reauthorize 
the critical USDA RD programs in the next farm bill, and we 
look forward to working with you to ensure that the rural 
communities and USDA have the tools that they need to promote 
improved quality of life for rural America.
    Thank you.

    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Joseph Duncan.

 STATEMENT OF JOSEPH DUNCAN, PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER, CHAMPLAIN 
 WATER DISTRICT/GREEN MOUNTAIN WATER ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATION, 
                      SOUTH BURLINGTON, VT

    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Chair Welch, Ranking Member 
Tuberville, and the members of the Committee. I want to thank 
you for having me here to speak to what I believe is, in my 
mind, the most important thing out there--water, safe drinking 
water. If anybody can live without it, I ask you to raise your 
hand.
    One of the things that Senator Welch touched upon was how 
the reactive measures during Irene in 2011, helped to address 
and eliminate, abate some of the issues that occurred in the 
2023 flooding that just occurred here in Vermont, and that is 
wonderful. It is wonderful that things like that happen where 
you can put stuff in place and avoid incidents in the future.
    A lot of our water systems operate that way. They wait for 
something bad to happen, and when something bad happens that is 
when they make a reactive investment in it. That reactive 
investment is typically not one that is the most prudent way to 
go about it, for users and investors in the system. People are 
paying rates to keep their systems up. There is a reason it is 
called operation and maintenance. A lot of times what happens 
is, especially in Vermont, people are just keeping their rates, 
as Jennifer said, keeping their rates low thinking that they 
are helping out their fellow citizens, when in reality they are 
not doing them any favors. Inflation, as well as all the supply 
chain issues and cost increases that we saw with COVID have 
caught up very quickly on that.
    In Vermont alone, I mean, we are an extremely small State, 
extremely small systems. Ten thousand is the cutoff for USDA 
Rural Development funding. We have about 1,300 public water 
systems in Vermont, serving about 59 percent of our 647,000 
residents in Vermont. Of that size, there is even a smaller 
amount of systems that are less than 1,000. Ninety-five percent 
of our systems are less than 1,000 people. We are an extremely 
rural State, and so I know what it looks like to try and 
overcome some of the challenges that a lot of these small 
systems are seeing.
    We need to look at USDA as one of the ways to help our 
water systems understand how to do stuff in a proactive manner. 
We have to do it both with our assets and our infrastructure on 
an investment basis, as well as stopping to take a look at how 
do we address the changes in climate that are affecting us, 
whether it is impacting your source waters with hot, dry 
weather so that you do not have the ability to access water to 
deliver to people. Perhaps it is rain events that are impacting 
infrastructure by flooding them, or washing stuff away, and how 
do you get yourself to be more resilient to deal with that. As 
well as--which USDA plays a role in--the electric grid, which I 
am not here to speak to, but there is not a water system in the 
country, that I am aware of, that does not need the electric 
grid to operate. We not only need to look at that from a water 
system perspective with our own infrastructure but how we, with 
our partners, produce our water.
    To me, looking at the farm bill, it is something that comes 
up every five years, we have an opportunity to, one, make some 
investments in it. One of the things I know, in talking to our 
Vermont residents as well as people in the water industry, 
there is a concern that the recent ARPA money, as well as BIL 
money, is going to give everything that we need to address all 
of our water infrastructure needs, and that is not the case, 
especially in rural States like Vermont. We need that money to 
help fund infrastructure on a very small scale, and USDA is a 
great place, a great source of that.
    It is also one of the only funding sources that I am aware 
of that is also not a regulatory compliant piece. The EPA is 
great with providing funds, but the EPA is a regulatory agency, 
and that scares a lot of people in Vermont utilities. The 
ability to continue the Circuit Rider program, because boots on 
the ground has been incredible for this recent event as well as 
other events, trying to look at climate resiliency and funding 
that, as well as asset management, is critical for our water 
systems.
    Then the last thing I will say is that there does need to 
be a look at--and it is in my testimony so I will leave it at 
that--that bonding is a real challenge in Vermont, the way that 
the program is set up. There are some ways, I think, that the 
SRF handles it that perhaps USDA Rural Development could look 
at so that bonding becomes more of a certainty for accessing 
funding.
    I thank you.

 STATEMENT OF CATHERINE COLEMAN FLOWERS, FOUNDER AND CEO, THE 
    RURAL CENTER FOR ENTERPRISE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, 
                         HUNTSVILLE, AL

    Ms. Flowers. Thank you, Chairperson Welch, Ranking Member 
Tuberville, and all the members of the Subcommittee for the 
opportunity to testify. My name is Catherine Coleman Flowers. I 
am a disabled veteran and founding director of the Center for 
Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice in Huntsville, 
Alabama.
    I also serve as the practitioner in residence at Duke 
University, a member of the boards of the Natural Resource 
Defense Council, the American Geophysical Union, and the 
Climate Reality Project. In 2020, I was awarded a MacArthur 
Fellowship in Environmental Health, and I authored the book 
entitled Waste: One Woman's Fight Against America's Dirty 
Secret.
    In my book I uncovered the extent in which rural America 
has been denied access to sustainable and resilient wastewater 
infrastructure. Too many people in this country lack safe, 
reliable, functioning sanitation. About 1 in five households 
are not able to send their sewage to a centralized wastewater 
treatment plant. These families rely on onsite sanitation 
systems that are more likely to fail. This impacts people 
across the country. For example, areas like the colonias and 
Tribal nations lack indoor plumbing.
    In Hawaii, 88,000 aging cesspools are leaking 53 million 
gallons of untreated waste into streams, oceans, and drinking 
water every day. Across Appalachia, raw sewage flows past 
people's homes. Centreville, Illinois, and Miami, Florida, are 
facing well-publicized struggles with sanitation issues. These 
systems are absent or failing small rural communities, from the 
Central Valley in California to native villages in Alaska. In 
Puerto Rico, communities struggle to rebuild wastewater and 
septic systems damaged by hurricanes.
    As a Lowndes County, Alabama, native, I am too familiar 
with the way sanitation failures affect families. Located 
between Selma and Montgomery, the soil and rising water tables 
in this area are not suitable for conventional septic systems. 
It is common for families to have failing systems that cause 
raw sewage to back up into their homes or into their yards. A 
2017 peer-reviewed study found evidence of hookworm and other 
tropical parasites in rural residents exposed to raw sewage.
    Failing systems degrade people's quality of life, take a 
toll on mental health, and cause economic harm by making it 
difficult to attract businesses. Data gaps make it difficult to 
understand the true extent of the problem and the people that 
it affects. However, all communities do not equally share these 
burdens. Low-income and rural areas are more likely to lack a 
centralized wastewater treatment system and are 
disproportionately affected by inadequate sanitation.
    This underinvestment in sustainable infrastructure goes 
back decades, and is being worsened by the climate crisis, as 
we have heard today what is happening in Vermont and rural 
towns across that State who have lost access not only to safe 
drinking water but also to sanitation because of intense 
flooding.
    We can make America a model of ingenuity and have a 
resilient infrastructure for everyone. The farm bill funds 
several USDA programs that could help, including the Rural 
Decentralized Water Systems Program. This program helps low- 
and moderate-income families in rural areas finance the cost of 
onsite assistance.
    Senators Booker and Capito have introduced a bill to 
reauthorize the program and make it work better. This bill is a 
positive step toward addressing critical rural sanitation needs 
across the Nation. A strengthened version of it should be 
included in this year's farm bill, with the following 
improvements.
    One of the things that I really want to make sure I cover 
this before I run out of time, all sanitation systems funded 
with this program must be required to carry a warranty of up to 
10 years. We know from experience that these systems fail 
often. Manufacturers and installers need to be held accountable 
instead of blaming rural residents. This is the only thing that 
I know where people spend this kind of money, and it goes into 
the ground, and if it fails the homeowners are blamed. Rural 
America deserves better.
    My written testimony has additional recommendations, and I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak today, and I look forward 
to continuing this conversation about sanitation equity for 
all.

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.

  STATEMENT OF PAULI UNDESSER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WATER 
  QUALITY ASSOCIATION AND WATER QUALITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION, 
                           LISLE, IL

    Ms. Undesser. Thank you, Chairman Welch and Ranking Member 
Tuberville and all of the members on the Subcommittee. Thank 
you for inviting me to testify and be a synergistic resource as 
you are working through your leadership on modernizing 
community rural water systems. My name is Pauli Undesser, and I 
am honored to be here and address the Subcommittee as the CEO 
of the Water Quality Association and the Water Quality Research 
Foundation.
    WQA is a not-for-profit association that amplifies and 
unites a voice of over 2,500 member companies, mostly 
headquartered on U.S. soil, and employ hundreds of thousands of 
workers. For over 75 years, our members have manufactured, 
distributed, and installed water quality improvement solutions 
in homes and in businesses. WQA upholds ethics and integrity 
while serving as an educator for water treatment professionals, 
a certifier for water treatment products, and an information 
source for the public.
    The Water Quality Research Foundation is the industry's 
not-for-profit data-generating powerhouse that advances the 
mission of water quality by sponsoring peer-reviewed academic 
research.
    Modernizing water systems, whether public, private, or 
otherwise, is critical for millions of Americans across the 
United States facing drinking water contamination from various 
sources, including lead, arsenic, nitrates, PFAS, and others. I 
applaud the Federal Government's recent efforts to combat these 
concerns and ensure safer drinking water for all Americans. 
Congress, through the leadership of this Subcommittee, should 
continue these efforts in the 2023 Farm Bill to ensure that 
rural communities are not left behind.
    Congress, EPA, and the CDC have all recognized that point-
of-use and point-of-entry-technology are effective solutions. 
Most options treating water closest to the point of consumption 
can be installed faster than centralized treatment systems, 
meaning people are protected sooner. More specifically, those 
living in rural communities served by private wells, like me 
and my family for the past 20 years, in-home solutions are 
coveted as the proven solution to improved water quality.
    USDA's Rural Development suite of Water and Environmental 
Programs has been incredibly successful in improving the safety 
of rural communities' drinking water, but more needs to be 
done, more to educate residents on their water quality and more 
to make funding available under current programs. By creating 
new program offerings, USDA can provide flexibility for these 
communities to leverage proven solutions. WQA strongly 
encourages this Subcommittee to prioritize the implementation 
of point-of-use and point-of-entry solutions as a key tool for 
modernizing rural water systems.
    WQA is particularly supportive of S. 806, which is known as 
the Healthy H2O Act, and urges the Subcommittee to include this 
essential legislation within the 2023 Farm Bill. This 
bipartisan, bicameral legislation would provide grants to low- 
and moderate-income households and licensed childcare 
facilities in rural communities to conduct water quality 
testing and to fund the purchase, installation, and maintenance 
of water treatment solutions. These treatment solutions would 
be required to meet national performance standards for any 
contaminants identified during testing and installed service 
maintained by qualified professionals.
    The Healthy H2O Act already has the support of many 
members, both from the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, 
and we anticipate all Subcommittee members will be eager to 
join supporting this bipartisan, commonsense solution.
    Availability of high-quality drinking water is a 
cornerstone for fortifying prosperous communities. It is of 
critical importance for rural communities to be afforded the 
same opportunity to enhance their quality of life through 
reliable and affordable access to quality drinking water equal 
to their urban and suburban counterparts. Technologies 
installed closest to the point of consumption are crucial 
components in this effort.
    I thank the Subcommittee for your time, attention, and 
thoughtful review of including the Healthy H2O Act in the 2023 
Farm Bill. I am a subject matter expert for the betterment of 
water quality, and I am available as a resource in your 
leadership for modernizing rural water systems. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF ROBERT N. WHITE IV, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ALABAMA 
            RURAL WATER ASSOCIATION, MONTGOMERY, AL

    Mr. White. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Welch, 
Ranking Member Tuberville, and esteemed members of this 
Committee. I am honored to be here today to offer my insights 
on the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Water 
and Environmental Programs and their crucial technical 
assistance initiatives which are integral for offering 
affordable and sustainable services to rural America.
    I would like to extend my gratitude to Senator Tuberville 
for his invitation, and more importantly, his stalwart 
leadership and advocacy for Alabama's rural water and 
wastewater sector.
    I serve as the Executive Director of the Alabama Rural 
Water Association, a nonprofit organization that advocates for 
small and rural water and wastewater systems across Alabama. I 
am also here on behalf of the National Rural Water Association, 
which represents over 31,000 rural systems throughout the 
country.
    Our rural systems have their roots in the 1960's Farmers 
Home Administration, and they continue to benefit from 
assistance and support from its successor agency, Rural 
Development. If I may, I would like to express my gratitude to 
this Committee for its unwavering commitment to these 
successful initiatives.
    USDA Rural Development, designed by Congress, is key to 
supporting rural America, especially since 91 percent of the 
Nation's water systems serve communities with less than 10,000 
residents. Rural Development's mission is to expand and 
modernize water infrastructure, and rural water provides the 
critical technical assistance needed to sustain these services.
    Many communities in Alabama have access to safe and 
affordable water service today that their grandparents never 
had, thanks to the resources authorized by this Committee. 
Thank you.
    I will now quickly review a few of our top priorities for 
your consideration as you draft the 2023 Farm Bill.
    First, the Circuit Rider program, established by this 
Committee in 1980, is our pioneer initiative aimed at offering 
solutions and hands-on support to rural communities. Water 
Circuit Riders offer a wide range of onsite, hands-on 
assistance and training.
    On a national scale, last year alone Water Circuit Riders 
made a direct impact on the health and safety of over 24 
million individuals, constituting 41 percent of rural America. 
Circuit Riders respond immediately to calls for assistance, 
whether they concern disaster management, sourcing disinfection 
supplies, design and construction advice, or system operation 
and maintenance, to make sure water service is available every 
second of every day. We humbly request this Committee 
reauthorize this flagship program.
    Second, the NRWA and State Rural Water Associations have 
been at the forefront of emergency disaster response for 
decades. Last year, during a historic cold front, Alabama 
Circuit Riders were responding to utilities on Christmas Day, 
finding and fixing leaks and distributing six truckloads of 
bottled water to communities without water service, at no cost 
to those utilities. We propose that this Committee consider 
extending authorities to enhance preparedness activities to aid 
systems in recovery outside the scope of immediate disaster 
response and ensure a more resilient water sector.
    Another ongoing project of note is the Closing America's 
Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative. ARWA has partnered 
with USDA and EPA to mitigate wastewater issues in Lowndes and 
Greene County, Alabama. This pilot project was announced in 
White Hall, Alabama, last August, to introduce a variety of 
wastewater treatment solutions for communities that lack 
sufficient sewer service. The latest estimates indicate that 
roughly $1.4 billion are needed to implement decentralized 
wastewater treatment technologies and resolve individual septic 
tank issues across Alabama's Black Belt alone.
    Next I would like to discuss the latest cybersecurity 
issues facing rural water. In Alabama, system regulatory 
inspections occurring after October 1, 2023, will require a 
cybersecurity audit. Unfortunately, given the scope and 
complexity of cybersecurity, the reality is most rural 
utilities lack the financial resources and in-house expertise 
to secure themselves from cyber threats.
    We suggest this Committee consider providing funding for 
cybersecurity Circuit Riders to help rural water systems 
protect their utility and its customers. We also recommend 
modernizing the Rural Development Water and Wastewater Programs 
to better address current utility needs with additional 
affordable financing and servicing options. This should include 
zero and one percent loans to disadvantaged or economically 
distressed communities. EPA and the Rural Housing Service 
already have similar authorities.
    Finally, we recommend advancing voluntary consolidation of 
rural communities by allowing a contiguous system to apply for 
a grant or loan on behalf of a neighboring underserved 
community. This authority show be narrow and ensure that the 
additional subsidy is targeted entirely to the community in 
need.
    In summary, USDA's Rural Development Water and 
Environmental Programs are critical in keeping rural America's 
water and wastewater services areas economically viable while 
also providing the resources to support underserved 
communities. With the current backlog of around $4 billion, 
demand remains high. ARWA and NRWA are honored to continue and 
strengthen the successful partnership with USDA Rural 
Development and this Committee.
    Thank you for the opportunity to participate today.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. White can be found on page 
364 in the appendix.]

    Senator Welch. Thank you, and I want to thank all the 
witnesses for their excellent testimony. I am the last Senator 
before a vote closes so I am going to have to leave temporary 
to vote, and I am going to turn the gavel over to Senator Cory 
Booker, and I will be right back.
    Senator Lujan. [Presiding.] Well, with that comes the 
privilege to questions, I believe, so thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
for letting me dig in there real quick as the gavel is going to 
switch to another hand, so I am going to jump on this 
opportunity.
    My first question, Ms. Day, surrounds colonias, so I 
appreciate you raising those as well. I appreciate the 
testimony of Mr. White with the importance of being able to 
apply for neighboring communities that may be in need as well 
and how you can get them support. One of the challenges with 
colonias is they are unincorporated communities, and so it is 
hard to do that.
    My question to you is, looking at New Mexico, specifically, 
home to about 129 colonias--and for those that do not know what 
they are, these are unincorporated communities. They often have 
economic challenges. They are generally economically 
distressed. They are along the U.S.-Mexico border, in the 
United States, and they lack access to safe drinking and 
sanitary wastewater systems. In 2022, USDA announced a $13 
million investment to expand access into these areas, so we 
support these and we appreciate them, specifically, as you 
pointed out, Ms. Coleman Flowers, to colonias, rural and Tribal 
communities as well.
    These investments are vital to ensuring that at-risk 
communities are able to take advantage of these funds. My 
question to you, Ms. Day, is as colonias are unincorporated 
they do not have a mayor or a council. Often they do not have a 
voice in State or Federal Government. How can Federal programs 
such as USDA Water and Environmental Program better catch our 
colonias and rural communities so they do not fall through the 
cracks when it comes to providing essential utilities?
    Ms. Day. Thank you, Senator Lujan. I appreciate the 
opportunity to talk to this. We know that this area, the 
environmental impact of weather will continue to make this 
issue worse for these communities. I know that when RCAP 
technical assistance providers are working in a community we 
are empowering them to make decisions on their own. We hear 
often that we are giving them the tools that they need and then 
they are using those tools.
    In colonias we are looking at continued technical 
assistance and funding. It is critical to maintain those water 
systems. We are often there when boards transition after a big 
project, so for us it feels like that is the place that we can 
have the most impact is helping even communities that are 
underfunded continue to find a way forward. We will be there 
for 10 years if that is what it takes.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Ms. Coleman Flowers, you 
mentioned colonias as well in your testimony. Do you have some 
thoughts to the question that I presented to Ms. Day?
    Ms. Flowers. Yes, and I think that first of all a lot of 
people do not know what the colonias are and they do not know 
they are there, aver 2,177 communities from Texas to 
California. A lot of these areas are dealing with the same 
problems that we see in Lowndes County, Alabama, and I think 
that there should be more of an emphasis on that. As the Co-
Chair of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council 
my suggestion to everybody--just as when I first met Senator 
Booker I invited him to come to Lowndes County to see for 
himself--I think that the only way we can even come up with 
positive solutions to those areas is going to visit and convene 
people in those communities to try to get this work done.
    I know that in California, for an example, they have just 
instituted a program where they are trying to find out how many 
people are on septic or do not have systems at all, so that 
they can come up with policies and ways in which to address 
this. I think one of the ways we can do this is to fund USDA to 
actually do the type of studies or collect that data to close 
those gaps so that policymakers can make the type of policies 
to address these issues.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. I have some other 
questions, but I will submit them into the record. I am 
reminded, to your testimony, Ms. Coleman Flowers, you cannot 
unsee what your eyes show you, and it is the power of seeing 
and feeling because you understand people's stories and plights 
as well when you go down there and see for yourself. I thank 
you for that reminder. I yield back.
    Senator Booker. [Presiding.] By the power vested in me by 
Senator Welch I hereby decree that Senator Braun shall go next.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Senator Booker. I have gotten 
water, ever since I moved back to my hometown, from a rural 
water district, Patoka Lake, an Army Corps lake. Several 
utilities get water from it. I am not sure about it, but at 
least 10 places across our State we have had PFAS showing up in 
the water at levels above the Federal guidelines.
    Ms. Undesser, you talked about that. How can these rural 
districts use point-of-use and point-of-entry systems? Is that 
economically viable for them to address an issue that I think 
we are all going to be more worried about in the future?
    Ms. Undesser. Thank you, Senator Braun. I appreciate the 
question. PFAS is very complex. It is a moving target, adding 
new compounds all the time. However, one thing that is great to 
know today is that there are solutions that are certified 
products that can remove specific PFAS compounds, and those 
products can be installed in rural water communities by 
qualified individuals that would take care of the installation, 
service, and maintenance of those as well.
    The solutions are available today. The Healthy H2O Act 
would help in the areas of low- to moderate-income areas where 
having access to reliable and affordable technologies is a real 
challenge. Including that in the farm bill is something that 
will be key going forward.
    Senator Braun. Then another question for you and then Mr. 
White. Oftentimes I hear that there are guidelines, regulations 
in actually building out a water system that are difficult. I 
would like each of you to maybe talk about the one or two that 
you would hear most often about, whether it makes sense, or 
whether they are over-burdening, and apply it again to the 
smaller water districts that might not have the resources to 
navigate through all of that.
    Ms. Undesser. As the Water Quality Association, the biggest 
burdens we hear about when it comes to creating a new 
centralized system is the time to get the solutions in and the 
costs to be able to get the solutions there as well. But, there 
are certified products and decentralized solutions that are 
able to do things today, and in a timely manner as well.
    Senator Braun. Mr. White, is the regulatory framework that 
we have got in place, does it hit the sweet spot, making sure 
that we adhere to them, or are there any instances where it is 
over the top?
    Mr. White. There are definitely challenges with some of the 
regulations. Lead in drinking water, getting the lead out, that 
is one that many water systems are struggling to kind of wrap 
their hands around as far as how they are going to address this 
and get the resources into the local systems and be able to put 
those into the field.
    PFAS is another emerging contaminant that is causing a lot 
of questions and consternation with rural water systems 
especially. As this emerging contaminant is found within 
various water sources, it is very costly to remove these 
chemicals. Some of the rural systems just simply would likely 
not have the capacity to be able to implement upgrades required 
in order to remove those chemicals.
    Senator Braun. Is there something beyond remediating 
contaminants? I am talking about just the general construction 
of water systems. Or do you feel that the guidelines we give 
when we cost-share here, is it reasonable in terms of actually 
building out a water system in the first place?
    Mr. White. I believe so. One of the largest problems that 
we have in Alabama, and I am sure across the Nation, is supply 
chain disruptions. We work with a lot of systems, trying to get 
projects designed and get funding from, say, USDA or SRF into 
the community. The project have been extended for months and 
months. The turnaround time on these has just been extended out 
years in some cases, and the cost is ever-increasing. 
Oftentimes we get the project obligated and by the time we put 
those funds out for bid to the communities, those cost overruns 
are to the extent that they have to go back to USDA, apply for 
more money to even complete the project that was originally 
designed.
    Senator Braun. Thank you.
    Senator Booker. I will go next because I have got the gavel 
and Mr. Tuberville is a generous man. Thank you, sir.
    First of all, I am grateful for the Ranking Member and the 
Chairman for holding this Committee. I cannot tell you about 
the urgency, and I think it was reflected in a lot of the 
comments that were made beforehand. I am, frankly, when I 
finally started doing the research when I got into the Senate I 
did not realize how much of a crisis many areas of our Nation 
have by just having not access to clean water or to septic 
systems.
    I was telling the Ranking Member that my roots go down into 
Alabama, and I owe that State so much of my life. When I went 
down to meet with you, Catherine, when you challenged me to 
come down and actually see for yourself, I was really stunned. 
It started because I was meeting with a doctor who was telling 
me that we have these tropical diseases that many doctors do 
not know exist in many areas of this country that have these 
kinds of straight piping because they have no septic systems or 
wastewater systems at all. When you see it for yourself and you 
meet with people who are struggling with this, it just makes 
you think it is a shame of our Nation, a nation this strong, 
this powerful, this wealthy, that could not do something about 
it.
    That is why I am glad this is a bipartisan issue, which is 
reflected in the comments from all the witnesses as well as 
from many of my colleagues. I have had the privilege of working 
with Senator Capito, who has been a great partner, in 
addressing these issues, and we were able to create authority 
for the USDA to provide loans and grants to low-income 
households to install individual wastewater systems.
    Now in the upcoming farm bill, Senator Capito and I are 
looking to make improvements to the program that we were able 
to get established, and I am going to direct my questions to, 
sincerely, one of my great American heroes. Catherine, you have 
inspired me more than you know, and I am just grateful.
    One of the changes that Senator Capito and I are pushing 
for in the farm bill is for a program to provide funding for 
warranties to accompany these septic systems. Can you talk 
about the warranties and why they are so important?
    Ms. Flowers. Yes. Thank you, Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. She calls me Cory when we are not in 
public.
    Ms. Flowers. Yes. I cannot do that today. It is very 
important because what happens is once a septic system is put 
in--and we paid for a lot of them in Lowndes County--the 
liability is transferred to the homeowner. When they fail, the 
homeowner has to fix it, and a lot of them cannot afford to do 
that.
    We are finding, not just in Alabama but across the country, 
these systems are failing within two years, and some of them, 
when they do fail, it is very costly to fix, and people do not 
fix it. That is when they start straight-piping or they do 
something else to come up with some remedy that is not legal in 
order to make sure that the sewage does not come back into 
their homes. When they come back into their homes it comes back 
either through a bathtub, it can come back through a sink. I 
mean, those of us that are pet owners know that a dog would not 
sleep on a bed that has been fouled. Why do we expect humans to 
live that way?
    I think the only way we can really change the way this 
works is to have warranties in place. It can inspire research 
and development and improvement. I mean, I am old enough to 
know when a car would not last more than two years, but when we 
had competition and we had to look at cars that were being made 
in other countries that were lasting longer, American cars got 
better too. Likewise with warranty systems for these wastewater 
systems, that people have to have.
    I spoke with Ranking Member Tuberville earlier. He talked 
about the importance of water. Sanitation is also important and 
is a part of water, and we have to have that for health and 
safety.
    Having these warranties in place, I think, would ensure 
health and safety for all homeowners, and certainly those in 
rural communities that should not be left to fix this on their 
own.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Catherine. I had a brief brush 
with power, which I am not about to lose to the great Senator 
Welch. I did not even get to slam the gavel down. I will ask 
you just one more question before I surrender the position I 
have, that has most of the people here in awe.
    Despite authorizing both grants and loans, we know that the 
USDA has administered this program strictly as a loan program. 
Now the folk I saw in Alabama, and now have seen in other 
places, are not the folks that can really afford these 
programs. Can you talk to me a little bit about how important 
it is that low-income households, which are usually the 
households affected, receive grants to install these systems?
    Ms. Flowers. Yes. I think that is a very important point, 
not only low-income households but also for a lot of the 
communities. When I first got involved doing this work I 
remember talking with Senator Sessions years ago about why 
rural communities, although the money was available, could not 
get it because they could not come up with a match. Likewise 
with loans. A lot of these families are struggling. They cannot 
afford that. Everybody in this country, I believe that we are a 
great nation, and we everybody in this country should have the 
right to sanitation, and they should not be able to be without 
it simply because they cannot afford a loan. That is why grants 
would be very important to a lot of poor families across the 
U.S.
    Senator Booker. Mr. Chairman, Catherine said that 
eloquently, but I had this wonderful, beautiful moment with 
Senator Shelby, in the gym of all places. He and I used to work 
at odd times and became really good friends because we were the 
only two people in the gym, and nobody was there to make fun of 
how little work we were doing in the gym. When I told him about 
your problem, Catherine, he said the exact same thing, that 
these are good folk that should have what is basic and did a 
lot on his position to deal with the issue. I am glad that we 
have Alabama Senators that have the same heart to address these 
issues and that this has been such a bipartisan space for me to 
work in, and I am just really grateful. Thank you, Mr. powerful 
Chairman.
    Senator Welch. [Presiding.] Thank you, and by the way, I 
want to acknowledge the letter that you are working on to get 
data that we need in order to focus where we need to have the 
allocation of resources. Thank you very much, and I look 
forward to working with you on that.
    Senator Tuberville.
    Senator Tuberville. I yield to my colleague, Senator Cindy 
Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you very much because I do have a 
couple of questions, and thank you for hosting this important 
meeting. Thank you for coming to testify. This is so valuable 
to hear from folks, and I know sometimes it is hard to come up 
here and do that. It takes a lot of time, and I just appreciate 
your willingness to do that.
    Mr. White, the Rural Water Association provides so much 
technical service that is very valuable for the training of our 
small utility providers. When the tornadoes blew through 
Mississippi just a couple of months ago, the Rural Water 
Association responded instantly to help. You know, they were so 
knowledgeable.
    You have already talked about this some, the Circuit Rider 
program. Can you kind of elaborate on that, like in disasters 
such as this tornado, how valuable it is and how the 
communities benefit so much from this technical support?
    Mr. White. Yes, absolutely. Thank you so much for the 
opportunity. In Rural Water we have a robust emergency response 
program, and it exists across the Nation. National Rural Water 
is a leader overall in emergency response, and the States 
joined together to support that effort. The States, we actually 
own and operate a lot of our own equipment--generators, bypass 
pumps, and just a variety of equipment that we pull together in 
times of need.
    Even now, the flooding in Vermont, my counterpart, Liz 
Royer, I know she has got her team out responding to systems 
now, and she knows that if she needs assistance she would be 
able to reach out to our national network of emergency 
responders, and we will show up when necessary.
    One additional resource that would be very helpful, from 
this Committee and the farm bill, is building upon the 
emergency response network. Having a Circuit Rider that could 
be dedicated to emergency response would be invaluable to the 
States across the Nation. Right now we can respond to disasters 
as they occur. When the tornadoes occur we move our teams in. 
We help get those communities put back together as quickly as 
possible and bridge the time where those communities will be 
without commercial power so that we can set generators and keep 
the water plants up and running so people can cleanup and move 
forward while the commercial power industries get those 
resources put together for the communities.
    In times of blue sky, we refer to, there is a lot of work 
that can be done that we generally cannot focus on in those 
days. If we had the resourcing ability to have a full-time 
Circuit Rider position that could go around and network with 
State and Federal agencies, work with the communities, ensure 
that they have all of their hazard requirements on hazard 
mitigation lists and county emergency networks, those are 
required for when a disaster moves through the community for 
the community to be able to access the money that immediately 
precedes that disaster.
    In addition, the administrative efforts are quite intense 
for any community that is going through a disaster, and to be 
able to support tracking all of the expenses and filing all the 
required documents with the appropriate agencies afterwards in 
order to get money that is made available back into the 
community and not leave any of that on the table would be of 
huge benefit to those rural systems.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you very much because we sure 
benefited from it then. You know, I understand in your 
testimony that work force recruitment and development is a 
challenge for Rural Water Associations. I am really passionate 
about keeping young people in rural areas, but we have got to 
provide something for them. One way to do that is promoting and 
encouraging careers and technical education to help us out 
here. It is great to see the Water Apprenticeship Program in 
Mississippi. It is taking off down there.
    How can Congress help ensure these work force challenges 
are met in rural America's water industry, particularly when it 
comes to recruitment and with training and retention, and 
keeping these people here?
    Mr. White. Yes, thank you. The apprenticeship program is 
growing, and we are certainly proud of it. Alabama is one of 
the 34 States now that have developed an apprenticeship 
program. We have recently started ours. We are looking for our 
first graduate next April, so hopefully that will go smooth.
    Additionally, just continuing to support the resources that 
are available now with training that is offered through the 
technical assistance provisions in the farm bill is a huge 
asset to rural water systems throughout the country, really. 
The apprenticeship program is going to continue to grow. It 
gives us the opportunity to promote the industry where we have 
not been able to before. In Alabama we are going to engage in 
career centers and be able to get the word out to people so 
that they can engage with our industry in a proactive manner. 
Then also provide a structured platform to move those people 
from curious about water and wastewater work into the career 
that we all know it could be, a very rewarding career.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Another thing that has been discussed a 
lot is the challenges that communities face when navigating the 
funding application process. You know, we get calls on that for 
water and wastewater projects, and we may want to talk about 
that. I know my time is out right now, if you will indulge, but 
how can the administrative burden for small and rural water 
communities be alleviated when participating in the USDA 
funding programs for water and wastewater projects? We are 
going to have to be fast because I am a minute over.
    Mr. White. I will try to be quick. The most success that we 
have in the State, when rural communities reach out and they 
are looking to apply to USDA for a project, is we will send a 
team out. They will go and they can help kind of navigate and 
cut a lot of the red tape, or the initial burden of engaging 
with USDA's online RD Apply system, for instance. There are a 
few complications in there that are required. They have to be 
registered with SAM.gov, and sometimes there can be some back 
and forth. In fact, that one can be difficult at times.
    Having the technical assistance available to be able to 
move into a community, get all the registrations registered, 
get the team pulled together, and then have to have an e-
authentication credential in order to engage with the system, 
the individual roles have to be set up, you have got to bring 
the engineers in, the accountants, and all of that to the 
table.
    Having the technical resource able to come in and help 
organize and get all that together so that we could kick the 
project off, or the application off, seems to be of great 
assistance to those communities.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Makes sense. Thank you very much, and 
we have five votes going on, so I apologize that the table 
looks empty. They just called the second vote, and I am going 
to go vote. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Duncan, I appreciate the help you are giving us in 
Vermont to assess what the damage has been. Do we need to make 
any changes to give USDA more flexibility to upgrade the 
resilience factors to accommodate the reality of the more 
extreme weather events that are occurring?
    Mr. Duncan. Yes. You know, my take on things is to always 
look to find proactive ways to do things as opposed to the 
reactive ways, and I think that USDA Rural Development can play 
a role in doing that. I know EPA has a ``CREAT'' I believe they 
call it, for climate resiliency evaluation tool.
    What you are looking for is those small communities that do 
not know where to begin at all with any of this, let alone the 
aging infrastructure needs that they have, they do not really 
have a sense of where to go, so planning assistance is very 
valuable there. That also applies for how to understand where 
their weak points are in their system when it comes to any kind 
of extreme weather event, and how to prepare for that, whether 
it is a large infrastructure investment or whether it is a 
small infrastructure investment. Providing the technical 
resources to allow for that, to get ahead of it, in my mind is 
a way that USDA Rural Development, through their Water and 
Environment programs, can play a role in making sure that as 
extreme events do occur, we are more buffered and----
    Senator Welch. By the way, does that also get to where the 
Circuit Riders are able to provide that kind of support and 
help that small communities do not have the resources for?
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, that is correct. I mean, the Circuit 
Riders in Vermont, I know, and it sounds very similar for Bob 
White in Alabama and I am sure in the rest of the rural water 
world, where those Circuit Riders are out there talking about 
not only the day-to-day stuff but, especially in Vermont I know 
it will be a big topic for a while, on how can we avoid this in 
the future and what can we be doing to----
    Senator Welch. Let me ask you. You mentioned bonding, and 
it is a really big deal for communities to have to assess 
themselves when they already feel overtaxed, and you cannot 
spread that out. What are the concrete suggestions you would 
make? Because what I understand is the apprehension people have 
that the bond amount is not going to cover the cost of the 
project, so they are reluctant to vote for something where they 
do not know what the bottom line is going to be. What could we 
do to address that?
    Mr. Duncan. At least in Vermont, the way that is handled is 
a first come, first served basis for USDA Rural Development 
loan and grant funding, and obviously the grant funding element 
is based upon median household income and your rates where they 
stand. What happens is USDA Rural Development will give you an 
estimate of what they believe their loan and grant package will 
be, at which point the users of the system have to conduct a 
bond vote to try and pass the financial will of the system to 
cover that loan amount. Then you have to put the application in 
and hope that the package that they told you that you might get 
will actually be there and available for you when you actually 
get the application into them. Providing certainty is key.
    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Ms. Coleman Flowers, you said that there should be a 10-
year warranty. That actually makes a lot of sense to me. I 
mean, what has been the practice for folks who put money out, 
and they come together to do it, it is a big decision, and they 
want to get that problem solved. Is it the standard practice 
that there is no warranty for the construction and building of 
these systems?
    Ms. Flowers. Well, we were engaged in discussions with some 
manufacturers early on. This is actually prior to COVID, and we 
talked about this. Right now the warranties, generally, through 
some home warranty companies, the homeowner has to take the 
responsibility themselves. Some insurance companies will cover 
it. Why is it transferred from the manufacturers? I think there 
should be a manufacturer's warranty. That is the only thing 
that is going to encourage research and development and 
improvement.
    Why it is like that, I do not know, but for something that 
is so important we need to change it.
    Senator Welch. All right. You know, I listened to you, 
Senator Tuberville. One of the things I thought I heard you say 
was trying to target that money to the places that need it the 
most, in the rural areas. Maybe you could comment on that, Ms. 
Flowers.
    Ms. Flowers. Yes. I think that in terms of rural 
communities there are numerous ways in which we should look at 
how we get money to them. I think I heard my colleagues today 
talk about the challenges of getting to these communities, 
these funds. A lot of funds are available now, but they need 
the technical assistance to be able to access it. I think that 
we need to come up with a process in which--when I first got 
started doing this work, over 20 years ago, there was a USDA 
office that was open in Lowndes County, where someone came at 
least once a week. Now that person is no longer there, and 
people have to travel long distances. I think we have to find a 
way in which to make it accessible to people in rural 
communities where they can get these funds.
    We also have to keep in mind that part of the problem, too, 
is a lot of these communities do not have broadband. If you 
have to register for SAMS.gov in order to even apply for the 
funds, that is the first hassle, to get to the funds.
    We have to make sure that rural communities, a lot of these 
gaps are closed, not just the wastewater gap but a lot of these 
gaps are closed in rural communities so they can get access to 
technical assistance that you do make available.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Just to let you know, Senator 
Tuberville and I have made it a major priority about broadband 
in rural America for this Committee to focus on, so thank you 
for that.
    Ms. Day, I want to ask you a little bit about the Technical 
Assistance Program. You have done a great job on that. How do 
the TA providers help communities before and after the natural 
disasters? You know, we are having one right now, but can you 
just elaborate a bit on that?
    Ms. Day. Thank you, yes. There are emergency response plans 
and vulnerability assessments that are part of the USDA loan 
requirements. USDA helps us to get those done in the 
communities so that these planning documents that might have 
been sitting on a shelf, actually we take them down, we work 
through them with the community, and make sure that they are 
up-to-date and accurate and are a viable document to work on 
pre and post disasters.
    Senator Welch. How can we be developing some more 
managerial capacity? Senator Hyde-Smith was asking about the 
training and the availability of a work force, and we want to 
have opportunities for young people who would like to stay in a 
rural community or come there, to be able to have a good job. 
How do we do that?
    Ms. Day. We will take any opportunity to work on work force 
development. We have some foundation work and some other work 
that we have been able to combine together to really raise the 
position of these water operators in the communities. I work on 
so many consent orders, when I started in this field, for the 
elderly manager of the system, who was a volunteer, who was 
operating a system without the correct licenses.
    There is a lot that can be done around regionalization, and 
if there are some more planning dollars available to help the 
small, disadvantaged communities who are strapped anyway, 
without accurate coverage for operators, then those larger 
systems could actually do eligibility criteria too, to get the 
grants from USDA, because the smaller system is probably more 
eligible for grants, and then that can work to bring the lack 
of operators that we have, making sure that there are more of 
them to go around.
    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Senator Tuberville, and take the time you want. I went over 
a little bit.
    Senator Tuberville. No problem.
    Senator Welch. I do not want to shortchange you.
    Senator Tuberville. No problem. The problem we are having, 
obviously, in the rural areas too is educating, getting enough 
people educated to do the work in the rural areas. Urban areas 
are fine. You know, they will struggle, but we are really 
struggling in the rural areas.
    I am going to ask everybody this one question, in 20 
seconds or more. Just do not make it long, if you have got a 
perspective on this. What is the most critical element in 
ensuring the operation of safe public drinking water supply? 
Rob, what do you think the most critical element is?
    Mr. White. I would say the most critical element would be 
your trained operators who have to oversee these systems and 
actually put in place, abide by all the regulations, and create 
the plans, and assess the systems, make sure that the system is 
rehabilitated when necessary and has a plan to move forward, 
and remains in compliance and within the regulatory bounds 
every day.
    Senator Tuberville. Ms. Undesser.
    Ms. Undesser. The most critical item as far as looking at 
safe public drinking water supply certainly is how do we think 
about water differently going forward. It is a complex world, 
and it only getting more complex as we are sitting here right 
now. We really need to think differently and really leverage 
all of our solutions that are out there.
    Senator Tuberville. Keep it simple, stupid, right? That is 
what we need.
    Ms. Flowers.
    Ms. Flowers. I think that the most critical element, if we 
are under-resourced and underserved communities, is access to 
funding.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Mr. Duncan.
    Mr. Duncan. The answer is definitely trained operators, but 
playing off of that a little bit is having the resources for 
those operators, being able to give them technical assistance 
as well as being able to allow them to plan for how to manage 
and operate the infrastructure that they have to work with and 
keep in good condition, whether it is something that is aging 
and knowing when to make those changes and having the 
investments to do so or whether it is understanding the risks, 
both cyber, climate, and whatever, to be able to address the 
needs and create a sustainable water future.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Ms. Day.
    Ms. Day. I would add educated and informed board members 
who actually run the systems and make the decisions, that they 
are informed about the technical aspects of running the 
wastewater and water system.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Mr. White, 91 percent of our 
Nation's water systems serve communities with populations of 
10,000 or less. I said that in my opening statement. In 
Alabama, 75 percent of the people we serve are 10,000 or less. 
In your experience, what suggestions do you believe could 
improve program operations and services for small system 
operators? Do not say money either. I do not want to hear that.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. White. Well, that was the short answer, is money.
    Well, one thing I would like to comment on is what is 
working now, what is available under the farm bill and the 
resources that are being utilized, at least in the State of 
Alabama. We have three water Circuit Riders, we have two 
wastewater specialists, an energy efficiency technician, 
numerous training staff, all working together, a source water 
assessment person. They all work together every day within all 
of the rural communities in Alabama to put in place all of 
these resources and technical assistance.
    We meet regularly. Our partnerships with USDA, locally, 
within the State, are strong. We meet quarterly with USDA, SRF, 
ADECA, other funding partners, and provide technical assistance 
reports, and we really get around the table and hammer out all 
of the concerns for the water and wastewater systems in 
Alabama. Those partnerships are critical, and they really help 
bring everybody to the table, and we do not duplicate work. 
That way we can find the targeted resources for those areas.
    To improve, I would say giving USDA more flexibilities. The 
financing options that were discussed in my written testimony, 
that would be critical in helping some of the rural, poorer 
areas in Alabama, being able to have the zero and one percent 
loans, refinancing options. That would help Uniontown, that we 
are working with on the west side of Alabama now, if we had 
that opportunity.
    Additional authorities for addressing cybersecurity and 
more resources for emergency response would also be helpful.
    Senator Tuberville. Ms. Day, can you answer that one?
    Mr. Duncan. Day or Duncan?
    Senator Tuberville. Either one of you. Have at it. Hey, I 
have got all time. I am the last one.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you. You know, I think the funding 
alternatives are definitely a way to do it, if you are looking 
at it without additional moneys to throw in there. I do think a 
shift in the paradigm is critical in how we operate our 
facilities today. The run-to-failure mode is where we are at, 
so whatever abilities and resources can be put toward systems, 
especially those small systems. I think if you went and talked 
to any operator in any small system, in any State around the 
country, they would tell you what their problems are. They do 
not have the capacity, knowing what they know that needs to be 
addressed, nor the ability to go and address it.
    Continuing to promote the Circuit Rider program to help 
them find that path forward, education to boards, and education 
and promoting the value of water is also critical because it is 
one of the cheapest utilities out there with the highest value 
in life, but yet we undervalue it incredibly.
    Anything along those lines, absent actual money, would be 
the way to go forward, I think, in helping to give those 
operators, as well as the system owners, which is the public, 
an understanding of how to create systems that will be more 
resilient going forward, will be more affordable to run. Any of 
those tools in the toolbox that can be promoted within the USDA 
WEP program are critical, in my mind.
    Senator Tuberville. I have got one last question, and I 
would like all of you to answer it, kind of like the first one, 
kind of short. Let's start with Ms. Day. All these natural 
disasters we are having, how do we prepare for those for our 
water system? In your mind. I mean, because we are having more 
and more. We are having hurricanes, tornadoes, what we saw in 
Vermont this week, it is a disaster, and we have to have water. 
How do we prepare for that?
    Ms. Day. We plan. I have to say that the USDA 
predevelopment dollars for the really small, rural, 
disadvantaged systems are the only predevelopment dollars that 
are available to them, and they cannot do a feasibility study 
without that. Vermont does a good job with SRF dollars getting 
out to those small communities, but not every State does. They 
may have an idea of what to do to make their system better, but 
they need that $35,000 of predevelopment to actually make a 
change in the system. Thank you.
    Senator Tuberville. Mr. Duncan.
    Mr. Duncan. The No. 1 answer, in my mind, is stop fighting 
Mother Nature and taking a look and understanding climate 
change. One of the things that is a real challenge is a lot of 
our systems are built in lowland areas, at least in Vermont, so 
it is a real challenge. That is not going to change overnight, 
but taking a look at what the risks and liabilities are 
associated with each of those different events that come at us, 
and then identifying paths to resiliency and redundancy is 
really the only way to move that forward, as opposed to keep 
getting knocked down and standing back up and taking it on the 
chin again.
    Senator Tuberville. Ms. Flowers.
    Ms. Flowers. You know, I actually live in Tornado Alley in 
north Alabama.
    Senator Tuberville. I know you do.
    Ms. Flowers. We had a tornado last night. I think that, 
first of all, planning, and then in terms of dealing with 
resilience, we have to have resilient infrastructure. I agree. 
We cannot build the way that we have built before and think 
things are going to change. Things are actually getting worse. 
Building a more resilient system. Just an example of a system 
that was built, this was in an urban area, and they did not 
prepare for the lights going out. When the lights went out, 
then the wastewater treatment stopped, and then the communities 
were flooded with raw sewage.
    I think we have to start looking at what we could probably 
do in terms of renewable energy, to use it as a backup energy 
source for when the power goes out, to make sure that we can 
continue to have water and sanitation.
    Senator Tuberville. Ms. Undesser.
    Ms. Undesser. Thank you. I absolutely echo the resiliency 
planning. That is No. 1. I would add on to it the emergency 
planning as well, and making sure that those emergency plans 
leverage all solutions that are available, and again, that we 
think differently about it rather than just kind of staying in 
the lane, but how do we leverage all of the solutions that are 
available to us?
    Senator Tuberville. Rob.
    Mr. White. I would say training and partnerships. We need 
to continue to train. It is ongoing. There are new resources 
and regulations that come around each year. Plus the work force 
is changing, so new folks get into those administrative 
positions, making sure they are aware of what is available to 
them. Then partnerships with not only Federal and State 
agencies and resources but do you know your neighbor systems. 
Do you have mutual aid agreements with those? Do you know your 
access to resources through our associate members, companies 
that are in the State that can maybe go ahead and prepare a 
contract for service during an emergency so you can lock in 
prices and ensure that you have a number of items available to 
you during that time?
    That is what I would say, training and partnerships.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you all for being here. It has 
been very good.
    Senator Welch. Yes, it has been an excellent hearing. Thank 
you. You know, as our country is facing these wild weather 
events, climate change, more severe and frequent storms, we 
have got to make sure that the water in our communities is safe 
and available. That is true particularly in rural communities 
of color and rural economically disadvantaged communities. They 
often struggle with robust water infrastructure and are very 
vulnerable to the effects of these wild climate-induced storms. 
Climate resilience and equity have to be very much at the 
forefront of our efforts.
    I look forward to continuing to work with all of you. You 
know, you are doing like real work, practical work, and our job 
is to try to help get you the resources that you need in order 
to help our communities back home. We have a hard job, but you 
have a harder job. I just want to acknowledge that and express 
to you the gratitude that I think every member of this 
Committee has for the work you are doing back home. We all 
really deeply care about rural America. That is what kind of 
binds this Committee and makes it one of the most nonpartisan, 
bipartisan committees in Congress. Thank you.
    The record will remain open for five business days for any 
members that wish to submit any additional questions or 
statements, and the meeting is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 4:27 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
