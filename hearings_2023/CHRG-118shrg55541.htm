    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TIM KAINE, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA

    Senator Kaine. Good morning. This hearing of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, 
Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Global Women's Issues will come to order.
    It is a pleasure to welcome our distinguished panel of 
government witnesses for this important hearing on Haiti. I 
want to thank the ranking member, Senator Rubio, and his team 
for his help in crafting this hearing.
    I am proud of the work that we have done together over a 
number of years on Latin American and Caribbean issues during 
our time in the Senate together and there is much more to be 
done.
    The focus of today's hearing is on the security crisis in 
Haiti and the next steps in potential international response.
    In July 2021, President Jovenel Moise was brutally 
assassinated in his home. A month later a magnitude 7.2 
earthquake devastated the country still in recovery from the 
2010 earthquake that killed over 200,000 people.
    Since then, criminal gangs have been fomenting terror and 
violence in the country, leading interim Prime Minister Ariel 
Henry to formally request international help last October.
    In the meantime, Haitians continue to suffer from 
reprehensible, brutal violence perpetuated by gangs who are 
backed by business and political patrons in Haiti.
    Homicides in the country have risen sharply, increasing by 
over 35 percent between 2021 and 2022. Kidnappings have more 
than doubled as gangs fight over territory. Gangs have used 
collective rape and other horrific gender-based violence 
against women, children, and the elderly.
    The violence has been compounded by natural disasters, 
leading to a humanitarian crisis where nearly 5 million 
Haitians are facing acute levels of hunger. Haitian Government 
agencies face difficulties addressing these challenges 
including cholera because vulnerable neighborhoods have been 
choked up by gangs fighting for territory.
    Understandably, Haitians are desperate to escape this 
violence, fleeing to neighboring countries throughout the 
region in increasing numbers and to the United States.
    Just in the last few days we have seen scenes of Haitians 
fleeing neighborhood violence and gathering at the U.S. Embassy 
in Haiti because they feel like they have nowhere else to go if 
they want to be safe.
    At the center of violence, we have to acknowledge, is an 
illegal flow of American firearms into Haiti. We see reports of 
the Haitian National Police, who the U.S. Government have long 
supported, being consistently outgunned by Haitian gangs.
    Federal law enforcement agencies have described the 
recovery of sophisticated weapons destined for Haitian ports--
50 caliber sniper rifles, belt-fed machine guns. Tragically, it 
is no surprise that the number of Haitian police officers being 
killed has only increased since 2019.
    We have to acknowledge that firearms trafficking is a 
problem not just in Haiti, but in other parts of the Caribbean, 
Mexico, and throughout the hemisphere. It is no coincidence 
that countries in the region have some of the highest rates of 
homicide in the world.
    The violence unleashed by firearms trafficked out of the 
U.S. destabilizes the Western Hemisphere and it also increases 
the pressure for irregular migration.
    I am pleased to see that the Biden administration named the 
creation of a coordinator for Caribbean firearms prosecutions 
within the Department of Justice in June, and in the Senate, 
Senator Rubio and I have introduced the Caribbean Basin 
Security Initiative Authorization Act.
    We are also both co-sponsors of Chairman Menendez's Haitian 
Criminal Collusion and Transparency Act. These pieces of 
legislation would help strengthen regional security cooperation 
in the Caribbean and sanction political and business elites who 
empower gangs in Haiti.
    For those interventions to work, security needs to be 
reestablished, first, alongside a Haitian-led solution to the 
political crisis. As recently as this month, U.N. Secretary 
General Antonio Guterres reiterated his call for a robust 
international security presence in Haiti.
    I am interested in hearing from our witnesses from both the 
Department of State and USAID on its latest discussions with 
international and multilateral stakeholders on this front.
    I am also interested in hearing about the U.S. efforts to 
support Haitian people through humanitarian aid.
    Let me now turn it over to my ranking member, Senator 
Rubio, for his remarks, following which I will introduce our 
panel.

                STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA

    Senator Rubio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this 
and thank you both for coming.
    Haiti right now is a complete disaster. This is as bad as 
it has ever been and I followed it not just because south 
Florida where I live is an enormous Haitian-American community 
650 miles from Miami, it is--everything that happens there is 
both heartbreaking and at the same time has a direct impact on 
the state of Florida and ultimately on the country.
    I think it is about as bad a situation as any on the 
planet. It does not get the attention I believe it deserves, 
but I know a few places on Earth right now that are confronting 
the challenges that they are facing, and despite Haiti's long 
history of problems and challenges this is probably--and I can 
be corrected, but this is probably as bad as it has been in a 
long time.
    Sixty percent of the country is controlled by gangs. When 
the most powerful person in your country is nicknamed 
``Barbecue,'' that is not a good thing, okay, and it is 60 
percent of the country that is controlled by gangs led by 
people like that guy.
    Seventy-five percent of its major cities controlled by 
gangs. I think it was last year that they seized the Varreux 
Port and denied--people could not get water. They could not get 
fuel. They could not get medicine. They could not get--just 
unbelievable that would happen.
    They have not had an election since 2017. There is not a 
single democratically-elected leader in the entire country. 
Then you think about the impact it has had on migration. I 
think in 2023 alone, the Coast Guard just this year has 
intercepted 7,400 people and those are the ones that live long 
enough to be intercepted.
    We do not know how many people have died in that path, but 
we know many have, and that does not count those who are 
stranded in the Bahamas and other places, as well.
    Since 2020, 146,000 migrant encounters, albeit some 
obviously coming from third countries where maybe they were 
working construction. The work dried up and then they made 
their journey here as well, but also a very dangerous voyage.
    Look, the talk has been about an international force. The 
truth of the matter is the last one that was there did not end 
very well. They brought cholera. They were accused of abuses 
against the population including sexual abuse.
    I understand the reluctance of countries from around the 
world in getting engaged in this endeavor.
    Frankly, we spend a lot of time thinking about--we filed 
our bills together. We have the Haitian Criminal Collusion 
Transparency Act that Senator Menendez and I have filed.
    Senator Warnock and I introduced the Haitian Economic Lift 
Program Extension Act to ensure that the trade benefits are 
extended to 2035, but as we--I do not want to pretend that I 
have an answer in my back pocket here over how to solve this 
problem. This is a really difficult Rubik's cube to line up. 
There is a lot of problems going on. Some are historic and long 
standing. Some are more recent.
    There is the whole structure of their government. It is not 
on us to structure their government, but they tried to marry up 
this French and American system and ended up with a system of 
government constitutionally that I think is flawed by design 
and has contributed somewhat to some of this.
    Security is something everybody agrees you have to have 
before anything else is possible, but you got a significant 
percentage of the national police are applicants currently 
waiting for the parole program that the Biden administration 
has created.
    That is never a good sign when the people that are supposed 
to be doing that believe their best option is to leave the 
country.
    I think as much as anything else in today's hearing, and I 
know it is an unfair question in many cases, but asking what is 
the Biden administration's plan or view of what the solution 
here is.
    I know there has been some efforts at the U.N. Security 
Council and so forth because, frankly, I am at a loss for 
understanding what the--this is not a blame assignment.
    This is sort of a testament to the intricacy of this 
problem, how difficult it is. What is the way forward? Because 
it is having an impact on the United States. This is not 
halfway around the world. This, as I said, is not far from 
Florida and the southeast United States.
    I appreciate you coming in to answer this very difficult 
question, at least begin to get a sense of what the outlines 
are of what the way forward is and what we can do, what the 
United States can do, to be a part of a solution, some ray of 
hope in what otherwise continues to be an escalating disaster.
    As a side note, I did want to mention both to the witnesses 
and to the chair that the Appropriations Committee is meeting. 
We have four votes today. They do not let you vote by proxy for 
the bills, so you may see me run out.
    Luckily, it is in the same building. That is the good news. 
The bad news is it is at 10:45, but as soon as I am done with 
those votes I will get back here if we are still in session.
    Thank you for coming and thank you for holding this.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Senator Rubio. Let me now 
introduce our witnesses.
    Brian Nichols is the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of 
Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State Department.
    He previously served as U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe and 
before that, Ambassador to Peru, and previously was the 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Also 
served as our DCM in Colombia.
    In May, President Biden nominated Secretary Nichols to the 
rank of Career Ambassador, which is the highest rank in the 
Foreign Service.
    Marcela Escobari is the Assistant Administrator for the 
Bureau of Latin America and the Caribbean at the U.S. Agency 
for International Development.
    Ms. Escobari previously served in this role in 2016 during 
which time she helped reinforce U.S. support for Peace 
Colombia, mobilized humanitarian response to the disaster to 
the response points of Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, and also 
supported efforts to deliver humanitarian aid in Venezuela.
    Prior to her government service, Ms. Escobari was a senior 
fellow at the Brookings Institution and executive director of 
the Center for International Development at Harvard University.
    It is great to have you both with us today. I would like 
now for each of you to offer your opening statements beginning 
with Secretary Nichols.
    Before you start, the Assistant Secretary Todd Robinson was 
invited to join us today, but was unable to talk about some of 
the security dimensions of this challenge. He has, however, 
submitted a written statement that I will include as part of 
the record.

[Editor's note.--The information referred to above can be found 
in the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section 
at the end of this hearing.]

    With that, Secretary Nichols, we will begin with you.

STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN NICHOLS, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE, 
WESTERN HEMISPHERE AFFAIRS, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 
                         WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Nichols. Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, members 
of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
regarding our efforts to address the security and humanitarian 
crisis in Haiti.
    We remain committed to supporting the Haitian people's 
right to a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous future. The 
Haitian people must determine their own future through dialogue 
and elections.
    We will support them to do so, working with them, our 
international partners, and members of Haiti's dedicated 
diaspora to support Haitian-led efforts to create a better 
future for the country.
    To do so, we support the process of political 
reconciliation. We train and equip Haiti's police. We also have 
significantly increased our efforts to implement financial and 
visa restrictions to promote accountability for those who seek 
to destabilize the country.
    We provide development and humanitarian assistance. We 
encourage private sector-led growth and we seek to mobilize 
international security assistance for Haiti.
    Haiti remains a top priority for President Biden, for 
Secretary Blinken, and for me. My colleagues from across the 
interagency and I have visited Port-au-Prince numerous times. 
We are in daily contact with Haitian stakeholders and the 
diaspora in the United States, as well as the region.
    Gang activity including targeted sexual violence, 
recruitment of minors, widespread kidnappings, and sniper style 
killings of neighborhood residents plagues the Haitian people.
    Gangs also hamper the Haitian Government's ability to 
deliver public services and combat poverty. As we work with our 
partners to urgently respond to Haiti's request for a 
multinational force to support the Haitian National Police, we 
intend, with congressional support, to allocate more than $120 
million to strengthen police capacity.
    This funding will strengthen the Haitian National Police's 
counter gang unit through recruitment and training, technical 
assistance, and equipment. Since 2021, we have donated 100 
vehicles, more than 1,000 sets of protective equipment, 37,400 
meals ready-to-eat, and additional equipment for the counter 
gang intervention unit.
    Our funding will also improve Haiti's overcrowded and 
deteriorating prisons both by building infrastructure and by 
implementing health programs to stem cholera outbreaks. We are 
also working with DHS to establish a transnational criminal 
investigative unit within the police. This will enable us to 
partner better with Haiti to investigate and prosecute 
transnational crimes with a U.S. nexus.
    Our financial sanctions and visa restrictions have a 
chilling effect on political and economic elites who finance 
gang leaders and foment the ongoing crises in Haiti.
    The United States has imposed visa restrictions and 
financial sanctions on more than 50 individuals involved in 
street gangs, other Haitian criminal organizations, drug 
trafficking, significant corruption, or gross violations of 
human rights. We have designated more people than any other 
country.
    In addition, we continue to press other nations and 
international institutions to follow suit. The United States 
proudly co-sponsored with Mexico the U.N. resolution creating a 
new sanctions regime for Haiti, the first within the Western 
Hemisphere.
    On July 14, with U.S. support, the United Nations Security 
Council unanimously renewed the mandate of the United Nations 
Integrated Office in Haiti.
    The United States also supports the Haitian people as they 
forge a path for their country's democratic governance and 
development including through the Global Fragility Act. The Act 
allows us to build long-term solutions with Haitians while we 
address today's acute multi-dimensional crisis.
    We encourage Haiti's political, economic, religious, and 
civil society actors to work together to resolve Haiti's 
political and security challenges. The United States supports 
the Caribbean community--CARICOM--in its efforts to encourage a 
Haitian-led political dialogue, a process brokered by former 
prime ministers from the region.
    On July 6, I joined Secretary Blinken in Trinidad and 
Tobago where he urged Prime Minister Henry to negotiate in 
earnest with other political forces to achieve a broader 
political consensus leading to elections as soon as possible.
    Haiti has made important progress in resolving its 
political impasse over the past year, but more must be done and 
urgently.
    We welcome the creation of the High Transition Council in 
Haiti, which is crucial for restoring democratic order and 
improving security. An even broader and more inclusive 
leadership structure will provide greater confidence to all 
Haitians.
    On the economic front we strongly support the HOPE and HELP 
Acts. During this critical time, producers and investors in 
Haiti, those they do business with, and the workers upon whom 
they rely, need certainty about the uninterrupted continuation 
of the HOPE/HELP preferences.
    The garment sector, created, largely, thanks to the HOPE 
and HELP Acts, accounted for approximately 90 percent of 
Haiti's exports, employed more than 34,000 Haitians, and 
supported more than 205,000 Haitians in 2022, but in the past 
year, some garment manufacturers have closed their factories 
and laid off workers, decisions made in part because of 
uncertainty about whether Haiti will continue to enjoy these 
preferences.
    We must continue to support economic growth, job creation, 
and investment where possible. Equally important, we must 
leverage the enormous talents and expertise of the Haitian 
diaspora who remain critical to a brighter, more stable, and 
secure Haiti.
    Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, members of the 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you 
today. I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nichols follows:]

religious, and civil society actors, to work together to resolve 
Haiti's political and security challenges.
    The United States supports the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)'s 
efforts to encourage a Haitian-led political dialogue--a process 
brokered by former prime ministers from the region. On July 6, I joined 
Secretary Blinken in Trinidad and Tobago, where he urged Prime Minister 
Henry to negotiate in earnest with other political forces to achieve a 
broader political consensus leading to elections as soon as possible.
    Haiti has made important progress in resolving its political 
impasse over the past year, but more must be done and urgently. We 
welcome the creation of the High Transition Council in Haiti--which is 
crucial for restoring democratic order and improving security. An even 
broader and more inclusive leadership structure will provide greater 
confidence to all Haitians.
    On the economic front, we strongly support the HOPE and HELP Acts. 
During this critical time, producers, and investors in Haiti, those 
they do business with, and the workers upon whom they rely, need 
certainty about the uninterrupted continuation of the HOPE/HELP 
preferences. The garment sector--created largely thanks to the HOPE and 
HELP Acts--accounted for approximately 90 percent of Haiti's exports, 
employed more than 34,000 Haitians, and supported more than 205,000 
Haitians in 2022. But in the past year, some garment manufacturers have 
closed their factories and laid off workers--decisions made in part 
because of uncertainty about whether Haiti will continue to enjoy those 
preferences. We must continue to support economic growth, job creation, 
and investment where possible.
    Equally important, we must leverage the enormous talents and 
expertise of the Haitian diaspora, who remain critical to a brighter, 
more stable, and secure Haiti.
    Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, members of the committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look 
forward to your questions.

    Senator Kaine. Thank you.
    Ms. Escobari.

 STATEMENT OF HON. MARCELA ESCOBARI, ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, 
   LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR 
           INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Escobari. Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify about USAID's work in Haiti.
    When I went to Haiti earlier this year I saw, as many of 
you have, the situation on the ground. Gang violence is leaving 
Haitians vulnerable to horrific crimes. The staff at our 
mission live with that reality day-to-day, especially our 
courageous Foreign Service nationals who have in some cases 
been displaced from their homes or even been victims of 
kidnapping, but our staff has kept going because they know that 
our work is making a critical difference in the lives of the 
Haitian people. Our budget of more than $150 million a year 
supports economic, health, and governance work that we have 
adapted to the security situation.
    We have also amped up our humanitarian response. USAID has 
provided an additional $112 million just in FY23 to respond to 
acute needs. We are providing clean water, food, and medical 
supplies.
    We responded quickly to the cholera outbreak and are 
supporting survivors of gender-based violence. We are reaching 
hundreds of thousands of people a month with food assistance 
and have helped bring nearly 20,000 people out of famine-like 
conditions in Port-au-Prince.
    We also continue building the foundations for long-term 
stability in Haiti. Over the last 10 years, USAID's investments 
in food security have helped over 100,000 farmers adopt new 
technologies, generating nearly $30 million dollars in new 
sales and supplying local markets.
    We have invested in promising Haitian companies who now 
sell products like peanut butter, moringa, and limes to stores 
across the U.S. and Canada. These investments have meant new 
jobs and growing incomes.
    USAID has also made strides in fortifying the country's 
water system, which are foundational for progress in every 
other sector from health to economic growth.
    We have helped set up 22 micro utilities that are now fully 
functional with water meters and data tracking devices that can 
tell you when water is cut off or disrupted in case of natural 
disasters.
    Most importantly, these investments have provided reliable 
drinking water to over 320,000 Haitians and are self-
sustaining. Some things are working in Haiti.
    Improving health outcomes is also a major focus for USAID. 
Our partners operate more than 160 health clinics. Forty 
percent of people who access health services in Haiti do so in 
a USAID-supported clinic. We vaccinate 76,000 kids every year--
50 percent of all fully vaccinated children in Haiti.
    The years we have spent strengthening the Ministry of 
Health and investing in public health infrastructure proved 
invaluable in containing the most recent cholera outbreak, but 
as our staff in Haiti know, protecting those gains and making 
further progress will require significant improvements in 
security. USAID and INL have joined forces in addressing gang 
violence in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Port-
au-Prince.
    Just last month, USAID launched a $12.5 million program to 
support community policing, provide life skills to at-risk 
youth, and help the government of Haiti provide social services 
to survivors of violence.
    We recognize that we can and should continue to protect 
livelihoods. Joblessness puts families further at risk and 
contributes to insecurity. Vice President Harris has signaled 
the Administration's strong support for the extension of HOPE/
HELP trade preferences. This certainty will keep jobs in Haiti 
and preserve and even grow the labor-intensive textile sector.
    Business is still possible in Haiti. Just last month, we 
helped broker a $4.5 million equity investment between two 
Haitian companies to expand a unique leasing model for solar 
energy.
    Despite the challenges, USAID programs are not only 
responding to acute needs, but also contributing to long-term 
stability and that includes supporting institutions, including 
those that will lead to elections that Haitian people can 
trust.
    To make sure that Haitians can participate, we are helping 
distribute more than 2 million national identity cards that 
Haitians can use to access services like banking services, but 
also to be able to vote.
    Thanks to our team in Port-au-Prince, our partners on the 
ground, and the generosity of this Congress, we believe that 
not all is lost in Haiti, but there is more left to lose and 
more will be lost if we do not continue to back these critical 
efforts.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Escobari follows:]

               Prepared Statement of Ms. Marcela Escobari

                                 intro
    Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, distinguished members of the 
Subcommittee--thank you for the opportunity to testify and to speak 
with you today about USAID's work in Haiti at this critical time.
                           current situation
    When I went to Haiti earlier this year, I saw--as many of you who 
have visited have seen--that the situation on the ground is dire. Gang 
violence is on the rise and the Haitian National Police is struggling 
to curtail it, leaving Haitians vulnerable to heinous atrocities.
    The staff at our Mission live with those day-to-day realities, 
especially our courageous foreign service nationals. Their 
neighborhoods are overrun with violent gangs. Some have been kidnapped 
themselves or had family members kidnapped for ransom.
    But whenever I speak with them, they make it clear that ``all is 
not lost in Haiti''--and that they are willing to face these risks 
because they know their work is making a difference. And it is.
    Our budget of more than $150 million a year supports economic, 
health and governance work--and we have continued to pivot those 
investments for maximum impact as the security situation changes. We 
have also amped up our humanitarian assistance to meet growing 
immediate needs.
                   impact of humanitarian programming
    USAID has provided more than $110 million in life-saving 
humanitarian assistance to Haiti since the start of fiscal year 2023. 
And since the stand-up of our humanitarian Disaster Assistance Response 
Team, or DART, last October, USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance 
has provided clean water, medicine and medical supplies to communities 
affected by violence. We have responded to new cholera outbreaks. We 
are supporting survivors of gender-based violence. And we are 
responding to widespread food insecurity with food assistance that 
reaches hundreds of thousands of people a month and has helped to bring 
nearly 20,000 people out of famine-like conditions.
                      building long-term stability
    And we continue working to make the country more food secure long-
term. USAID investments have helped over 100,000 farmers adopt new 
technologies over the last 10 years and generate nearly $30 million in 
agricultural sales.
    USAID has catalyzed equity investments in promising Haitian 
companies, leveraging $28 million since 2018. For example, we provided 
support to Acceso Haiti which works with smallholder farmers to boost 
their production and aggregate their output to help them bring products 
like Lavi Spicy Peanut Butter to grocery stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
With USAID support, Acceso is working to expand its network of farmers, 
double farmers' yields and incomes, and connect new crops, like mango, 
lime, and moringa, to new markets.
    USAID has also made strides in fortifying the country's water and 
sanitation systems, which are foundational to making progress in every 
other area from health to economic growth. We've helped re-establish 22 
micro-utilities, improve their technical capacity, identify leaks, 
install meters so they can collect and share data--including in the 
wake of natural disasters--and generate revenue. Three of those 22 
utilities have already mobilized over $70,000 in domestic revenues.
    These types of USAID investments have helped increase access to 
reliable, potable water service for over 320,000 people in Haiti since 
2018. And our investments in sanitation management--which help ensure 
waste doesn't pollute water sources--have increased sanitation services 
for over 78,000 people.
    Improving health outcomes across the country is also a major focus 
for USAID. With USAID support, our partners operate more than 160 
health clinics, which account for 25 percent of the health services 
provided in the country. We vaccinate 76,000 kids every year. Since 
2022, one in every two fully vaccinated kids in Haiti were vaccinated 
with USAID support. That's critical to long-term health in the country.
    The years we've spent strengthening the health system, operating 
public health education campaigns, bolstering data gathering 
capabilities and operationalizing failed water utilities proved 
invaluable during the most recent cholera outbreak. The 2010 outbreak 
saw more than 10,000 people lose their lives to cholera. The years we 
spent building up the Ministry of Health and public health 
infrastructure meant that during the most recent outbreak in October 
2022, the Ministry was able to limit the number of deaths to 800. That 
kept this outbreak's fatality rate under the World Health 
Organization's standard of 1 percent.
                  long-term solutions require security
    But as our staff in Haiti know, protecting those gains and making 
further progress toward long-term solutions will require significant 
improvements in security.
    So, we continue to simultaneously address the urgent needs of the 
moment and build a path to long-term stability. Under the Global 
Fragility Act we have created a 10-year plan that allows us to better 
coordinate our development work with our interagency partners' efforts 
to meet Haiti's security goals.
    USAID and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement 
Affairs (INL) are more aligned than ever, designing joint programming 
to address gang violence. While INL provides support for the Haitian 
National Police, USAID is doing our part on citizen security.
    Just last month, USAID signed a 3-year award with an initial 
investment of $12.5 million to reduce violence and strengthen security 
in gang-controlled neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince, focusing on: 
implementing community development activities and, assisting the 
Government of Haiti to provide social services for at-risk populations 
and survivors of violence. These services include supporting at-risk 
youth with psychosocial services, life skills, and help finding jobs 
and livelihoods outside of joining a gang. This approach recognizes 
that police can't solve this problem on their own and is based on 
proven models implemented across the world, from Los Angeles to San 
Pedro Sula.
                           economic security
    We recognize that we can and should work to protect livelihoods, 
even in the current security environment. Joblessness puts families 
further at risk and contributes to insecurity.
    Vice President Harris has signaled the Administration's strong 
support for the extension of the HOPE/HELP trade preferences program, 
which will keep jobs in Haiti. At this critical time, producers, 
investors, clients, and workers in Haiti need certainty about the 
continuation of HOPE/HELP. Maintaining this program will be essential 
in preserving and growing the labor-intensive textile sector.
    At USAID, our work to create economic opportunities continues 
across the country. For example, we recently brokered a $4.5 million 
equity investment between two Haitian businesses to expand and 
accelerate a solar energy company's unique solar leasing model for 
residential, commercial and industrial customers.
                           political security
    Despite the challenges we face, USAID continues working to ensure 
our programs not only operate in the short term, but really take root, 
so they can contribute to long-term stability when the security 
situation improves.
    That includes supporting institutional improvements, like national 
identification cards Haitians can use to vote and to access banks and 
other services. To make sure people everywhere can get these cards, 
USAID is partnering with the Organization of American States to 
distribute 3 million cards throughout the country.
    We stand ready to use our convening power to help Haiti move toward 
democratic elections. USAID recently launched a new elections-support 
program to work with Haitian institutions and civil society to take 
concrete steps forward, including: creating a realistic electoral 
calendar; developing security plans for voting; and supporting Haitian 
efforts to carry out constitutional and electoral reforms.
                               conclusion
    Thanks to our incredible staff and partners on the ground, and the 
generosity of this congress, our local staff are right: ``all is not 
lost in Haiti.'' But there is more left to lose--and more will be 
lost--if we don't continue to back these critical efforts across the 
country.
    I thank this subcommittee for its ongoing support, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Assistant Administrator Escobari. 
We will begin a round of questions.
    Secretary Nichols, I will start. The title of this hearing 
is ``Next Steps on the International Response,'' and so I would 
like to begin there.
    We have barely scratched the surface in all of our opening 
comments about the depth of the challenge. To that end, what 
can the Department now share publicly regarding a potential 
international, multinational force in Haiti to assist with 
security?
    Talk a little bit about what we are doing as a Department 
and also share discussions that you can with respect to the 
U.N. Security Council or our international partners.
    Mr. Nichols. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We have been working intensively on this for as long as I 
have been in this position, and the most recent activities have 
been the renewal of the U.N.'s office in Haiti and in that 
resolution that was renewed earlier this month, it called on 
the Secretary General to provide recommendations for more that 
could be done to address the security situation in Haiti within 
30 days of the passage. 
August 15 would be the deadline for that report.
    Senator Kaine. Just as we are having a dialogue here, that 
was notable because that is the U.N. Security Council 
resolution, unanimous vote of countries such as Russia and 
China, that sometimes are not with us on these. They worked 
together with us on this initiative and that is at least a 
positive sign, correct?
    Mr. Nichols. That is correct, Mr. Chairman, and we continue 
to consult with fellow council members, both permanent and 
elected, with key peacekeeping contributors around the world.
    Assistant Secretary Robinson is doing that right now. That 
is why he could not be with us today. He is continuing those 
conversations.
    We talk to potential contributors to a multinational force, 
which we consider the fastest deploying solution and 
specifically responsive to the request from the Haitian 
Government, as we contemplate other solutions that could 
include some type of assessed peacekeeping operation in the 
future.
    We believe it is urgent to get forces on the ground that 
can support the Haitian National Police as they carry out 
missions specifically targeting the gangs that prey on the 
Haitian people.
    Senator Kaine. The challenge with the multinational force 
idea has been that--I think you have done a good job in 
identifying not only the United States, but other nations that 
are willing to participate if it is scoped correctly.
    It has been hard to get a nation to agree to lead it and 
that--Senator Rubio referred to this in his opening 
statements--and there are many reasons for that.
    Some nations have histories with Haiti that would make them 
leading a challenge because of historical challenges, and also 
the history of other peacekeeping or multinational efforts in 
Haiti have had their own challenges that makes some skittish 
about taking the lead.
    What are lessons learned from past multinational efforts or 
peacekeeping operations that we should keep in mind as we are 
trying to approach this particular formation of a multinational 
effort?
    Mr. Nichols. Well, I think having a focused narrow scope 
for the operation. The security situation in Haiti is very much 
differentiated by where you are in the country. The situation 
in Port-au-Prince, the capital, is extremely bad. It is 
something that requires urgent assistance.
    Other parts of the country, the situation is substantially 
better. A force needs to provide security around key 
infrastructure sites. The ranking member referred to the 
seizure of the Varreux fuel terminal late last year as one 
incident.
    We need to protect sites like that so that the Haitian 
National Police can interact with the populace and provide 
security. We also need to grow the police force in tandem with 
the deployment of a multinational force.
    Senator Kaine. Let me ask you one more question and then I 
will cede to my colleague. I might have some more USAID 
questions in a second round for you, Ms. Escobari.
    You mentioned that in Trinidad and Tobago, Secretary 
Blinken urged interim Prime Minister Henry to engage in good 
faith dialogue with all sectors of Haitian society to look at a 
next political chapter.
    My Haitian-American diaspora community in Virginia has been 
very critical. I will not say it is monolithic as a criticism, 
but there has been significant criticism of the interim Prime 
Minister's lack of willingness to engage broadly with all 
sectors of Haitian society as we talk about a next political 
chapter.
    What has been your observation thus far, Secretary Nichols, 
about the efforts being made by the Prime Minister to do what 
Secretary Blinken has encouraged him to do?
    Mr. Nichols. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Prime Minister 
traveled to Jamaica under CARICOM auspices, met with a diverse 
section of political and social stakeholders from Haiti in 
offsite conversations.
    Those were under the auspices of three eminent former prime 
ministers from other Caribbean countries. Those conversations 
have continued in Port-au-Prince. That is a positive step.
    He has offered to not seek reelection or seek election, I 
should say, as well as his cabinet, which is an important 
guarantee for the process.
    He needs to expand the political representation in his 
cabinet and, frankly, I think the High Transition Council 
should be expanded to include other political forces.
    There was robust debate within Haiti over how you would do 
that. The December 21 agreement that he and many of those who 
view him more favorably have signed does not provide for an 
expansion of the High Transition Council. That is a point of 
significant debate within the country, but a broad national 
effort to take the country to elections as quickly as security 
will allow is vital.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you. I will yield to my colleague, 
Senator Rubio.
    Senator Rubio. Well, just on that point of security, so I 
think we all would hope to see a Haiti that has a prosperous 
economy that provides opportunities and a functional 
government.
    I think a precondition to both of those things being 
possible--you are not going to drive investment in the country 
without security and I do not know how you hold elections, 
given the current security situation.
    Security is first and foremost, and that is a really tough 
one to deal with. Number one, the argument for a multinational 
force, which is what the Administration and others have been 
supportive of, is not unanimous either among all political 
actors inside of Haiti, correct? There are many who are against 
that as a solution.
    Mr. Nichols. The----
    Senator Rubio. There are some, I should--yes.
    Mr. Nichols. I have spoken with scores of Haitians in Haiti 
and members of the diaspora. I would say that opinions toward a 
multinational force have evolved over time and people that I 
talk to who were against that 18 months ago are now very 
supportive of that.
    The guarantee that they want is this will not be used as a 
way to maintain the Prime Minister in power indefinitely, and I 
think that we have ample assurances from him directly to the 
Secretary of State and to other actors in the country that he 
will not remain in power and that his goal is to hold an 
election.
    We need to have that security, as you rightly state, to be 
able to do that.
    Senator Rubio. Under what auspices? For example, I guess 
the August 15 deadline is for the U.N. recommendation on what 
the steps forward are through the Security Council. Have the 
Chinese expressed opposition to international force inside of 
Haiti to provide security?
    Mr. Nichols. I want to be careful in characterizing another 
country's position, but they have expressed concerns about how 
any future effort would be different from the MINUSTAH effort 
that lasted for 13 years.
    They did support the resolution that passed earlier this 
month and they have said they would like to see the text of the 
recommendations from the Secretary General and what a 
resolution says before presenting a final opinion.
    Senator Rubio. Which countries have expressed an openness? 
For example, the Kenyans--are they a potential partner or a 
lead in a peacekeeping effort?
    Mr. Nichols. They are. Secretary Robinson is--has just 
departed from Nairobi and we have talked to them. They are one 
of the leading contributors to U.N. peacekeeping and 
multinational operations around the world.
    We have talked to many other countries as well. One of the 
things I think it is important to focus on is that while we may 
be asking a specific country to be the lead, we envision this 
as a multinational force with members from this hemisphere, 
from developed and developing countries, with different levels 
of skill sets that they would bring to bear to the problem.
    Senator Rubio. Yes. I guess the reason why I ask about that 
is just it is historically the U.N., the U.S., Canada, others 
have come under criticism in the past for these efforts for a 
lot of reasons--the 13 years or whatever may have happened 
during that time, other incidents that happened during those 
interventions for peacekeeping purposes.
    I think it is--that has made it more difficult to get the 
Canadians or the French or anybody to be excited about this. I 
am glad to hear that some countries have expressed. What about 
in the Caribbean?
    Mr. Nichols. CARICOM member states have stated publicly 
their willingness to participate in a multinational force. 
Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and The Bahamas have all publicly 
said that they would be willing to participate. Other countries 
in the Caribbean as well.
    Interestingly, some of the smaller Caribbean countries do 
have Creole speakers and that could be an important resource 
for a multinational force for interpretation and translation.
    Senator Rubio. The issue here is not finding nations that 
potentially are willing to be contributors. The issue is 
finding a nation willing to say, and will be the lead on 
command?
    Mr. Nichols. Yes, sir. That has been the challenge that we 
face.
    We believe that we are making progress in that area and it 
is vital to do so, and I would note that any country that does 
take the lead, I am confident will enjoy support from other key 
peacekeeping contributors as well as from the United States, 
from Canada, from France, in terms of supporting their efforts.
    Senator Rubio. My last question, and I apologize again 
because an appropriations vote is coming up here in a few 
minutes.
    On the security assistance we are providing now, the 
training mission, the equip and train and so forth, what is 
more detail? Obviously, the training occurring in country, out 
of country. Obviously, part of that involves retention. All of 
the security workforce there faces the same challenges that our 
locally employed--our local employees at the mission would 
confront.
    They have the same housing challenges, security challenges, 
and the like. I--and obviously it is telling when you have a 
substantial percentage of those in the current security forces 
looking to leave the country.
    If you could describe a little bit more about how that 
program is functioning. Where are we doing with the training 
in-country, how is that--and, obviously, is recruitment a part 
of that as well?
    Mr. Nichols. Absolutely, sir. The Bureau of International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement has 14 subject matter experts 
embedded within the Haitian National Police that are providing 
training and assistance within the police.
    Alongside that, there are United Nations political 
officers, actually two of them right now, who are also 
providing training within the police.
    We work with the police to recruit, to vet, to train at the 
police academy in the Port-au-Prince area, as well as some 
other facilities, as well as programs to develop their anti-
gang unit, their transnational criminal investigative unit, 
their sexual gender-based violence unit, the inspector general 
function, which is like their office of professional 
responsibility to ensure that bad actors are identified and 
removed from the police force.
    We have had conversations with the police around their 
growth plans, their maritime operations with the Haitian Coast 
Guard, which is associated with the police.
    We also provide assistance to maintain and equip Coast 
Guard vessels within Haiti. In addition to the United States, 
other countries provide assistance to the Haitian National 
Police. Mexico, France, Brazil, Canada, just to name a few, 
have provided training both within Haiti and outside of Haiti 
to the police.
    I can continue if you like.
    Senator Rubio. Pretty comprehensive. That was 
comprehensive. I appreciate your answer on it. I apologize. I 
will come right back after I--great--after we vote on those 
things.
    I was trying to think of any of the appropriations bills we 
are going to vote on, have to do with the funding for any of 
this, but we already did that last week.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Senator Rubio. I will have a 
series of questions.
    I want to stick with you for a minute, Secretary Nichols. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Senator Rubio and I have 
introduced the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative 
Authorization Act. It is bipartisan.
    We believe we have a--we are on a good path on this. We 
were trying to get it connected to the National Defense 
Authorizing Act. I am not sure we are going to be able to do 
that, but I wanted to ask you a question about Assistant 
Secretary Robinson. We have referenced him during this hearing. 
He was unable to join today for the reasons that you described.
    Our federal law enforcement agencies are focused on 
firearms trafficking, and can you briefly describe what the 
Department's role is in combating firearms trafficking to Haiti 
and the Caribbean region?
    Mr. Nichols. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Department of State has supported, alongside with the 
Department of Homeland Security, FBI, and the Department of 
Justice, the creation of the transnational criminal 
investigative unit within Haiti.
    There is also the gun crime investigative unit in Port of 
Spain, Trinidad. We are providing training and access to the 
eTrace software platform that allows police officers anywhere 
in the world to trace the serial numbers of weapons found at 
crime scenes for investigative purposes.
    You referenced in your opening statement, Mr. Chairman, the 
new coordinator position within the Department of Justice, 
which we think is going to be a very important tool in aiding 
prosecutions of straw purchasers.
    The bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which this body 
passed--and thank you very much for that--provides important 
tools that allows us to prosecute straw purchasers of weapons 
that are used in crimes overseas who have the knowledge or 
expectation that the guns that they purchase would be used in a 
criminal activity.
    We have, I think, made important progress in attacking the 
gun trafficking into the region, but there is much, much more 
work to be done, and as you rightly signaled, this is a vital 
task for this Administration and our partners around the 
region, and I know, sir, that you personally heard this from 
our partners during your trips and participation in the Summit 
of the Americas.
    Senator Kaine. Again and again, I have heard this all 
throughout the region. You referenced earlier the U.N.-
integrated office in Haiti, which I think is referred to as the 
BINUH, and the fact that the Security Council extended its 
mandate by a year.
    Share a little bit about what that integrated office does. 
What is the scope of their work?
    Mr. Nichols. They coordinate the United Nations country 
team activities in Haiti, so all of their specialized agencies. 
They provide political mediation and intervention. They have 
dedicated police officers who provide training within the 
Haitian National Police as well as some of their own site 
security.
    The number of police officers in the mission actually 
nearly doubled in the renewal of the resolution so they will be 
able to do more things around training. The coordination of 
humanitarian efforts in Haiti, not just within the U.N. country 
team, agencies like World Food Programme or UNICEF also extends 
to other donors as well, and Assistant Administrator Escobari 
could tell you about how they work with BINUH in that regard.
    Senator Kaine. Excellent. You mentioned in your testimony, 
Secretary Nichols, the role of the Haitian diaspora in the 
United States and I think that is an intriguing reference that 
there is a significant diaspora in the DMV, in this region. 
Senator Rubio talked about the diaspora, very significant in 
south Florida.
    Talk a little bit about how you see the role of the Haitian 
diaspora--Haitian Americans--in assisting a transition to a 
better chapter in the life of the country.
    Mr. Nichols. The Haitian diaspora--I have met with them in 
Miami, I have met with them here in this area, I have met with 
them in New York, virtual meetings from people--with people 
around the country--they are an incredibly talented group--as 
you well know, business leaders, doctors, lawyers, dentists--
and they want to help Haiti.
    They have economic resources. They have professional 
skills. Historically, we have worked with Haitian-American 
police officers to support the Haitian National Police in the 
past.
    The ability of that community to provide assistance depends 
also on the security situation in Haiti. It has to be safe for 
them to travel there and work with Haitians in-country around 
the broad areas of development, and we are proud to have 
Haitian-Americans who work in the State Department and even on 
the Haiti account. This is very important for us.
    Senator Kaine. Excellent.
    I want to switch to humanitarian issues, Assistant 
Administrator Escobari. In my opening comments, I mentioned the 
fact that this latest spate of political unrest and violence 
following the assassination of the President, shortly following 
was an earthquake.
    There have been even more recent challenges. Flooding and 
earthquake just in June of this year led to 55 deaths, but left 
more than 13,000 people homeless, and the U.N. indicated in a 
March 2023 report that gang violence had displaced at least 
160,000 people.
    The magnitude of this challenge is very striking, but your 
point was there are some good things going on. I thought the 
statistics that you referenced about the health care system, 
the percentage of Haitians that receive health care in clinics 
that have been supported by USAID, the work that is done 
between USAID and the Haitian Government on health care 
facilities, I thought those were very powerful.
    How are these health care facilities operating in an 
environment where the gangs control so much of the country? Are 
health care clinics kind of viewed as safe spaces where the 
gangs have not overly interrupted their work or are you seeing 
significant restrictions of the work of these facilities 
because of gang violence in the country?
    Ms. Escobari. Thank you, Senator, for your question and 
your enduring support of Haiti.
    Health is probably the place where we are strongest in 
USAID. There is over 160 clinics that are run with support from 
USAID and 90 percent of them are currently operational, and I 
think it is because of a mix of the things that you talked 
about.
    A lot of our partners come from those communities, work in 
those communities, and serve those communities. I think that 
everybody is motivated to keeping them open more so in the 
current circumstance, and they provide everything.
    They provide primary health. They were instrumental during 
the cholera outbreak. They are the first point-of-contact on 
response to gender-based violence.
    They are really integral to these communities and have 
been--have remained open even in the worst moments.
    Senator Kaine. Are these facilities part of the government 
public health network or are they facilities run by NGOs and 
nonprofit organizations?
    Ms. Escobari. There is a mix, but our--most of our support 
is supporting the Ministry of Health in Haiti and this has been 
investments for the last 10 years to not only build the 
capacity of the ministry and build that public health 
infrastructure, those norms for people to know how to respond 
to cholera, and really all of that investment has come to 
fruition in these institutions that were able to respond and 
the government was able to respond during the recent cholera 
outbreak in October and really keep that at the WHO 1 percent 
fatality.
    Eight hundred people have died of cholera in that recent 
outbreak.
    Senator Kaine. Just--and just----
    Ms. Escobari. After 2010, it was 10,000. I am just saying 
there is a big difference in how the government was able to 
respond to the crisis.
    Senator Kaine. Right. The U.S. investment along with other 
partners in this public health infrastructure connected to the 
Ministry of Health that began a decade ago was absolutely 
critical during COVID, for example.
    Before that, there might have been one-off clinics or 
people running health institutions, but not a robust public 
health infrastructure under the Ministry of Health. The 
creation of that architecture has helped with cholera, helps 
with the pandemic----
    Ms. Escobari. HIV. Yes.
    Senator Kaine. --helped under the HIV--helps under the 
current situation.
    Describe a little bit, because I think it is hard to wrap 
our head around the fact there is not a functioning democratic 
government in this sense. There is no elected official in Haiti 
right now who has a mandate. There have not been elections that 
have led to people serving terms pursuant to a mandate.
    How does the Ministry of Health maintain itself? I mean, 
how does it fund the clinics? How does it provide security to 
the clinics so that gang violence does not interrupt it? 
Describe that a little bit.
    Ms. Escobari. Yes. USAID works in very complicated places. 
We work in South Sudan. We work in war zones in Ukraine, and we 
have learned to work with the partners that we have.
    In Haiti--and many times we work at the level of the 
community and we work with the institutions and the civil 
servants that exist and with partners that want to work with us 
and we have found that, and I have met with the Minister of 
Health when I was there in January.
    They are partners in the provision of health care in 
responding to the emergencies and we have found partners like 
that in other institutions, and when we find those partners we 
double down on strengthening them irrespective of sometimes the 
instability at the national level.
    Senator Kaine. I focus on the health issue because I think 
Senator Rubio correctly pointed out that before you get to 
significant economic activity, investment, or new elections you 
have to have a base of security and I would argue that a 
functioning health care system is another one of these 
preconditions.
    Of all the things that we could do while we are looking for 
that next step forward, hopefully, with a multinational force 
to provide security assistance doing what we can do to continue 
to train police and maintain through our assistance this 
functioning health care network, those are the two 
preconditions that if all else is not working, we have to make 
sure that those things work because those will be the 
foundation upon which a political resolution will have to be 
built.
    I encourage USAID in that effort and I think you are right, 
that of all the work that USAID does in Haiti and maybe many 
other countries that the health care work is probably the 
foundational work that is the most important.
    Let me ask you this. The GAO released a report in March 
that recommended that USAID and State improve the management 
and assessment of reconstruction activities.
    It looked at USAID's post-2010 earthquake investments and 
found that despite efforts of USAID to increase partnership 
with local entities to manage funding--and that is a capacity 
building as well as a service delivering value--the U.S.-based 
partners implemented the majority of the USAID reconstruction 
activities rather than local partners and received most of the 
funding obligated between 2010 and 2020.
    What might we do to--in reconstruction activities? Now we 
are talking outside the healthcare space, other kinds of civil 
society reconstruction activities. What might we do to increase 
localization efforts as a way of both delivering services and 
building capacity?
    Ms. Escobari. Thank you, Senator. As you know, renewing our 
commitment to localization is part of our priority throughout 
the agency.
    Senator Kaine. Right. Ambassador Power has stated that we 
should be doing 25--a minimum of 25----
    Ms. Escobari. Of 25 percent----
    Senator Kaine. --percent of assistance going through local 
partners by 2024 throughout the USAID portfolio.
    Ms. Escobari. She often says that even 25 percent seems low 
when we think that our major mission is to really create 
capacity in the places that we work in. That is important for 
the agency and it is still important and a priority for Haiti, 
even though we do have to acknowledge that localization 
involves more staff, more people, more money, which is 
challenging. All of those are challenging in Haiti.
    Despite those challenges, actually Haiti had made a huge 
improvement just last year in doubling the percentage of 
funding 
that went to local partners from 10 percent to 22 percent from 
FY21-22.
    We have established a new partner engagement unit within 
our mission to be able to work with civil society and really 
not only help them do their functions, but also work with them 
to help them work with us.
    We know we are sometimes an onerous organization because we 
have to account for every dollar of taxpayers and we do so, but 
we are working to train those organizations to work with us and 
we are making progress.
    Senator Kaine. Let me explore just one example during your 
opening testimony. I am curious as to how this is being 
localized.
    You talked about USAID investments in micro utilities for 
clean water access and possibly other utility service for 
hundreds of thousands of Haitians and you used the phrase in 
your testimony that these investments were self-sustaining. Are 
these utility investments being done with local partners?
    Ms. Escobari. Well, these are run by communities. This is 
what--what we want to bring is institutionality, that these 
utilities can not only provide services, but that people are 
willing to pay for them and that is what we have seen in these 
micro utilities is that they are not only functioning, 
providing drinking water, but they have a water meter.
    They have the capacity for people to pay online. They have 
gone from really receiving nothing and being bankrupt to three 
of them, I think, have received over $70,000 in revenue. They 
are self-sustaining.
    Same with sanitation and water management, which is really 
making a difference. Haitians are willing to pay for services 
if they are provided and what we have done is help those be 
managed at the community level.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you.
    Secretary Nichols, I was in the Dominican Republic in 
October and met with Prime Minister Abinader and we talked 
about the Haitian-Dominican border and some of the challenges, 
the percentage of births in Dominican hospitals that are to 
Haitian women who have fled across the border because they do 
not have any option that they find acceptable in Haiti. That is 
a good thing that they have this option in the Dominican 
Republic. Yet, it does create its own set of challenges.
    Talk to me a little bit about the Haiti-Dominican Republic 
relationship. Dominican Republic is a good ally of the United 
States. They are also a pro-democracy nation, having formed the 
Alliance for Development and Democracy in the region.
    Talk a little bit about Haiti and the Dominican Republic. 
Now, in the past there have been challenges, court cases in the 
Dominican Republic and other efforts that were seen as sort of 
trying to close off or reduce the historic sense of welcome 
that Haitians have found there, but talk a little bit about the 
current state of the relationship.
    Mr. Nichols. The Dominican Republic has been very vocal in 
their demanding, exhorting the international community to 
support Haiti.
    They have stressed that the global responsibility to help 
the Haitian people is something that they--they are focused on 
the value. The Dominican Republic hosts thousands and thousands 
of Haitians as well as many hundreds, thousands more people who 
have historic or ethnic roots to Haiti.
    They have provided training and assistance to the Haitian 
Government over time. President Abinader, Foreign Minister 
Alvarez, in our conversations with them repeatedly stressed the 
importance of providing assistance to Haiti.
    The future of the island of Hispaniola depends on a 
prosperous and successful Haiti and the Dominican Republic, as 
prosperous and successful as it is, will become even more so. 
They need to have a neighbor that is stable and prosperous as 
well.
    I just note that we are very honored--I am proud to hand 
over the chair of the summit coordination process for the 
Summit of the Americas to the Dominican Republic, which will 
host the next Summit of the Americas.
    As you alluded to, they have been very committed to 
strengthening democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and 
private sector-led growth in our region. We consider them a 
valuable partner.
    Senator Kaine. Excellent. Well, one of the things we can 
do--let me finish up with a question to both of you, the kind 
of wrap-up question unless other colleagues come, and that is 
what would you ask of Congress right now to enable you to do 
the work you need to do in Haiti? What can we be doing that 
would be more helpful?
    I will give you one answer. We had a really good hearing 
yesterday with ambassadorial nominee Hankins to be the 
Ambassador to Haiti. It is always better to have a confirmed 
ambassador.
    Ambassador Hankins has served in Haiti earlier in his 
career, understands the situation, anxious to get back. We have 
had a little bit of a slowdown in some of the ambassadorial 
confirmations, particularly in the hemisphere, and I have done 
a lot of work with my colleagues to free up a number of them.
    I think getting a confirmed ambassador in Haiti is 
something that would be a very important step for the Senate to 
take, but in addition to that, how about each of you take some 
time as we conclude and offer any additional comments you would 
have about things we can do to be helpful?
    Mr. Nichols. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Obviously, I agree wholeheartedly with the importance of 
confirming Dennis to be our Ambassador in Port-au-Prince. 
Beyond that, the renewal of HOPE and HELP legislation will be 
incredibly valuable to provide economic stability and economic 
growth for Haiti.
    I believe that we are currently well-positioned to provide 
resources for a multinational force in Haiti, but this body's 
continued generosity in supporting our efforts to aid the 
Haitian people and provide security in Haiti are vital and I 
thank you for your leadership on that and for this body's 
willingness to support that generously.
    The final note that I would make is, broadly, in our 
efforts to promote greater stability and security in 
challenging places around the world, resourcing our colleagues 
in diplomatic security to ensure that our people can be safe 
wherever they are in the world is very important.
    Thank you for your support, which has been steadfast in 
that area, as well.
    Senator Kaine. Virginia is home both to the training 
facility for the Marine security guards who provide security to 
embassies, but also the State Department Foreign Affairs 
Security Training Center in Southern Virginia.
    We care very, very deeply about keeping our folks safe and 
are proud to host the security training facilities in the 
Commonwealth.
    Administrator Escobari, how can we be more helpful?
    Ms. Escobari. Thank you so much, Senator, for that 
question.
    Let me reiterate what my colleague said. HOPE/HELP right 
now would be extremely valuable. You are correct that there are 
certain things that are needed that are basic. Security is one 
of them. Health is one of them.
    Things are still happening in Haiti. The worst of the 
violence is happening in Port-au-Prince. We work in the north 
and the south where people are still exporting their goods they 
are producing. One in every two jobs are in agriculture.
    People need those jobs, and the textile sector has employed 
at some point over 50,000 people. They work within free trade 
zones where they have some protection of institutionality, and 
I think those investors are making those decisions now and your 
commitment to the continuation would send a really strong 
signal.
    The second thing would be engaging our continued--to bring 
attention, like, with this hearing to our international 
partners and the importance of them joining us.
    We are the largest donor and--but this needs to galvanize 
the whole international community for us to make a difference 
because the humanitarian needs are immense, and I do think that 
not all is lost, but we need to have sustaining power to make 
sure that we can continue to save lives as we try to turn the 
course of Haiti.
    Thank you.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you very much.
    Well, I know that I am really looking forward to this 
report from the Secretary General, the recommendations back to 
the Security Council in mid-August, and I do not know that we 
will have a hearing on that, but you can expect that we will be 
reaching out to State once those recommendations are delivered 
to have further dialogue about whether there seems to be a 
gelling plan to move forward.
    My assessment of this before today, but it has certainly 
been emphasized in your testimony, is that there are a number 
of partners that really want to participate in this 
multinational effort if it is scoped correctly, defined 
correctly. Learn some of the lessons from some past challenges.
    I think the challenge is not finding willing participants. 
The question of leadership is a tough one, but at least there 
are partners around the table that want to participate and that 
should give us hope.
    I look forward to the report on the 15th and then further 
dialogue with you about how we can move forward to provide 
appropriate security assistance.
    I am going to ask that the record of this hearing stay open 
until close of business tomorrow in case members who were not 
able to come would like to submit questions for the record. If 
they do, I would encourage you to respond fully and promptly.
    With that, the hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
                              ----------                              


              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


              Responses of Mr. Brian Nichols to Questions 
                  Submitted by Senator Robert Menendez

    Question. For over 6 months, Haiti has had zero democratically 
elected officials. Prime Minister Henry, who the United States and 
international community recognize as Haiti's de facto leader, had his 
term constitutionally expire in November 2021 and is viewed as 
illegitimate by a significant portion of the Haitian population. And 
despite the signing of the December 21 Accord, it seems to me that a 
true political consensus between Henry and key opposition groups 
remains elusive as does any concrete, realistic timetable for the 
peaceful holding of free, fair, and transparent elections in the 
immediate future.
    Is it time for a more inclusive transitional government in Haiti or 
do you believe the December 21 Accord is sufficient to set Haiti back 
on the path towards democratic governance?

    Answer. We believe Haitians must decide what an acceptable 
political consensus looks like. To that end, the U.S. Government has 
supported Haitian-led efforts facilitated by actors such as the Eminent 
Persons Group from CARICOM, which includes former prime ministers of 
Jamaica, The Bahamas, and St. Lucia. These efforts aim to facilitate 
greater political dialogue and broader consensus, paving the way for 
elections when security conditions permit. The National Consensus for 
an Inclusive Transition and Transparent Elections, also known as the 
December 21 accord, represents a positive step towards resolving 
Haiti's political impasse. This accord has broader support than 
previous efforts and its leadership, including Prime Minister Henry, 
continues to engage opposition parties including the Montana Group and 
the Group of Eight political parties. Since the signing of the December 
21 accord, Prime Minister Henry took several significant steps towards 
creating a path forward for inclusive elections, including installing 
the High Transition Council, reconstituting the Supreme Court, and 
holding political roundtables and ongoing discussions with opposing 
political parties.

    Question. Are you satisfied with progress made under the December 
21 Accord?

    Answer. Much work remains ahead but, Haitian stakeholders made 
important progress through the December 21 accord. The installation of 
the High Transition Council, reconstitution of the Supreme Court, and 
political roundtables with opposing political parties were important 
steps in the path towards elections. Now Haitian stakeholders must 
reach a compromise on the distribution of executive powers and 
remaining steps towards elections, including naming members of the 
Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) and logistics around identifying 
polling places, updating voter lists, and issuing voter registration 
cards.

    Question. It is clear to me that the Haitian National Police 
unfortunately cannot solve the urgent security crisis in Haiti alone. 
To this end, I was glad to see the United States introduce a resolution 
at the UN Security Council this month, which was adopted unanimously, 
requiring the UN Secretary General to develop a comprehensive list of 
international responses to address Haiti's security challenges, 
including the potential creation of a multinational force. While I know 
the United States has been in discussions with partner countries on the 
creation of such a force for close to a year, I am frankly frustrated 
at how long this process has taken and at the ongoing lack of clarity 
over the leadership, composition, duration, and mission objective of a 
multinational force.
    What specific information can you share on each of these points?

    Answer. The United States continues engaging the international 
community on the potential creation of a multinational force (MNF). A 
MNF could assist the Haitian National Police (HNP) in securing critical 
infrastructure sites and enabling the HNP to focus on curtailing gangs' 
use of kidnapping, hijacking, extortion, murder, and sexual violence. 
The United States stands ready to provide support to a MNF where it 
would be most effective, potentially including the provision of 
training, logistics, and/or equipment.

    Question. What is being done to ensure that any future 
multinational force avoids the shortcomings of previous internationally 
led efforts in Haiti?

    Answer. We are drawing lessons from prior international efforts in 
Haiti to avoid shortcomings from these experiences and to maximize the 
ability of a MNF to pave the way towards sustainable peace and security 
and maintain credibility and popular support. We remain committed to 
introducing language in a UN Security Council Resolution authorizing a 
MNF that encourages the MNF to comply with applicable international law 
and follow best practices the international community has established 
on gender, the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, and 
environmental management. In addition, we will use the upcoming United 
Nations Secretary General report, which we expect to outline the full 
range of support options the United Nations can provide to enhance the 
security situation, to help guide development of the MNF.
    The deployment of a MNF should provide short- to medium-term 
security assistance. The United States will also continue to support 
Haitian National Police (HNP) capacity building efforts, which would 
complement a MNF. We will supplement these efforts with longer term, 
strategic planning under the Haiti Strategy to Prevent Conflict and 
Promote Stability (SPCPS) 10-year plan, which provides a comprehensive 
U.S. Government approach to address the drivers of instability, in 
close coordination with local stakeholders in Haiti and the 
international community. We actively coordinate on implementation of 
this 10-year plan and apply lessons from past experiences.
    I believe a MNF with a narrow scope could assist the HNP in 
securing critical infrastructure sites and better enable it to curtail 
lawlessness and stop rampant gang violence. Continuing to support the 
growth of the HNP will also play a critical role in ensuring a positive 
outcome in Haiti.

    Question. The Haitian people cannot afford to wait another year for 
the international community to figure this out. When do you expect a 
multinational force to be ready for deployment?

    Answer. Given the urgency of Haiti's security situation, we 
actively engage the international community to advance a multinational 
force as soon as possible. Timing of deployment of a multinational 
force would depend on several factors, including the identification of 
a lead country, and that country's review of conditions on the ground 
in Haiti.

    Question. For 2 years, armed criminal gangs have launched a 
horrific wave of violence across Haiti. Murdering civilians and 
ambushing police officers. Kidnapping American nationals. Sexually 
assaulting women and girls. They have done so with the political and 
financial backing of Haitian elites. That is why I introduced the Haiti 
Criminal Collusion and Transparency Act, which has the support of over 
a dozen Haitian civil society and diaspora groups, to expose the links 
between these actors and ensure both Haitian gangs and their sponsors 
are targeted for economic sanctions and visa restrictions. That is also 
why I supported the establishment of a sanctions regime at the United 
Nations last October.
    Can you provide an update on progress towards holding Haitian 
criminal gangs and political and economic elites accountable through 
the use of sanctions? What more needs to be done?

    Answer. The United States' financial sanctions and visa 
restrictions--rolled out at an unprecedented pace--placed significant 
pressure on political and economic elites who finance gang leaders and 
foment the ongoing crises in Haiti. Since October 2022, the United 
States took steps to impose sanctions and visa restrictions on over 50 
individuals involved in street gangs, other Haitian criminal 
organizations, drug trafficking, significant corruption, gross 
violations of human rights, and serious human rights abuses. In October 
2022, the United States also secured unanimous approval for the first 
ever UN sanctions regime in the Western Hemisphere and persuaded 
partners like Canada and--following my hearing--the EU to create their 
own Haiti sanctions programs. We continue to press other actors to 
follow suit.
    A key factor in the success of our sanctions policy is carefully 
choosing targets who are doing the most damage and whose sanctioning 
will motivate others to improve their behavior. U.S. financial sanction 
and visa restriction laws and regulations that remain narrow in scope 
and/or require evidentiary standards limit the efficacy of our 
sanctions due to limited information collection capabilities in Haiti. 
I would welcome a chance for my team to brief your staff in-depth about 
our sanctions successes so far and how to ensure that your well-
intended legislation does not have unintended consequences that would 
harm the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool.

    Question. What is the current status of the UN sanctions regime, 
and has the U.S. proposed additional targets for inclusion?

    Answer. Establishing this sanctions regime proved an important step 
to help the Haitian people push back against a culture of impunity 
among certain elites and criminal actors, and had an immediate 
deterrent effect on actors supporting or involved in criminal activity. 
However, the peace and security of the Haitian people requires more. We 
continue to work with members of the UNSCR 2653 Sanctions Committee to 
co-sponsor additional designations against those who finance and foment 
violence and instability in Haiti.

    Question. The United States has a global responsibility to prevent 
U.S.-manufactured guns from falling into the hands of criminal actors 
overseas. For decades, we have failed to live up to this 
responsibility, and the trafficking of American guns has directly 
contributed to widespread insecurity and violence across communities in 
our hemisphere. This includes Haiti, where the United States is the 
principal source of licit and illicit firearms, according to a recent 
report by the UN Office on Drugs and crime. We should all be ashamed 
that the horrific wave of murder, kidnappings, and sexual assaults 
being unleased by Haitian gangs is most likely being committed with the 
assistance of U.S.-made weapons.
    What is your assessment of the extent to which arms trafficking 
from the U.S. is contributing to insecurity in Haiti?

    Answer. The illicit flow of firearms enables gangs to carry out 
their crimes and to stockpile weapons that can often surpass the 
firepower of the HNP. We also know that the proliferation of small arms 
and light weapons can be linked to conflict-related sexual violence. We 
recognize that arms trafficking is a critical issue in Haiti as well as 
the broader Caribbean, and we remain committed to addressing this 
issue.

    Question. What are we doing to effectively address this issue, and 
what challenges remain?

    Answer. In June, Vice President Harris announced a new position 
within the Department of Justice, the first ever Coordinator for 
Caribbean Firearms Prosecutions. The Coordinator will support the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which established stiffer penalties 
for international weapons trafficking. As the Vice President also 
announced in June, the Department of State will support the Department 
of Homeland Security in collaboration with the HNP to develop a 
Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU) to facilitate 
investigations and prosecution of transnational crimes with a U.S. 
nexus, including firearms and ammunition smuggling. We continue 
providing training and access to the eTrace software platform that 
allows police officers anywhere in the world to trace the serial 
numbers of weapons found at crime scenes for investigative purposes. 
The United States has been a strong supporter of the Crime Gun 
Intelligence Unit in Trinidad and Tobago, which is a regional effort to 
understand issues related to gun trafficking. We recognize the 
challenges to stopping firearms flow, tracing trafficked weapons, 
identifying perpetrators, and holding criminals accountable. Aligning 
our efforts strategically and leveraging all available tools to advance 
the Haiti Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability 10-year 
plan can enable us to address gun trafficking in Haiti and the broader 
Caribbean in the most comprehensive manner.

remains elusive as does any concrete, realistic timetable for the 
peaceful holding of free, fair, and transparent elections in the 
immediate future. It is imperative we make sure Haiti is equipped to 
hold elections when the time comes.
    What democratic governance programming is USAID undertaking now to 
help the Haitian people prepare for this?

    Answer. In Haiti's contested political environment, USAID is 
focused on facilitating a process that builds trust between citizens 
and their institutions and starts to renew Haitians' faith in 
democracy. In alignment with the State Department's efforts to build 
consensus around a path to elections, USAID is supporting the 
Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS) to 
work with Haitian institutions and civil society actors on election 
planning and preparations. CEPPS is fostering dialogue on a range of 
reforms to Haiti's electoral process, including a required revision of 
the Electoral Law, which could include improvements to the structure 
and functions of the electoral council; a realistic elections calendar, 
including the synchronization of presidential, legislative, and 
municipal elections; and identifying polling places. They also plan to 
hold dialogues on the Political Parties Law, which will involve 
political actors, the Provisional Electoral Council, and civil society. 
In addition, the CEPPS partners are supporting civil society 
organizations so they can build their capacity for advocacy in these 
discussions and can lead efforts for constitutional and electoral 
reforms and election observation.
    Also, in partnership with the Organization for American States, 
USAID has launched a program to support Haiti's National Identification 
Office to renew expired national identity (ID) cards. This activity 
will help register, issue, and deliver 2 million new national ID cards 
to Haitian adults who do not have one. In Haiti, national ID cards 
serve as voter ID cards. Importantly, this program will also update 
Haiti's voter registration system, helping to bolster future turnout.

    Question. We are currently witnessing one of the world's worst 
humanitarian and food security crises unfold in our own hemisphere, 
mere miles from Florida. Haiti is per capita the second most food 
insecure country in the world, with more than half the population in 
need of humanitarian assistance. At a time when Haitians desperately 
need support from the international community, however, such support 
has been lacking. Only one-fourth of the UN Humanitarian Response Plan 
request has been met, and the World Food Program has announced it will 
be forced to cut hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries without 
additional funding. While I recognize USAID's significant contribution 
of over $100 million in humanitarian assistance this year, this is 
clearly insufficient to meet Haitians' dire needs.
    Does USAID have sufficient resources at its disposal to bolster 
humanitarian support to the Haitian people? If not, what additional 
funds and programs are needed this year to prevent the humanitarian 
crisis from worsening?

    Answer. Thanks to the continued support of Congress, the United 
States is the top humanitarian assistance donor to Haiti ($112 
million), followed by the EU ($10.5 million), Canada ($8 million), and 
Japan ($7.1 million). Since FY 2021, the United States has provided 
more than $265 million in emergency humanitarian assistance to Haiti. 
Since its deployment to Haiti in mid-October of 2022, USAID's Disaster 
Assistance Response Team has worked closely with partners to assess 
needs on the ground and to provide life-saving assistance such as food 
assistance, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and protection services, and 
critical health and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies to 
partners responding to the ongoing cholera outbreak. While USAID will 
continue its lifesaving work through humanitarian assistance and will 
advocate for a robust budget in FY 2024 based on humanitarian needs, 
the hard reality is that more support from the international community 
is required to fully address the widespread needs of the Haitian 
people.
    The UN launched a 3-month system-wide scale-up in April aimed at 
bolstering resources, increasing UN staff and coordination, raising the 
profile of the emergency, and addressing acute food security and 
malnutrition, child protection, cholera, and gender-based violence 
(GBV) needs across Haiti. The scale-up has since been extended to mid-
October. USAID has been a strong advocate and supporter of the scale-up 
since its inception, and we continue to advocate for other 
international donors to increase their funding toward the underfunded 
Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). USAID continues to advocate that 
Haiti remains in the spotlight of higher-profile emergencies 
considering the deepening humanitarian situation that exceeds the 
Government of Haiti's capacity to manage.
    Meanwhile, USAID works through a wide range of capable and 
longstanding partners to reach the most vulnerable populations despite 
operational challenges and the unpredictable security environment. For 
example:

  <bullet> USAID partners continue to provide emergency food assistance 
        and nutrition support to at-risk populations despite 
        significant security challenges. Specifically, the World Food 
        Program (WFP) reached nearly 26,600 households with cash 
        distributions in Artibonite, Centre, Nord-Ouest, Ouest, and Sud 
        departments during July. Further, BHA's funding contributed to 
        a WFP effort that brought 20,000 people in the Cite Soleil 
        commune of Port-au-Prince out of Catastrophe--IPC 5--levels of 
        acute food insecurity.

  <bullet> In response to massive protection violations and sexual 
        violence, BHA partners have provided critical protection 
        services, including GBV prevention and response, as well as 
        psycho-social services. USAID partner, Concern Worldwide, 
        reached nearly 2,900 people with GBV prevention and response, 
        including GBV sensitization, in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan 
        area as of June.

  <bullet> In partnership with the logistics nonprofit Airlink, USAID 
        established a humanitarian air bridge to deliver critical 
        health and WASH supplies to relief organizations combating 
        cholera in Haiti, transporting more than 232 metric tons (MT) 
        of assistance to eight humanitarian organizations as of July 
        2023. Overall, BHA has transported more than 682 MT of health 
        and WASH commodities to humanitarian partners in Haiti in FY 
        2023.

  <bullet> USAID currently supports 11 partners implementing WASH 
        activities to disseminate disease prevention messaging; provide 
        hygiene kits and safe drinking water to vulnerable households; 
        repair WASH infrastructure, and conduct awareness campaigns on 
        hygiene best practices to reduce disease transmission.

         Written Statement of Assistant Secretary Todd Robinson

                                     Submitted by Senator Tim Kaine

                 Prepared Statement of Todd D. Robinson

    Chairman Kaine, Ranking Member Rubio, and distinguished Members of 
the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today regarding 
the Department of State's efforts to address the security and 
humanitarian crises in Haiti. Addressing the current emergency in Haiti 
is a key foreign policy objective that supports our goals of reducing 
instability and illegal trafficking in one of the United States' 
closest neighbors.
    When I traveled to Port-au-Prince in January, I saw firsthand the 
effects of the instability and violence devastating Haiti. In my 
conversations with the Prime Minister and Haitian National Police (that 
is, HNP) Director General, we discussed the urgent challenges facing 
the police, and the message was clear: HNP officers need our support 
with training, equipment, logistics, and vetting. In their work to 
counter increasingly sophisticated and violent gangs, HNP officers are 
outnumbered and outgunned, leading to low morale and making clear the 
HNP needs the help of the international community to grow and maintain 
the force. Experiencing the public outpouring of discontent shed a new 
light on Haiti's security, humanitarian, and economic crises, and 
prompted me to redouble my efforts alongside U.S. interagency, Haitian, 
and international partners to improve the security situation, thereby 
laying the foundation for meaningful progress in Haiti.
    The U.S. Government has led the international community in 
responding to the security situation in Haiti. Since 2021, the Bureau 
of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), has 
allocated approximately $122 million, including $30.3 million recently 
approved by Congress, to address rampant insecurity and support the 
Haitian state's ability to provide a safer country for its citizens. We 
have provided key equipment donations, including 100 unarmored 
vehicles, 1,200 sets of body armor, and 37,400 emergency food rations 
for police officers. We will donate additional strategic equipment in 
the coming months, including armored vehicles for U.S.-vetted HNP 
officers, armored heavy equipment to help police dismantle roadblocks 
created by gangs, and advanced GPS trackers to protect donated 
vehicles.
    Our support includes training and advising, and we fund 16 advisors 
to specialized units and senior leaders of the HNP, nearly all of whom 
bring U.S. law enforcement experience paired with Haitian Creole 
language abilities to offer capacity-building expertise. In addition, 
our training program has grown the HNP counter-gang intervention unit 
to approximately 110 officers as of this month, which represents a 50 
percent increase in the force size. To mitigate the risk of gang 
influence and corruption, U.S.-certified polygraphers vetted 
approximately 240 current and prospective officers in the specialized 
units.
    Our assistance helped to establish and develop new units in the HNP 
and contribute to stronger HNP leadership. Over the past 10 years, we 
supported the creation and professionalization of the HNP's 
counternarcotics, crowd control, border patrol, and community policing 
units. Through long-term INL training programs, eight individuals INL 
trained are now in key leadership positions across the HNP, including 
the Acting Director General.
    Our efforts have helped the overburdened officers in the 
corrections sector. Prison infrastructure support since the devastating 
2010 earthquake helps reduce overcrowding and create more humane 
conditions for those detained. We also trained Haitian prison 
authorities and developed food production programs to reduce 
malnutrition and health issues among the prison population, including 
cholera mitigation efforts amid the ongoing outbreak. This support 
continues today despite the incredibly challenging security and 
operational environment.
    INL developed new partnerships with our interagency colleagues. We 
coordinated with the Department of Defense (DoD) to deliver HNP-
purchased armored vehicles to Haiti in 2022 and 2023. These vehicles 
helped the HNP to end the fuel blockade and reopen the Varreux Fuel 
terminal in November 2022. We are partnering with Homeland Security 
Investigations to establish a Transnational Criminal Investigative 
Unit, the first of its kind in Haiti. Starting in fall 2023, this 
specially vetted HNP unit will work with HSI special agents on the 
ground in Haiti and analysts in Miami to investigate and prosecute 
transnational crimes impacting both U.S. and Haitian security, 
including firearms, drugs, and human trafficking.
    Under the umbrella of the Global Fragility Act (GFA), we intend to 
join our colleagues at USAID to undertake a new phase of INL's ongoing 
community violence prevention program. Aimed at improving community 
police units, restoring trust within communities, and delivering key 
health, educational, and economic services, this effort would bring 
together the best of INL and USAID expertise to build the resilience of 
communities through violence prevention, including sexual violence 
prevention, provide incentives to reject gangs, and offer alternatives 
for at-risk youth. We welcome the efforts of our USAID and other 
interagency colleagues under the GFA 10-year plan to address the 
development and humanitarian components of the crisis that continues to 
plague Haiti's citizens, which also will shore up Haitian Government 
resources for investment in security.
    INL's work has saved lives in Haiti, but the challenges facing the 
HNP are daunting--gangs continue to terrorize Haitian citizens, recruit 
young men and boys into a life of violence, and outnumber the HNP. Our 
brave HNP counterparts face extreme danger every day and are asked to 
carry out high-risk operations well beyond typical police duties. 
Thirty-two HNP officers have been killed in the line of duty since the 
beginning of 2023. With approximately 14,000 officers on HNP records in 
July 2023, the Haitian police need to double the force to adequately 
provide security and meet UN-recommended force levels. We anticipate 
this will be a long-term effort, and we are looking at ways to increase 
the recruitment and retention of the HNP in the short- and medium-term.
    INL cannot do this alone--corruption, firearms trafficking, and 
irregular migration continue to hinder Haiti's ability to emerge from 
the crisis and move towards political stability. We need the support 
and cooperation of the international community and regional law 
enforcement partners to investigate and counter criminal organizations. 
We are encouraged by the continued collaboration with our international 
partners--we are actively coordinating with our Canadian counterparts 
on their March 2023 announcement of 100 million CAD (76 million USD) 
towards improving security in Haiti. The UN-led multi-donor police 
support fund is another key mechanism for us to harmonize security 
assistance with international partners, and we have provided funding 
for this effort to assist the HNP with emerging needs.
Within our own government, a coordinated response is more important 
than ever, and we are pleased to have increased our collaboration with 
our partners at USAID, HSI, and DoD. We will continue to seek further 
opportunities to improve interagency efforts and deploy expertise that 
can improve conditions in Haiti.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share INL's work in Haiti.

                                  <all>
