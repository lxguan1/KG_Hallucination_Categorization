                      THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2023

                  House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security,
                          Committee on Energy and Commerce,

    The Chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes for an 
opening statement.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF DUNCAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    First off, I want to thank you all for being here, both our 
local witnesses and my colleagues who made the trip, both from 
DC and from their respective districts.
    This looks a little different than our normal hearing and 
our normal hearing room. But I am excited we are in Midland, 
Texas, for our first Energy field hearing. I believe field 
hearings gives us a unique boots-on-the-ground perspective on 
how the policies and rhetoric coming out of Washington, DC, 
affect, and actually impact, regulated parties and communities.
    We unfortunately have an administration that has taken a 
whole-of-government approach to wage war on American energy 
production. President Biden has repeatedly promised to phase 
the industry out of existence and has followed through by 
creating uncertainty and issuing regulations to make energy 
harder to produce, more expensive for consumers. The rush-to-
green agenda has also compromised our energy security, making 
us more reliant on our adversaries for sources of energy.
    Two years ago, America was energy dominant for the first 
time since 1952. In 2019, we became the number-one oil and gas 
producer in the world. This drove down the cost for consumers 
at home, benefited our allies abroad by providing supply as an 
alternative to Russia and to OPEC. Much of this success is owed 
to the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit of the shale 
revolution created by hydraulic fracturing and the production 
of both oil and natural gas, something this community knows 
better than most.
    Energy and Commerce Republicans have solutions to build off 
of the success of the shale revolution and get us back to 
energy dominance. We have a series of bills that aim to unleash 
innovation by creating regulatory certainty and encouraging 
long-term investment. This is in sharp contrast to the Biden 
administration and congressional Democrats who want to make oil 
and gas production impossible.
    For the United States, we produce oil and gas cleaner and 
safer than nearly anywhere in the world. And we need policies 
that reflect this reality instead of ones that undercut our 
success. We need to unleash more American energy.
    So I am looking forward to the hearing, looking forward to 
hearing the perspective of our witnesses today, the ones who 
really understands the impact that the industry has on 
communities like Midland.
    Also, I would like to thank Chair Rodgers for holding this 
hearing and my colleague, Congressman Pfluger, for hosting us 
here in his district.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Duncan follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I would like to yield the remaining of my 
time--balance of my time to Mr. Pfluger for some opening 
remarks.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. AUGUST PFLUGER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Mr. Pfluger. Well, thank you, Chairman Duncan, Chairwoman 
Rodgers, and the rest of the committee for making this trip to 
Texas.
    OK. Is this on now?
    I would like to thank the entire committee for making the 
trip here. We obviously had a little bit of air travel 
difficulty and are glad to be here. We will have some more of 
our colleagues joining us.
    But Midland, Texas, Odessa, Texas, the Permian Basin is 
where our Nation's energy debates should take place. I am 
excited to have a bipartisan group of Congressmen and women 
here and that our community gets to showcase how the Permian 
Basin, and those in the audience today, are indispensable to 
America's economic and national security.
    Under Chair Rodgers' leadership, this committee is 
committed to engaging with local communities to understand the 
challenges that American people are facing today, many of which 
have been inflicted by this current administration.
    Thankfully, this city anchors the most important region 
that is poised to solve many of the critical issues facing our 
Nation and our world. If you listen to the White House, oil-
producing regions are greedy and unpatriotic. But nothing could 
be further from the truth as we look out into the crowd today. 
The story of the Permian Basin is one of innovation. It is one 
of unending entrepreneurial spirit and community. In fact, 
Permian producers have a long history of rising to the 
occasion. Extraordinary cooperation between the U.S. Government 
and American oil companies is what helped win World War II as 
Permian crude literally fueled General Patton's infiltration of 
the German border and eventually the defeat of Hitler.
    It is often quipped that that war was won inch by inch, and 
that is true. The U.S. launched two incredible pipeline 
construction projects, the Big Inch and the Little Big Inch. 
And the Inch lines delivered more than 500,000 barrels of 
Permian oil a day to the Northeast, and they were incredibly 
successful in safeguarding the precious commodity from U-boat 
attacks. Those pipelines are still in use today.
    Again, in 2008, another engineering feat allowed Permian 
producers to rise to the occasion when hydraulic fracturing and 
horizontal drilling enabled the U.S. to significantly increase 
production of oil and natural gas in what is known as the shale 
revolution. This put OPEC on its heels. It established U.S. as 
the energy-dominant country in the world. It gave us an 
indispensable tool for national security.
    In 10 years, production of the Permian has grown from well 
under 1 million barrels a day to over 5\1/2\ million barrels 
presently. That is 40-plus percent of total U.S. production and 
7 percent of the world production.
    Just like it did throughout World War II, the Permian Basin 
is doing its part to make this country energy secure. It is 
also helping our allies around the world. You cannot understand 
U.S. energy dominance without visiting the Permian Basin.
    I am incredibly proud to show off my district, to have the 
conversation here, and to talk about the importance of 
delivering affordable, reliable, secure energy, not just to 
Americans, but around the world.
    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pfluger follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman for having us and for 
your comments.
    I now recognize Mr. Peters from California for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT H. PETERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to say it is great to be back in West Texas.
    Thank you, Mr. Pfluger, for having us.
    Mr. Pfluger does a wonderful job representing you all and 
advocating for you in Washington, DC. He might think that it is 
a credit to him that he got such a big crowd. But I think it is 
because folks heard there might be a Democrat, and they want to 
see what that looks like. It is a pretty rare commodity in 
these parts, I understand.
    On my previous trips, I have visited Houston, Midland, and 
Lubbock and learned about the oil and gas industry and local 
communities. I got a tour from Pioneer of fracking and some 
drilling. I came away with an understanding of how this 
industry is not just an economic feature of Texas but a 
cultural one.
    And today I met people whose families have been working in 
energy for generations. It is hard, honest work. They are proud 
of it, and today I am excited to continue our dialogue.
    To start, I want to say that this country has never solved 
any great problem, whether it is sending a man to the moon or 
winning a world war or beating back a pandemic, without the 
participation of both political parties. And in Congress I have 
three energy priorities that I think are ripe for bipartisan 
cooperation right now.
    First, permitting reform. In the 118th Congress, we can 
work together to make it easier, not harder, to build things. 
For my Republican colleagues, this means looking beyond just 
oil and gas and truly investing in an all-of-the-above energy 
strategy. In the coming decades, we have to build massive 
amounts of energy and infrastructure, including transmission 
lines, solar, wind power, carbon capture, nuclear, and more.
    And Texas is a great example of this energy future. We know 
the State is a global leader in oil and gas, but it also leads 
elsewhere. The American Clean Power Association found that 
Texas is the national leader in clean energy development, just 
ahead of my home State of California, which might bring some 
smiles in this room, because everyone likes to be bigger in 
Texas, all right? So you are bigger than California in clean 
energy.
    This State is first in the Nation in wind power and second 
in solar and storage. Forty percent of the electricity in Texas 
comes from wind, solar, and nuclear.
    We can learn valuable lessons from Texas and admit that 
picking technology winners and losers is a failed strategy, 
whether you are focused solely on natural gas in Texas or solar 
power in California.
    On permitting reform, my Democratic colleagues have to 
accept that environmental laws written in the 1970s primarily 
to stop bad projects can and should be updated to meet the 
environmental challenges of today. And we can work together to 
speed up our processes without sacrificing environmental 
outcomes.
    My second priority is making our energy system cleaner. We 
all agree that oil and gas isn't going away anytime soon. We 
also can agree that making U.S. oil and gas production cleaner 
is good for the economy and the environment. For the oil and 
gas industry, the focus must be on methane, a super pollutant 
more potent and harmful than CO<INF>2</INF>.
    Last year, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, 
which included billions of dollars to monitor and reduce 
methane emissions at oil and gas facilities. This money can 
help address the methane problem without breaking the bank for 
companies, and I would love to work with you to make sure that 
this money is spent effectively in California to help your 
producers make this advance.
    Third, I want to talk about advanced energy technologies. 
The United States should lead the world in developing and 
exporting technologies like carbon capture, geothermal, direct 
air capture, and advanced nuclear. The U.S. oil and gas 
industry can help develop carbon capture and carbon removal 
because they have the knowledge, labor force, and capital to 
take these technologies from good ideas to large-scale 
deployment.
    We can clean up our domestic energy production and help the 
world do the same, positioning the United States--and Texas, 
parenthetically--as a global energy and climate leader.
    It is wonderful to be with you today, and I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Peters follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman.
    Now it is my pleasure to recognize the chair of the full 
committee, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Chairman Duncan.
    And a big thank you to you, Congressman Pfluger, for 
organizing, helping organize this field hearing today.
    We are really excited to be here in Midland for the first 
field hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee for 
the 118th Congress. And Congressman Pfluger is the first Member 
representing the Permian Basin to serve on the best committee 
on Capitol Hill, the Energy and Commerce Committee.
    But this is--this is really important to all the Members 
that are here. Thank you for being here, and we are looking 
forward to the discussion today. Thank you for the witnesses 
also.
    Our primary energy objective is to ensure reliable, secure, 
and affordable delivery of energy to Americans, to their homes, 
to their businesses, the grocery store, and everywhere in 
between. We must build upon our Nation's diverse and abundant 
natural resources to create more secure supplies and more 
dependable power. And we must work to develop a predictable 
regulatory landscape, one that unleashes America's unmatched 
genius for innovation and technological leadership.
    While we have examined solutions in our hearing room, in 
Washington, DC, to secure our energy future, here today in 
Texas we get to see where it all begins in places, like the 
Permian Basin. It begins with the workers, the families, and 
all the people living and working in energy-producing 
communities like Midland and so many others, large and small, 
all across this Nation.
    We cannot achieve a more secure energy future, create more 
jobs, and increase affordability without the people who do the 
work and take the risk to produce American energy.
    Today's hearing will shed light on the benefits of energy 
production at the local and State level, and it should serve as 
a reminder of how American energy expansion helps communities 
across our country and how we can change the regulatory 
environment to speed up this expansion.
    America is a diverse Nation blessed with abundant natural 
resources. And we must be responsible stewards of those 
resources to ensure our communities flourish. Different areas 
of the country have different advantages, and the one-size-
fits-all, top-down approach is not the way to go.
    For instance, I come from Washington State. The Pacific 
Northwest has abundant hydropower. The Marcellus Shale has 
helped make the U.S. the world leader in natural gas 
production. Wyoming has the potential to provide uranium to 
power advanced nuclear reactors across the country. And the 
Permian Basin, where we are today, has made us the world leader 
in oil and natural gas production.
    And August has impressed upon me that it is the hard-
working and the--it is hard-working people and the ingenuity of 
the people that have made this happen in the Permian Basin, 
bringing tremendous benefits in terms of economic opportunity 
and tax revenues for local schools and communities.
    Last year, the Texas oil and gas industry paid nearly $25 
billion in local and State taxes and royalties to support 
schools, infrastructure, and local services. It is almost 
double what it was 5 years ago. Permian Basin operations 
represent a major portion of these revenues.
    Unfortunately, this administration has signaled repeatedly 
their intention to reduce oil and gas production in coming 
years. Today, we will hear from witnesses on what this would 
mean for communities like Midland: Lost jobs, lost revenues, 
and lost livelihoods.
    I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Midland 
Mayor Lori Blong. You sit at the intersection of energy, 
economic development, and the needs and concerns of our 
families, those who live here in Midland. You and Mr. Carrasco, 
the Midland Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, both have unique 
perspectives on the challenges facing small businesses, 
including surging energy costs. Given your experience and the 
experience of our other witnesses, today's hearing is to 
explore the role of innovation in advancing cleaner, more 
productive operations.
    Allowing businesses the freedom to experiment is 
fundamental to innovation. We saw this with the shale 
revolution where entrepreneurs found a more efficient, 
effective, and cleaner way to produce oil and gas, giving new 
life to oil wells and opening up new opportunities to produce 
American energy. And we did this with some of the highest 
environmental and labor standards in the world.
    Unlocking our resources and removing barriers to American 
energy should be a bipartisan goal, and we are here bipartisan 
today.
    I am confident that the voices we will hear today will 
reinforce that unleashing American energy is the best path 
forward to strengthen our energy security, reduce emissions, 
and make life more affordable across the board.
    Thank you. I yield back.

    Mr. Duncan. Before I recognize Mr. Cardenas, I want to 
thank the chairwoman for letting us wear jeans and boots today.
    Now I recognize Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TONY CARDENAS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Cardenas. OK. Got it.
    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Really appreciate this 
opportunity. But I really want to thank somebody who I owe my 
life to, Congressman Pfluger.
    Thank you for getting us here safely. Our flight from 
McAllen to DFW to get to Midland didn't work out very well. So 
he swiftly commandeered a flight here and it was good and 
smooth, and he didn't fly it for us. I don't know if that is a 
good or bad thing.
    You do fly, correct?
    He does fly.
    But, again, I think it is really important for us to 
understand that we are here as Americans. We are all Members of 
Congress. We are very blessed to represent our various 
communities, yet at the same time we come together. And 
sometimes we do argue, fuss, and fight, but it is because we 
have the best interests of all of you at heart.
    And when I say ``all of you,'' as the United States of 
America, I think that we all understand that we carry on our 
shoulders to be the shining example to the world and how, when 
we do our best, we definitely are the best. And it is not from 
a place of ego. It is just a place from being blessed to have a 
country of innovation like no other, to have a country that is 
willing to get into the eye of the storm and come out in a way 
that we make the better--the world a better place for everyone.
    So with that, I just want to say thank you for bringing us 
together in your beautiful community here.
    And I do have jeans but no boots. When I was--when I was 
single and much more successful, I got a pair of boots made for 
myself. But that was a long, long time ago. But I did wear the 
jeans.
    ``American Energy Expansion: Improving Local Economies and 
Communities' Way of Life,'' which is the title of today's 
hearing, but I think it is really important for all of us to 
understand that we can do all of that, and we have been doing 
all of that in many, many ways.
    But the fact of the matter is the world is changing, and we 
are having an impact on the environment. And we must move 
forward in a way where we can actually have it all, and we can. 
But that means we have to be looking at all energy 
opportunities. And as was mentioned by my colleague from 
California, Texas is doing it bigger and better in many ways 
with many different energy sources.
    And so making sure that we can do it right, I want to use 
one example that we cannot repeat, for example, when it comes 
to the 2017, it was Kineder Morgan--or Kinder Morgan, excuse 
me--announced the Permian Highway pipeline that would be routed 
through the Texas Hill Country. Despite citizens' protests and 
lawsuits filed, construction on the pipeline did begin.
    And in March of 2020, an accident during construction 
caused about 36,000 gallons of drilling fluid to spill. It 
contaminated the groundwater, which local families depended on, 
and the drinking water source that they depended on as well, 
and it had let hazardous materials in the drilling fluid. And 
it was regarded as carcinogenic to humans.
    Contaminating the drinking water is something--like I said, 
we can do things right. And we have to make sure that we hold 
everyone accountable to do it right and to actually finish the 
job in a way that doesn't leave behind any catastrophe or 
anything that would actually cause harm to our communities', as 
the title of this hearing is ``way of life.'' And it is 
important that we all understand that we can do it better, and 
we can make sure that we hold everyone accountable.
    Today we are hearing from four witnesses who are giving 
different perspectives of how to do it right, what we are doing 
right, and what we need to do better.
    I want to use an example of my father. I am the youngest of 
11, and my father came from Mexico. And he spoke very little 
English but--and he was a man of very few words. And one day I 
asked him what it was like, just--I don't remember why I asked 
him this question. I must have been watching TV, and there was 
some crop dusting going on over the fields.
    And my father started in this country as a farm worker. He 
only had a first-grade education. He was proud of being a hard, 
hard-working man.
    And I said, ``Dad, what would you do in the fields back in 
the '40s and '50s when you were a farm worker when they were 
crop dusting?''
    He said, ``Son, we put a rag over our face, and we just 
kept working.''
    Well, obviously, that is not good for the people working in 
the fields. It is not good to have practices--today we know 
better. We know how to do things better. Science has brought us 
a long way. We have practices that we should be practicing, 
that we used to do in the past, that we shouldn't be doing 
today. No one should be subjected to that kind of environment 
in the workplace.
    And so what I am here to say is that we want to come 
together and make sure that the United States continues to be 
the leader and also the shining light for the rest of the 
world, to make sure that tomorrow is better than today.
    And I have grandchildren. I was just looking at their 
pictures a few minutes ago that was sent to me. And I want 
their world to be good and better than it was when we got here.
    So, with that, my time has expired, Mr. Chairman. Really 
appreciate this opportunity and thank you so much.
    I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Cardenas follows:]

 AND CHIEF EXECUIVE OFFICER, ELEVATION RESOURCES, AND CHAIRMAN 
   OF THE BOARD, INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA

                    STATEMENT OF LORI BLONG

    Ms. Blong. Good afternoon.
    And thank you, Chairman Duncan and Chairman Rodgers and 
members of the subcommittee.
    Thank you to Congressman Pfluger for all of your work in 
making this happen.
    We welcome you to Midland, the energy capital of Texas and, 
arguably, the energy capital of the United States. We believe 
that the secure, affordable, reliable, and responsibly produced 
oil and gas of the Permian Basin is a critical component to 
promote human flourishing, both domestically and abroad.
    My name is Lori Blong, and I serve as the cofounder and 
managing partner of Octane Energy, a Midland-based operator. I 
also have the distinct privilege of serving as the first female 
mayor of America's energy epicenter, Midland, Texas.
    Today the perspective that I hope to share with you is not 
as a representative of a special interest group or as of a 
research firm but instead from the perspective of a small 
businesswoman, a community leader, a wife, and most 
importantly, a mother to three very spirted West Texas children 
who are growing up here in the oil patch.
    I am a second-generation Midlander, having graduated from 
high school just a few blocks from where we are now. And I am 
also a second-generation member of the oil and gas industry. 
Mine is a boots-on-the-ground perspective, and I am deeply 
conscious that I could see our region and my own business 
succeed or fail based on the decisions that you make and the 
policies that you advocate for.
    Somehow over the past century, much of the U.S. has begun 
to think of oil and gas as merely a fuel source for 
transportation or for heating, and the reality is that these 
hydrocarbons that we produce are also responsible for creating 
the highest standard of living in any society in the history of 
the world. And there are also components in as much as 96 
percent of the products that we use every single day, from 
pharmaceuticals to clothing and electronics, just to name a 
few.
    I am sure that everybody in this room has a mobile phone in 
your pocket, and I want you to note that the part of your phone 
that breaks when you drop it is the part that is not produced 
from petroleum products.
    The pipeline and the infrastructure permitting headwinds, 
the current SEC-driven ESG movement, and the current 
administration's vow to put an end to fossil fuels are all 
creating growing market distortions and need to be reversed. 
These policies prevent individual Americans and American 
businesses from growing, from creating jobs, and energy--and 
the energy security that we otherwise could.
    Many of the members of this subcommittee have stated that 
energy security is national security, and I completely agree 
with that sentiment. We are watching today's newspaper 
headlines demonstrate how critical these reserves are to the 
future of our Nation.
    We have the energy we need right here in the Permian Basin 
to keep American homes warm, to provide electricity to 
hospitals and schools, and to keep our country and our allies 
safe. But we must have Federal advocacy and support for the 
energy production that we require.
    We also need the Federal Government to change the tone from 
restriction to proactive partnership with environmental 
solutions. And we have watched as the Federal Government has 
invested our tax dollars into wind and solar energy options, 
among others. We know that the Federal Government is doing 
those things. And we know that--we also have technology 
available that we have--we have identified much of it here in 
the Permian Basin for beneficial reuse of produced water that 
millions of barrels that are being produced every single year 
as associated byproducts of oil and gas production.
    If we could get the Federal Government to partner with us 
in developing those into scalable, economically viable 
solutions for produced water in the Midwest and West United 
States, this would be a game changer.
    Directly underneath our feet right now where we are 
sitting--you may not know this, but oil is being produced 
beneath where you are sitting, about 10,000 feet below ground 
here, and it is being extracted 2\1/2\ miles south of here on 
the south side of town.
    Our Permian advances in science, engineering methods, and 
processes have yielded the safest, most environmentally 
responsible barrel of oil in the world. Considering the 
regulatory framework at the Federal and State levels, a barrel 
of oil in the Permian Basin is the greenest barrel of oil 
produced in the world.
    Another tangible benefit that the city of Midland is 
currently experiencing from oil and gas is record sales tax 
collection. Much of it is attributed to the activities related 
to the oil and gas industry. This enables us to provide city 
services, healthcare, education, and many other things without 
overburdening property tax payers.
    We are providing jobs in Texas to nearly half a million 
people with an average annual income of $115,000. And we are 
tied for lowest unemployment rate in the State at 2.4 percent. 
An 18-year-old with a commercial driver's license can earn six 
figures a year in Midland, Texas. Not just can, but they do.
    We have a crucial ingredient to enable flourishing: Secure, 
responsible, reliable, and plentiful American oil and gas.
    I have heard it said that the last drop of oil on Earth may 
be produced right here from the Permian Basin because we are 
innovative, we are hard-working, and we understand how to watch 
our costs. Today I ask you to take a stand to enable and 
empower our people, removing unnecessary headwinds and 
roadblocks--the American ingenuity and productivity that all 
Americans--so that we may thrive and flourish.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Duncan. Mayor, thank you so much.
    And I will now go to Mr. Carrasco for 5 minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF ADRIAN CARRASCO

    Mr. Carrasco. Good afternoon.
    Chairman Duncan, Chairwoman Rodgers, and members of this 
committee, I would like to thank you. And it is an honor to be 
a witness at this hearing that has so much meaning and positive 
impact in the world.
    I would like to say a big thank you to Congressman Pfluger 
for his leadership, service, and dedication to our district.
    I am Adrian Carrasco. I am the chairman of the board of 
directors of the Midland Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, 
president and owner of Premier Energy Services, and board of 
trustee of Midland Community College.
    The MHCC has over 30-plus years of advocating, partnering, 
and supporting small minority businesses in Midland County. 
When I say ``minority,'' it is not just color. It is women-
owned businesses and veteran-owned businesses.
    As many organizations suffered during COVID, the MHCC did, 
as well. And we had to totally rebrand the MHCC to ensure that 
we continued the great work of the past and create opportunity 
now and for the future.
    The mission of the MHCC is to successfully lead, develop, 
and advocate for our members, while encouraging the 
advancement, economic growth, and social development of the 
Hispanic and minority community. The MHCC provides commerce 
opportunities through quality of education, quality of 
business, quality of jobs, and quality of life.
    We all know that small businesses play a key role in 
increasing commerce, providing jobs, and bringing economic 
development within our community. It is crucial that we 
continue to provide business education, funding opportunities 
for business growth, and guidance for positive growth.
    As communities like Midland grow, we look to entrepreneurs 
to develop businesses that meet the need of the community and 
its growth.
    Through programs like our Bettering Your Business at 
Breakfasts, we have been able to education new and existing 
small minority businesses on how to obtain a credit line, how 
to build cost-effective websites, and how to promote the 
business and its services.
    The MHCC builds connections between its members and the 
business community. With our quarterly business mixers, we give 
current members and future members the opportunity to network 
and develop business relationships for growth. It is important 
that we serve as a liaison to assist in making small minority 
businesses more marketable, ensure stability and lasting 
prosperity.
    Due to the positive impact of the oil and gas industry on 
local communities, this has given aspiring entrepreneurs the 
opportunity to fulfill dreams of owning a business. We have 
seen home bakers open restaurants and bakery shops, restaurants 
expand their businesses into second locations and catering 
services to the oil field drill sites. Licensed commercial 
electricians have expanded services into the oil and gas 
sector, and cosmetologists and barbers have opened their own 
shops.
    I applaud the great work of the Midland Development 
Corporation and Kevin Dawson with Maybe in Midland/Odessa on 
their successful efforts of bringing new brands of restaurants, 
family entertainment centers, aerospace- and aviation-related 
businesses to Midland.
    Midland is home to over 6,200 business establishments and 
provides over 100,000 jobs. Oil and gas in the Permian Basin is 
an economic driver not only here but throughout this Nation and 
the world. MHCC will continue to support our local minority and 
small business owners so they can provide economic growth and 
commerce in our community.
    Premier Energy is a proud member of the MHCC, and my 
company is celebrating its seventh-year anniversary. I grew up 
in Kermit, Texas. And I actually started working in the gas 
plant industry at 18 years old and was able to continue work in 
the summer to help pay my way through college. I have over 14 
years' experience in the production field of the oil and gas 
industry. I am proud of my 64 employees. And without them, my 
wife and I could not continue to grow and provide exemplary 
services to our customers.
    Premier focuses on new construction and maintenance of well 
and battery facilities, environmental, and remediation and 
reclamation work, earthwork, and vessel repair.
    I thank companies like Diamondback Energy, Pioneer Natural 
Resources, Elevation Resources, Walsh & Watts, and others that 
trusted me and my company to get the job done. Over the years, 
I continue to be impressed upon the innovation, the safety, and 
the commitment to the environment by these companies and all in 
this industry.
    The use of plastic-lined facilities and berms is a true 
commitment to eliminating oil or produced water to fall 
directly onto the ground. The use of automation to monitor tank 
levels, well sites, and production facilities has allowed 
electricians to expand upon their knowledge and prevent 
overflow.
    I am often disturbed by the attacks that groups display 
against this very important industry. The oil and gas industry 
is very responsible, and I get to see it firsthand. I challenge 
those that don't understand or go by hearsay to come visit an 
oil well and a facility site. All are invited to see the 
innovation, safety, and the importance of taking care of the 
environment.
    I commend the Texas Railroad Commission for being in the 
forefront of working with oil and gas operators to provide 
clean oil and gas in Texas. Oil and gas operators and service 
companies have a positive impact on employment, building strong 
communities and quality of life. I have seen my very own 
employees able to buy and qualify to purchase their first home, 
first new car, and give back to their churches and communities. 
I have witnessed one of my own managers recently become a 
citizen of the United States.
    Furthermore, I have provided opportunities for our contract 
lease operators to be hired on a permanent basis by oil 
producers which, in essence, will have access to more extensive 
training, benefits, and quality of life.
    I thank you and look forward to your questions today and 
for a progressive dialogue.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Carrasco follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you.
    The Chair will now recognizes Dr. Zavada for 5 minutes.

             STATEMENT OF MICHAEL S. ZAVADO, Ph.D.

    Dr. Zavada. Yes. Good afternoon, everybody.
    I am Michael Zavada. As my mother used to say, I am not a 
real doctor. I am a Ph.D. and geoscientist in environmental 
geology.
    I would like to start off by saying that I don't think 
there is any doubt that the oil and gas industry in West Texas 
over the last 100 years actually has contributed to the 
development of the towns in this region. It has made major 
contributions to the energy available and the security of the 
United States.
    And with new technologies, the Permian Basin continues to 
be a major producer. I think we are all aware of the argument 
and the data that surrounds climate change and continues to be 
discussed on levels in academia and also in politics and other 
areas.
    But one thing I--one point I do want to make. I do think it 
is prudent if the United States--for the United States to 
develop alternative energy sources with a result to diversify 
our energy portfolio. I think this is necessary. That is the 
safest and most stable way of maintaining long-term energy 
independence.
    But we shouldn't make any one form of energy excessively 
important. I think this is the most strategic way to protect 
the energy grid and has a good strategic move in the world, in 
a hostile world.
    The Permian Basin, known for its supplying a major portion 
of America's energy, will remain so in any new paradigm that is 
emerging for the future. And that will be at least for the next 
50 years. It is no secret that West Texas is also an ideal 
environment for the production of alternative energy: solar, 
wind, hydrogen fuels, among others.
    I believe with rational and cooperative investment in the 
development of all forms of alternative energy will not only 
diversify our energy portfolio but continue the long-term 
tradition of West Texas as a major source of America's energy 
needs, and will also help our towns that rely heavily on oil 
right now transition to a new paradigm. I think to develop--I 
do have some suggestions to develop a sustainable plan for the 
communities in this region.
    First of all, I would like to say, in partnership with 
industry and academics and academia within Texas, we need to 
continue to invest in developing technologies that will 
ameliorate the larger amounts of CO<INF>2</INF>, methane, and 
other volatile organic compounds released into the atmosphere 
at all phases of oil and gas production. That is recovery, 
transport, refinement, and use.
    Industry and academics are already engaged in efforts--not 
in an adversarial way, but in a cooperative way--to remediate 
some of the environmental issues, for instance, as have already 
been mentioned, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration; 
hydrogen fuels; and fuel-cell technologies. Industry is also 
partnering with academics to explore ways of cleaner-produced 
water to minimize needs for injection wells and to minimize 
low-grade earthquake damage.
    All of these efforts by industry and academics need to be 
consistently invested in as long as fossil fuels remain a 
primary energy source, and they will. I think any projections 
of 10 years or any time like that is just unreasonable.
    And we have to get a level head about how this transition 
will actually occur, and that we should keep all of the 
components of it. It shouldn't be at the expense of any one 
component.
    OK. So here is one of the suggestions--here is another 
suggestion. Because of the nature and rise of full price of a 
barrel of oil, many towns in West Texas that are only dependent 
on the industry take a characteristic--take on characteristics 
of a boom-and-bust economy and woefully lag behind communities 
in other parts of Texas and the United States that have more 
diverse and reliable tax base.
    This also leads to a large number of itinerant workers 
living in temporary housing: trailer parks, RVs, and man camps, 
many of which are not regulated for disposal of human waste and 
are hosted on dusty, barren lots. They are reminiscent of 
worker camps associated with coal mining in the early part of 
the 20th century.
    Itinerant workers and their families changed the 
effectiveness of funding that was intended for more permanent 
population with regard to education, health, and welfare. So 
this is an issue that many communities struggle with, as costs 
go up to service all of these families, as workers come into 
our towns, particularly in Odessa and West Odessa.
    I think many companies have been effective in yielding 
large profits from their investors, but focused investment on 
permanent infrastructure in the communities of the Permian 
Basin is necessary: improving schools, roads, creating parks, 
walkable communities, supporting a variety of programs to 
enhance entertainment in these communities, summer programs to 
help children more success--to be more successful in school, 
and specialized programs for immigrant families.
    Industry operations should be relegated exclusively beyond 
the borders of a town. This would be for aesthetic, health, and 
safety reasons.
    There should be investment in providing help to these 
communities to better zone and plan their rural communities to 
be more beautiful and pleasant communities to live in. This 
often attracts other businesses, and people become permanent 
residents in the community.
    In other words, what I am advocating for is that they are 
to diversify--they are to diversify their job base, in other 
words, the types of jobs they have, rather than to rely on one 
industry.
    Provide funding to communities to seek out energy 
industries or tangential industries to diversify the jobs 
available in the region. This would ameliorate the effects of 
oil and gas boom-and-bust cycles. This will also diversity the 
skills of the workforce and may attract unrelated industries to 
the area in which workers' skills are transferable, further 
diversifying and stabilizing the community's tax base.
    Thank you.

    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Dr. Zavada, thank you and thanks for, at short 
notice, coming in and being part of the hearing.
    I now go to Mr. Pruett for 5 minutes.

                 STATEMENT OF STEVEN H. PRUETT

    Mr. Pruett. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, Chairman--
Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers, Congressman Pfluger for inviting 
me, and to all the members of this distinguished committee for 
making the arduous trip to Midland, Texas, the heart of the 
Permian Basin. It is an honor to speak with you today.
    I am Steven Pruett, founder and CEO of Elevation Resources, 
a private, Midland-based independent oil and gas company that 
happens to be owned by East and West Coast institutions and 
myself. We are active in drilling and operating horizontal 
wells in the Permian Basin.
    I am also chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association 
of America, which I will refer to as the IPAA, which represents 
over 6,000 independent oil and gas companies and individuals in 
33 States. We are based in Washington, DC. So you will be 
seeing me more over the next 2 years.
    Elevation, along with the other active drillers in the 
Permian Basin, rely upon horizontal drilling and multistage 
hydraulic fracturing to develop unconventional shales that 
comprise over 90 percent of the oil and natural gas production 
in the Permian Basin today. As Congressman Pfluger said, in 
2008 we were producing about 700,000 barrels a day. And thanks 
to horizontal drilling and fracking, we are now producing 5.6 
million barrels per day. And we have got more upside from 
there.
    I am going to discuss three factors that affect and limit 
the growth of U.S. natural gas production--U.S. oil and gas 
production. That is the impact of regulatory uncertainty, 
permitting delays in labor, and supply-chain shortages.
    So regulatory uncertainty has constrained capital formation 
and the reinvestment of cash flows needed to increase U.S. oil 
and gas production. As a result of the COVID-induced oil and 
gas price collapse, over 300 oil and gas companies and oil 
field service companies filed for bankruptcy protection, and 
many ceased operations permanently. The universe of investors 
who will invest in oil and gas companies is dramatically 
smaller than a few years ago due to ESG concerns and financial 
losses. The number of banks loaning money to oil and gas 
companies is half what it was 5 years ago due to loan losses 
and ESG mandates from their investors.
    The EPA is drafting rules for Quad-O b and c 
implementation, which dictates the equipment and practices we 
use to manage and reduce emissions. The EPA is--in the 
rulemaking process for the Inflation Reduction Act methane fee, 
which is ambiguous and gives the EPA a license to tax our 
industry as they see fit.
    The IPAA supports Congressman Pfluger's H.R. 484, the 
Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act, as it addresses the tax that is 
singularly focused on the oil and natural gas industry, 
implemented by the EPA, which does not have taxing authority or 
the resources to do so, and utilizes a taxing formula that is 
flawed at best. It is--we believe that much of this language 
was drafted by environmental firms that really know nothing 
about our business.
    Rest assured, Elevation and our peers have made and 
continue to make substantial investments in methane recovery. 
All of our operations are closed systems. We have also invested 
in emissions monitoring and reduction technologies ahead of the 
EPA rules. Oil and gas producers utilizing these technologies 
produce the lowest-emission oil and gas in the world here in 
the Permian Basin.
    IPAA also supports Chairman Duncan's H.R. 150, Protecting 
American Energy Production Act. State regulatory bodies have 
been delegated primacy from the EPA, and in Texas we believe 
the Railroad Commission and TCEQ are best informed and best 
staffed to regulate oil and natural gas operators in their 
respective States.
    Giving the President authority to shut down hydraulic 
fracturing is akin to killing the shale revolution, which is 
responsible for growth in U.S. oil production from 5 million 
barrels a day in 2008 to 12.3 million barrels a day presently. 
And natural gas production has increased from 56 billion cubic 
feet a day in '08 to over 100 Bcf today, which has been an 
economic engine for our country and, as Congressman Pfluger 
reminds us, for our allies in providing cheap, reliable energy.
    Permitting delays for infrastructure development limits 
growth in U.S. oil and gas production. Without pipelines, 
processing plants, export terminals, oil and gas production in 
the U.S. will not grow as we need markets for our product.
    Examples include the permitting of reactivating the 
Freeport LNG export facility, which is 20 percent of LNG 
exports over 2 Bcf a day to our allies in Europe, and there's 
other LNG export terminals waiting on years for export 
approvals.
    Permitting natural gas pipelines serving the Northeast 
where power generators are still burning coal and homes and 
businesses still burn heating oil and import LNG from abroad, 
not from the U.S. Gulf Coast, due to the Jones Act--that needs 
to be fixed.
    And leasing Federal land does not translate into drillable 
locations, as many other permits and easements are needed. 
There is the BLM in Carlsbad, New Mexico, sitting on stacks of 
permits that are needed because a well is not going to be 
drilled if they can't get product to market.
    Finally, labor and supply-chain constraints have not been 
aided by the Biden administration's negative messaging.
    Further, the oil industry is aging. My generation is 
approaching retirement, setting our industry up for the great 
crew change. However, there are not young people to replace my 
generation in the oil industry.
    Over the last 2 years, oil fields experienced 15 percent 
wage inflation, if you can find the qualified workers. We have 
also experienced months-long delay in completing and preparing 
wells due to manpower and equipment shortage.
    Drilling completion costs for my company are up 40 percent, 
and we still have escalating costs for steel labor while we 
have very weak natural gas prices because we don't have 
adequate pipeline capacity.
    To reduce uncertainty and improve the investment climate 
needed to grow U.S. oil and gas production, we need Congress to 
provide oversight of the EPA, the Department of the Interior, 
the FERC, and the SEC as it relates to regulations affecting 
the oil and natural gas industry.
    Thank you very much.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pruett follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I want to thank the gentleman, and we now have 
finished up the opening statements portion.
    Other Members are very, very close. I hate that they didn't 
get the benefit of--don't start my clock yet--of your 
testimony, and I hate they are not going to get the benefit of 
my excellent questioning of you. But now, I will now recognize 
myself for 5 minutes for questioning.
    You know, when I looked at the title of this hearing, 
``American Energy Expansion: Improving Local Economies and 
Communities' Way of Life,'' I thought about all the time I 
spent in the State of Louisiana. Now I am an honorary Texan 
thanks to Governor Abbott, and it is great to be in West Texas.
    When I have spent time in Louisiana, from Lafayette and New 
Iberia to Thibodaux, Houma, on down to Port Fourchon, on the 
sides of Highway 90, a four-lane highway, there is business 
after business after business after business after business 
after business after business after business after business 
that are somehow involved in supporting energy production 
offshore.
    It could be HVA services, it could be food services, it 
could be transportation, it could be, you know, drilling mud, 
it could be supply vessels, it could be casing, it could be all 
the downhole widgets that make energy production possible 
offshore.
    Guess what I saw last night when I drove from the airport 
in Midland to the hotel across the street. On I-20 Business, I 
guess is what it is called, Mayor, business after business 
after business after business after business after business 
after business that supports the energy production that happens 
in the Permian Basin. That is an impact on the economy. Those 
are great jobs within those industries that you guys represent.
    But the workers and the businesses themselves, they join 
the United Way and the Chamber of Commerce and they support 
ball teams at the YMCA and they go to church and they tithe and 
they tip the waitresses and they eat at local restaurants. 
Tremendous trickle-down economy within the energy sector, both 
in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and anywhere energy is produced. 
I saw it firsthand just from a little short drive from Midland 
airport to downtown. You know the impact. You know the impact 
that energy provides.
    And I think about when you--and I talked with the guys from 
Pruitt Energy today. When you take a barrel of hydrocarbon, you 
put it under pressure--God gave us this tremendous ability to 
figure this out--you put a barrel of hydrocarbon under 
pressure, and it miraculously separates in all kinds of 
products during the cracking that we use today, whether it is 
bottles--and I look around and see all the things that may 
derive from a barrel of hydrocarbons. It is an amazing 
substance produced right here in the Permian that makes the 
lives of people around the world so much better.
    But this administration is killing this industry. OK. I 
appreciate the President saying that we are going to still need 
oil and gas for a while. His definition of ``a while'' and my 
definition of ``a while'' and your definition of ``a while'' 
all could be different. We use ``10 years'' in Washington for 
all kind of stuff. Ten years is just kind of a filler word, 10-
year budgeting, 10-year this, 10-year that. It is going to be 
here a lot longer than 10 years, and I am glad of that, but we 
have got to support the industry, not kill it.
    So, Mr. Pruett, you mentioned how regulatory uncertainty 
and the COVID price collapse, ESG movement, how it all 
constrained the capital available to the industry.
    Can you explain how the President promising to end oil and 
gas production in the U.S. impacts your ability to establish 
long-term investment that is needed?
    Mr. Pruett. Yes, I will give you an example.
    So we--I mentioned we are owned by East and West Coast 
institutions through a private equity fund. And when we needed, 
when our bank held a gun to our head and said, ``You need some 
additional equity or we won't extend your credit agreement,'' 
and--or, ``If you don't put in the money, the alternative is 
you won't drill anymore, you are going to blow it down, and we 
will own your cash flows''--and it was a major bank--we went to 
our primary investor, even though we are 10 years old, we are 
way beyond the period in which they should be investing money, 
we are surviving on our own cash flow.
    So we went out to our 20 or so investors, and two of the 
largest--and they are household names, one is the largest money 
manager in the world--said, ``Not only are we not going to 
invest, we are going to sell our shares back to the company.'' 
And we negotiated a price, and they went on their way, which 
was fine. Actually, it was fantastic, because we managed to 
scrape together the money between myself, our CFO, and our 
primary investor.
    We got a new lease on life, paid down debt a little bit, 
and cut our debt in half over the next 6 months by not 
drilling. But basically, we quit drilling, we started blowing 
it down, but we complied with the bank, and now we have a great 
relationship with that same bank. We expanded our credit group.
    But there were many companies during that same time, even 
though we violated no covenants and our credit statistics were 
good, we were all put into the workout group just because the 
CEO mandated that. And we--they were basically telling us, ``We 
are going to dictate your budget. You can't drill. We own your 
cash flows.'' And that was a dark place to be. But, 
fortunately, we got price recovery. The industry has healed, 
those of us who survived that dip. And--but in the meantime, 
the number of banks who would even consider loaning money 
shrunk, and most of our banks said, ``We have a mandate from 
the top not to advance any more capital than what we have 
already committed to you.''
    So it was--it is a whole new game. So from that experience, 
my peers and I, all knowing we have to survive on our own cash 
flow--we can't rely on the banks, we can't rely on getting 
external money, the number of private equity firms has dropped 
from 30-something to probably 5 or 6 that can actually raise 
capital. And it is just a new world.
    So, while we are not public, I mean, the publics are all 
saying, ``We are going to reinvest 30 percent of our cash flow, 
the rest will go to share buybacks and dividends,'' because 
that is what their investors want. But it is the same for 
private companies. We now need to provide dividends, and that 
will fundamentally limit the ability of Permian Basin and U.S. 
oil companies to grow.
    Mr. Duncan. My time is expiring, so I want to thank you for 
that.
    I look forward to the other Congressmen's comments and the 
questions you guys and talk about the impact on the economy and 
the government in that area.
    I am going to go to Mr. Peters from California for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Peters. I just want to say I want to talk a little bit 
about a place where I really think we can agree in concept, 
even though Mr. Pruett points out some of the--maybe we haven't 
gotten it quite right in terms of regulating. But that is 
methane. A lot of my colleagues have pointed out that the shale 
revolution has dramatically reduced the production of carbon 
dioxide over other sources of energy, and that is absolutely 
true.
    The problem is that fugitive methane takes away a lot of 
the climate benefit from that, and I think that is an 
opportunity for us to work together to close this gap, whether 
it is--even Dr. Zavada said 50 years. It is going to be some 
long time that oil and gas is going to be around. Let's just 
make it clean while we are doing it, and I think there is a 
real opportunity there.
    In fact, when I went to Qatar to thank them for helping us 
with refugees from Afghanistan, everyone asked about refugees. 
I asked the emir about methane. I said, ``What do we do about 
methane?'' This is something where we can really, I think, come 
together and agree.
    It is complicated. When I visited Texas Tech, we visited 
with the petroleum engineering department there. It is not easy 
to get right. I commit to working with you to get the mechanics 
of it right, because I think we owe you that. We want to get it 
right. We don't want to be wasting money or product.
    But I think it is an operative concept. If we can work 
together, we can tone down the rhetoric around oil and gas a 
little bit, even as other sources of energy help diversify our 
economy.
    And, Mayor, I would say that is important to you, because I 
didn't hear--to be honest with you, I heard that right now 
Midland is killing it. Congratulations, right? So right now we 
are not looking at a lot of downsides. But you are concerned 
about the talk, what you hear about the future. And I think one 
way to bridge the gap--and I say this to Midland--is help on 
methane. Let's all come together and fix that problem.
    Mr. Pruett, you did mention the problems you had with the 
methane fee in the Inflation Reduction Act, but there is money 
that is going to come out to help producers comply. And can you 
talk to me about how we can work together to make sure that 
that money gets to the Texans and Oklahomans and Pennsylvanians 
who are doing this work to really deal with this methane issue 
that I just identified?
    Mr. Pruett. Yes, Congressman Peters, our 6,000 members 
distrust the EPA because they have had a target on our back. If 
the monies were instead managed and permitted by the DOE, I 
think it would be a very different picture.
    The concern is that, in order to qualify for a grant from 
the EPA, you are basically going to lift the hood on all of 
your practices. And for some of the small operators who aren't 
in compliance with the coming regulations, that is a frightful 
process, because they may be subject to fines for their 
noncompliance. And the irony is they are the ones that need the 
funding most--not my company, not Diamondback or Pioneer, 
because we are already in compliance.
    So if there is a way to move the funding, it is kind of 
like the EPA has never taxed anything before. That is in 
Treasury Department--that is unnerving--and the same thing 
about applying for grants. DOE has the technical experts, the 
scientists, the engineers. The EPA, it is a different concern. 
And I just don't think members will sign up for those grants.
    Mr. Peters. I think it is a very constructive comment. I 
think we have also assigned the EPA other grant-making that 
maybe doesn't--a square peg in a round hole. And I will take 
that back and consider it.
    Mr. Pruett. Thank you.
    Mr. Peters. But in terms of the money, I want to make sure 
people understand that the intent is to make sure that we can 
help people comply.
    By the way, your Representatives, Mr. Pfluger, Mr. Curtis, 
have also explained to me that when I hear that the industry is 
interested in methane compliance, it often comes from the big 
players. And it is the independents who are low to the ground 
and living month to month that need the help. So that is the 
intent of us and that we are trying to achieve, and we will 
keep at that.
    And if you can't send me a Democrat, I guess Pfluger is all 
right.
    Mister--I am sorry. I want to ask the mayor. The region has 
been effective at both producing large amounts of oil and 
natural gas and welcoming new technologies like solar and wind.
    How would you like policymakers to better communicate on 
energy policy so that we embrace this all-of-the-above thing 
without pitting one against the other? What would you like to 
hear out of DC? What would sound good to Midland on that score?
    Ms. Blong. I think the perception here, and perhaps the 
reality, is that we have picked winners and losers in certain 
cases because we have given, you know, we have given benefits 
to solar and wind that we have not afforded to oil and gas. And 
so, we are faced with restrictions. We are faced with 
regulatory headwinds and with permitting issues that are making 
things harder for to us move forward.
    And so I think that pulling back on some of those headwinds 
that we face would go a long way. Most of the folks in oil and 
gas don't really have a bone to pick with solar and wind 
development as long as it is a level playing field.
    Mr. Peters. You will only hear 10 more seconds from a 
Democrat in this whole hearing. So let me just say this:
    I believe in subsidizing and researching from the Federal 
Government as things get started. I think your comment is 
legitimate as those industries mature. I think right now, 
concentrating on investing in things that are new like carbon 
capture and direct air capture and things that need help, I 
will take that comment, as well, as constructive.
    And, again, thank you all for having us in Midland. I love 
visiting here. I have--still have to explain what chicken fried 
steak is, but I enjoy it when I get it.
    So I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Where are we getting chicken fried steak? 
Because I am.
    Mr. Peters. Down the street.
    Mr. Duncan. OK. Yes, you just drive north up to the 
panhandle. You will see all the windmills you want, and there 
were a lot of them subsidized by the Federal Government, at 
least initially.
    I will now go to the full committee chair, Mrs. McMorris 
Rodgers, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Again, just a big ``thank you'' to all the witnesses and 
everyone for being here today. It is great to be in the energy 
capital, as you labeled it, or called it.
    You know, and in America, we often--we often celebrate 
American ingenuity and creativity and what it has meant for us 
in so many different--different fields, sectors where we have 
led the world. And the result of that has been America has done 
more to lift people out of poverty, raise the standard of 
living more than any other Nation in the history of the world.
    And energy is foundational to all of that. You can't do 
anything without energy. It is our economy. It is our way of 
life. It is our national security. And I think at a hearing 
like this, I am reminded of just how foundational energy is. 
And we truly do need the all-of-the-above approach.
    The fact is that America has been leading. And right here, 
you know, the numbers Mr. Pruett was sharing about just the 
increase in production, energy production, because of new 
technology in Midland has had a tremendous impact here in this 
community, impacting a lot of people's lives. And I just wanted 
to have you talk a little bit more about that.
    But it has been--what we need to make sure that we continue 
to focus on is that all-of-the-above approach and continue to 
advance the new technologies, the innovations, the research 
that is going to ensure that we lead.
    And so to the mayor, I just wanted to have you speak a 
little bit more about what you have seen in Midland since, I 
guess, it was 2005, 600 percent increase in production, oil 
production, here and just the impact that that is having as far 
as on the city, your ability to provide for people, on 
individuals that live here, citizens, your way of life.
    Ms. Blong. Well, thank you.
    One of the things--you know, I am recently elected, and so 
I did polling in the fall, so I have fresh information on some 
of the biggest concerns for our community.
    And the number-one polling issue in our community is 
education, and number two is healthcare. And so, when we look 
at the things that are really being impacted by this, it is 
really the population growth that we have seen and also some 
State-level issues that are really not yours to deal with, with 
recapture and other things here in the State of Texas. But 
education here in Midland is our number-one concern.
    And we--all of these families that are coming in here, 
workers at all different levels, are bringing kids with them. 
Our average age in Midland, Texas, right now is 31 years old, 
and our largest group of population is ages zero to 4.
    And so we have this dynamic in Midland of an extremely 
young population, folks that care a lot about getting good 
education for our kids. And so that is probably the single most 
significant impact.
    But we also see other things, you know, housing, affordable 
housing in the booms-and-bust cycles that were referenced, and 
some of the man camps and the things that are associated with 
that. So there are concerns that we are facing because of rapid 
population growth and the development of oil and gas.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Does it mean more revenue also to the State, 
or----
    Mr. Blong. It absolutely means more revenue.
    And so, on the positive side, we are collecting more tax 
revenue than we have ever seen, especially on sales tax, but 
also our tax basis for ad valorem tax is higher than it has 
ever been. And so that is a pro and a con, right? So the folks 
here are paying a lot in taxes, but we are also collecting 
that, and we are able to move some things forward.
    And we see this facility that we are in and other capital 
campaigns that we have had over the last few years where we 
have developed things in Midland to improve upon the community 
that we have. And so that has been afforded to us because of 
oil and gas.
    We also see so much innovation taking place that we export 
out of the Permian Basin to other basins around the world 
technology that was developed here because we have investors 
that are willing to put their money into it here. They know 
that we take care of their capital. They know that we are 
creative and we have the groups that are able to advance 
technologies in Midland. And so we are benefiting not just here 
but the world because of that.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Appreciate that.
    Mr. Carrasco, I understand that you are a Midland trustee, 
or you said that. Would you just speak to what the energy 
production here and expansion has meant for the students at 
Midland College?
    Mr. Carrasco. Thank you, Chair Rodgers.
    Without a doubt, it is something that we continue to work 
on. My goal as a board of trustee is workforce training. We 
have to train our workforce. We have to be able to develop the 
innovation that is out there for us to continue to grow.
    And, with that, as you train students, they get into better 
jobs, so they benefit in the community. They buy homes. They 
buy their first home. They buy their first car. They get to go 
shop a lot more in the mall. So it is an opportunity for them 
to be able to improve their quality of life.
    And it helps the oil operators because we have to be a 
partner with them to make sure that we not only provide what 
they need, but we need plumbers, we need A/C and refrigeration 
techs because our homes are growing. So there is a lot of 
opportunity. And so it is our job, and it is something that I 
am very proud of that we are working on a CTE design right now 
and a big state-of-the-art CTE building where we are going to 
be able to train students so they can get out into the 
workforce quicker.
    So that is an opportunity that is definitely there for our 
students.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK. I ran out of time that quickly. I had 
more questions, but I will save those conversations for later.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. You are the chairwoman of the committee. Do you 
think I am going to gavel you?
    Before I recognize Mr. Burgess, who will be our next 
Congressman to question, there are two former Members of 
Congress in the room: Pete Olson, who I served with, former 
Energy and Commerce member, and former Congressman and now 
Texas Tech Chancellor Kent Hance, right here in Texas.
    Welcome, and thank you guys for participating.
    I will now go to Mr. Burgess for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Burgess. Thank you. And thanks to everyone for being 
here. We were late, and I apologize to you for that.
    But I just have to share something with you. You have a 
great Congressman in August Pfluger. We are sitting in the 
McAllen Airport at 5:15 this morning, and things start looking 
bad like they can sometimes on an unnamed national airline. 
People are scurrying around. They are closing doors. They are 
wheeling people off the plane we have already gotten on.
    August doesn't miss a beat, and--well, what he told me was, 
``I got 400 of my closest friends coming to this hearing, and I 
will not disappoint them''--not ``I cannot disappoint them,'' 
``I will not disappoint them.'' And he gets on his phone, and 
he arranges not one but two chartered aircraft.
    I still don't know who is paying for them, August. I hope I 
am not.
    And he gets us--for the most part, gets us all here. We 
didn't all make it. But it was a big deal, and he moved--
literally moved Heaven and Earth to make sure that this hearing 
came off.
    So big hand to your rep, Representative Pfluger.
    And, Madam Mayor, in, of course, spending the last 8\1/2\ 
in airports--and I apologize I missed your testimony, but I had 
a chance to read it, reread it, reread it, while we were 
waiting. And, you know, we had kind of an interesting start to 
this Congress. It took us 15 votes to elect a Speaker. First 
time that has happened in a hundred years. Kent Hance called me 
at midnight on one of those nights and said, ``What the hell 
are you all doing up there?''
    But, in your testimony, a hundred years ago, Santa Rita No. 
1 came online. And that kind of--when you talk about education, 
particularly for our State, I mean, that changed the curve.
    Can you tell people who may not know about Santa Rita No. 1 
a little bit about that event?
    Ms. Blong. Sure. So it was the first well that really 
brought on the Permian Basin and changed the trajectory of this 
region.
    Before that, we were known as the midway station between 
Fort Worth and El Paso. That is how our name came about, so we 
became known as Midland, halfway between Fort Worth and El 
Paso. And, whenever we saw Santa Rita No. 1 and the development 
that exploded here quickly thereafter, it has really been an 
interesting trajectory for our community and for our region--
not just for Midland, Texas, but for Odessa and for all of our 
surrounding communities.
    And so we have seen the expansion of communities with 
education, with roads and infrastructure, with workforce 
training, with our--we have two community colleges, one in 
Odessa and one in Midland, and then we have the University of 
Texas Permian Basin. And so----
    Mr. Burgess. Right.
    Ms. Blong [continuing]. So much growth has come in the 
community, largely driven just by oil and gas. And so we have 
seen some diversification. But, for the most part, it was 
driven by the discovery of this huge basin and the reserves 
here.
    Mr. Burgess. And the creation of the permanent endowment 
fund----
    Ms. Blong. Yes.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. For University of Texas and----
    Ms. Blong. Absolutely.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. Texas A&M. Not that those 
universities are important to me, but they are to other people.
    Ms. Blong. Right.
    Mr. Burgess. But the Permian Strategic Partnership is also 
a big deal----
    Ms. Blong. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. Here, and you all have worked 
very hard to promote that.
    Can you, in a couple of words, just kind of tell us what 
the Permian Strategic Partnership----
    Ms. Blong. Absolutely.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. Has meant?
    Ms. Blong. So the Permian Strategic Partnership is a 
collection of 20 companies and several others that are joining, 
and they have pooled their resources voluntarily to solve some 
of the greatest issues that we face in our community. And so 
they are addressing healthcare and workforce training, 
education--I am going to miss some--affordable housing, and 
transportation issues, infrastructure related to our region. 
And they are not just addressing that in Midland but in the 
Permian Basin at large.
    Mr. Burgess. And one of the more exciting things you said 
is that technology that is developed here because of the 
expertise and the investment is exported to other areas, and 
you all are doing it so well here that the overall carbon 
footprint of the United States year over year since 2005 has 
gone down. And it is because of exporting that technology.
    And Chancellor Hance, I do have to also mention--
Representative Peters mentioned the great engineering school 
you have built out at--in Lubbock at Texas Tech to create the 
engineers or to educate the engineers of tomorrow. So that is 
the sort of stuff that is coming out of West Texas. And the 
country--the world--benefits from that.
    Mr. Pruett, let me just ask you because you spent a lot of 
time in your testimony talking about, look, the methane problem 
that Representative Peters addressed is true. It is real. But 
the longer the gas is stranded here--he calls it fugitive 
emissions, venting and flaring. All of those are byproducts of 
the fact that you can't get your product from here to where it 
ultimately is going to be sold, generating electricity in 
Dallas or Houston or at an LNG facility out of--off Freeport.
    So are there things that can be done to hasten that 
delivery?
    Mr. Curtis [presiding]. And, Mr. Pruett, can you answer 
rather quickly and so we can move on to the next speaker?
    Mr. Pruett. Yes. Just permitting reform to--we need to 
replace aging pipelines. Kinder Morgan's pipeline was down for 
9 months to California. They needed our gas. We couldn't get it 
there. So we need to replace our aging pipeline infrastructure. 
We need the permits to do so.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you.
    Mr. Burgess. Well, we are going to help you do that.
    Mr. Pruett. Thank you.
    Mr. Burgess. Thank you.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Walberg.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you.
    I think I--it is on. I see the green light.
    Thanks for waiting around for us. And, again, 
Representative August Pfluger did a masterful job of getting us 
here. And I think it showed the desire to make sure that we had 
a chance to hear from the industry, the community, and the 
concerns that really assist us all, so thank you for being 
here.
    Mr. Carrasco--and did I pronounce that right? I wasn't here 
for your opening statement.
    Mr. Carrasco. That is fair.
    Mr. Walberg. I read all of your statements--written 
statements--so I guess I am up to that. But, Mr. Carrasco, I 
also sit on the Education and Workforce Committee as well as 
this committee, and I hear from countless constituents about 
the challenges that they face in attracting and growing a 
workforce in these critical industries.
    How is your community addressing career exploration and 
workforce training for the oil and gas industry?
    And, secondly, how are you engaging with K-12 as well as 
postsecondary institutions?
    And I would add the final point: How are you dealing with 
parents to get them past the peer pressure of saying Johnny and 
Susie have to go to 4-year institution when there may be better 
values for them and a lifelong opportunity?
    Mr. Carrasco. Well, thank you, sir.
    And, without a doubt, I mean, we understand that, within 
our increasing industry, we need workforce training.
    To address your pre-K, we are now building a pre-K academy 
that is going to serve the community well of over 280 young 
students that we are actually going to be able to----
    Mr. Walberg. You have toy oil wells or something they work 
with?
    Mr. Carrasco. No. They will be able to--well, we are able 
to accelerate early childhood teachers in a 3-year degree. It 
is the first bachelor's degree that we have. So we will be able 
to fill that void in the education. As Mayor Blong has talked 
about, that is a very important----
    Mr. Walberg. Right.
    Mr. Carrasco [continuing]. Piece of ours.
    Also the fact that we are starting with our strong dual 
credit programs so our seniors, our juniors are able to take 
dual credit. And they--and we talk to them about careers. We 
talk to them about, if you don't want to go to a 4-year 
institution, it is all right. You can be an electrician and 
make a lot of good money. You can be a welder. You can be a 
diesel mechanic. And we will train you, and we will put you out 
into the workforce fast.
    So thanks to the Permian Strategic Partnership, because 
they have invested in us. Along with their partners, they 
invested in our community college to make this happen so we 
don't have to put the burden on the taxpayer, ask for a bond or 
this and that. So very grateful for that because it allows us 
to be able to expand our reach and understand what our 
operators need, what our industry needs, what our community 
needs.
    Mr. Walberg. More student loan debt to follow----
    Mr. Carrasco. Exactly.
    Mr. Walberg [continuing]. Many of them.
    In his State of the Union address last week, President 
Biden said that we would need fossil fuels for at least another 
decade.
    Coming from Michigan, auto industry capital, that idea that 
we could move past the use of fossil fuels, these essential 
resources, in 10 years is laughable, or cryable. But that 
doesn't mean that the administration won't try.
    So, Mr. Pruett, how are the backdoor rulemaking efforts by 
the EPA and DOE affecting the industry's ability to produce oil 
and gas and keep our country energy independent?
    Mr. Pruett. You know, what is frustrating for the IPAA and 
the industry as a whole is, under the Obama administration, the 
Clinton administration, certainly under Trump and the Bushes, 
we had access to--we had a dialogue with the EPA. That is no 
longer the case. We have no--they will not return emails, phone 
calls. There is no dialogue.
    On the other hand, I am on a group with EDF--Environmental 
Defense Fund--Ceres, UT Austin scientists, and the majors where 
we are collaborating to look at ways to measure and reduce 
emissions in the Permian. That is collaborative. It is kind of 
across the aisle, but the EPA doesn't want to hear from us. 
They would rather get their formulas from EDF and others that 
don't apply and are not calculable.
    And, further, their subpart W Excel spreadsheet is flawed 
as it can be, and that is how we are reporting emissions and 
how we will be taxed. So there needs to be a lot of help and a 
dialogue with industry to create something that is 
implementable and viable. It is really not even a 
constitutional or--I don't think it will survive the courts as 
presently contemplated to implement the methane fee.
    Mr. Walberg. OK. I thank you.
    These rush-to-green policies by the Biden administration 
have caused an increase in investment in traditional energy 
production. My own horsehead pump at the end of my cornfield 
hasn't pumped for 9 months, and very little before that. It 
will pump long enough to pay for my daughter's wedding. That is 
about it. That helped.
    Mayor Blong, how has the Biden administration's rhetoric 
around the oil and gas industry impacted communities like yours 
and these industries that they support?
    Ms. Blong. I think the main impact that we see is the lack 
of access to capital for a lot of our local businesses. And so, 
through the downturn during COVID and following, we saw a lot 
of businesses suffer and fail in our community.
    And, whenever we are facing the kind of headwinds that we 
have at a Federal level with the rhetoric that has come out of 
DC, it does not incent people to want to invest in what we are 
doing. And, if he is calling for an end to our industry 
entirely, it has caused difficulty for access to capital.
    Mr. Walberg. OK.
    Ms. Blong. I think that is the biggest----
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you.
    My time has expired. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan [presiding]. I thank the gentleman.
    And now the Chair will go to the vice chairman of the 
committee--Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security, 
Mr. Curtis, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Duncan.
    I was also going to compliment our colleague, Mr. Pfluger, 
but he is not in the room, so I am not going to waste my time 
with that.
    And I would rather give a shout-out to my colleague from 
San Diego, Mr. Peters. I think it is no small thing that you 
are here today, and I think it is no small thing that you have 
been to Houston and to many places to understand this from our 
perspective. And I just really compliment you on that.
    And I would say to all of us, to the extent that we heed 
his thoughts about methane, really that helps fossil fuels be 
viable into the future and helps with the argument that we want 
to replace our adversaries' foreign fuels with U.S. foreign 
fuels. So my staff will tell you, Mr. Peters, they roll their 
eyes when I talk about methane because they know that I want to 
do something. I want to join you in that effort. So thank you 
for bringing that up today.
    Mayor Blong, you and I met just briefly, but we share some 
things in common.
    Ms. Blong. Yes.
    Mr. Curtis. I was a mayor of Provo City, some of the 
happiest years of my life being a mayor. I think that is a 
really important position that you hold.
    And, in my congressional role, I too represent many people 
who derive their income, their livelihoods, from oil and gas 
and, in my case, actually coal as well.
    And I would like to focus on a couple of your comments that 
were in your testimony.
    You said, ``The messages, virtue signaling, and the 
rhetoric that have come from the Federal level tell us oil and 
gas is evil or not on the side of average American or the side 
of the care of our environment.''
    And then you made a very, very bold statement: ``Our 
Permian advances in science, engineering, methods, and 
processes have yielded the safest, most environmentally 
responsible barrel of oil in the world. A barrel of oil 
produced in the Permian Basin is the greenest barrel of oil 
produced in the world.''
    And then, in your testimony, you used the word ``vilify.'' 
So can you tell me why you and your constituents feel that your 
way of life are vilified?
    Ms. Blong. As to why it is vilified, I am not sure that I 
can speak to that, but I would like to address that, 
absolutely.
    I think that the--there is a large lack of understanding in 
our Nation and in our world for what oil and gas professionals 
really do and for the care that we give to making sure that we 
are doing it in the most economically viable but also 
environmentally friendly way. Our families live here. And my 
children are going to bed at night just not very far away from 
the closest drilling operation. We can see it from our house, 
from our street. And so we care a lot about that.
    We are incented locally to invest our time and our money 
and our efforts into making sure that we are doing this well, 
and so I think that is a really important thing to consider.
    Mr. Curtis. So is it fair--and some of this, I am 
projecting for my constituents----
    Ms. Blong. Sure.
    Mr. Curtis [continuing]. In Utah. Is it fair to say that 
they are disturbed when they hear and they see the shutting 
down of U.S. fossil fuels here in United States, and then they 
hear the messages to Iran, to Venezuela, to Russia to produce 
more?
    Ms. Blong. Yes.
    Mr. Curtis. Can you just, like, explain how that makes them 
feel?
    Ms. Blong. Well, absolutely. And I think that that is--you 
are exactly right. We are watching a national push to some of 
these other basins around the world where we do not have 
friendly relationships with their governments. We know that 
they don't have our best interests at heart. And they are 
producing a dirtier barrel of oil than what we are.
    And so we are--we are able to do the job that community 
around us needs to do, the Nation needs us to do, and the world 
needs us to do, but we are facing our strongest headwinds from 
our own Federal Government.
    Mr. Curtis. So you mentioned you can see the rigs and 
things like that. You mentioned you are a mother of three.
    Can we assume that you care deeply about your children's 
future and about the Earth that they inherit----
    Ms. Blong. Yes, absolutely.
    Mr. Curtis [continuing]. And you do care about these 
environmental issues? And not just you, but the people that you 
represent. And could you speak to that for a minute?
    I call Utahns the best environmentalists in the world.
    Ms. Blong. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Curtis. I don't know about your constituents. Mine hate 
to be called environmentalists. But can you speak to that for a 
minute?
    Ms. Blong. That is absolutely true. As a mother and as a 
person who has lived here for--now I am the second generation, 
as I said, raising the third generation here in our community, 
I will also tell you that some of the oil and gas companies in 
the Permian Basin are doing more to advance beneficial reuse, 
water recycling operations, and the technologies associated 
with that than anyone else anywhere in the world. And so we are 
advancing those technologies right here.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you.
    Mr. Pruett, I want to just quickly turn to you.
    I believe, when we go to the year, let's say hypothetically 
2050, and we see what energy sources we are really using, there 
are going to be four variables that determine what we will use: 
reliability, affordability, safety, and clean.
    Can you speak for those in the room today? Are you prepared 
to compete with fossil fuels in all of those, including the 
clean area, moving forward?
    Mr. Pruett. Absolutely. I--look, we produce in the closed 
systems, as Mayor Blong said. We are drinking the water from 
aquifers from which our wells drill through. So we are on that 
path.
    I think a big part of the challenge for our industry is 
having you all here and having people see it to believe it, 
that we are good stewards of the land. And so I do think, 
representing thousands of smaller independents, we have got to 
pull some of the older practices to the modern practices that 
we employ since all of our facilities are less than 10 years 
old. That will----
    Mr. Curtis. I am going to cut you off because I am out of 
time, and the chairman is going to cut me off.
    Mr. Pruett. That will be the key, to bring up the laggards 
to the highest standards, and we will be competitive.
    Mr. Curtis. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield my time.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman.
    And, as a football aficionado, I just realized that Midland 
and Odessa gave us Friday Night Lights, so I want to thank you.
    Ms. Blong. You are very welcome.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes. Look, I'm going to skip over Mr. Weber and 
come back to you and go to Mr. Pfluger. It is his area, so Mr. 
Pfluger.
    Mr. Pfluger. If I may have just a minute of personal 
privilege, and then I will----
    Mr. Duncan. OK. Go ahead.
    Mr. Pfluger [continuing]. Yield back for Mr. Weber's.
    To both Chairman Duncan, Chairwoman Rodgers, thank you for 
bringing this committee to the heart and soul of energy 
production here in this country. We are so thankful for your 
leadership. Not even one month into the legislative business, 
and we are already talking about the most important thing for 
our economy that underpins our national security. And I can't 
thank both of you enough for bringing this many Members, being 
able to introduce you to our community, the hardworking men and 
women.
    And, as a small token of our appreciation, we figured that 
you needed to go home with a little piece of West Texas.
    And, Chairman Duncan, you have been mentioning a cowboy 
hat, and so we have a Leddy's cowboy hat that I would like you 
to take home with you. Most of the time in West Texas, we don't 
wear it indoors. We will give you a second to put it on so that 
you can go home to South Carolina and show off your new cowboy 
hat there.
    Mr. Duncan. Wow.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Wow.
    Mr. Pfluger. Chairwoman Rodgers, we can also do a cowboy 
hat. However, in West Texas, we have worn spurs for a long 
time. And, as a token of our appreciation for your leadership, 
we have a spur pendant that we hope that you will wear with 
pride in Washington and in Washington, DC, and maybe as a piece 
of symbolism to spur along our government to do the right thing 
and put a little bit of reality--some West Texas reality--into 
Washington, DC.
    Mr. Duncan. As long as she doesn't stick the spurs in the 
committee members----
    Mr. Pfluger. I have a feeling that might happen, but that 
is OK. We are good with it if you do.
    Thank you for your leadership, and it is--not everybody can 
see it as much as the cowboy hat.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Here we go. Oh, it is great. Look at this. 
Oh, OK. Here we go. I have some spurs here. Great. All right. 
Great.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mrs. Rodgers. I apologize that I am going to have to sneak 
out now. I have some other commitments I have to get to, 
another plane to catch.
    But, first and foremost, it is great to be here. And so 
pleased that we were able to bring the Energy and Commerce 
Committee to Midland, Texas, for our first field hearing.
    A big thank you to Congressman Pfluger for all his help in 
organizing and putting this all together. But also just know 
you have a great Representative. He is a great voice for you. 
He represents your community, this industry so well--a strong 
defender and promoter of American energy and oil and gas 
production that is driving our leadership on so many different 
fronts.
    So it is great to be here. I look forward to coming back 
again and spending more time with all of you. And just keep up 
the great work. Keep innovating, keep working hard, keep 
leading the way, OK? Good to be with you.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you so much.
    August, I don't know who wears it better, me or John 
Dutton.
    But, anyway, now I will go to Representative Weber for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Weber. Boy, that is a hard act to follow, I will tell 
you.
    But I will tell you this. How many Members in the crowd 
remember who E.F. Hutton was? Some of you all are almost my 
age. When August speaks, he is like E.F. Hutton: We listen. So 
give him a hand, will you?
    [Applause.]
    Mr. Weber. I don't mind telling you that having August for 
a friend gives me status. You know, I had a friend in the fifth 
grade gave me the measles one time, and this is a lot better 
deal. So it is great to be here.
    Mayor, I want to come to you. I didn't get to hear your 
testimony. We were on the second plane. It is exciting what you 
wrote. I have read most of it and tried to listen and pay 
attention to everything going on.
    You actually write in your testimony that you are a 
privately held exploration and production company that operates 
and stewards--you all, don't miss that word--stewards over 300 
wells across 35,000 square miles of West Texas, southeastern 
Mexico.
    I think, for the gentleman from California, our colleague 
across the aisle, I think a lot of times that is missed on some 
people, that some of the original environmentalists were 
farmers and ranchers and people who cared deeply about the land 
and things that have to happen.
    Well, August and I have a great relationship for a number 
of reasons, not the least of which is I am the upper Gulf Coast 
of Texas. I represent from the Louisiana border, that other 
foreign country, right down the Gulf Coast toward Corpus 
Christi. Michael Cloud is below me. I have got the first three 
coastal counties. We produce 65 percent of the Nation's jet 
fuel, 80 percent of the Nation's military grade fuel, almost 
twice the Nation's gas in the eastern Rockies.
    You all punch holes in West Texas out here. Now, I am going 
to put you all on the spot again. How many of you all remember 
The Beverly Hillbillies show? When he says he went out hunting, 
and up through the ground comes some bubbling crude--what did 
they call it?
    Ms. Blong. Black gold.
    Mr. Carrasco. Black gold.
    Mr. Weber. Texas----
    Mr. Carrasco. Texas tea.
    Mr. Weber. Texas tea. There you go. You all remember that. 
You all saw the--you saw the reruns, young lady.
    So you all punch holes out here, and you send it down to 
us. We are the pipeline capital of the world, really, in Texas, 
235,000 miles of pipeline. We produce that oil, gas--the 
gasoline, jet fuel. And I will just go right down the list. So 
August and I really have a great, great, great energy 
connection on what you all do.
    And did I mention that you all are good stewards of what 
you all do? So thank you for that.
    I want to ask a couple of--I want to point out a couple 
things and then ask a couple of questions.
    First, Americans need to understand that not only are we 
good stewards and do we care about our environment, because we 
have got kids to raise--you said you have three. I have got 
three kids and eight grandkids, and our oldest granddaughter is 
22, married 2 years, and I am fixing to be a great grandpa. So 
I am getting old. All that to say I am getting old.
    Americans need to understand that we care just as much 
about our environment and the country as anybody else. And I 
would even argue really, in some fashion, maybe even more 
because we understand what is at stake.
    2013, when I got elected to Congress, Jim Clifton, then the 
CEO of a research committee, Gallup polls, came and spoke to 
us, the Republican freshmen, and he made this comment. He said 
that free enterprise is not a fiscal tool, it is a spirit.
    And I said, ``Wait, wait. What did you say, Mr. Clifton?''
    ``Free enterprise is not a fiscal tool, it is a spirit.''
    And I thought, you know what? He is on it. If you get the 
spirit of free enterprise, you will do it no matter what, and 
you will do it right, and you will do it correctly, because you 
care about those kids and grandkids. You care about this 
country. You run risks. I owned an air conditioning company for 
35 years. I am a small business guy. You invest your capital, 
and you are not guaranteed that you are always going to get a 
return.
    Americans need to understand that energy for us is energy 
dependent--what we are doing, energy independence, it is 
national security. It is energy dominance. It is economic 
security. It is actually geopolitical security, what you all 
do, because when America is strong, the world is a safer place.
    Now, Dr. Zavada, you made a couple of comments in your 
writing too. I had a chance to read through it. You say these 
observed changes have motivated governments, talking about 
climate change, and the people of primarily developed countries 
to seek alternate--alternative energies to ameliorate the 
effects of fossil fuels.
    We love renewables. Renewables are good. But let me just 
say this. You know, we went through Winter Storm Uri 2 years 
ago when Texas was number-one energy State, produced most of 
our energy, 5 percent of solar panels, we found out--we found 
this out. Renewables cannot be the leading actor in this movie. 
They can play a supporting role. Back to John Dutton's--where 
did my John Dutton friend go?
    What you all do is important. I hope you all understand 
that. I hope you understand that we care about our environment. 
Everybody here is a perfect example of industry and the care 
that they have for this country and why I am glad to be here.
    And I will yield back.
    Mr. Curtis [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Weber.
    Chair now turns to Mr. Pfluger.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    First, I would like to thank some people behind the scenes 
before I get into my questions.
    We have a phenomenal team with multiple Midlanders, not 
just here in the Midland office, the Odessa office, but also in 
our DC office. A lot of people put on this hearing today, to 
include my chief, John Byers, Deputy Chief Evan Thomas, Lyssa 
Bell, and Preston Howey, who are Midlanders, Corbette Padilla, 
and Monica Mauldin. They did a great job, and we are thankful. 
Fabulous.
    The title of this hearing is so important. We are in an 
energy expansion. We are in an expansion--not a transition, but 
an expansion. And we have to keep focused on that. And I want 
to talk a little bit about the shale revolution. And this 
revolution has allowed so many people around the world to not 
be impoverished by energy, without energy. But there are still 
many who don't have access to energy. And I don't want to see 
us go down that path here, the path that Western Europe is 
going through right now, where they have made bad choices that 
led to terrible situations. We can't get there.
    When it comes to the reduction of emissions, we have 
reduced CO<INF>2</INF> emissions 30 percent over the last 10 
years, 14 percent on methane. Yes, we will continue to do what 
we can here. And we will work together, but it is innovation 
that makes that happen.
    I have three questions.
    Mr. Carrasco, thank you for your testimony. Thank you for 
your leadership. You have 64 employees. That is amazing. How do 
those families feel--we will do 1 minute each for 3 questions.
    How do those families feel when the President of the United 
States says--and I quote--``I am going to end fossil fuels''? 
How do they feel about the careers they have chosen?
    Mr. Carrasco. Well, I think it brings panic, because, you 
know, how can you say that it is going to be gone in 10 years? 
These are employees that have been with me for well over 10 
years that have benefited from this industry and the innovation 
of this industry and the safety of this industry. So, without a 
doubt, there is panic because, you know, they say, ``What will 
we do after? Where do we go after?''
    So, you know, obviously we need to understand that the oil 
and gas industry are here to stay. And I will tell you--I talk 
about this, about how I get to see it firsthand. I see these 
operators and what they do and how they employ--they help me 
employ people so they can have a quality of life. So I--
sometimes they ask me, ``What is going to happen?''
    Mr. Pfluger. You know, those families aren't just putting 
food on the table. They are adding to our national security. 
They are doing something that no other country in the world has 
done. We have revolutionized the delivery of affordable, 
reliable, secure energy.
    And, Mr. Pruett, we appreciate what you do. But what 
happens to our country--in 1 minute or so--what happens if we 
stay on the path of the policies that we have seen over the 
last 2 years, where we have basically legislated through 
Executive fiat? What happens to our country, to our national 
security vis-a-vis the energy industry?
    Mr. Pruett. Well, the path we are on with China's oil 
consumption recovering, we are going to be short crude. And a 
lot of the experts, including, you know, Scott Sheffield, who 
runs Pioneer, are predicting $150 oil, which won't be good for 
this country or the developing world or our allies. And that is 
not a scenario that I want or our members want.
    And unless we remove the regulatory barriers and the access 
to capital constraints that we face now, we will not be able to 
grow U.S. production enough to meet the growth in worldwide oil 
and gas consumption.
    Mr. Pfluger. We hear this talk about 9,000 permits when we 
know that most wells take up to 50 permits. So how many permits 
do you think we need throughout the United States--maybe it is 
impossible to say.
    Mr. Pruett. Well, it is just--the BLM and the other 
regulatory bodies in States other than Texas are intentionally 
slowing down our activity. Unless you have the easements to lay 
the pipes so you can get product to market, you are not going 
to drill the well. So it is a whole series of permits that have 
to be approved by States like New Mexico and the BLM, and that 
is just not happening. And it is true offshore as well.
    Mr. Pfluger. Well, thank goodness for our Railroad 
Commission. They do a great job of helping us to achieve the 
multiple goals that we have.
    I appreciate my colleague from California. I appreciate 
your comments and wanting to work together, and I think we can 
work together.
    To the mayor, great testimony. Thank you for your 
leadership. I will give you the last 40 seconds here.
    How do we innovate? Is it privately? Is it government, top-
down directed? How do we innovate to achieve not only taking 
care of our world, but making sure people still have 
affordable, reliable energy?
    Ms. Blong. I think the best innovation comes from private 
companies and from the good ideas of people who have boots on 
the ground. I do not believe that the best ideas come from the 
government top-down. But I do think that there are things that 
we can do to facilitate good ideas and to invite more people to 
the table to bring those forward.
    One of the areas that that is taking place is cooperation 
among companies on produced water and solutions for injection 
for SWDs but then, also, how we might be able to recycle that 
water and have beneficial reuse. They are leading the way in 
that, and I am thankful for that.
    Mr. Pfluger. Well, the Permian Basin is the heartbeat of 
this country when it comes to the energy innovation, when it 
comes to taking care and doing better. And I think we can and 
have and we will continue to demonstrate ways to take care of 
this Earth but also ways to make sure that the quality of life 
remains the highest that it has ever been.
    Thank you for coming to the Permian Basin, which is leading 
the world through the shale revolution and through a hundred-
plus years of national security for our country.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Pfluger. And thank you for 
hosting today.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. 
Carter.
    Mr. Carter. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you all for having us here today. And I want to 
echo the comments made about your Representative. August 
Pfluger is a great Representative and is certainly a rising 
star in Congress, and we look forward to his leadership for 
years to come.
    As you heard, I am from Georgia. I guess I am not too 
popular in Texas right now. But, nevertheless----
    Voice. Don't bring it up.
    Mr. Carter. I kept--well, I didn't. I didn't say anything. 
I just, you know----
    Voice. Don't complain.
    Voice. Don't complain.
    Mr. Carter. No. It is--you know, I kept looking for our 
quarterback doing community service on the side of the road, 
but I didn't see him, but nevertheless.
    Anyway, thank you. Thank you for having us here. And thank 
you for the work that you are doing. And I mean that sincerely. 
Look, I am--I have served in the previous session on the Select 
Committee for Climate Change. I am a member of the Conservative 
Climate Caucus. I have the honor and privilege of representing 
the entire coast of Georgia, over a hundred miles of pristine 
coastline.
    The environment matters to me. It is my home. It is where I 
have lived all my life, where I intend to live the rest of my 
life. I want to make sure, just like you do, that we take care 
of our environment. We all understand how important energy 
independence is to our national security.
    Mayor Blong, like you, I was a mayor in another life, and, 
you know, in no small part, the job of a mayor is kind of to be 
a cheerleader. I mean, you are the one who has got to keep 
everybody encouraged and keep things going.
    It must be difficult knowing that this administration, that 
this President, day one--day one, declared war on fossil fuels 
and on fossil energy. And, even in the State of the Union 
address here just last week, when he said that, you know, it 
was only going to be around for the next decade--I mean, it 
must be difficult for you to keep everyone here and those of 
you in business--to keep everyone encouraged that, you know, we 
all know that we in America have not gotten as much credit for 
decreasing carbon emissions that we should.
    The United States of America has decreased carbon emissions 
more in the last decade than the next 12 countries combined--
the next 12 countries combined--while still growing our 
economy. I applaud what you have done in the fossil fuel 
industry. You have done it, but, Mayor, it must be difficult 
for you to keep people encouraged.
    Ms. Blong. I think one of the best things that Midland has 
going for it is public-private partnerships to be able to 
address the needs that we face as a community. We have Pioneer 
Natural Resources that partnered with the city of Midland to 
put in a water reclamation facility to take effluent water from 
the city of Midland and use it for fracking and other things. 
And so we see this partnership, this convening of oil and gas 
companies and the leadership and innovation that they have 
partnering with our municipal needs and our community needs.
    We are seeing that not just with water, but we are seeing 
it with our education system and with so many other things. And 
so I believe that the way forward for us as a community and 
really the way forward for us as a Nation is to listen to the 
creative business minds in our----
    Mr. Carter. Absolutely.
    Ms. Blong [continuing]. Communities, to take a page from 
their book.
    Mr. Carter. And then to hear our President--our President, 
he is my President too--to hear him say that, you know, the 
reason for high gas prices is because the industry has stopped 
pumping oil. You know, why have they stopped investing? Have 
you seen the decrease in investment? Are you worried about 
that? Are you preparing for that? What is the--tell us: What is 
the pulse?
    Ms. Blong. I would say that we have seen a decrease of 
investment. And certainly through those COVID years, it got 
really, really difficult. And Steve Pruett has referenced some 
of that from his own story.
    But I do believe that we are seeing some of that bounce 
back. The other thing that we are seeing locally is local 
investors, people who have made good money in the oil business, 
are investing back into other for-profit efforts here in our 
community. So they are investing in technological advances, in 
fracking and in other things, water issues that I have 
referenced multiple times here. But they are--those dollars are 
coming back into our economy from people who made their money 
here. They are investing back into our community.
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Mr. Pruett, have you seen investment in infrastructure? 
What is your feelings?
    Mr. Pruett. Well, I would echo what Mayor Blong said about 
it is the old style of financing of family offices and 
syndicates, of redeploying money they have made, money in the 
oil business over the decades, and they are putting it back in. 
That is really the best source of capital an entrepreneur has 
right now, is local money, or I call it Texas family office 
moneys.
    So I am seeing some improvement, banking markets starting 
to heal just because the leverage in our sector has come down, 
so we are better credits. So that is encouraging as well.
    So I think the capital--the big issue is just we are 
distributing so much cash to investors now as an industry, and 
that is just----
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Mr. Pruett [continuing]. Something investors have demanded. 
That is not changing.
    Mr. Carter. Well, I am here to encourage you. I am here to 
thank you. I thank you. I thank for the innovation. You have 
cleaned up the industry. You continue to clean it up. You have 
continued to invest in innovation. And thank you for that, and 
thank you for what you do for energy in our country, and God 
bless you.
    Mr. Pruett. Thank you for your service.
    Mr. Carter. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Curtis. The gentleman yields.
    The Chair now recognizes, also from Texas, Mr. Crenshaw.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all for being here. It is great to be in August's 
district. Wonderful, wonderful time in Midland. Been here many 
times. And it is a place like this that keeps America afloat in 
hard times, and that is absolutely true.
    It is probably why J.P.Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, called a 
world without fossil fuels a road to hell, and so I kind of 
want to examine what a road to hell might like look.
    For starters, you essentially lose the ability to heat your 
home or cool your home. That ability, by the way, saves 
millions of lives a year.
    You have to do away with all the things that you need to 
build a modern society: steel, concrete, plastics, all gone. No 
roads, no bridges, no buildings, no hospitals, no cars, no 
military defense, phones, computers, no other modern luxuries: 
all gone without fossil fuels.
    And--oh, yes, fertilizer too. Synthetic fertilizer is one 
of the main reasons we can feed billions more people than we 
ever thought possible, and that is made because of natural gas.
    The recent societal collapse in Sri Lanka might be a great 
example of what happens when radical environmentalists get 
their hands on the reins of policy and insist upon organic-only 
fertilizers. So no air-conditioning, no hospitals, no 
biomedical devices, no cars, no planes, maybe mass starvation. 
That does sound kind of hellish, to be honest.
    It is more than that. I mean, it is the basic things we 
need to stay healthy. It is antihistamines, antibiotics, cough 
syrups, lubricants, creams, ointments, any gels, processed 
plastics which are made for heart valves and other specialized 
medical equipment. Petrochemicals are used in radiological dyes 
and films, intravenous tubing, syringes, oxygen masks.
    We could go on and on and on, but, if you took away 
petrochemicals and then you looked around the room, you would 
watch basically everything disappear. That is pretty amazing. 
And it is places like this that help us maintain the wonderful 
reality that we all live in.
    I am concerned, though, about the investment in this 
important industry. Recently, J.P. Morgan head of oil and gas 
research Christyan Malek said the bank had identified a $600 
billion shortfall of upstream investment needed between now and 
2030 to meet what he called a muted view of global oil demand.
    I am wondering if you all can expand upon that point. We 
will start with you, Mr. Pruett.
    Mr. Pruett. Yes. That is a--I have read that research, 
where the--we are investing 400 billion in oil and gas 
development exploration and development now. We were investing 
over 800 billion. Researchers think we need to invest about a 
trillion a year, which happens to be what is being invested in 
renewables now, which is great.
    But there is an imbalance, and so there is so much capital 
flow to the low-return investments and renewables, which we 
need to do, but there is too much capital flowing there. It 
reminds me of the various oil booms where too much money flowed 
to our industry, and we destroyed value. It is happening in the 
renewables at the expense of the upstream and midstream oil and 
gas development.
    So, unless that rebalances, we will be short oil and 
natural gas in this world within the next 2 years, and it will 
be very economically damaging.
    Mr. Crenshaw. And maybe you could also talk about some of 
the end uses of the products that many of your members pull 
from the ground. You know, maybe expand upon the list--the long 
list that I just gave.
    Mr. Pruett. Well, I don't know that I can. That was 
comprehensive. It is very impressive.
    But, you know, one thing that people miss is the amount of 
petroleum that goes into making a wind turbine or a solar 
panel. There is a massive amount of coal that is used to burn 
the silicon to make a solar panel. The components of a wind 
turbine are resins and petroleum-based products. And the amount 
of mining that goes on, which is all diesel-driven equipment, 
to mine lithium and cobalt for batteries. There is a huge 
supply chain that depends on petroleum to make renewable power 
possible.
    Mr. Crenshaw. And it is a pretty dirty supply chain.
    And, Ms. Blong, I want to come to you on this, because you 
have mentioned that, here in Midland, we produce one of the 
cleanest, most greenest barrels of oil. I am paraphrasing, I 
think, what you said.
    Ms. Blong. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Crenshaw. But, you know, I tend to agree. I have seen 
research that says that American natural gas is 42 percent 
cleaner on a lifecycle basis than, say, Russian natural gas.
    Can you speak to that and how your industry here is cleaner 
than the rest of the world? The point we are making here is 
demand is going to increase around the world no matter what.
    Ms. Blong. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Crenshaw. So somebody has got to produce that. Should 
it be us, or should it be the Saudis?
    Ms. Blong. I think that is an excellent point.
    One of the ways that I think we produce greener and a 
better barrel of oil here is that we are looking for ways to 
capture emissions before we are required to. And we see that as 
destruction of value.
    If we have to vent or flare, we are actually destroying 
value and losing money. And so we need to have access to be 
able to capture that and get it to market.
    We require permits to be able to build the midstream 
pipelines to get that gas to market, and so we need y'all's 
help to get that accomplished.
    Mr. Crenshaw. How much better could we do for the 
environment if we were allowed to build more pipelines more 
quickly?
    Ms. Blong. I think that we could come close to solving some 
of--I don't know if we could permanently solve, but from an oil 
and gas perspective, we could alleviate most of the methane 
concerns for those kinds of emissions if we had access to the 
pipeline permits that we need.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan [presiding]. The Chair will now go to the 
gentleman from Georgia, another Bulldog, Mr. Allen, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Allen. Well, yes. Correction. Well, my mom and dad are 
Bulldogs, and my youngest daughter and my middle daughter went 
to graduate school there, so--but I do know how to go ``woof, 
woof, woof,'' OK? And it has been more fun than that. I went to 
Auburn, and so it has been tough.
    But, anyway, Congressman Pfluger, thank you for all this. 
It is amazing what you have done here for us in the last 2 
days, and the things we have seen have been eye opening. I 
mean, it is just you had to be here to experience this. And it 
is just a privilege for me to be here.
    And, you know, I have been around a while. I spent most of 
my life in the business world creating businesses, growing 
companies, and I know a lot of the challenges out there and 
understand the challenges with the oil and gas industry. I 
served on the Energy Action Team, and we had a lot of the--
mostly independents coming, which is another thing.
    Big Oil doesn't produce the oil in this country. I think it 
is a small percentage of it. It is the independents that are 
producing the oil.
    But a little history on energy. I graduated from Auburn in 
1973, and it was not really a good economy then. And then, 
within a year, the oil embargo hit, and it almost devastated 
our economy. And, I mean, I didn't know if I was going to be 
able to keep my first job.
    And we were only 28 percent dependent on energy in this 
country at that time. And, in fact, our fellow Georgian, who 
Buddy knows very well, Jimmy Carter, was elected President 
because he promised to make this Nation energy independent. He 
created the Department of Energy.
    And then, you know, it didn't take long that, you know, we 
fast forward to 2008, the Great Recession. The administration 
during that--that came into office at that time declared war on 
the coal industry. All this money that my MC spent to clean 
coal to meet the Clean Air Act that was passed by Congress--he 
spent all that money. The rules all changed.
    And so the State of West Virginia--I am not predicting 
anything here, but the State of West Virginia had the tenth-
best economy in the Nation. Today, they are third from last. 
That State has been devastated.
    You know, you cannot--I mean, so what happened is, in 
2016--and the other thing that is great, we have an election 
every 2 years in this country, so we can kind of see where the 
American people sit on these issues. But the bottom line is, in 
2016 we had the majority in the House, we had the majority in 
the Senate, and we had the White House.
    And, under the leadership of Paul Ryan and many of our 
leaders on committees, we went through the Congressional Review 
Act. We unleashed the economy. I had no idea what that would 
do. All I know is I was all in. I was pro-business, and we had 
a pro-business administration.
    I could not believe what I saw. We became not only energy 
independent, we became energy dominant. Do you realize how much 
power that is? We were setting the price of a barrel of oil. 
There was unprecedented world peace.
    And so, you know--so what we get to then--of course, then 
COVID hits, and, you know, we have--you know, we got a major 
reset, and it was a big problem.
    Mr. Pruett, you started your own business, and, you know, 
like I said, we have an election every 2 years. Election every 
2 years. If we get a pro-business administration in this next 
term, how long would it take you to get back to where you and 
all of your members to get back to where we were just 3 years 
ago?
    Mr. Pruett. It is probably about 2 years. So, when I make 
the decision and my board approves a budget, it takes about a 
year to contract the rig, get all the permits, and that is in 
Texas. That is the fastest cycle time anywhere. But it is a 2-
year timeframe to really get the machine turning, and then 
there is a lag on getting all that production to market.
    But it can be done. But we need the White House. Without 
the White House running this, we are----
    Mr. Allen. Right. Right. Well, one of the things I realized 
in business, too, is our whole economy is based on confidence. 
I mean, we are 70 percent----
    Mr. Pruett. That is right.
    Mr. Allen [continuing]. Consumer economy. And, if consumers 
aren't happy--and they are not happy right now. You know, this 
war on fossil fuel has created the inflation issue in our 
country. I mean, bar none. I mean, every--this coat has oil in 
it, OK? It affects everything in our economy.
    And I experienced that in construction. Construction costs 
have skyrocketed because of the price of a barrel of oil. And I 
do know, like--I am out of time, but I do know how it was back 
during COVID. I mean, you guys were calling because we had a 
war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and oil was $7 a barrel, 
and I had a lot of friends in your business that called me and 
said, ``We have got to get the price up to at least market,'' 
you know, ``We are going broke here.''
    So--but, anyway, thank you for hanging in there. Keep the 
faith.
    Mr. Pruett. Thank you.
    Mr. Allen. And I think the American people are going to 
wake up.
    Mr. Pruett. Appreciate it.
    Mr. Duncan. Chair will now recognize Ms. Miller-Meeks for 5 
minutes.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Is it on?
    Mr. Duncan. Should be.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. All right. Well, thank you very much. I 
thank Energy and Commerce Committee for having this hearing.
    And, while in Texas, if you are around Representative 
Pfluger and Representative Weber and Representative Burgess and 
Representative Crenshaw, you hear a lot and have had the 
pleasure of hearing how everything is bigger and better in 
Texas in every way that you can imagine.
    However, let me say that I grew up in Texas around San 
Antonio, started at San Antonio Junior College at 16, enlisted 
in San Antonio, have all my education from San Antonio. But I 
realized I was threatening the reputation of Texas that it is 
bigger, and so I went to a smaller State.
    In the spirit of qualifying the States we represent, 
Representative Peters mentioned solar in California, and 
McMorris Rodgers mentioned hydropower. So I just want to take 
the opportunity to say that that smaller State that I moved to, 
Iowa, has 50 percent of its energy from renewables, and we are 
an energy exporter, so Iowa is an energy State along with 
Texas.
    But, also, that Iowa has 50 percent of its energy--over 50 
percent electricity is generated from wind power, 
Representative Pfluger, but I will give Texas credit, because 
overall does produce the most wind power of all States. It is 
also the top crude oil and natural-gas-producing State in the 
Nation. And we have learned how important that production is to 
both the State and to Midland in particular.
    And, as States increasingly depend on nondispatchable 
resources, such as wind, we need strong natural gas supply and 
deliverability.
    Why? For 2021, the U.S. Energy Information Administration 
reported that total U.S. primary energy consumption was equal 
to--anybody have a guesstimate? Ninety-seven quadrillion Btus. 
And how much of that was from renewables, such as wind and 
solar? Twelve point five percent. How much from natural gas? 
Thirty-two percent.
    And we know, having gone to both COP26 and COP27, everyone 
around the globe acknowledges that energy demand--global energy 
demand is increasing, despite advances in energy efficiency.
    Mr. Zavada, you mentioned health risks associated with the 
oil and gas operations and also from climate change. But are 
you aware how many people perish from cold or heat exposure 
each year?
    Dr. Zavada. Not offhand, no.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Lancet and Wall Street Journal articles 
in 2021 indicated exposure to hot or cold temperatures is 
associated with over 5 million--5 million premature deaths 
globally each year. Heat deaths account for 1 percent of global 
fatalities, about 600,000, but cold kills 8 times as many 
people, 4.5 million annually.
    A study by the National Bureau on Economic Research in 
March of 2019 estimates that, by driving down natural gas 
prices, not only did that help Midland, but by driving down 
natural gas prices, the fracking revolution saved more than 
11,000 American lives annually from 2010. Eleven thousand lives 
saved by what you do here in Midland, Texas.
    The best way to protect people from heat and cold excess 
mortality deaths is access to plentiful, cheap energy. And that 
often means carbon-based fuels.
    Mr. Pruett, can you speak to how a strong oil and gas 
industry is necessary to support other sources of energy, 
including Texas and Iowa wind?
    Mr. Pruett. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, the components of 
the renewable machines, whether it is the massive wind turbines 
that you have all seen that populate west Texas and the 
panhandle or solar panels or the wires that are built to 
transmit remote renewables to consuming markets like the San 
Antonio area, where you hail from, or from the panhandle to 
DFW, petroleum is critical in all of that.
    And, without--this idea that the world can survive on 
renewables without petroleum is just unrealistic, as Dr. Zavada 
said, because of the components that go to make it and the 
enabling of those--the construction of and the management 
operation of renewables is tied to petroleum. And the density 
of it and the use of petroleum in transportation fuels also 
cannot be ignored.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you.
    And will you discuss the topic of Federal permitting 
reform? For me, both permitting reform for oil and gas projects 
and permitting reform for transmission come to mind, and we 
must find a better balance between energy project development 
and environmental goals. And I think that we can do both of 
those. Not lessen environmental standards but provide greater 
certainty and predictability to permitting efforts.
    Because my time is running out, Mr. Chair, I would ask--the 
question I want to ask of our panel is if they can speak to the 
challenges that exploration and production companies have faced 
with respect to permitting and what reforms may be helpful at 
the Federal level.
    If they could submit that in writing, and then I will yield 
my time.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes. So we will talk about the ability to have 
questions inserted in the record and answered at the end.
    I will now go to the birthday girl, who turned a year older 
today, Mrs. Cammack from Florida.
    Happy birthday, and you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Cammack. Thank you.
    Well, I can't think of a better place to spend my birthday 
than Midland, Texas. I love it.
    No. Thank you. And thank you for everybody for showing up 
today. I thank you to all my colleagues, everybody, and the 
witnesses for appearing before us.
    And, as the lone Representative from Florida and the Gator 
Nation, Dan, hell is listening to Buddy Carter talk about 
another national championship. That is hell.
    We are going to get you, though, for Texas. Welcome to the 
SEC.
    Thank you to my friend, August, and fellow congressional 
baseball teammate. I am not sure if you all know, he was our 
MVP last year. I trucked a guy at home plate, and you still got 
MVP. I don't know how that happened.
    But, in addition to having great States, Texas and Florida, 
great constituents, wonderful industries, we also share 
something else in common. We are both taking all of 
Representative Peters' constituents from California. No. 
Seriously, thank you for being here. It does. It means a lot. 
Seriously, we do appreciate you being here.
    And, you know, a couple of weeks----
    Mr. Peters. Careful. You know how they vote.
    Mrs. Cammack. I think we are getting the good ones.
    Mr. Allen. That is great.
    Mrs. Cammack. See, the people have personalities in 
Washington. We all aren't like doorknobs.
    So a couple of weeks ago, Chairwoman Rodgers, she hosted a 
full committee hearing on energy dominance and concerns within 
the industry. And one of the things that stood out that--was 
that every single one of the witnesses, Republicans and 
Democrats, were in favor of domestic production. And we 
recognized that as Americans we can do it better, cheaper, 
safer, efficiently, and cleaner than anywhere else in the 
world. That is an American idea, not a partisan one.
    Something else that stood out was the recognition that we 
are an energy economy, and it is not only the thing that powers 
our everyday lives, from our schools, for our businesses and 
everything in between, but our domestic energy economy is the 
foundation for the American dream.
    One of our witnesses, Ms. Donna Jackson, she made a comment 
that really stuck with me. She said that because of high energy 
costs at home, when they turn on the lights, when they fill up 
at the gas station, and basically everything else, that folks 
weren't living paycheck to paycheck anymore. They were living 
paycheck to Wednesday and borrowing the rest to get by.
    That really stuck with me as somebody who was raised by a 
single mom on a cattle ranch. My family, we were commercial 
sandblasters. And I just--I had never heard anyone say anything 
beyond paycheck to paycheck, because I know what it is like to 
live paycheck to paycheck. Heck, I remember what it was like 
filling up my gas tank when I was homeless with pocket change. 
That really stuck with me, the impacts that the regulatory 
regime has had in the last 2 years on our producers.
    And so I think it is incumbent upon us here today, as 
representatives of the people's House, that we do the most 
important thing, which is get the hell out of your way. We need 
to get government out of the way, because I believe that our 
producers can do it better than anywhere else. And so, that is 
going to be our goal, is to help get out of the way.
    Now maybe because it is my birthday, maybe it is because I 
am sleep-deprived, I am feeling a little froggy, but I'm going 
to ask my first question to you, Madam Mayor.
    The Department of Energy is proposing new energy 
conservation standards for new household gas and electric 
cooking devices. This move comes shortly after the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission suggested that they should ban gas 
stoves under the pretext of reducing indoor air pollution.
    Now, I personally see this as President Biden's rush-to-
green agenda to phase out oil and gas and electrify everything.
    Should gas stoves be phased out, and how this will impact 
costs to consumers?
    Ms. Blong. Absolutely they should not be phased out, if 
only for the fact that they cook better. As a person who loves 
to cook, that--I prefer to cook on a gas stove.
    No, I think that this is something that is a little bit of 
posturing on their part. I don't believe that it is a needle 
mover in terms of consumption in our Nation. And so I think 
that it is posturing, but I do believe that it is symptomatic 
of the lack of understanding of how energy actually works and 
how our grid works in----
    Mrs. Cammack. Exactly.
    Ms. Blong [continuing]. In the United States.
    Mrs. Cammack. My husband, who is the avid chef in our 
family, when he cooks at the firehouse, he loves a good gas 
stove. So this really got him riled up.
    Mr. Burns. Yes.
    Mrs. Cammack. But I will move on because I only have 22 
seconds.
    I am the author of the REINS Act, which would rein in the 
regulatory environment across the board. Any major rule or 
regulations that had a $100 million impact or more would come 
back to Congress for an up-or-down vote.
    Mr. Pruett, I have got 7 seconds. Give me the number-one 
regulations that you want taken off the books.
    Mr. Pruett. NEPA.
    Mrs. Cammack. Easy. Done.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Awesome. The gentlelady's time is expired.
    She yields back.
    Mr. Duncan. I gave you 8 seconds because it is your 
birthday.
    Mrs. Cammack. Just 8?
    Mr. Duncan. First off, I want to thank all the witnesses 
and panelists. You-all have done a great job, and thanks for 
taking time to be here for this field hearing.
    Seeing there's no further Members wishing to ask questions, 
we will wrap this up.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Chairman?
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Pfluger. I have three thank-yous: Number one, to my 
legislative energy director, Clara Cargile, for putting a 
phenomenal hearing on from our standpoint; number two, to our 
witnesses, as you just mentioned; number three, to all of the 
oil and gas workers, industry professionals, and residents of 
the Permian Basin who are in the audience today for what they 
do.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you.
    Go to Mr. Peters for just a second.
    Mr. Peters. I want to say thanks to Midland for hosting us.
    I am not from a State that is much of a producer. I just 
want you to know that I am committed to taking a trip to Texas 
whenever I can to learn about this. I think we have to work 
together. For us to work together effectively, we have to 
understand it. So you have my commitment that I will keep 
trying to work with you.
    And I would just also just remember that when some of the 
times when--sometimes when people say something into a 
microphone in a political context that are ridiculous, they are 
ridiculous.
    And you know I thought that the testimony from the 
gentleman here, the professor, that oil and gas is going to be 
around at least 50 years is more along the lines of reality. I 
think we should just keep that in mind as the heat of politics 
plays out and that I am very well aware that oil and gas is 
going to be with us for a long time. I just hope we can make it 
clean and as part of a larger suite of all-of-the-above energy, 
which is what my colleagues talked about as well.
    So, again, thanks to Midland for hosting us and thanks to 
Chairman Duncan and chairman of the committee Rodgers for 
bringing us out.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, appreciate that. I thank the Democrats as 
well.
    Just some last comments. I ask unanimous consent to insert 
into the record documents included on the staff hearing 
documents list.
    Without objection, that will be ordered.
    Pursuant to committee rules, I remind Members they have 10 
business days to submit additional questions for the record.
    And I ask witnesses to submit their response within 10 
business days upon receipt of the questions.
    Without objection, the subcommittee is adjourned.
    And God bless Texas.
    [Whereupon, at 2:56 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
    [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
