                        WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,

               ENHANCING AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH

                   THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

                          FINANCE CORPORATION

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHRISTOPHER A. COONS

    Senator Coons. This Hearing of the Subcommittee on State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the United States 
Senate Appropriations Committee will come to order.
    Mr. Nathan, we are grateful that you are joining us today. 
We will have one witness today, Scott Nathan, CEO of the 
Development Finance Corporation.
    I will make some brief opening remarks. I believe my 
Ranking Member will join us by then, but if not we will then 
proceed with your opening testimony, and then proceed to a 
round of questions of the Members of the subcommittee.
    We meet in a moment when, nationally, we are facing the 
challenge of: How do we sustain American competitiveness, how 
do we strengthen our place in the world, and how do we respond 
to recovery from the pandemic, to economic growth opportunities 
all across the world, and how do we sharpen and modernize 
America's development tools?
    This hearing is an opportunity to review the successes, 
challenges, and lessons learned for the Development Finance 
Corporation, and to discuss ways we can help strengthen the 
DFC's implementation of its mandate.
    I have also invited the DFC Inspector General to submit 
testimony, which I will review and will be included in the 
hearing record.
    Some of our colleagues have scheduling conflicts, but I 
thought it was critical we hold this hearing today as we are 
working on drafting Appropriations bills, and other critically 
relevant legislation for the Development Finance Corporation.
    First, a quick word on the House Appropriations Committee 
allocations which concern many of us given the proposed deep 
cuts across agencies, including those funded by this 
subcommittee. I have worked with Chair Granger in the past, and 
I am looking forward to working with Chair Diaz-Balart in his 
new role as the House SFOPS Chair. They are serious 
appropriators and we share many priorities. We don't yet have 
the full picture of the resources or legislative provisions 
that may be included in the House SFOPS Bill, but we do know 
the initial allocations include deep cuts, a cut of about 33 
percent to the SFOPS allocation.
    The consequences of that I think would be grave. Under-
investing in our global, diplomatic, and development 
professional workforce. Failing to pay our treaty dues on time. 
Failing to provide credible alternatives to countries seeking 
development finance, investment, and infrastructure, and 
modernization. Stepping back from our global leadership in 
confronting Russian aggression, countering PRC economic 
coercion, and addressing, truly, global threats to stability, 
like terrorism, corruption, and climate change.
    I don't think we can compete globally and do our job by the 
American people by slashing funding and turning inward, this 
will make for a particularly challenging and engaging 
Appropriations process between the House and the Senate.
    Moving on to today's topic. The DFC was established through 
strong bipartisan support for modernizing U.S. foreign 
assistance. It was broadly recognized at the time many of us 
worked on the BUILD Act, that by expanding the tools we have 
for leveraging private-sector capital, we could achieve a 
greater impact on development, and advance our broader foreign 
policy objectives.
    We also thought it was important to provide more 
opportunities for higher quality investment so that partner 
countries would not be susceptible to relying on coercive 
lending from other countries, principally the PRC, which across 
dozens of countries, has too often been the only choice in 
emerging markets for rapid financing or access to large 
infrastructure investments.
    I am optimistic about the DFC's trajectory in seeking to 
meet these objectives as you approach your fifth year in 2024. 
Over the relatively brief time that the DFC has been 
operational with its current authorities, and mission, and 
mandate, including under two administrations with some 
significant differences in the administration's priorities, I 
have been impressed with the DFC's progress in using the new 
tools provided by Congress.
    Fiscal year 2022 set a record for DFC investment, with over 
$7 billion committed to offer values-driven and high quality 
alternatives, and to drive investment in economic growth and 
development where it is most needed in the world.
    And what matters more than the dollars are the projects 
themselves. You have worked to ensure that there is a critical 
investment in energy transitions, in critical mineral supply 
chains, tackling food insecurity, facilitating responses to the 
COVID-19 pandemic globally by making available vaccines and 
investing in vaccine production, increasing capital access in 
countries plagued by economic crisis like Sri Lanka and in 
Ukraine, where Russia's War has had a devastating impact on its 
economy. There are so many more, and we look forward to hearing 
from you about them.
    To be clear, I didn't play a role in creating the DFC 
imagining it would be a panacea to all of our global 
challenges, I have no illusions about the complexity of your 
work, but we look forward to working with you to take the next 
steps required to strengthen the DFC.
    I do hope to hear from you about planned internal 
reorganization, and how you are working to strengthen the 
overall strategic direction of the Corporation, and 
communicating your priorities, and your response to those who 
feel the DFC has been too slow to engage in either critical 
sectors, or regions, including, in particular, the Indo-
Pacific.
    I look forward to getting your perspective on some of the 
specific legislative reforms that I am pursuing with 
colleagues, such as ensuring you can fully leverage your equity 
investments as Congress intended and, potentially, expanding 
country eligibility.
    So Mr. Nathan, thank you for joining us. We have a great 
deal to discuss. I am not anticipating the imminent arrival of 
my Ranking Member, and so let me briefly introduce you to the 
other Member of the subcommittees who is with us.
    Scott Nathan you are someone who has served in public life 
for quite a period of time, educated at Harvard and Harvard Law 
School. We most recently met when you were working for the 
White House Office Presidential Personnel, helping manage the 
transition adroitly. I very much look forward to your 
testimony.
    And welcome the Members of the Committee who have joined 
us.
    Mr. Nathan, if you would address the subcommittee. Thank 
you.

STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT NATHAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
            OFFICER, UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL 
            DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you very much, Chairman Coons, Ranking 
Member Graham, and Members of the Committee, thank you for 
having me here today.
    I want to start by thanking Congress, and especially this 
Committee, for its continued support of DFC. You have helped 
strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission, drive positive 
development impact, and advance the foreign policy interests of 
the United States.
    I am proud of the progress DFC has made in increasing its 
investments and impact, both developmental and strategic.
    Last year, DFC committed over $7.4 billion through 183 
transactions in 111 countries. That was a great result, but DFC 
can drive even greater impact as we build our capacity, execute 
on our strategy, and work more effectively with our partners.
    For fiscal year 2024, the Administration requests a budget 
of $1.023 billion for DFC, a 2.3 percent increase over last 
year's request. Included in that total is $780 million in 
program funds, unchanged from last year, and $243 million in 
administrative expenses, an increase of $23 million. The 
requested increase in administrative resources will allow DFC 
to meet critical staffing needs, bolster business development 
efforts, and increase our overseas engagement.
    DFC is also working to be more proactive across our 
operations, refocusing our efforts on our highest priority 
sectors where there are enduring needs: infrastructure, energy, 
health, and agriculture, and small business support.
    DFC focuses on working with the private sector because 
closing the $40 trillion global infrastructure financing gap is 
beyond the capacity of any single development finance 
institution or single state actor.
    The PRC focuses on lending at the sovereign level, 
frequently burdening communities with projects that are 
overpriced, poor quality, and unsuitable to local conditions. 
This often saddles developing countries with too much debt and 
disappointing results.
    DFC offers a choice. Our investments carry our values of 
openness, respect for local laws and conditions, and high 
environmental, labor, and quality standards. DFC's work 
enhances the long-term sustainability of our projects, 
amplifies development impact, and guards against the danger 
that projects will harm local populations.
    DFC is committed to making high-quality investments in 
seaports, airports, railways, and road networks that connect 
communities to the opportunities of a global marketplace.
    For example, earlier this year DFC invested $150 million in 
the expansion of the Yilport Terminal in Ecuador, and earlier 
this month, DFC's Board approved a loan that supports the 
expansion and modernization of an airport in Sierra Leone, 
providing one of the world's poorest countries stronger 
connections to its region and to the world.
    At the same time, DFC is also investing to strengthen 21st 
century infrastructure, working with the private sector to 
bolster digital connections, and networks that are secure, 
safe, and open.
    In Ghana, South Africa, and Kenya, DFC is investing with 
Africa Data Centres, a company investing in information 
technology infrastructure. And in the Indo-Pacific region, DFC 
worked with our Australian and Japanese counterparts to support 
Telstra's acquisition of cellular and digital networks in Papua 
New Guinea, and five other Pacific Island nations.
    DFC is also investing to secure supply chains for critical 
minerals. As you know, the PRC has made it a priority to 
attempt to control these supply chains, from mining to 
processing. With an additional $30 million equity investment 
into TechMet Limited, a U.S.-aligned critical minerals 
platform, DFC is helping to secure access to nickel and cobalt 
through an innovative project in Brazil. I am optimistic that 
our relationship with TechMet will lead to many additional 
opportunities.
    DFC is focused on providing affordable, reliable, and 
sustainable access to energy, a critical factor in development 
and economic security.
    In India, DFC is pursuing several transactions that will 
diversify the solar manufacturing supply chain away from PRC 
dominance. Last year, DFC provided $500 million in debt 
financing to First Solar for construction of a new plant.
    Across a range of technologies, DFC is working to provide 
reliable access to power for communities in countries ranging 
from Sierra Leone, and Malawi, to Nigeria, and Ecuador. We are 
pursuing new opportunities in nuclear energy, e-mobility 
businesses, and the supply chains that support them.
    In response to Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, DFC is 
also helping to drive greater diversity and resilience in 
energy supply in Central Europe and the Caucasus. In Bulgaria, 
Georgia, Moldova, and Poland, DFC has projects that will help 
diversify power supplies away from Russian gas and stabilize 
electricity grids.
    Russia's war against Ukraine has also endangered food 
security around the globe, and in response, last year DFC 
surged efforts in the food and agriculture sector.
    Investments in resilient health care systems provide a 
necessary foundation for the development of a vibrant private 
sector, and help prepare for future health crises. For example, 
in Vietnam, DFC is investing to help expand access to clinics 
and pharmaceutical products in rural areas.
    DFC is also committed to providing support for the small 
businesses that are the engines of so many economies. We have 
recently made investments focused on expanding access to 
capital for SMEs in Egypt, El Salvador, Honduras, Jordan, 
Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, amongst many others. And none 
of these deals are easy, but all of these countries and 
investments are strategically important to the United States.
    DFC has a unique complement of products and tools that can 
help drive the private sector investment to make development 
impact. However, current budgetary rules for equity scoring 
prevent DFC from taking full advantage of this important tool 
that Congress gave us in the BUILD Act. I imagine we will 
address this further during the questions. I want DFC to be 
strategic and focused where we make investments, and to be held 
accountable for our performance.
    The Administration's funding request allows us to build our 
workforce, grow our capacity, and align our organizational 
structure to drive greater impact.
    Thank you for your support which makes this work possible; 
and for your continued commitment to helping DFC achieve even 
more.
    I look forward to continuing to work with this Committee. 
And I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.

    [The statement follows:]
                 Prepared Statement of Scott A. Nathan
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for having me here today to discuss the 
Administration's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request for the U.S. 
International Development Finance Corporation.
    I want to thank Congress and especially this committee for its 
continued support of DFC. The resources and tools you provided DFC have 
helped to strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission, drive positive 
development impact, and advance the foreign policy interests of the 
United States.
    I am proud of the progress DFC has made in increasing its 
investments and impact, both developmental and strategic. In Fiscal 
Year 2022 alone, DFC committed over $7.4 billion through 183 
transactions, in 111 countries. This was a great result, but I know we 
can do more. DFC can drive even greater impact as we build our 
capacity, execute on our strategy, and work more effectively with our 
U.S. government partners and partners around the world.
    For FY 2024, the Administration requests a budget of $1.023 billion 
for DFC, a 2.3 percent increase over its FY 2023 request. Included in 
that total is $780 million in program funds, unchanged from our FY 2023 
request, and $243 million in administrative expenses, an increase of 
$23 million over the FY 2023 request.
    In response to what we've heard from our team, from clients, and 
from you, DFC is in the process of building our overall capacity to do 
more and do it faster. The requested increase in administrative 
resources will allow DFC to meet critical staffing needs, bolster 
business development efforts, and increase our overseas engagement.
    DFC is also working to be more proactive across our operations, 
refocusing efforts on our highest priority sectors where there are 
enduring needs: infrastructure, energy, health, food and agriculture, 
and small business support.
    DFC focuses on working with the private sector because closing the 
$40 trillion global infrastructure financing gap is beyond the capacity 
of any development finance institution or state actor to address alone. 
The People's Republic of China (PRC) focuses on lending at the 
sovereign level and often uses the demand for infrastructure investment 
for its purposes, frequently burdening communities with projects that 
are over-priced, poor quality, and unsuitable to local conditions. This 
often saddles developing countries with too much debt and disappointing 
results.
    DFC offers a choice. Our investments carry U.S. values of openness, 
respect for local laws and conditions, and high environmental, labor, 
and quality standards. DFC's work enhances the long-term sustainability 
of our projects, amplifies development impact, and guards against the 
danger that projects will harm local populations. Supporting high 
quality, sustainable projects has been a focus for DFC from the 
beginning, and we have continued to enhance our capacity to monitor and 
measure our impact.
    DFC is committed to making investments in seaports, airports, 
railways and road networks that connect communities to the 
opportunities of a global marketplace. For example, earlier this year 
DFC invested in the expansion of the Yilport Terminal in Puerto 
Bolivar, Ecuador, which after its modernization, will become one of the 
most advanced facilities of its kind on South America's Pacific Coast. 
And earlier this month, DFC's Board approved a loan that supports the 
expansion and modernization of an airport in Sierra Leone, providing 
one of the world's poorest countries stronger connections within West 
Africa, a region where populations and markets are rapidly growing.
    At the same time, DFC is also investing to strengthen 21st century 
infrastructure, working with the private sector to bolster digital 
connections and networks that are secure, safe, and open. In Ghana, 
South Africa, and Kenya, DFC is investing with Africa Data Centres in 
information technology infrastructure to help make these countries more 
attractive destinations for data-driven companies looking for a 
foothold in growing markets. And in the Indo-Pacific region, DFC worked 
with our Australian and Japanese counterparts to support Telstra in 
making an acquisition that allowed the company to provide secure, high 
quality mobile services to Papua New Guinea and several Pacific 
Islands.
    DFC is also investing to secure supply chains for critical 
minerals. As you know, the PRC has long made it a priority to attempt 
to control these supply chains, from mining to processing and 
manufacturing. With a $30 million equity investment into TechMet 
Limited, a U.S.-aligned critical minerals platform that DFC had 
previously supported, DFC is helping to secure access to nickel and 
cobalt through an innovative project in Brazil. I'm optimistic that our 
relationship with TechMet will lead to many additional opportunities. 
We are committed to pursuing additional projects that help diversify 
the supply and sourcing of these and other strategic resources 
important to the economic growth and national security of the United 
States.
    DFC is also focused on providing affordable, reliable and 
sustainable access to energy, a critical factor in development and 
economic security. In India, DFC is pursuing several transactions that 
can diversify the solar manufacturing supply chain away from PRC 
dominance. Last year DFC provided $500 million in debt financing to 
First Solar for construction of a new plant, which goes online in Tamil 
Nadu later this year. Additionally, the DFC Board approved financing 
last week for the development of Ecuador's first private sector owned, 
on-grid solar power plant. Supported by a $144 million DFC loan, this 
power plant will be the lowest cost electricity provider in all of 
Ecuador.
    Across a range of technologies, DFC is working to provide reliable 
access to power for communities that have never had it in countries 
ranging from Sierra Leone to Malawi to Nigeria. While we are working 
with developers to find more power projects in every region of the 
world, we are also pursuing new opportunities in nuclear energy and e-
mobility businesses and the supply chains that support them.
    In response to Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, and in keeping 
with the authorities provided to DFC under the European Energy Security 
and Diversification Act (EESDA), DFC is also helping to drive greater 
diversity and resilience in energy supply in Central and Eastern Europe 
and the Caucasus. In Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, and Poland, DFC has 
projects that will help diversify power supplies away from Russian gas 
and stabilize electricity grids.
    Russia's war against Ukraine has also put other critical supply 
chains at risk, and endangered food security for communities beyond the 
region. To respond to this potential crisis, DFC surged efforts in the 
food and agriculture sector, doubling the number of transactions to 
support food security in FY 2022, and we continue to actively look for 
more viable projects to support. We are committed for the long term to 
working with the private sector to improve agricultural yields, 
increase incomes for smallholder farmers, and foster innovation in food 
distribution networks. From Guatemala to Ghana, DFC is investing to 
help bring more produce to market and bolster food security for remote 
populations. And we want to do more of this critical work.
    Investments in resilient health systems, not unlike investments in 
food security, represent a commitment to the well-being of people and 
the stability of communities, providing a necessary foundation for the 
development of a vibrant private sector. The COVID-19 pandemic helped 
to underscore the need for these investments, particularly improvements 
to healthcare supply chains, which DFC is working with the private 
sector to address.
    In places like Vietnam, DFC is investing to help expand access to 
clinics and pharmaceutical products in rural areas. In Brazil, a DFC 
loan is helping to modernize a women's health diagnostic center and 
supporting its expansion into areas with minimal access to medical 
care. In India, we finance a chain of eye care clinics and are 
supporting a local company that provides much needed sanitary products 
for women, both with huge development impact. And across sub-Saharan 
Africa, DFC's investments are improving access to quality care, 
including through the provision of digital healthcare solutions.
    DFC is also committed to providing support for the small businesses 
that are the engines of so many dynamic economies. Our investments in 
the third quarter of this year alone demonstrate what an important 
priority this line of effort is to the organization. From a $476 
million guaranty that will provide working capital for thousands of 
Brazilian SMEs in an underbanked part of the economy, to support for 
women entrepreneurs in Honduras and small businesses in El Salvador 
addressing climate impacts, DFC is working to provide individuals the 
financial support they need to create jobs and opportunities in their 
communities. Since FY 2021, DFC has provided over $430 million in loans 
and loan portfolio guarantees to support small businesses and 
underserved populations in sub-Saharan Africa, a chronically under 
financed region. We have recently done investments in Egypt, Jordan, 
Mexico, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, and Vietnam and we will continue to scour 
the world in search of opportunities to invest in the small businesses 
that are the backbone of free enterprise.
    Small business support is one critical area where DFC's close 
partnership with USAID is helping to deliver opportunity in communities 
across the world. Because of transactions sourced jointly by DFC and 
DFC Liaisons at USAID, small business owners and smallholder farmers in 
the DRC have financing they need; entrepreneurs in Burkina Faso, Mali, 
and Guinea, and Sierra Leone are creating hundreds of jobs, and in 
Ukraine, Bank Lviv is able to provide loans that are a lifeline to 
small businesses that can continue operating during a difficult time of 
war. DFC's Mission Transaction Unit (MTU) has worked closely with USAID 
to identify communities where DFC can address a lack of financing 
through support for local institutions, with DFC/MTU helping to close 
more than $900 million in USAID sponsored commitments.
    DFC is also committed to driving impacts that cut across the 
priority sectors we have identified and using our tools to advance 
innovative transactions. For instance, DFC recently provided $656 
million in political risk insurance to support the largest debt for 
nature swap in history. This ground-breaking transaction helps to 
preserve the diverse ecosystem of the Galapagos, and protect it from 
illegal fishing, while at the same time significantly reducing 
Ecuador's sovereign debt.
    None of these deals are easy, but all of these countries and 
investments are strategically significant to the United States. DFC has 
a unique complement of products and tools that can help us drive 
private sector investment and development impact. However, current 
budgetary rules for equity scoring prevent DFC from taking full 
advantage of this important tool Congress gave us in the BUILD Act.
    One avenue for boosting DFC's equity investments is through a $2 
billion revolving fund that is included as part of the President's Out 
Compete China Proposal. I look forward to continued discussions with 
you on how DFC can make more robust use of our equity tool and the 
potential for changes to provide DFC working capital authority, 
allowing us the ability to use the fees we collect from private parties 
to share costs for due diligence with potential partners seeking 
investment.
    I want DFC to be strategic and focused in where we make investments 
and to be held accountable for our performance. The Administration's 
Funding request for DFC in FY 2024 allows us to build our workforce, 
grow our capacity, and align our organizational structure to drive 
greater impact across a number of strategically important sectors.
    In DFC's short history, we have made great progress. Funding for 
this request will support DFC's efforts to further unlock the power of 
private capital to create opportunity, alleviate poverty, and improve 
lives in communities across the world.
    Thank you for the support which makes this work possible and for 
your continued commitment to helping DFC achieve even more. I look 
forward to continuing to work with this Committee and welcome your 
questions.

                                 ______
                                 
 Prepared Statement of Anthony ``Tony'' Zakel, Inspector General, U.S. 
   International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector 
                                General
    Chairman Coons and Ranking Member Graham, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to provide 
written testimony for the record to discuss the U.S. International 
Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Office of Inspector General's 
(OIG) oversight work related to DFC.
                             about dfc oig
    DFC OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and deter fraud, waste, 
and abuse by conducting and supervising audits and investigations of 
DFC's programs and operations worldwide. Congress established DFC OIG 
in the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) 
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-254). Like other Offices of Inspector 
General, DFC OIG gets its authority from the Inspector General Act of 
1978, as amended (IG Act). I was appointed as DFC's first Inspector 
General in August 2020 and report directly to the DFC Board of 
Directors and Congress. DFC OIG is a lean office with 11 FTEs and a 
$5.5 million budget in FY 2023. However, we are tasked with overseeing 
a growing agency whose budget has increased to $1 billion, staff has 
grown to 513 employees, and has increased the number of new projects by 
about 132% between FY 2020 and FY 2022.
    DFC's development portfolio has reached almost $40 billion\1\ and 
is expected to grow in the coming years, especially in economies that 
may not have adequate safeguards to address fraud and corruption. DFC 
products include debt financing, equity investments, feasibility 
studies, investments funds, political risk insurance, and technical 
assistance.\2\ These products are essential to supporting key sectors, 
such as small business, energy, water, infrastructure, agriculture, and 
health, which improve the quality of life for millions and lay the 
groundwork for creating modern economies and providing financing for 
women or other borrowers who do not have sufficient access to 
commercial financing.
    DFC needs an effective OIG to safeguard American taxpayer dollars 
as DFC fulfills its dual mission to partner with the private sector to 
finance solutions to the most critical challenges facing the developing 
world today, while also advancing U.S. foreign policy priorities.
                              work to date
    In the last year, DFC OIG completed all four of its congressionally 
mandated audits, one performance audit, and eight investigations, four 
of which were referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 
prosecution. Some of our audit and investigative work is highlighted 
below and additional details can be found in our Spring FY 2023 
Semiannual Report to Congress and Fall FY 2022 Semiannual Report to 
Congress. Our semiannual reports to Congress, as well as our audit 
reports, Top Management Challenges Facing DFC,\3\ and other public 
documents and correspondence can be found on our external website, 
www.dfc.gov/oig.
                                 audits
    The Office of Audits conducts a variety of independent, statutorily 
mandated and discretionary performance audits assessing controls of DFC 
programs and operations to detect and deter waste and mismanagement. 
Mandatory audit work includes Financial Statements, Federal Information 
Security Modernization Act (FISMA), Risk Assessment of Government 
Charge Cards, and Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) audits. In 
addition to mandatory audits, the Office of Audits conducts performance 
audits of DFC programs or functions to determine if they are operating 
as intended to achieve stated goals. Two recent performance audits are 
highlighted below.

  --DFC Made Significant Progress Implementing Provisions of the BUILD 
        Act This audit revealed that DFC complied with and implemented 
        116 of the 118 subsections of the BUILD Act. The two 
        subsections not fully implemented were: (1) the roles, 
        responsibilities, and authorities of the Chief Development 
        Officer and Chief Risk Officer; and (2) DFC publicly reporting 
        performance metrics including development impact on a country-
        by-country basis. In addition, we noted two observations 
        regarding: (1) the methodology of calculating and tracking the 
        progress of investments in less developed countries; \4\ and 
        (2) the Annual Report timeliness.
  --We are wrapping up an audit of DFC-funded renewable energy and 
        finance projects in India. This was DFC OIG's first audit where 
        we had ``boots on the ground,'' allowing us an opportunity to 
        review projects and see DFC's impact in developing countries 
        firsthand. Our audit team, along with DFC staff, traveled to 
        India in February and March 2023 and visited eight DFC-financed 
        projects. We are discussing our findings with DFC management, 
        including issues regarding records management, waiver of 
        environmental and social standards, project monitoring, 
        reporting fatalities and serious injuries, and subordinate 
        loans policies. The final report of our audit findings and 
        recommendations will be published in early fall 2023.
                             investigations
    The Office of Investigations conducts proactive investigations and 
responds to allegations of fraud, abuse, and misconduct, which may 
result in criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions. DFC OIG 
investigations protect whistleblowers and address critical and 
sensitive issues supporting not only DFC's mission, but also U.S. 
foreign policy objectives and national security interests more broadly. 
The Office of Investigations seeks to foster the integrity of DFC 
employees, partners, and contractors, and encourages them to report 
suspected wrongdoing through outreach and training. To assist in this 
effort, DFC OIG provides training to new DFC employees and issues 
periodic newsletters to all DFC employees to promote understanding of 
our investigative mission and encourage reporting of suspected fraud, 
illegal activity, or misconduct.
    The OIG Hotline is available online or by phone, +1 833-OIG-4DFC, 
allowing information and complaints to be submitted to DFC OIG easily 
and confidentially from anywhere in the world. Since DFC OIG's 
inception, we have received 49 allegations, which have resulted in 28 
preliminary inquiries or investigations. During that time, we conducted 
six proactive initiatives to detect fraud and illegal conduct. Three 
recent investigations are highlighted below.

  --An investigation revealed a loan applicant submitted false 
        financial statements to DFC in support of a $41 million loan 
        for a construction project in the Middle East. Fortunately, the 
        loan commitment was cancelled before funds were dispersed. We 
        sent a report to DFC management detailing our findings and will 
        be referring the subjects of the investigation to DFC for 
        debarment.
  --As part of a proactive initiative, an OIG investigator visited a 
        solar power plant in India funded by a DFC loan to determine 
        the origins of the solar modules and inverters used to 
        construct the plant. We verified that although the solar 
        modules and inverters were manufactured by companies in the 
        PRC, the manufacturers were not linked to forced labor programs 
        as identified by a Federal interagency advisory.\5\
  --Last, we have investigated several complaints by whistleblowers 
        recently, including a whistleblower reprisal complaint, which 
        we referred to the Office of Special Counsel.
                      ukraine management advisory
    DFC OIG intends to proactively protect DFC's investments in 
Ukraine. To raise awareness of potential areas for fraud and abuse, we 
issued a management advisory, Key Considerations to Inform DFC's 
Response in Ukraine, to DFC management in June 2023. DFC plans to 
mobilize well over $1 billion in private sector capital to support the 
economy and people of Ukraine. While it has been reported that Ukraine 
has made significant improvements in its efforts to address corruption, 
it still faces challenges with implementing internal controls to ensure 
effective and efficient reconstruction efforts. DFC OIG is a member of 
the Ukraine Oversight Interagency Working Group; coordinating with 
other OIGs, international law enforcement entities, and various 
domestic and international stakeholders, and intends to commit 
resources to proactively monitor and evaluate DFC-funded projects in 
Ukraine.
                dfc top management challenges in fy2023
    Last fall, in collaboration with DFC, OIG published Top Management 
Challenges (TMCs) facing DFC in FY 2023 and discussed four challenges: 
\6\ (1) improving monitoring and evaluating actual development impact; 
(2) improving performance management, transparency, accuracy and 
availability of project data as DFC's commitments grow; (3) balancing 
heightened expectations of Congress and stakeholders while managing 
risks; and (4) managing organizational transition while building 
internal controls of core management systems. In particular, we 
identified that DFC needs to take action to make actual development 
impact achieved and promotion of our nation's foreign policy the 
primary metrics of its success. We look forward to working with DFC 
this coming fall in identifying the FY 2024 TMCs, which likely will be 
similar to those previously published.
                        memorandum of agreements
    DFC OIG has been actively establishing international partnerships 
to support anti-fraud and anti-corruption initiatives that will enrich 
our audit and investigative efforts. We recently executed Memoranda of 
Agreement (MOA) with the United Nations Office of Project Services 
(UNOPS) Internal Audit and Investigations Group, the European Anti-
Fraud Office (known by the acronym OLAF), and the World Bank Group 
Internal Audit (GIA). These MOAs are based on a common interest to 
enhance relationships that support sharing information and other 
resources with these international partners, which is critical given 
the international nature of our work.
                             looking ahead
    The BUILD Act authorizes DFC to grow its portfolio to $60 billion. 
To reach this goal, DFC plans to increase its staff level to 700 by 
September 2024. DFC has requested $1.023 billion for FY 2024 and $2 
billion in mandatory funds for an equity revolving fund.\7\ As DFC's 
portfolio and staff levels grow, the OIG also must grow. The OIG has 
requested $7.2 million for FY 2024, which includes increasing staff 
levels to support mobilizing an inspections and evaluations program and 
expanding our Office of Investigations (which currently has only two 
staff).
                increase oig staff to match dfc's growth
    To audit program and operational effectiveness, as well as 
investigate allegations of fraud, in a portfolio of DFC's size and 
complexity, the OIG must attract and retain skilled, experienced 
auditors, evaluators, investigators, attorneys, and other 
professionals. We also want to effectively monitor and evaluate DFC-
funded projects worldwide, which includes site visits, as a critical 
aspect of evaluating progress, assessing development impact, developing 
relationships, and identifying potentially fraudulent activity. The OIG 
proposes to hire an additional 9 FTEs in FY 2024, which will include 
auditors, evaluators, a data scientist, and an attorney to improve our 
audit and investigation capabilities. In addition to FTEs, the OIG has 
also recently hired two Pathways paid interns to support legal and 
audit functions.
                   need for law enforcement authority
    DFC OIG is hampered in its ability to independently conduct certain 
law enforcement activities because we do not have law enforcement 
authority. Our request for such authority has been pending with the 
U.S. Attorney General's Office for two and a half years. Prior to the 
BUILD Act, DFC's predecessor, the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC), was overseen by USAID OIG, which has law 
enforcement authority. Compared to OPIC, DFC has a significantly larger 
portfolio, a larger staff, expanded investment authority (including 
equity), and increased focus on development impact and promoting U.S. 
national interests. DFC OIG cannot properly oversee DFC without the 
same law enforcement authority that its predecessor OIG--and almost all 
other OIGs--have. Our lack of law enforcement authority has also 
hampered our ability to recruit and hire experienced investigators, who 
naturally want to continue their law enforcement careers. The OIG 
continues to work with key stakeholders, including Congress and DOJ, to 
obtain much-needed law enforcement authority.
                         future planned audits
    The OIG currently has two future audits it will conduct. The first 
is an audit of DFC's goods and services contracts. We plan to determine 
whether DFC complied with applicable goods and services contract 
regulations, policies, and procedures that contribute to being good 
stewards of government resources, ensuring Federal programs fulfill 
their intended purpose, effectively spending funds, and safeguarding 
assets. In the second audit, because of DFC's dramatic growth\8\ and 
the planned organization realignment, we plan to audit DFC's workforce 
planning efforts. We will assess if DFC is hiring the right people in 
the right places, how decisions were made, and explore current employee 
retention efforts. We will also review DFC's strategic human capital 
management as it positions the organization to be more effective and 
results-oriented by managing DFC's most valued resource--its people.
          inspections & evaluations of dfc projects worldwide
    DFC has a global reach and currently has development initiatives in 
four regions: Africa and the Middle East; Latin America and the 
Caribbean; Indo-Pacific; and Eastern Europe and Eurasia. DFC has also 
made investment commitments in Ukraine, which will likely increase in 
the future. To enhance our oversight efforts, DFC OIG intends to 
establish and mobilize an inspections and evaluations (I&E) program in 
FY 2024 to assess 8-10 DFC-funded projects around the world. We 
strongly believe that such a program is required to improve 
transparency and provide timely status of project progress and 
development impact as DFC's portfolio continues to grow. The I&E 
program will provide ``boots on the ground,'' giving DFC OIG the 
ability to provide real-time input regarding project status and 
effectiveness to help make timely recommendations for improvement and 
identify where administrative action might be necessary. The OIG's I&E 
program will incorporate lessons learned from our recent audit of DFC 
investments in India and we will also collaborate with DFC's Office of 
Accountability and DFC's Impact Management and Monitoring Division.
                               conclusion
    DFC has an important mission and makes significant contributions to 
promote economic growth, increase food security, build critical 
infrastructure, advance global health, and bolster connectivity in the 
developing world, while advancing U.S. foreign policy and providing 
financially sound alternatives to unsustainable and irresponsible 
state-directed initiatives. At the same time, in many parts of the 
world, extremism, instability, and open conflict make the jobs of 
development professionals working to achieve these goals much harder. 
Meeting these and other challenges requires serious commitment; a 
thoughtful, informed approach; and effective collaboration to curb 
risks and change course when necessary. DFC OIG will continue to be an 
independent voice and steadfast partner in helping chart improvements 
to U.S. foreign financial support, and I look forward to working with 
you in the years to come to ensure that we provide maximum value to 
decision-makers, stakeholders, and, above all, the American people.
    I appreciate the opportunity to provide you with this overview of 
our work and our needs. My staff and I are always available to brief 
you and your staff and look forward to working with you on prioritizing 
future oversight efforts.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Nathan. We are now going to 
move to, probably, one round of 7-minute questions, and if 
there are members who persist, I will be happy to do a second 
round.
    I wanted to ask, if I could, when we established the DFC in 
2019 it was with a mandate to mobilize private capital in 
support of development goals and sustainable economic growth, 
to help further our foreign policy interests. Some of the 
stakeholders of the DFC want you to focus more of your 
attention on poverty reduction in less developed countries, 
while others are urging a shift towards critical geostrategic 
investments.
    To what extent is this a zero-sum trade-off between poverty 
alleviation and strategic impact? Is that real, or is that a 
perception? And how are you ensuring the DFC is maximizing 
resources to deliver on the full scope of its mandate? How do 
you prioritize if this is, in fact, a real trade-off?
    Mr. Nathan. So the BUILD Act clearly gave us a dual mission 
to make development impact in the poorest countries of the 
world, and to advance the strategic and foreign policy 
interests of the United States. And I think we can do both. We 
can do both through all of our transactions.
    Both elements of our mission are mutually reinforcing, I 
don't see them as contradictory in any way.
    I see the two elements of our mission, as strongly 
reinforcing of one another. And you can see this through our 
projects. A project like I mentioned, Yilport, critically 
important from a strategic point of view to give Ecuador a 
deepwater port on the Pacific. It is important that we were 
there to finance that rather than our strategic competitors. 
But that project also produces 1,250 jobs locally, it provides 
connections to markets around the world for Ecuador which is a 
key to their economic growth.
    So even a project that can be viewed as purely strategic 
has huge developmental impact, and the same is true in terms of 
the small and very important, highly developmental projects we 
do, that make a difference in remote communities, that helps 
with economic growth and stability, that is good for the United 
States, that is good for our interest.
    Senator Coons. What I mostly hear when I travel to other 
countries, Senator Graham and I traveled to a number of 
countries in Africa together a few months ago, is they want 
more. They want more of the DFC, they want more of your 
leveraging American private capital, they want more of having 
an alternative to, as you put it, PRC investment that often 
produces too much debt and disappointing results.
    There are legislative changes, that a number of us are 
advocating for, that would allow you to leverage funds more 
effectively. One would fix the equity scoring issue. The other 
would expand country eligibility, rather than just relying on 
World Bank income categories. A similar change is being 
considered for the MCC.
    What would the impact of these two changes be? And could 
you provide some examples of equity investments you have had to 
have pass on which could have helped us geostrategically with 
countering the PRC, and with development, had the equity 
scoring problem been solved?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you for the question. It is very clear 
that in the BUILD Act the expansion of our toolkit to include 
equity was one of the key elements of making us be able to be 
more forward-leaning on risk. Our predecessor agencies, 
particularly OPIC, were constrained in their ability to take 
risk in projects, partially by the way that they were 
structured and funded, but also because they were unable to use 
equity as a tool.
    That made it difficult to partner with our colleagues at 
other development finance institutions, with the G7 and other 
allies. And it meant that there were projects that were earlier 
in the life cycle, or in countries, low-income countries there 
is reasons why there is not robust financing markets on the 
debt side, equity is a more long-term, patient tool.
    The way that I think equity, if we had the expanded ability 
to use it, would be valuable to our mission, in particular, we 
would be able to be earlier in projects, even infrastructure 
and energy projects, where we could support developers, help 
influence their choices of vendors and EPC contractors, other 
shareholders, or sources of finance to make sure they make the 
right choice.
    You are right, when I travel I hear like you did, that 
people want us to show up, they are looking for diversity in 
their relationships, they are looking for a choice, but if we 
don't have an offering that fits their needs, we won't be able 
to offer that kind of choice.
    I am struck that both the Millennium Challenge Corporation, 
which was an innovation of the Bush Administration, and 
approaches development with metrics, accountability, long-term 
goals, and the DFC whose principal goal is crowding in private 
capital and deploying the best of the American private sector, 
and delivering more transparent, more sustainable--are both 
funded at about a billion dollars, in a government, that in 
terms of our engagement with the world between defense, 
development, diplomacy, does hundreds of times more than that.
    I am excited to have a chance to work with you and my 
colleagues in trying to fix the equity scoring issue. What 
would that fix do to your leverage, and your reach, and your 
scope?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. So at the moment our ability to make 
equity investments, because they are accounted for on a dollar-
for dollar basis, as if immediately, it is as if we lost the 
money, it is accounted for more like a grant than an 
investment. We are not able to get the kind of leverage that we 
do with our debt transactions.
    On an appropriation last year, of $500 million of program 
funds, we made $7.4 billion of investments, but the amount of 
equity we could use was quite limited as a result.
    If we had a bigger pot of equity we could look at making 
$100 million, or $200 million investments in precisely the kind 
of projects that I mentioned: big infrastructure, mining of 
critical minerals, energy projects, where we could be early and 
influence the direction that those projects are taking, as 
opposed to coming all the way at the end with debt financing.
    Senator Coons. And just for those who may not be familiar 
with how the stacking and the structuring works, if you are 
equity, you help drive the deal.
    Mr. Nathan. That is right.
    Senator Coons. If you are debt, you are the caboose.
    Mr. Nathan. With equity we would have a seat at the table, 
we would be able to be far more patient, we would be able to 
operate in environments that are more difficult, more complex, 
and riskier.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. I appreciate your testimony.
    My Ranking Member, Senator Graham.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Number one, a 
brief opening statement here.
    If you are really serious about countering China, and we 
all are, you have to show up, you have to show up and offer to 
people in the world an alternative to Belt and Road. This 
program, the DFC, is sort of like the best thing we have going 
for us right now, and a billion dollars, it should be multiple 
times that, and what the Chairman is trying to do, and no 
matter who wins in 2024, we are going to be partners on this 
issue. Senator Shaheen has been great.
    All of our colleagues up here sort of get, that you are not 
going to compete with China through a lens of isolationism. Why 
are we spending money over there? Well, because people over 
there affect the quality of life over here. If you want to stop 
illegal immigration, let us improve the quality life in places 
where people are coming from.
    If you have forgotten 9/11 which was over there, I haven't. 
Taking your eye off the ball can really lead to a lot of money 
and lives being lost. So without some soft power, as General 
Mattis said, ``You had better buy a lot more bullets'', because 
if you don't show up and turn things around before it is too 
late, you wind up getting sucked into military conflict, or you 
lose influence in a world that China is trying to dominate.
    So the equity aspect of this makes perfect sense to me, Mr. 
Chairman. The goal is to run this more like a business, we have 
the former Ambassador to Japan here. We are going to have to 
redesign and reimagine foreign assistance, the MCC, the DFC, 
the fragile-state approach, the food security conservation 
fund, where you are having the private sector put serious money 
involved, and the government partners up, is the only way to 
get outcomes.
    So I want to applaud you, Mr. Chairman. You are trying to 
make this program more efficient, to get a better return on the 
taxpayer dollar and equity investment should be allowed.
    I am worried about the World Bank income classification 
being our guide, taking areas of the world off the table that 
it is in our strategic national security interest to be 
involved in. It should be about what is best for us, it is not 
what the World Bank does in terms income ratings. So I would 
like to change that.
    To my colleagues here, don't tell me about how tough you 
are on China if you are going to let Ukraine fail. You are not. 
If you don't see the need to support Ukraine, related to China, 
you are missing a lot. Don't tell me we are going to be tough 
on China if you don't have something like the DFC to compete 
with a Belt and Road Initiative.
    So this subcommittee I think has done really good work in 
this space. President Bush started it, President Trump 
continued along these lines, even though he cut the account 
dramatically, these are one of the programs he saw value in, 
and I want to support President Biden's effort to grow the 
footprint here.
    So the bottom line for me is that this is a program worth 
investing in at a higher level, taking some of the limitations 
off the program to get maximum benefit, should be our goal in 
2024. And I will end with one question, basically.
    Mr. Nathan, is China your chief competitor in the spaces 
that you deal in through the DFC portfolio? And what would 
happen if this program went away, vis-a-vis China's ability to 
influence the world at a greater level?
    Mr. Nathan. Senator, thank you for the question. And thank 
you, especially, for your comments before that. I 
wholeheartedly agree with what you said.
    So it is clear, in the markets where we operate, China is 
the major actor, the major source of finance, through the Belt 
and Road Initiative, through their development banks, the 
offering of finance at terms that often end up creating 
problems for the countries down the road that accepted them. It 
is clear.
    You can't blame countries for looking for financing to 
build their economies, and support the infrastructure in their 
countries, but it often comes with strings attached, or is 
inappropriate, poor quality.
    What we do at DFC is different than what China does. There 
are there are many reasons for that. The first is we support 
the private sector. I am a strong believer that the best engine 
for alleviating poverty around the world is a robust economy, 
and a robust private sector.
    We also adhere to extremely high standards. We are offering 
projects that countries want, that are appropriate for their 
local conditions, and their laws, that have passed through very 
important screening for labor conditions, environmental 
standards, for know your customer, we care about corruption.
    These are things where we offer something, not only that is 
a choice, but that is different, and I believe is better. And 
if we weren't on the playing field, I hear this all the time 
when I travel, that countries are impatient, they obviously are 
looking to support the welfare of their people, but they want a 
diversity of relationships.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Graham.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this 
hearing. And to you, Mr. Nathan, thank you for being here, and 
for the work you are doing every day.
    I share Senator Graham's sentiments about not limiting 
where we invest to just those countries that are designated by 
the World Bank, because there are places that both need 
investment and have strategic interests for the United States.
    One of those areas, I would argue, is the Western Balkans 
which I have been focused on for a number of years, and one of 
the places where I think we should consider opening a DFC 
office, somewhere in the region, because of its significance, 
both for a Europe that we want to see whole, free, and at 
peace, but also because it is an area that is ripe for 
interference by both the Russians and the Chinese.
    And one of the examples that I have here is from 
Montenegro, which signed a nearly billion-dollar Belt and Road 
deal with the China Road and Bridge Corporation, with funding 
from the Export-Import Bank of China, to build a road that 
would have connected the north and south of the country.
    [Poster on Display.]
    Senator Shaheen. Now, you can see the current status of the 
project in red, that is where the project is completed, but the 
blue parts highlight the still incomplete sections of the 
project, and I think this is a poster example of what you were 
talking about in your opening statement about the limits of the 
PRC's investments.
    Sadly, despite the fact that this project has not gone 
forward as it was supposed to, Montenegro has now signed yet 
another infrastructure deal with China. That happened in March 
when the government signed a deal worth $59 million with the 
PRC Consortium to build a new road.
    But it is my understanding that there were no U.S. or 
European firms who submitted bids. So can you talk about why 
that would have happened? That there were no other viable 
offers from the U.S., and what lessons we should take from this 
kind of situation?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you Senator. Well, I don't know the 
specifics of why the tender in Montenegro failed. I think I can 
generalize to the kind of situations that I see in many of the 
countries where DFC operates. You know, we focus on the private 
sector, so the projects that we fund need to be commercially 
viable, need to offer an opportunity for a return from the 
sponsors where we would provide debt financing or, potentially, 
make an equity investment.
    And I think what frequently happens in these government 
projects that are then tendered, is there is an opportunity--
and I don't know in this particular case--but in general, there 
is an opportunity for corruption, for projects that don't 
really fit the needs.
    What happens when Chinese firms come in is frequently, they 
use their own workers. They end up burdening the country at the 
sovereign level with debt that is difficult to manage. We are 
avoiding that by focusing on the private sector and viable 
projects. And I heard yesterday about a--you know, a South 
American country where Huawei had built the 911 Emergency Call 
System that needs to be rebooted every 4 hours, and so it goes 
offline for an hour, all the manuals are in Chinese, and the 
country can't use it, so they are launching a new tender.
    I am hopeful that American companies will step in, that 
companies from allied countries, and our partners will also 
step in, in order to provide these services. But it is true, 
particularly when I am in Africa, one of the things that you 
rarely see are U.S. companies that are there to compete, and 
that I think is a broader issue, but one, I would love to see 
EPC contractors, the firms that build infrastructure, be more 
broadly representative of America and Europe.
    Senator Shaheen. I agree. And one of the things we have got 
to do is to remind those countries that are looking for 
investments, the trap that the PRC can create for them as they 
did for Montenegro.
    Last year, the DFC announced a deal to provide up to 300 
million in financing to the Three Seas Investment Fund, which 
is supposed to invest in transportation, energy, digital 
infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. It is my 
understanding that despite the strong bipartisan support for 
this investment, that negotiations have still not been 
finalized; can you give us an update on where those are, and 
when you expect them to be completed?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. Thanks for the question. So I was 
delighted last year, I think it was in June, to lead the U.S. 
delegation to the Three Seas Initiative Summit, the Three Seas 
Initiative is incredibly important in terms of strengthening 
our partners and allies in Central Europe. It is about economic 
connectivity, something that I am a strong believer in.
    At that conference we announced that we would be making a 
commitment to the fund. We are already working with the fund 
and throughout the region to find investments that we can make 
directly. We are in the final stages of negotiation with the 
Fund Manager for that fund. There are still some sticking 
points in the negotiation that are important from our side in 
terms of protecting the taxpayer interests in how the fund is 
structured, but you know, I am hopeful that we can get that 
fund across the finish line in short order.
    The bigger picture is this is a Europe where--this is a 
region where we are actively looking for projects. The European 
Energy Security and Diversification Act authorizes us to focus 
on energy infrastructure, and we have some very good projects 
in the pipeline, and have already made a few in the region.
    Senator Shaheen. That is good to hear. One of the other 
areas, I chair the European Affairs Subcommittee of Foreign 
Relations, and so that is where I have been mostly focused. And 
one of the other areas I know that is ripe for investment is 
telecommunications, and we hear particularly from Eastern 
European countries about their interest in getting investment 
to help them so that they are not reliant on China or other 
countries for telecommunications.
    Is the DFC currently involved in any telecommunications 
projects in Eastern Europe?
    Mr. Nathan. So in the high-income countries of Eastern 
Europe, which is the vast majority of them, we are not 
currently authorized to work on telecommunication investments.
    Senator Shaheen. I actually have legislation that I 
introduced in 2022 that would authorize the DFC to invest in 
those kinds of telecommunications projects, because they are so 
critical. So hopefully we will revisit that legislation.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you to my colleague, Senator Shaheen, 
both for the way that you bring your experiences, and 
strengths, and skills, across several different committees, but 
also your persistent focus in a critical part of Eastern and 
Central Europe. It is greatly appreciated.
    Senator Hagerty, we very much look forward to your 
questioning.
    Senator Hagerty. Chairman Coons, thank you very much for 
your remarks. I think that all of you will find that I am in 
violent agreement with everything that has been said, and I 
look forward to working with you on making some continued 
improvements.
    And Senator Shaheen, I could not agree with you more about 
the criticality of telecommunications infrastructure, 
particularly given the difficulties that we have had with 
Huawei, ZTE, and others that are trying to invade the entire 5G 
infrastructure system.
    I would like to just step back for a moment, Mr. Nathan. I 
think you know a little bit of the history, but for my 
colleagues, I would like to share the fact that I have some 
parental pride in what you are doing, because the design of 
what has now become the Development Finance Corporation was 
something I was deeply involved, and as we transform from the 
old OPIC, to what you are leading right now.
    And at that point, we made some significant modifications 
in terms of what you are allowed to do, equity investment for 
example. I don't think any of us, particularly people with 
business background imagined that we got it exactly right, but 
I think that what we would hope to see is the ability to 
continue to improve. As you learn, as you try to deploy the 
funds that we have given you, and finding rules that will help 
make you more and more effective, so I am glad that this 
conversation is happening right now, in terms of how we can get 
it done.
    I will see another critical aspect of having the ability to 
improve, is having individuals like yourself who have the 
relevant private sector experience, and know-how to invest. And 
I think we benefit from your experience, your predecessors like 
Adam Boehler, and Ray Washburne, having that type of business 
DNA makes your organization much more effective. And I think it 
makes us much more inclined to work with you to improve the 
various parameters that you have been given to operate, so that 
you can become even more effective.
    One thing that you mentioned; is that the best recipe for 
alleviating poverty--and I don't want to put words in your 
mouth--was a robust economy and a robust private sector. And I 
would just add to that, that it is also the best means to 
ensure economic security and national security, when we have 
both of those elements.
    I hope that you will have that emblazoned, and put on the 
wall there at the Development Finance Corporation, because I 
admire your words and agree with them, with that slight 
addition.
    I would like to step back and share just some observations 
from a trip I recently took, and I think I spoke with you 
before I undertook the trip to Chile, to Uruguay, to Colombia. 
I just left, this morning, a conference, an ASEAN-U.S. Business 
Council Conference, everywhere we go talking to leaders, we 
realize something very basic. They are trying to recover from 
the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. Their economies 
are facing serious headwinds, their debt burdens have 
increased, social upheaval exists everywhere, frankly, crime is 
up in each of the countries that I speak with.
    These are very real challenges. And you have got countries 
that are operating at the bottom level of Maslow's hierarchy of 
needs. They are trying to put food on the table right now. And 
as I look at the DFC Investment Portfolio what I see are a 
number of projects that are oriented toward lofty goals but, 
you know, with ESG parameters on them, we are investing in, you 
know, billions of dollars in climate change projects, solar 
panels that require endless government subsidies, we are even 
doing a project in South Africa on equitable taxi 
transportation.
    So I am trying to understand how you prioritize projects, 
particularly given the competitive environment that we are in. 
And this has been mentioned, I think, very clearly. We are 
competing every day, you have acknowledged who our top 
competitor is, and that is the CCP, how do you prioritize these 
projects?
    Mr. Nathan. Well, thank you for your comments and for your 
question, Senator. So we have been engaged in a process at DFC 
of thinking about, now that DFC is fully launched its 3 years 
into operation, about how to refine our statement of 
priorities. And I mentioned them in my testimony, it reflects 
the areas that we have been working in, and I think they are 
broad and enduring enough that from administration to 
administration they should be in place.
    That is, infrastructure, energy, health care, agriculture 
and food, and support for small business. This is the five 
areas, that if you look across our portfolio, it is 85-90 
percent of the activity that we do, and it should be where we 
are focusing our business development efforts, our client 
management efforts, trying to bring our whole toolkit of 
solutions to clients in that area, to make a difference in 
infrastructure, energy, health care, food and AG, and small 
business support.
    Senator Hagerty. Well, I think that the countries that we 
are targeting to partner with, will be most receptive if you 
focus on the very basic deliverables here, and the aspirational 
projects that may have some benefit at the higher levels of 
Maslow's hierarchy, I think should be reprioritized. I just 
want to get that point across.
    The second point has been emphasized earlier before, and 
that is the utilization of income-based criteria for the 
countries that you work in. I had a very frustrating 
conversation with the President of Uruguay who really wants to 
work with us, yet our rules make it impossible for him to do 
so. So his only alternative is to, as he told me, is to turn to 
China.
    And I think it just underscored for me, the need to take a 
fresh look at this, and if you have any further comments on 
what we might be able to do in that regard, I would appreciate 
it.
    Mr. Nathan. Well, thank you for the question. The BUILD Act 
gave us eligibility to work in lower-income countries, lower- 
middle- and upper-middle income countries, and that is by 
income classification from the World Bank, a categorization 
that the World Bank doesn't even use for their lending.
    What we think might make more sense is a categorization 
based on the World Bank lending categories, which can take into 
account countries that haven't yet graduated, that haven't yet 
found the way to get to a position where commercial finance is 
the only option.
    Senator Hagerty. Well, I think that----
    Mr. Nathan. If we went to that category, Uruguay would 
become a country that we would be able to operate in.
    Senator Hagerty. I think we will look forward to working 
with you on taking a more strategic view, as opposed to sort of 
a dogmatic income approach.
    There is one last thing I would like to--just a comment I 
would like to have you take a look at it, and get back to my 
team, if you might. And that is to take a look at the Hanjin 
Port at Subic Bay in the Philippines, that project. I was 
deeply involved in that project in my previous role as U.S. 
Ambassador to Japan. I learned that CCP-affiliated entities 
were about to buy that shipyard out of bankruptcy. We were able 
to change that dynamic, put a U.S. private-sector company in 
play for the equity component.
    The DFC was not able to play as I had imagined they would 
be able to play. And if you could just take a look at that 
project, with your business perspective, and could get back to 
me and tell me what might have changed, if your toolset had 
been different, that would have allowed you to play; if I am 
asking that in a way that makes sense?
    I would really like to just take a hard look at that one 
lesson I am very, very familiar with, and understand how an 
improvement or a modification of your tools could have allowed 
you to play a more effective role.
    Mr. Nathan. I definitely will do that. Sea ports are an 
area of real emphasis for us, shipyards too. We just did a deal 
in Greece, we did a ship--a seaport in Ecuador, and we have a 
couple projects in our pipeline that I hope to be able to 
announce publicly later in the year that fit exactly the kind 
of strategic and developmental elements that you just 
referenced.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you. I look forward to hearing back 
from you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Hagerty, for bringing 
your previous experience and insights, both regionally and 
sectorally, to the questioning today.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, 
Mr. Nathan.
    I want to start by associating myself with the comments the 
Chairman made at the outset, and the comments that the Ranking 
Member made at the outset. And I am very concerned about what 
we saw emerge from the House of Representatives yesterday in 
terms of their 302(b) allocations for SFOPS.
    In my view that represents a retreat around the world at a 
time that we need to be more engaged, not less engaged. And I 
hope that--I know this Committee has had a bipartisan history 
in terms of recognizing America's role in the world, and the 
need to use all of our tools to engage around the world, 
especially when, as you have said, we are competing around the 
world.
    We have a good product to offer. China's investments often 
come with strings that result in bad things happening to those 
countries. But you can't do this on the cheap, and you can't do 
it with rhetoric and no resources. So it is going to be really 
important that we move forward, including the DFC.
    I want to commend the Chairman, not only for his role in 
establishing the DFC, but the legislation that I am proud to 
co-sponsor to fix this budgeting issue. It is absolutely nuts 
to account an equity investment as a PEER Grant, nobody in the 
private sector would think that makes any sense. And since 
these investments are appropriately public-private 
partnerships, we want to make sure that our dollars can travel 
as far as they can, and we are essentially handcuffing you in 
the DFC when we place that limitation through the Budget County 
Rules.
    I am pleased that yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee I chaired a nomination hearing for someone I hope 
will be your deputy, Nisha Desai Biswal, I hope we can move 
that confirmation forward as soon as possible.
    Let me ask you, Mr. Nathan, about the issue of critical 
minerals, and what role the DFC can play in this area. I 
appreciated our conversation after you returned from a visit to 
the Indo-Pacific, including Indonesia. But right now we know 
that we are way behind the game when it comes to critical 
minerals.
    China has secured access to lots of critical mineral 
deposits around the world, and is the world's largest processor 
of critical minerals, and the world's largest manufacturer of 
batteries for EVs, which is going to be a very important part 
of our future, and our future competitiveness globally.
    So can you speak to what kind of projects, investments the 
DFC has when it comes to securing our supply chain for critical 
minerals?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you for the question, and thanks for 
chairing yesterday's nomination hearing.
    So we are the owner of about, I think it is about, 12-13 
percent at the moment of a company called TechMet Limited which 
is a U.S.-aligned platform for investing in the mining of 
critical minerals. We made an initial $25 million investment; 
we have made a follow-on $30 million equity investment 
recently, so that they could pursue cobalt and nickel mining 
and processing in a more efficient way than the standard of the 
industry, in Brazil.
    We are going to have some follow-on projects with them 
elsewhere in Africa, focused on rare-earths, and other 
minerals, those two projects that we are currently working with 
them on.
    This is just an example with the difference that equity can 
make. In these kinds of projects the ability to make equity 
investments made them possible. We wouldn't have been able to--
at the early stage that we were involved, be able to use debt.
    But we are looking beyond just this relationship, there is 
a whole series of projects in other rare earths, in critical 
minerals, in the manufacturing of batteries, and even in 
graphite, we hope to be able to announce a deal later this year 
in that regard, graphite being a critical component of being 
able to manufacture batteries.
    This supply chain, you are right, is already very much 
dominated by PRC entities, but we have to begin chipping away 
at that, at the mining, at the processing, at the manufacturing 
level.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, I appreciate it, and I think 
right now you--you know, you are you are hamstrung a little bit 
in terms of the rules, because I think we need to do more than 
chipping away. I mean, I think we need a surge effort in this 
area. And I look forward to following up on the conversation we 
are having here.
    I worry that we, the United States, and even our allies are 
perceived in some cases of over-promising and under-delivering. 
The President and the G7 announced the partnership for Global 
Infrastructure Investment with the goal of investing $600 
billion in, by I think the year 2027, approximately.
    Can you talk about the DFC's role in that effort, and the 
extent of resources that you are investing at this time?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. So the areas of priority for DFC dovetail 
very nicely with the Partnership for Global Infrastructure 
Investment, and the effort that the G7 is making.
    Last year, out of our $7.4 billion of transactions $5.2 
billion of those qualified as PGII projects. This is helpful to 
have this more whole-of-government effort with our interagency 
partners, but beyond even the U.S. Government, our G7 partners 
are critical in helping amplify the amount of capital available 
for the kind of private-sector investing that we do.
    Under PGII we have made a great deal of effort to 
coordinate with our counterparts in the G7, and more broadly 
amongst our allies, particularly in Europe and in Asia. By 
working together we can create greater efficiency, bring more 
resources to bear on these projects, and really chip away at 
what is the thing that we hear, I hear constantly that DFC 
needs to do more, and do it faster. That is our effort. And 
this is a helpful part of that.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you. On the ``do it 
faster'' part, any suggestions you have as to how we can be 
helpful to you in that, or whether it is internal to the 
Executive Branch process? I would welcome any suggestions on 
that front. Because I think moving quickly is obviously very 
important in this global environment.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator. And thank you for your 
persistent interest and engagement on this issue, and on the 
balance between development and strategic priorities.
    Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you and Senator Graham for holding this very important hearing.
    We appreciate you, Mr. Nathan, for being here and all that 
you are doing. You have got a big job. I know in your 
testimony, you mentioned that the DFC has surged its efforts in 
the food and agricultural sector, food security is national 
security for all of our countries, and that you continue to 
actively look for more viable projects to support.
    Can you tell us what types of projects has the DFC 
supported in improving food security in developing countries?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you for the question, Senator. 
Particularly after Russia's illegal and brutal war on Ukraine, 
the issue of food security, globally, has become even more 
critical and highlighted. It has been one of the reasons why we 
have surged our effort, had a special focus on it.
    Our projects are often small in this area, because they are 
targeted at smallholder farmers, at rural communities, at 
finding ways to bring products to market more quickly, 
eliminating layers of middlemen. We have invested in companies 
that provide technology and financing to smallholder farmers. 
We have made investments with banks that then target their 
lending activity toward farming and agricultural businesses.
    I visited, when I was in Georgia, in the Republic of 
Georgia, I visited cold chain supply--cold chain logistics 
companies that help--that we have invested in, that help 
products--produce not spoil and get to market more quickly. I 
think there are a range of things we can do in aquaculture in 
Asia, and in other activities, focused on really bringing the 
farmer more directly to market.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. That is so important, you know, 
things, little things that are huge things getting countries, 
the regions at just the world food price, you know, as opposed 
to not having the competition, you know, it is so important.
    Mr. Nathan. If I could add. Even something like our 
investment in Yilport, and Puerto Bolivar in Ecuador, a Pacific 
deepwater container port, that has a food security element to 
it, because that helps Ecuador be more efficient in exporting 
bananas, and their--you know, their primary agricultural 
commodity to the rest of the world; so infrastructure is a 
critical component to also helping to promote food security.
    Senator Boozman. Right. Very good. Speaking of 
infrastructure I know that DFC is focusing on working with the 
private sector to promote infrastructure investment in an 
effort to offer a good alternative to Chinese predatory 
lending, can you elaborate on the specific actions the DFC has 
done to reduce Chinese predatory lending in developing 
countries, and what it intends to do moving forward?
    Mr. Nathan. Senator, we need to show up and offer a choice. 
That is the best way to compete. If we have a flow of deals, if 
we have the financing tools available to us, if we have the 
workforce and capacity to process those deals quickly, and to 
generate more deal flow, and deal with clients, that is how we 
are going to be able to properly compete with China.
    I can think of some recent examples of investments that we 
have made that are helpful in that. Our Board approved earlier 
this year our financial support for the expansion of an airport 
in Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries 
in the world, anything we can do to help connect them to their 
region, to the world, to help their economy.
    We are also financing the building of a power plant in 
Sierra Leone. This is a country with an extremely low level of 
electricity penetration. That is a key to development. At the 
moment the capital city, Freetown, is dependent on diesel 
generators on a barge that are owned by a Turkish businessman. 
It is unreliable, it is inefficient, it is unhealthy. By 
financing the construction of a power plant we are helping them 
have greater energy security, and promote development.
    Senator Boozman. In the 2024 budget, the State Department 
has a lot of money for infrastructure, ports, things like you 
are describing; do you all work together?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. We work very closely with our interagency 
partners. The Secretary of State is the Chair of our Board. We 
rely on posts around the world to help us with sourcing deals, 
with the vetting of our partners, with our Know Your Customer 
rules.
    The State Department helps us with thinking about 
certification for the strategic importance of our deals. And 
like with all of our interagency partners, USAID, the Treasury 
Department, Commerce, we work closely to help get our projects 
through the process more quickly, and to generate as many good 
ideas as we can for potential future transactions.
    Senator Boozman. And as far as critical, critical entities 
like biotechnology, do you--are you emphasizing things like 
that? Or how does that work?
    Mr. Nathan. So one of our priority areas is health care, 
helping developing countries build more resilient health 
systems, is an important element of that, that can include 
therapeutic clinics, but it can also be involved in the 
manufacturing of vaccines, or pharmaceuticals, the distribution 
of medicines to rural and underserved communities, those are 
the kind of opportunities that we are looking at.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Well, thank you. We appreciate 
you and your staff's hard work.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. And thank you, Senator Boozman, thank you 
for your great partnership, and development work in Africa, and 
around the world, over now so many years together. I think we 
have done this 13 years together.
    Senator Boozman. A long time.
    Senator Coons. It is hard to believe, thank you for coming 
today.
    If I might, while we wait to see if there is one more 
member who wants to join us, I am going to ask a few more 
follow-up questions. I am specifically interested in vaccine 
production, one of the things that was striking to me about the 
arc of the global pandemic was that we faced a moment where 
vaccine nationalism emerged, and a number of countries, in 
Europe, and the United States, prioritized the development of 
abundant available vaccines for their own population before 
meeting pledges that had been made to the developing world, 
partly because of developments in India.
    But it opened a critical window where both China and Russia 
offered vaccines that were less effective, on complex terms 
that were often not favorable to the recipient country, and 
there was a 6- to 9-month period where I received dozens of 
pointed, and sometimes desperate calls from heads of State 
pressing for access to vaccine technology.
    Vaccines are an important part of human development, and 
public health. We are also likely at some point in our lives to 
face a comparable global pandemic. I am wondering what 
initiatives have been taken to provide some investment or 
financing, or whether that it is credible, in places around the 
developing world so that there is a more distributed global 
network of vaccine manufacturing?
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you, Senator. DFC, this is before I was 
there, but DFC pivoted and directed a huge amount of energy 
toward responding to the global pandemic, that did include 
supporting efforts for distributed vaccine manufacturing in 
Senegal, in South Africa, and in India.
    But now that the current pandemic has seemed to fade from 
the top of people's attention, we can't divert our focus from 
preparing for the next pandemic. Part of that is building 
resilient health care systems, and just the underlying 
development of countries I think is critical to that.
    But specifically on vaccines we are looking at broadening 
some of the investments that we previously made to be beyond 
COVID-19 response vaccines, but instead be funding available 
for a broader approach for the basic sort of health of 
societies for children, and for development.
    We worked with, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, we provided 
them with a revolver in order to place orders for vaccines 
prior to donor nation commitments coming in. And we are working 
with them again to think about how to reimagine that 
relationship to be broader in the way that you exactly referred 
to.
    Senator Coons. I would appreciate your keeping up with me 
on that development. One of the things we imagined when writing 
the BUILD Act, was that having equity investment capabilities, 
would also improve syndicating capabilities, partnering early 
stage with DFCs from the Nordic countries, from Japan, from 
South Korea, from our European partners; how is that 
proceeding? What are the limitations on it? Are there any 
additional supports you need either for the interagency or in 
terms of refunding, or legal authorities that would help make 
that real?
    Mr. Nathan. It is clear that that was one of the goals 
behind the BUILD Act, and we have worked hard to fulfill this. 
And I think we are doing a good job. There is a lot of work 
ahead though. Part of that is direct coordination. We have had 
numerous meetings with our counterparts at multiple levels, my 
level and at staff level to find ways that we can get 
efficiencies on due diligence, on deal sharing. This has been a 
productive activity.
    There are some examples of specific frameworks that I think 
could produce great results. One is focused on Ukraine, and I 
don't want to get ahead of an announcement but we announced in 
Japan, during the G7, a collaboration between EBRD, DFC, and 
the other DFIs in the G7, and I think there is opportunities to 
broaden this out.
    Another is a deal that I mentioned in my opening statement, 
which, along with our Japanese and Australian counterparts, we 
were able to fund the acquisition of digital assets in the 
South Pacific. These assets had received an unsolicited offer 
from a Chinese firm. It was important to the Australians, and 
as a result, clearly strategically important to the Japanese 
and to us, to support that effort.
    I think there is a lot more things like that we can do, it 
includes also some of the MDBs, so we are working closely with 
Inter-American Development Bank, with the EBRD, and others, to 
find ways to share deal flow, to get more efficiencies, and 
make greater impact.
    Senator Coons. As there is more and more conversation and 
there have been some actions to revise the World Bank, its risk 
tolerance, its structure, its prioritization, similarly in the 
IMF, I will be interested to have you keep me and others on the 
subcommittee up to date about that work in terms of the 
syndication.
    Two other quick questions, if I can, then I will turn to my 
friend and colleague, Senator Merkley. I think countering 
corruption is an absolutely critical part of what you are 
doing. I would welcome any input on how the offerings that you 
are making allow leaders in developing countries to not just 
have more transparency, better labor standards, better 
technology and skill transfer, but to push back on corruption, 
and what other supports, or partnership you need from either 
State Department, more broadly, Federal law enforcement, the 
private sector, to strengthen that piece of what you are 
bringing to the table?
    Because often the conversation about a large infrastructure 
project in a foreign country is complex, and there are some 
elements of a government that stand to benefit politically and 
professionally, and others that may stand to benefit 
personally. And those are very fraught conversations for a 
potential bidder, an American contractor to engage in, and it 
requires subtle and complex conversations. How are we doing at 
bringing the best of your capabilities, in terms of countering 
corruption, to the fore?
    Mr. Nathan. Thanks for the question. I believe that our 
adherence to high standards is one of our competitive 
advantages, actually. I think you are exactly right, that by 
having a commitment to high standards, labor, social, 
environmental, and integrity standards, it gives countries an 
opportunity to fight corruption, to highlight the problems they 
have, to contrast a difference.
    We work closely with post, our colleagues at embassies are 
critical for helping inform our work, on many questions, but 
particularly this one. We work closely with the intelligence 
community for our KYC, our Know your Customer, and other due 
diligence activities for vetting our potential partners. We 
have very high standards, and occasionally that means we have 
to pass on a deal, but more often than not it means that we are 
able to improve the structure of a deal, the partners we deal 
with, and provide an example in the countries where we operate, 
where working with the private sector, we can really set the 
tone in the way that you said.
    Senator Coons. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the 
DFC next year, I am interested in how you monitor that. Our 
ability to go around the world and say: We have got this great 
new tool, it has got great resources, it is delivering--is 
going to be tested. Folks will look back at some of the 
projects that have been financed and say, did they in fact 
meet, higher labor standards, higher skilled transfer, and 
higher transparency?
    How are you monitoring the outcomes of projects? And as you 
know, unfortunately, all too often in looking across a big 
portfolio, critics or the media are inclined to pull out one or 
two out of hundreds of projects that may have failed to meet 
the projected goals. How are you monitoring the actual 
implementation on the ground over these 5 years?
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. Well, I think you are right mistakes do 
happen, and we need to be prepared to handle them well. That 
that is what makes the difference, right, by being open and 
transparent, by having process internally and externally for 
dealing with that. That is the key to mitigating the damage 
that a mistake, or some future problem could have.
    You know, this is one of the things that the resources, 
that this committee has provided us with has really helped 
bolster. Our Office of Development Policy is actually the 
biggest area in DFC. That is where our investment monitoring 
takes place. We don't just need to do screening and analysis of 
the development impact, and all of the various standard 
concerns we have before making the investment, we need to stay 
engaged and measure in precisely the way that you are 
mentioning.
    And when things happen, if we didn't catch them, we still 
need to have a mechanism whether it is our public 
accountability mechanism, our openness with our Office of 
Inspector General, or other channels with our interagency 
partners, to make sure that when deals go in a direction that 
we wouldn't have wanted, that we handle that as effectively and 
proactively as possible.
    Senator Coons. I look forward to staying in touch with you 
about that, because anyone who has supervised a large portfolio 
project knows there is always a tail, there is always a few 
that go sideways. But as you said, exactly, how you monitor, 
how you respond, and then how you change policies and practices 
are critical.
    Senator Merkley, thank you.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
Mr. Nathan for coming and sharing your insights.
    I want to focus on the DFC's role in supporting fossil fuel 
projects. The report from April 2021 through March 22 had $217 
million directed towards fossil fuel projects; when is DFC 
going to quit financing all fossil fuel projects?
    Mr. Nathan. Senator there are situations where the funding 
of fossil fuel projects is within our mandate. For example, in 
response to Russia's brutal war on Ukraine, and under the 
European Energy Security and Diversification Act, we have 
increased our effort to find projects in Central Europe that 
help with energy security.
    We provided $400 million in political risk insurance to an 
entity that is providing gas in Moldova so that they can 
diversify away from their dependence on Gazprom. This is in 
response to the emergency situation that Moldova was in because 
of the war in Ukraine.
    Furthermore, and I referenced it earlier, DFC is currently 
financing the building of a gas-fired power plant the small 
one, 83 megawatts, in Sierra Leone, this project is highly 
developmental in a country that is incredibly poor, where 
providing access to electricity is a critical component of 
development. And while the major emphasis for DFC in providing 
access to electricity is in providing renewables, solar, 
geothermal, wind, we are looking at many nuclear projects, in 
some circumstances where there is no alternative and a highly 
developmental situation that can help bring a country out of 
poverty, we will still consider those situations.
    Senator Merkley. Yes. Well, I would suggest that you are 
missing the bigger picture. The amount of fossils that can be 
burned by humankind across the globe, and keep us below 1.5 
degrees centigrade, is microscopic now. And all the identified 
projects around the world already account for more than two 
times the amount that can be burned and keep us below 1.5, and 
40 percent more than will keep us below 2 degrees.
    And yet here we are continuing to promote one project after 
another. For example, DFC is supporting the LNG Pipeline and 
project in Vietnam, the DFC supporting the project in 
Mozambique, and supporting intermediaries that are supporting 
fossil fuel projects, and I think it was called the Three Seas 
Initiative.
    So here we are in a situation where my State is burning up, 
we have a national Paris commitment, we have a notional 
understanding that we need to get zero, we are building more 
fossil fuel projects, and yes, I certainly understand that you 
can create jobs in the fossil fuel world, but I recall this 
conversation with the Energy Minister in New Delhi, and this 
occurred during actually a trip that Chris and I were on 
together, and I did a little side trip to meet with him.
    We had had a conversation with the legislators from India 
at the Paris talks in 2015. And he was intent on developing 
some 40 new coal plants, and the gist of it was, I asked him 
what does it cost for a new kilowatt hour of coal? And he said: 
Seven cents, about seven cents.
    I said, how about for a new kilowatt hour of solar energy? 
And he said: About two to three cents. And I said: And those 
costs don't reflect what is outside your window? And he looked 
outside his window but he couldn't really see anything because 
of the pollution from burning coal. And you take into the 
health impacts, then the discrepancy was not seven cents versus 
two cents; it was some much larger number.
    And so the world is at this crisis point, and yet the DFC 
is doing exactly what we have to not do. And there seems to be 
a philosophy deeply embedded in the organization that somehow 
fossil gas is better for the climate than fossil coal, and that 
is simply, scientifically, untrue.
    In its lifecycle, because methane is such a heat collector, 
it is as bad as coal. Now, it is a very powerful organization, 
the fossil fuel world, but we have the biggest challenge ever 
presented to humanity in terms of the devastation we are doing 
to this planet, and the DFC has blinders on, and is continuing 
to support all these fossil projects.
    And there may be super-rare exceptions, but even in a 
situation where there has been war, it is an opportunity to 
rebuild, not on the old model, but on a new model, a new model 
of renewable energy with wind and solar, and in other places, 
for example, in the Rift Valley of Africa, tremendous 
opportunity for geothermal.
    So DFC could be a leader on the pathway the world has to 
take, or they can be anchoring us to exactly the wrong strategy 
that that puts us deeply invested in fossil gas, for a 
generation to come. That is my concern. I really think it is 
time to say that DFC has to rethink this strategy doing far 
more harm than good. And think about how those rising 
temperatures are devastating our coastlines, devastating our 
forests, devastating our groundwater, producing more powerful 
storms, devastating cities across America.
    All those are impacts that have to be taken into account 
too. And those facts, by the way, are not just in America, they 
are all over the world. And if we talk about development in 
Africa, the expanding drought and climate impacts in Africa are 
having enormous impact. The climate impacts in Central America 
are a major driving force of loss bean and corn harvest, 
driving people in the cities, where people cannot find work, 
where they are subject to drug cartels, and they are coming 
north to our border.
    And so while it may look like creating some significant 
number of jobs here, or solving a short-term crisis there, it 
is really time to rethink this underlying strategy.
    Mr. Nathan. Thank you, Senator. I think our area of 
disagreement is actually pretty small. I think there is a large 
agreement between us, of finding ways of addressing the climate 
crisis is a priority for DFC. Last year we did $2.4 billion of 
climate-linked investments.
    Last week our Board approved $144 million loan to a company 
in Ecuador, called Solar Aromo to build a 200 megawatt on-grid 
solar plant that will be the cheapest electricity in Ecuador.
    So I completely agree with you on that. We are engaged in 
diversifying the solar panel supply chain for manufacturing, 
from PRC, so that it is easier to do development of solar 
projects. Even in Ukraine we are currently considering 
providing political risk insurance to a number of wind projects 
which, when I was there, I have been there several times this 
year, these projects are still under construction in the 
western part of the country.
    So this is a huge emphasis from e-mobility, to geothermal, 
wind, solar, nuclear for us. It is the rare exception that you 
mentioned. Some of the projects you mentioned I think are not 
actually projects that we are doing, there is no LNG pipeline 
in Vietnam that DFC is financing. The Mozambique project was 
initiated in 2020. Our major emphasis is in the areas that you 
mentioned, and it is----
    Senator Merkley. Well, let us talk about Vietnam for a 
moment. The Saigon Times reported, January 14, 2023, that the 
U.S. International Development Finance Corporation were going 
to help Vietnam's decarbonization by financing transition to 
LNG. And while the details were not published, that the 
assumption is that supporting the Chan May LNG project, a 4,000 
megawatt gas-fired power project, the energy transition 
partnership, found that Vietnam can transition to clean energy 
without any new LNG development. Transitioning to LNG is not 
decarbonization.
    Mr. Nathan. Yes. So I don't know what that article is 
referring to. I mean, I just have to be frank about that.
    Senator Merkley. Okay. We will explore that, and see if 
that was a typo in the article, but it is the type of thing 
that certainly concerns me. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Merkley. And thank you 
for your persistent engagement on critical issues that matter 
to all of us.
    Thank you, Mr. Nathan. I appreciate your testimony today. I 
look forward to staying in close touch. You have had a wide 
range of questions from a wide range of Members of the 
subcommittee, which I hope reflects the degree of interest. 
Across many of us the common theme is that we want to see the 
DFC succeed, and be strategic, and be effective, and help with 
development, and help with the United States' overarching 
strategic goals. So I look forward to continuing our 
conversation and appreciate your valuable input.
    This hearing, the record will remain open for written 
questions until 5:00 p.m., on Wednesday, June 21. And with 
that, thank you.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
  Questions Submitted to The Honorable Scott Nathan, Chief Executive 
      Officer, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation
              Questions Submitted by Senator Jeff Merkley
    Question 1. What steps has DFC taken to implement its timeline for 
reaching net zero emissions by the year 2040? What will you do to 
ensure that the DFC ends financing for fossil fuels from all sources, 
including financial intermediaries, as well as midstream and upstream 
fossil fuel projects?

    Answer. As potential investments are driven by market demand on the 
ground, DFC expects the net emissions of DFC's portfolio to decrease as 
the proportion of mitigation, resilience, and adaptation investments in 
DFC's pipeline increases and as it potentially supports more 
investments that sequester carbon from the atmosphere, including 
forestry and agriculture. DFC can support a diverse set of technologies 
on a case-by-case basis with an eye towards significant developmental 
and strategic benefits. However, DFC believes that the commercial 
viability of nature-based solutions will increase, allowing the 
Corporation to scale its financing in zero and negative emitting 
investments.
    DFC has seen demand for its support in the alternative energy 
sector increase since its establishment. For example, on June 6, DFC's 
Board of Directors approved a $144 million loan to support the 
construction of a 200 MW solar photovoltaic power plant in Ecuador, 
which is expected to be amongst the lowest cost electricity in the 
country. This investment will be the first large-scale solar power 
project in Ecuador, demonstrating the financial and operational 
viability of solar investments in the country.

    1a. Can you share background information on the projects that DFC 
is counting as contributions to climate adaptation? (i.e. basic project 
background, amount of DFC support that advances adaptation, amount 
leveraged for adaptation, etc.).

    Answer. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, DFC committed $393.75 million to 
11 investments with adaptation and resilience interests.
    Examples include:

  --MCE Empowering Sustainable Agriculture Fund LLC (DFC $10 million, 
        all source funding $40 million): This debt fund is providing 
        financing globally to agribusinesses and rural farmers, 
        improving long-term food security in lower income countries.
  --Leap Agri Logistics in India (DFC $6.7 million, all source funding 
        $8.9 million): Greenfield loan to construct modern, resilient 
        grain silos leased to Food Corporation of India to deliver on 
        their food security mission and reduce food loss yielding 
        positive environmental impacts by avoiding carbon emissions 
        that would have been associated with producing the wasted 
        grain.
  --responsAbility Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Fund (DFC 
        $19 million, all source funding $350 million): Climate smart 
        investments for global small and medium businesses operating 
        across the food system, including in production, processing and 
        logistics, retail, and technology.

    1b. DFC recently approved a $500 million LNG project in Poland that 
will run until 2030, which is also the year by which the EU aims to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% below 1990 levels. The pipeline 
will likely operate for decades after. This project stands to further 
widen the gap between President Biden's $11.4 billion annual pledge in 
international climate financing and the mere $1.057 billion in 
bilateral and multilateral authorized by Congress for this use in FY 
2023, as every dollar of new fossil fuel investment means more future 
climate financing needed to counter emissions to stay within the global 
carbon budget. Please explain the DFC's justification for financing 
this fossil fuel project given the administration's shortfall in 
renewable energy projects, its climate pledges, and security risks 
associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels.

    Answer. The referenced DFC investment in Poland is a guaranty 
covering derivative obligations that represents an important 
contribution to broader U.S. government support for Ukraine and 
European energy security and is in line with the U.S.-EU Task Force on 
Energy Security. By helping European countries meet their energy needs 
and reduce dependence on Russian energy, DFC is supporting a needed 
alternative to Russian supplied energy sources.
    While DFC is supporting energy supply diversification projects for 
strategic foreign policy reasons, the Corporation is committed to 
supporting mitigation, resilience, and adaptation efforts. In FY22, DFC 
committed significant financing to investments that respond to the 
climate crisis (more than $2.3 billion).

    Question 2. There has been concern that the DFC's emissions 
accounting fails to assess the emissions of DFC projects over their 
entire life cycle, thereby underestimating the real climate impact of 
DFC investments. How would you evaluate the DFC's current emissions 
accounting, and what measures could the DFC take to more fully account 
for its carbon footprint?

    Answer. DFC and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, DFC's 
predecessor organization, have been tracking and reporting direct 
emissions from its carbon intensive investment portfolio since 2010. 
That accounting approach follows the methodology established by the 
industry standard Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. As noted, in the GHG 
inventory reports published on the DFC website, the accounting approach 
adheres to statutory obligations.

    2a. Does the DFC contract third party monitors to objectively 
assess DFC's carbon footprint and lifecycle emissions?

    Answer. Yes, DFC currently retains an independent firm to verify 
portfolio carbon emissions. The firm's GHG inventory certification 
letters are publicly posted on the DFC website.

    2b. Does DFC's life cycle analysis take into consideration not only 
the gas that is burned downstream but the leakage that occurs 
throughout the supply chain? How is DFC dealing with new science that 
is finding that methane leakage is significantly higher than previously 
thought?

    Answer. Yes, as part of the due diligence process, DFC conducts 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments of all infrastructure 
investments. The Corporation follows current industry guidance in 
assessing potential GHG impact.

    2c. How are Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)-driven opportunities 
around US clean energy development and deployment being leveraged by 
DFC to support a diversified, global clean energy economy?

    Answer. One area where DFC can support Inflation Reduction Act 
goals is in critical minerals. DFC's tools can support efforts to 
diversify and secure critical minerals supply chains, which are 
important to meet increasing global demand. For example, DFC provided a 
$30 million equity investment in TechMet Limited, building upon 
existing DFC support for the development of critical minerals and 
bolstering of supply chain security for the renewable energy 
transition.
    DFC is collaborating with other U.S. government agencies to 
identify opportunities to leverage investments for greater impact.

    Question 3. A leaked diplomatic cable suggests that there is 
interim guidance in place for climate policy on international public 
finance for energy. While the cable appears to rule out U.S. bilateral 
support for unabated and partially abated coal and other carbon-
intensive projects, there appears to be loopholes that could facilitate 
continued large-scale support for fossil fuels, particularly for gas.

    3a. Is that guidance going to be published, and if not, why not?

    3b. Does the guidance include a prohibition on indirect support, 
such as lending through financial intermediaries that finance fossil 
fuel projects?

    3c. Does the guidance prohibit U.S. support to natural gas 
projects?

    Answer. We refer you to the Department of State for questions 
related to its cables and other internal communications.

    Question 4. How does DFC conduct due diligence with partners and 
engage in local consultation processes to obtain the free, prior, and 
informed consent of Indigenous communities before approving any 
projects affecting their lands and territories?

    4a. How has the establishment of an independent Office of 
Accountability improved transparency and addressed concerns about 
environmental and social issues that arise around DFC-supported 
projects?

    Answer. DFC's Environmental and Social Policy and Procedures 
incorporates the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance 
Standards, which in turn define client responsibilities for managing 
environmental and social risks. IFC Performance Standard 7 focuses 
directly on Indigenous Peoples and outlines specific engagement 
responsibilities when there are potential adverse impacts to Indigenous 
populations. DFC specialists assess and monitor the process as the 
client implements the requirements under Performance Standard 7.
    The DFC Office of Accountability can further provide affected 
communities an opportunity to have concerns related to the project 
independently reviewed and addressed.

    Question 5. How is DFC prioritizing projects to address forest loss 
in the Amazon region, and what are regional DFC staff doing to source 
and develop these kinds of deals? We are aware of a new Brazilian 
representative of DFC and would like to know how they will be charged 
to focus on nature-based deals.

    5a. President Biden announced during the Major Economies Forum on 
Energy and Climate Change potential DFC financing of $50 million to 
help mobilize $1 billion for the BTG Pactual Timberland Investment 
Group's (TIG) Latin American reforestation investment policy milestones 
are satisfactory--and how can DFC scale more sustainable forestry and 
conservation projects like this one?

    Answer. The Regional Managing Director based in Sao Paolo, Brazil 
will support DFC business development activities generally across Latin 
America and the Caribbean with a focus on nature-based solutions. The 
Brazil-based officer will work closely with counterparts in Washington, 
DC, including an investment officer focused on nature-based solutions.
    DFC is conducting ongoing due diligence of the BTG Pactual TIG 
project and structuring the commercial terms for the loan. DFC hopes to 
be able to reach commitment on the investment this year.
    DFC is now evaluating its approach to overseas staffing and working 
closely with interagency partners to develop and implement a strategic 
plan for placing officers abroad where DFC can achieve the greatest 
impact. Part of DFC's strategic vision is to expand its on-the-ground 
presence so that DFC can be closer to potential clients.

                          SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS

    Senator Coons. This hearing is adjourned.
