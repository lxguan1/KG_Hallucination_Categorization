STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
    OF MICHIGAN, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
                    NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY

    Chairwoman Stabenow. I call this hearing of the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry to order. 
Welcome, everyone. I certainly welcome back the Secretary of 
the USDA, Secretary Vilsack.
    A couple of things first. One, I want to put into the 
record two different letters the Committee has received, one 
from nearly 300 energy organizations, including the Ag Energy 
Coalition and the National Rural Electric Association, in 
support of clean energy investments, and the second is from a 
diverse coalition of over 220 stakeholders and advocates in 
support of critical nutrition assistance programs. Without 
objection, those will be placed in the record.

    [The letters can be found on pages 68-82 in the Appendix.]

    Let me also begin this morning by welcoming our new Deputy 
Staff Director, Eyang Garrison. Welcome. We now have a full 
team. We have a full team of members that we welcome, all of 
our staff that are getting ready to write a wonderful 
bipartisan farm bill. As Secretary Vilsack knows, Eyang comes 
from the Department, and I thank him for sharing his talent. He 
calls it ``stealing,'' but we welcome that you have such 
wonderful, talented staff, and we are happy to have them join 
us at any time.
    Thank you again, in all seriousness, for being here and for 
your leadership, and the work of the nearly 100,000 dedicated 
public servants at USDA, is invaluable to American farmers, our 
rural communities, and our food systems that support millions 
of families. The Department's continued partnership with 
Congress will be absolutely essential to this Committee as we 
work to complete a bipartisan farm bill.
    I have always said that the farm bill is a jobs bill. That 
is especially true for the 46 million people who live in rural 
America. Since the last farm bill, we have made historic 
investments to address the unique challenges faced by these 
communities across the country.
    New funding for programs like ReConnect is improving rural 
America's access to affordable, high-speed Internet, creating 
new opportunities to connect people to jobs, education, and 
health care. Historic investments in affordable clean energy 
and energy efficiency upgrades are working to lower costs and 
create new, good paying jobs in these communities.
    We have also made progress to address the climate crisis by 
providing historic investments in longstanding, voluntary, and 
flexible farm bill conservation programs. For years, these 
popular, bipartisan programs have been oversubscribed and 
underfunded. New funding for programs like Environmental 
Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Regional Conservation 
Partnership Program (RCPP) is allowing us to finally address 
the backlog of initiatives and strengthen these programs.
    We also know that our farmers are facing traditional and 
novel challenges. While USDA projects that net farm income will 
remain above the 20-year average and many commodity prices are 
at historic highs, so too are land, fertilizer, and other input 
costs. This is making it challenging for our producers to 
maintain their operations.
    Since the last farm bill, farmers received $70 billion in 
assistance outside of farm bill programs, including over $13 
billion in response to weather and climate disasters that have 
devastated crops, forests, and livestock. This is why I will 
continue to fight to expand and strengthen crop insurance and 
the farm bill disaster assistance programs for all farmers. The 
future of our food systems rely on the investments we make 
today.
    The 2018 Farm Bill included strong investments in 
agriculture research, which helps our farmers develop the tools 
they need in the face of the climate crisis and other emerging 
challenges. These investments, as well as farm bill programs 
that support the next generation of farmers and agriculture 
professionals, are critical to the long-term success of 
American agriculture.
    We must also ensure that the farm bill continues to support 
the nutrition programs that serve as a lifeline to millions of 
people and families across this country. The Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides food assistance 
for more than 41 million Americans, 80 percent of which are 
children, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities.
    The bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill directed a long overdue re-
evaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan, which had not been done 
since 1975--almost 50 years ago. This update resulted in a very 
modest increase to the average SNAP benefit of about $1.35 a 
day, an increase estimated to lift 2.4 million people, 
including 1 million children, out of poverty.
    Spending on nutrition programs does not rob resources from 
other farm bill programs, just as crop insurance does not rob 
resources from other programs when disasters hit and spending 
goes up.
    Threats we are hearing from some, certainly not agriculture 
leaders, but some in the House of reckless mandatory budget 
cuts will result in cuts to all farm bill programs, and I know 
that is something that no one in this Committee wants. We 
cannot go backward at a time when our farmers and our families 
are counting on us to move forward.
    Turning to our national forests, let me finally just say I 
am pleased that Congress provided additional tools to the 
Forest Service in the 2018 Farm Bill. We provided for expedited 
treatment of forests impacted by insects and disease, built on 
the successful Good Neighbor Authority to create efficient 
partnerships between State and Federal foresters, and 
established competitive programs to fund source water 
protection and landscape scale restoration projects. These are 
very important tools to keep the health and growth of our 
forests.
    We know that only with the backing of a broad and 
bipartisan coalition of supporters--and broad, bipartisan 
support in Congress--can we craft a bipartisan farm bill that 
delivers for the American people. This is how we accomplish our 
shared goals of a strong agriculture economy that supports 
communities across the country. We are providing these 
communities with the tools that they need to thrive, and I am 
so pleased our Committee works so closely together to do that 
and partnership will be essential in the coming months, and so 
we welcome you again.
    I turn now to my friend, Ranking Member, Senator Boozman.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and we are pleased 
that we are having this hearing today. Welcome, Secretary 
Vilsack, back to the Committee. We appreciate all of your hard 
work, not only in this Congress but in past Congresses.
    I know everyone in this room has heard me say this before, 
but based on the last census, 53 of the 75 counties in Arkansas 
have lost population. That is 71 percent of Arkansas counties. 
Across the United States, 53 percent of our counties, or 1,660 
out of 3,140, lost population in the last census.
    I am certain that all my colleagues on this Committee are 
concerned about the hollowing-out of our States and our country 
and the impact that this will have on the future of America. I 
know this has been a major theme of yours, as you have talked 
across America in the last two years.
    At the end of this farm bill process, I would like to go 
back to rural Arkansans and tell them that we have put policies 
and programs in place that will improve their quality of life 
and give their children and their neighbors' children reason to 
return home. In my mind, ensuring this country has a vibrant 
and economically sustainable agricultural economy is key to 
accomplishing that goal.
    The headwinds for our producers are great. For only the 
third time in 55 years we are expected to have a trade deficit 
in agriculture, and no new trade deals have been signed or are 
under negotiation.
    This will be the most expensive crop on record at $460 
billion and follows last year's previous record of more than 
$440 billion.
    Farm debt is over half-a-trillion at $535 billion. Input 
costs are still high, supply chains are easing but remain 
tight, interest rates have rapidly increased and, by 
percentage, represent the largest cost increase our producers 
will face this year. Farm production costs have increased 28 
percent, or nearly $90 billion.
    Many do not understand the amount of capital required to 
farm these days. During the Fiscal Year 2022, the average size 
of the Farm Service Agency's guaranteed operating loans, often 
used for our young and beginning farmers and ranchers, was 
nearly $330,000.
    The capital cost of getting into agriculture is enormous 
and farmers are going to have to rely more heavily on credit 
this year. How many other jobs require that you take out a loan 
the size of a mortgage, or larger, each year? In order to pay 
that back, you must contend with the weather, the markets, the 
economy, and global politics. These are many of the reasons why 
when I meet with my farmers, they all tell me the ``safety 
net'' is badly frayed and needs to be reinforced.
    The 2014 Farm Bill was successful in moving agriculture 
away from direct payments to need-based support during times of 
low prices or low revenue. That was nearly a decade ago and 
farm programs have not kept pace with the needs of modern 
agriculture and are not responsive in the face of pandemics or 
geopolitical pressures. The current safety net does not reflect 
the current levels of risk taken on each year by those that 
provide the food, fiber, and fuel we depend on.
    As we address these risks, it is critical that we not get 
consumed by a small farm versus big farm conflict. While 89 
percent of the farms in the U.S. are classified as small by 
USDA and contribute nearly 18 percent of farm production, there 
are 3.2 percent of farms, classified as large, that contribute 
46.5 percent of our Nation's farm production. All farms are 
valuable. This farm bill will not neglect the small nor punish 
the large.
    We must also acknowledge that programs within this farm 
bill that relate to trade promotion, research, basic 
infrastructure in rural communities, bolstering the 
infrastructure to protect our flocks and herds, and so many 
other important programs must be considered. This farm bill 
covers much more than simply conservation, nutrition, and green 
energy, which have received a $300 billion windfall since the 
last farm bill.
    Before I close, I would like to mention one final issue, 
the importance of a productive, working relationship between 
Congress and the technical experts at USDA as we develop the 
farm bill.
    Senator Stabenow and I are proud of the accomplishments 
that we made in the last Congress and, in every instance where 
we have been successful, we have experienced constructive and 
timely technical feedback from USDA.
    The Keep Kids Fed Act, providing support for summer meals 
for children, and the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which 
Senator Braun led, Senator Braun and Senator Stabenow, are 
examples of the great things we accomplished, with USDA 
providing invaluable technical assistance.
    I am growing increasingly concerned about USDA's ability to 
provide timely responses, however. Just yesterday, I received a 
response to a letter I wrote to you in October, which was not 
entirely responsive. We really depend on USDA as we write the 
farm bill, because we need to understand how the policies we 
are considering would be implemented.
    We very much enjoy working with your staff, but again, the 
lack of responsiveness lately has been disappointing. It is not 
only for me. It is for members on our side of the aisle, and a 
lot of this is actually inquiries that are bipartisan 
inquiries. It is something that I would like you to look at and 
see if we can resolve because it really is going to be a key 
factor as we head into the farm bill.
    Thank you Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much, and again, thank 
you and welcome, Secretary Vilsack.
    Secretary Vilsack is no stranger to the Senate Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, having been the only member 
of President Obama's cabinet to serve all eight years, and he 
has reprised his role in the Biden administration, and we are 
very pleased about that. We are so fortunate to have his steady 
and experienced hand at USDA. As a former Governor of Iowa, a 
former member of the Iowa State Senate, and a former mayor of 
Mount Pleasant, Iowa, Secretary Vilsack, I know you know all 
too well the importance of the programs we are discussing here 
today, to rural America.
    Welcome again, and we recognize you for your opening 
comments.

   STATEMENT OF THE HON. THOMAS J. VILSACK, SECRETARY, U.S. 
          DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Secretary Vilsack. Madam Chair, thank you very, very much, 
and to Ranking Member Boozman, thank you for the opportunity to 
be here this morning. I look forward to the questions and 
dialog with the Committee.
    Make no mistake, you folks have a very difficult job. 
Crafting a farm bill is not an easy task, and it is 
particularly difficult in this day and age. I want to assure 
Senator Boozman that we will provide timely and effective 
technical assistance. I would ask of you, Senator, and your 
colleagues, that when you make requests for information that 
you really just simply target what you really want and not 
provide a laundry list of things that could be considered to be 
somewhat of a fishing expedition. I think that will help us be 
more helpful to you in providing technical assistance.
    I am going to put one issue on the table for you all to 
consider. The last two year of farm income were, in fact, from 
a net cash income perspective, a record set of years. Never 
before in the history of the country have we had net farm cash 
income at the level we have had the last couple of years, and 
as the Chairwoman indicated, we anticipate and expect above 
average net cash farm income this year, notwithstanding many of 
the challenges that Senator Boozman outlined accurately.
    The challenge, however, is this, that nearly 50 percent of 
our farmers did not make any money at all in those record 
years. In fact, they lost money. Another almost 40 percent of 
our farmers made money, but the majority of the money they made 
came from off-farm income. In records years, nearly 90 percent 
of our producers either did not make any money or did not make 
the majority of the money that they need to represent their 
families.
    This is not a small-versus-large situation. This is a 
situation where 90 percent of our farmers need help. I think if 
we are truly interested in making sure that they get help, 
while respecting the important role that large commercial-sized 
operations play in providing the productivity that this country 
needs and the world needs, and if we are truly concerned about 
the hollowing-out, as Senator Boozman has indicated, he is, and 
I believe he is, and I am too, of rural America, an important 
part of America, we have got to figure out how we can create 
more revenue streams for farmers, particularly those small and 
mid-sized producers. We have got to figure out ways in which we 
can extend beyond the traditional role of farmers benefiting 
from the sale of crops and livestock to figuring out additional 
ways in which that farmstead can generate profits so that they 
have multiple streams.
    This is not a new issue. I brought with me the first report 
of the Commission of Agriculture, that was published in 1863, 
the first year of the Department's history. In it, Commissioner 
Isaac Newton--not the real Isaac Newton, different fellow--had 
an interesting preface to the 632-page report, in which he 
talked about the importance of focusing on making sure that we 
had small, mid-sized, and large-scale farming operations. We 
have had this issue since 1863. Secretary Bergland, in 1979, 
issued a warning to all of us about the potential opportunity 
for exactly what we are talking about here today. This has been 
with us for a while.
    Fortunately, because of the passage of the American Rescue 
Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation 
Reduction Act, we now are in a position to create seed money, 
if you will, for the establishment of multiple ways of farmers 
to profit from the farm besides, and in addition to, the sale 
of crops and livestock, which will provide more hope and 
opportunity for small and mid-sized producers, and will create 
an entrepreneurial spirit which I think will be able to allow 
small communities to attract young people back for an 
opportunity to expand and increase the population.
    I am excited about this. I want to work with the Committee 
to ensure that as you are crafting this farm bill that we 
address this issue because I think it is an important one, and 
I think it has a rippling effect.
    I look forward to the questions that the Committee will 
ask, and with that, Madam Chair, I will yield back.

    [The prepared statement of Secretary Vilsack can be found 
on page 54 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much, and I so appreciate 
you focusing on the fact that we need to support farmers to 
have more opportunities on the farm, revenue streams on the 
farm, and I think that is a really important discussion and 
effort that we all need to work on together.
    I want to start, just because this has been a discussion on 
the Committee and other places, regarding SNAP, and just start 
from the beginning to say that we, in the 2018 Farm Bill, asked 
for the first update in 50 years for the Thrifty Food Plan. Did 
that update direct you to make sure that was cost neutral, Mr. 
Secretary?
    Secretary Vilsack. Madam Chair, we are following the 
prescription and direction of the Food and Nutrition Act of 
2008, passed by Congress, which directed us, and I will quote, 
``By the year 2022, and at five-year intervals thereafter, the 
Secretary shall reevaluate and publish the market baskets of 
the Thrifty Food Plan based on current food prices, food 
composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.'' 
There was no mention in the law that directed us to do the work 
that we needed to do about cost neutral. It basically said you 
are to do this every five years, with 2022 being the first 
iteration of this, and you are to focus on market baskets that 
reflect current food prices, food composition data, consumption 
patterns, and dietary guidance.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. You believe that the Department 
followed what is in the 2018 Farm Bill?
    Secretary Vilsack. We did.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Let me say that at other times updates 
did have language on cost neutral. This, on purpose, did not 
because there was an effort after 50 years to look at how we 
cook, very different patterns for cook, how we eat, what we do, 
food inflation, and all of that. It was meant to be more 
comprehensive.
    Let me ask you, last week our Committee heard from CFTC 
Chairman Behnam about the potential risk of fraud in emerging 
carbon markets due to a lack of regulation and guidance from 
the Federal Government. As you know, working with the 
Department--and we appreciate the technical assistance last 
year. We passed the Growing Climate Solutions Act that Senator 
Braun, Senator Boozman, and myself and others worked on, and it 
authorizes, by law, that we take first steps to protect farmers 
who engage in carbon markets.
    Can you tell us what USDA has done to implement the Growing 
Climate Solutions Act and what more the Department can do to 
ensure that carbon markets and credits they generate have 
integrity? I assume as you talk about more revenue streams that 
this is part of the options for our growers as well?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is correct, Madam Chair. We are 
focused on responding to the direction in the Growing Climate 
Solutions Act to provide a report to this Committee by August 
2023, and we are in the process of putting together the team 
that will essentially do the groundwork surrounding that 
report. We will also be looking at and doing a review of the 
existing carbon market system today.
    I think we are going to learn a great deal from the 141 
projects that we are funding under the Climate Smart Ag and 
Forestry Commodity Partnership Initiative, because many of 
those initiatives are also establishing and working on trying 
to maintain and support a variety of markets, not just carbon 
markets. There are roughly 24 regulated markets--not regulated 
markets--24 markets that exist today that we can take advantage 
of with climate-smart practices. Carbon markets are one of 
them. Water markets, biodiversity markets, a whole variety of 
markets.
    This is a strategy I think which is important and we want 
to get it right, but to get it right we have to understand 
where things are today, and then we have to determine whether 
or not there need to be improvements, and how we would, at 
USDA, ensure that farmer participation in these markets is 
appropriate.
    I would say one last comment, which is that we have to make 
sure that they are farmer friendly, that they are usable by 
farmers. Many of the carbon markets in the U.S. today are not 
really structured for farmers. They are structured for 
investment banks and so forth, and that does not really work 
very well in the countryside.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. It is so important that we 
have integrity in the measurements and the processes, so this 
is real. The good news is our farmers know--I remember in the 
last farm bill that corn growers brought us the demonstration 
project on healthy soil. The farmers know that the more carbon 
in the soil, the healthier it is, and the healthier it is for 
all of us because that carbon is not in the atmosphere, hanging 
around chasing weather disasters. It is certainly a win-win, 
and we want to make sure this has integrity.
    Secretary Vilsack. Every major commodity group is involved 
this partnership initiative, and we have nearly 100 
universities and colleges working to make sure that we do a 
proper reporting verification, measurement, monitoring of the 
results.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you.
    Talk a little bit more about local economies and supply 
chains. I know that you and the Department have done so much on 
this, and we have seen what happened as a result of the 
pandemic in broken supply chains. Our small and mid-sized 
farmers need new and better markets, and in Michigan we saw how 
impactful programs like the Meat and Poultry Processing 
Expansion Program worked to our Michigan turkey producers, 
supporting their work to expand local processing capacity.
    How do you anticipate recent investments in the food supply 
chain will improve local marketing opportunities?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, let me talk about the meat and 
poultry processing as an example. In addition to providing 
nearly 3,000 facilities assistance and help on inspection fees, 
we have also helped nearly 277 facilities expand market 
opportunities by allowing them to be able to sell across State 
lines, expanding their markets. We have announced 31 projects 
already, where we are providing grant money to expand or to 
build new processing capacity. That is going to strengthen 
local and regional food systems.
    We are not finished. We have more work to do. You will see 
more announcements over the next several months of additional 
projects that we are funding. You will see a second round of 
resources being made available. You will also see a round of 
resources being made available for non-meat and poultry 
processing opportunities.
    You are going to see a significant investment that we can 
make in strengthening the processing capacity, which creates 
additional markets. This is important, particularly for small 
and mid-sized producers, because it creates the opportunity for 
them to negotiate, to have a different market opportunity, to 
be in a situation where there is competition for whatever it is 
they are growing and raising. Unfortunately, in too many parts 
of the country today there is just a single market and you have 
got to take the prices of whatever it is on that particular 
day.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. As we are looking at the 
next farm bill, I look forward to hearing any suggestions you 
have about how we should be expanding that effort or extending 
the life of the programs. I certainly hear from a Michigan 
perspective that this is something of great interest to folks.
    At this point I am going to turn to Senator Boozman. 
Indicate to the Committee, I think everyone is aware, we have 
extended the questions to seven-minute rounds rather than five, 
so we have ample opportunity to talk to the Secretary.
    Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mr. Secretary, in regard to the no-direction in the law 
with the Thrifty Food Program, I guess the problem with that is 
that the--no-direction law regarding it being revenue neutral. 
Yet through the technical assistance process, which USDA is 
intimately involved in, CBO determined that it would be revenue 
neutral based on the information that USDA gave them during 
that administration.
    I understand your argument, but I just do not think it 
holds water. I do not think that Secretary Perdue thought that 
this was going to be a revenue producer of $300 billion, nor 
did anybody on this Committee. Those are the facts, and that is 
really what GAO alluded to in their report.
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, with all due respect I do not 
think I necessarily am bound by what Senator Perdue decided 
while he was Secretary.
    Senator Boozman. You are bound by what this Committee 
wanted to do, what CBO wanted to do, and we are not bound by 
you finding loopholes to try and do things as you wish.
    Secretary Vilsack. Not a loophole, Senator. We are 
basically taking a look at the law that was passed by Congress, 
directing us to take into consideration a number of factors, 
and one of those factors is consumption patterns, which have 
changed. One of those factors is current food prices, which 
clearly were different than they were 45 years ago. Part of it 
has to do with the activity of families. Part of it has to do 
with the mix of what families are purchasing.
    To the Chairwoman's comments, you know, there was a time 
when it was assumed that people were spending an hour and a 
half preparing food from scratch, and that was the basis upon 
which the Thrifty Food Plan was initially created. Well, I am 
pretty sure----
    Senator Boozman. No, no. I----
    Secretary Vilsack [continuing]. that is not the case today.
    Senator Boozman [continuing]. but I agree with all of that. 
My point is that when you are going to spend $300 billion, you 
come to Congress and you say, ``This is a problem. We need to 
address it. Let us work together to sort it out.'' I am not 
saying that it did not need to be updated or necessarily that 
we did not need to spend some money. The idea that an agency 
can spend $300 billion without congressional direction--the 
Inflation Reduction Act was only $750 billion. This was a 
massive amount of money, and it was not done right.
    In regard to the comment that I made, getting technical 
assistance and the answer to simple questions, you all do not 
get to decide what is a fishing expedition. We have the right 
to ask questions. We have got 50 outstanding questions. We have 
got a bunch of technical assistance that people are trying to 
write bills from, and again, we simply are not getting the 
information.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I do not think that is a fair 
evaluation, Senator, of the work that we have done over the 
last two years to try to be responsive to concerns that you 
have expressed. For example, you expressed concerns about a 
situation in Dumas, Arkansas, and our team has worked----
    Senator Boozman. You did a wonderful job in that regard-we 
appreciate it.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, and that is an example of us 
willing to work with you when there is a need and an issue. We 
are more than happy to provide the information that you need, 
to craft a bill, to improve a bill, to determine whether or not 
a provision should be included in a bill.
    Senator Boozman. Well, I will be glad to make the list of 
the 50, and again, it is not me. It is us. I would say--they 
would have to speak for themselves, but both sides are having 
this problem.
    I would like to discuss the Climate Smart Commodities Pilot 
Program. This is something that we are hearing from producers. 
Can you tell us which agencies within USDA, and which agencies 
or offices within the Federal Government, such as EPA or the 
White House's Counsel on Environmental Quality or any other 
agency will have access to the data generated under the 
projects?
    Secretary Vilsack. The information that is going to be 
requested from the projects will be funneled through the 
project leader. Each of these 141 projects have a leader. Those 
leaders will essentially accumulate the information, and we 
will provide cumulative data. It is not a situation where 
specific information on a particular farmer's farm is going to 
be provided or shared. We will have cumulative information 
because we want to know what works and what does not work.
    Senator Boozman. Who will control the data, and who is 
responsible for its protection as well as the protection of the 
producer privacy?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are running this program primarily 
through our Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission 
area, National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) obviously 
being involved, Farm Service Agencies are involved.
    Senator Boozman. Will the producers be made aware of how 
the data that is generated from projects they are involved in, 
how it may be used?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Senator Boozman. Okay. Very good.
    Current law allows States to waive the time limit for able-
bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) when they have more 
than 10 percent unemployment when an area does not have a 
sufficient number of jobs to provide employment for the 
individuals. How do you define a ``sufficient number of jobs''?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, as a former mayor and a Governor, 
you have a general sense of your State or a general sense of a 
region within your State that has suffered a particular 
circumstance or situation. We are dealing with some of those 
circumstances right now as we speak, in Ohio and western 
Pennsylvania. You know the impact of a disaster. You know the 
impact of a plant closing. You know the impact of high 
unemployment in a particular specific area of the State or 
across your State. You keep track of that every single month. 
You are aware of the economic circumstances within your State, 
and that is, I think, the basis upon which Governors make the 
decision to request the waiver or not.
    Senator Boozman. When will you start accepting ABAWD 
waivers?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think at this point the current 
State is based on the public emergency declaration which 
expires in May. I would assume at that point in time States 
that are faced with a circumstance or situation where they deem 
it appropriate to request a waiver, will request it, we will 
then make a determination whether it is appropriate or not.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Senator Durbin.
    Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and Mr. 
Secretary, it is good to see you. You and I have had several 
discussions about SNAP benefits for people who are gathering 
together and whether or not they are appropriate under the law. 
I asked one of your staff leaders in the Department of 
Agriculture, and she said that despite the fact that the agency 
had paid out these SNAP benefits for 20 years it was the result 
of a mistake.
    We are now trying to resolve this so that these elderly 
people in my State, some 8,000 of them, are not denied basic 
food benefits, and I hope that you will continue to work with 
us to try to find a solution to this problem.
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, sir.
    Senator Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, we all know, you 
and I know the Midwestern farmers better than most, and know 
that they need solid proof before they are convinced of most 
things. Ten years ago I started asking visiting farmers a very 
basic question in the groups that came, Farmers Union, Farm 
Bureau and such: Do you believe that human activity has any 
impact on our climate and environment? To be honest with you, 
for several years no one raised their hand. There was some 
skepticism about that premise. I think things are coming 
around, and I hope they are.
    I want to ask you the policies of the Department of 
Agriculture and proposals in the farm bill when it comes to two 
or three basic things. One of the issues is the creation of 
solar farms. Farm organizations are arguing that it takes prime 
farmland out of production and, therefore, they are opposing 
solar farms. We all know that that is, on its face, a true 
statement in most cases, but we also know that many other 
factors relate to the removal of prime farmland from 
production.
    Do you see a way that we can deal with marginal or 
unproductive land as a source in rural areas for solar farms 
and get engagement from our farming community in this national 
effort?
    Secretary Vilsack. I do, Senator, and the reason I do is 
because of the Inflation Reduction Act and the historic amount 
of resources provided under the Real Estate Investment Trust 
(REIT) program, which could create the basis upon which farms 
could be established.
    I think it is important for us to encourage the utilization 
of that opportunity on highly erodible land, on land that is 
not as productive as it needs to be or should be, and as a 
result can create a new revenue stream for farm families. I 
think it is also important for us to look at our Conservation 
Reserve Program (CRP) program in that same vein.
    I also think it is important for us to look at creative 
ways in which those solar farms could coexist with additional 
operations. I know that there are many sheep operations that 
essentially combine solar farms and raising of sheep. The sheep 
basically maintain the vegetation, and then that sheep then 
become processed for local and regional food system. There are 
creative ways to have solar farms and a livestock production 
operation, for example.
    Senator Durbin. I want to explore that. I also want to 
address one other aspect. As of October, maybe September, of 
last year, my wife and I became electric power generations in 
the city of Springfield, Illinois, by installing solar panels 
on the roof of our home. We are not the first in the city to do 
it but the first in our neighborhood, for sure. The net impact 
is that our electric bill has gone down from $115 a month to 
$15 a month, and that is good news for us, and I think shows 
that the investment was worthwhile.
    I started asking the question of farmers who visited, 
whether they were looking into this concept of net metering, 
and I can recall one farmer said to me that he wanted to 
install a major solar panel array on this 3,000-head hog 
operation and benefit from that metering because he ran fans 
24/7 for the livestock.
    He ran into a problem. It turned out the electric co-cop 
did not have transmission lines sufficient to deal with net 
metering, and so we are still trying to help him and there may 
be a way out. The problem is if we have to deal with each 
farmer connecting up to the proper transmission arrangement it 
becomes prohibitive.
    You mentioned the REIT program. The REIT program is very 
good but it deal with the farmer on the farm and it does not 
deal with distribution lines, as I understand it. Is that your 
understanding too?
    Secretary Vilsack. That is correct, but there is another 
part of the Inflation Reduction Act that does potentially 
respond to your concern, which is the effort to help RECs 
decarbonize their generation capacity. We have a significant 
opportunity that can leverage resources under the Inflation 
Reduction Act to encourage RECs to convert from fossil fuel-
based generation systems to renewable systems, which in turn 
would result in the need for the infrastructure necessary to 
make that happen.
    Senator Durbin. Are you aware of any electric co-ops in 
rural areas that are pursuing this?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are just beginning the process 
because of the passage of the law. I think you will see and 
hear more about that later this year as we begin the process of 
reaching out to RECs and making a request for application and 
see what kind of interest there may be.
    Senator Durbin. Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. 
Thanks, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Ernst.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for being here today.
    We have heard a lot about how the Administration really 
wants to support rural America, but bottom line, we are not 
seeing a lot of action so far. We have seen a lot of spending, 
a lot of spending, and Iowans, you know, are feeling as if they 
have been thrown under the bus and not really seeing the 
benefit. A lot of the proposals and laws that I hear about when 
I am out doing the 99-county tour, when we are doing the farmer 
roundtables, to help support what we are doing in the farm 
bill, I hear a lot about the so-called Inflation Reduction Act 
and how a lot of how that was written really reads like the 
Green New Deal. As we are looking at the farm bill we want to 
make sure that what we are doing in the farm bill is actually 
working with our farmers, with our ranchers, for their benefit, 
not the folks on the far left, on the coasts of the United 
States. This is about middle America and providing food 
necessary for the greater population.
    We know that this Administration is focused heavily on 
green energy, which on its own that is great, but there is such 
an ardent push toward electric vehicles, and you know how I 
feel about ethanol, that we have this ready-made, available 
resource in the Midwest that is cheaper. It is a cheaper energy 
solution than some of the proposals such as the electric 
vehicles. We really feel that it deserves full attention. I 
know ethanol biodiesel does not fall under the jurisdiction of 
this particular Committee but it is something that is very 
beneficial for our farmers.
    The President has been very insistent on returning to a 
number of harmful, overreading regulations, and again, as I am 
out across every one of my counties--and you know those 
counties very well--every one of those counties, when I do a 
town hall, when I do a farmer roundtable, Waters of the U.S. 
(WOTUS) always comes up. Here we are returning to the Obama-era 
regulations of WOTUS. It does not matter what group it is--
farmers, small business owners, county secondary roads 
personnel--they are all just very upset about WOTUS 
regulations, and they feel they have not been heard.
    Folks are struggling, Mr. Secretary. They are struggling in 
Iowa. They are spending more, they are getting less, and 
especially in the most rural of our communities. We have got to 
stop the out-of-control partisan spending. We need less 
regulations, not more.
    I want to focus on our livestock sector because this is 
maybe where you can help us out here. Secretary Vilsack, the 
livestock producers were hit very hard during the pandemic. I 
have experienced a lot of hardships through various times and 
trials during my time here at the Senate, but the pandemic was 
probably the hardest, to sit through Zoom calls and conference 
calls with our farmers and those that were going out and 
culling herds and their livestock because of plant closures.
    During that tough time a lot of the producers sought to 
capture a greater share of the retail meat dollar by joining 
with other producers to build packing plants that they supply 
and own. As you know, Iowa is home to Cattlemen's Heritage, 
which is building a state-of-the-art facility in Council 
Bluffs, Iowa, down near me, and West Liberty Foods, which is 
building a new producer-owned turkey processing plant in West 
Liberty, Iowa. In our neighboring State of Nebraska there are 
similarly processed beef processing startups that are producer 
supplied and producer owned.
    The USDA created the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion 
Program to expand small and regional meat processing, to 
bolster supply chain resiliency. As you have described, quote, 
``will give farmers and ranchers a fair chance to compete in 
the marketplace,'' end quote.
    Thus far grants totaling $157 million have been awarded, so 
that is a good thing. We have got grants going out the door. 
Three of the largest grants total $69 million, which comprised 
nearly half of the funds award.
    Now again, a lot of money has gone out the door. We think 
that is a good thing. Nearly half of it has only gone to 
three--three--projects, who are privately owned by some of the 
wealthiest people in the United States. One of the projects in 
Nebraska is owned by a man on the Forbes billionaire list, 
another in Idaho is owned by the wealthiest man in the State of 
Idaho, and a project in South Carolina is being awarded to a 
privately held family business with production in five States.
    Hey, I have no objection to families succeeding and owning 
a lot of businesses, and I wish them great success. What I find 
problematic is that taxpayer dollars are being doled out as 
free grants to billionaires while applications from farmer-
owned startups like Cattleman's Heritage in southwest Iowa and 
West Liberty Foods expansion are deemed unworthy through these 
grants.
    Mr. Secretary, what is the criteria that has been used by 
USDA to determine who is getting grants, and why are we seeing 
that billionaires are being awarded those grants over smaller 
owned startups?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, first of all, the Iowa project 
you mentioned is actually on the list that is currently under 
review, and we are in the process of finishing the 
environmental review that is required under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) before grants can be issued. 
Just be patient. I think you are going to find that that is a 
project that merits additional investment that is going to be 
forthcoming.
    The level of investment is based on the application that 
people submitted. Some of these plants are very small. A 
Charles City plant, for example, very small. It needed $8 
million and we provided it. A Cherokee plant needed several 
million dollars; we provided it. Iowa has received several 
grants already and I anticipate and expect they are going to 
receive at least one more, for sure. Then there is the 
circumstance of the second round of resources.
    The criteria is based on independently owned, that they are 
not part of the big four packing operations. We obviously are 
investing in farmer-owned cooperatives that are in processing. 
We are very conscious of where the need is, based on the 
consolidation of livestock operations and the livestock that is 
being raised. We are trying to make sure that we are doing a 
good job of spreading this out in a way that actually meets the 
market demand and provides these producers more than one 
market.
    We are excited about this. We think the 31 projects we have 
funded already are good projects and are going to expand market 
opportunities, but we have not stopped. There are going to be 
more. For sure there are going to be more, a lot more.
    Senator Ernst. I appreciate that, and thank you. I think it 
is important that we have support to some of these smaller, 
again, farmer-owned, operated facilities. I think the 
discouraging part is when we do see such incredibly large 
producers, those that are on the billionaire list, receiving 
rather than a loan, they are receiving the free dollars from 
our taxpayers. We can certainly talk through that as we look at 
some of these programs for renewal in the farm bill.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Lujan.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Chair. I really appreciate this. 
First, good morning to you and the Ranking Member and to 
everyone here. Mr. Vilsack, Mr. Secretary, thank you for being 
here as well.
    Last time you were before the Committee, as you may 
remember, New Mexico was facing some really large fires, the 
largest in our State's history. I just want to say I appreciate 
your support and your help to keep in mind the families of New 
Mexico and the challenges that those families are facing. Thank 
you for that.
    As you would suspect, not all families have received all 
the support that I hoped that we will be able to work together 
to ensure that they benefit from. The way that the teams are 
working now, I just wanted to recognize that.
    Secretary Vilsack, the questions that I have are 
surrounding that fire, and the first one I have is, when the 
Federal Government is responsible for a disaster, like they 
were in this case, such as this wildfire, does the Federal 
Government have the responsibility to support the recovery?
    Secretary Vilsack. Absolutely.
    Senator Lujan. Can I count on your support to ensure that 
everyone in your Department knows that getting New Mexico the 
resources needed to meet the needs of residents is a priority 
of the Administration?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes. In fact, Senator, we worked with 
your Governor to establish an opportunity for there to be a 
meeting where we had multiple agencies and mission areas from 
USDA present that would allow an easy time for folks to fill 
out the applications and to figure out what potential benefits 
there might be and help there might be. We continue to look for 
ways in which we can be helpful.
    Senator Lujan. I very much appreciate that.
    Last month, the USDA's Equity Commission released a 37-page 
report with 32 recommendations designed to advance racial 
equity among USDA's programs, and I applaud the initiative. In 
order to better implement these recommendations accurate data 
matters. I want to applaud and encourage that deep dive.
    In March 2022, I sent a letter to USDA asking for a 
breakdown for New Mexico based on gender, race, ethnicity for 
farmers and for programs, and earlier this year I received a 
response, and the numbers concern me. They are a bit startling 
for me in New Mexico, and one of the reasons is this. Hispanic 
or Latino producers constitute about 34 percent of the farms 
back in New Mexico. Yet in 2022, they received only 9.5 percent 
of guaranteed loans and 22 percent of direct loans. Now this 
one program shows where there is room for improvement.
    Secretary Vilsack, what is USDA planning to do to address 
this longstanding problem and how can Congress support those 
initiatives?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, one of the challenges we have 
is getting information out about the various programs at USDA 
so people can apply. We have entered into contracts with 85 
separate organizations in which we are asking those 
organizations that have connections to communities--Hispanic 
communities, African American communities, et cetera--asking 
them to assist us and help us in getting information out to 
people about programs and then providing guidance for those 
folks in terms of how to apply.
    I think over the course of the next several years our hope 
and belief is that we are going to see more folks walk through 
the door, more folks understand what they have to have to be 
able to successfully apply for resources and more folks getting 
resources. Everyone in our team understands the importance of 
making sure that we are providing the kind of help and 
assistance that people need. The cooperators is one area.
    The second area is NRCS, our conservation folks. Now the 
first operation is the folks who do the loan programs, FSA. 
NRCS has a series of contracts as well, with over 100 
organizations, to do virtually the same thing in terms of 
conservation and conservation investments. We are trying to do 
a better job of expanding outreach.
    The third thing we are doing is working with Hispanic-
serving organizations and HACUs, universities, trying to make 
sure that they also understand that they have an opportunity to 
help us with extension. We are looking for ways in which we can 
provide assistance. We have just recently hired a series of 
liaisons to work with a number of those universities to be able 
to provide more extension services. There is a massive outreach 
effort right now.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Mr. Secretary, along 
those lines my office has invited USDA to participate in some 
educational sessions, and your team has been very open, and 
those sessions have been welcomed by farmers and families 
across New Mexico. I appreciate that and I will make sure we 
are doing more along those lines as well, to partner with you 
and get that word out and see what we can do to also do our 
part to increase applications.
    Secretary Vilsack. We have also simplified the application 
process. It was, I think, 29 pages. It is now 13, still 
probably too long but better than 29.
    Senator Lujan. Well, and as you clearly know, that was one 
of the challenges with some of the programs out there. There 
was one that we worked on together here for help with the 
acequias for the irrigation programs, and the first 
application, when I went to visit the acequias in Mora, New 
Mexico, one of the communities that was hit by the fire, one of 
the folks came in with boxes of paperwork, and they said, ``We 
can't do this again.'' USDA responded and were working to 
streamline that. I know that progress has been made in each of 
the farm bills, and the Chair helped me quite a bit, when I was 
in the House, to get some support to them. I look forward to 
working with you more in that space.
    Secretary Vilsack. Language is also an issue. The report 
that you mentioned was the first major report that was 
published both in English and Spanish.
    Senator Lujan. I very much appreciate that.
    Madam Chair, I do have some questions in the area of SNAP. 
I just want to emphasize that in New Mexico about 40 percent of 
the SNAP beneficiaries are children, and they do not get a say 
over how much folks are making and whatnot. I think we all 
agree that kids that are going to school with something in 
their belly is a good thing, or when they are there and they 
are more attentive. I certainly hope that we can come together 
as a body, as a family here, to make sure that we are working 
in that regard.
    It is also a program that benefits rural producers, and the 
more that we can do that and concentrate on kids and work on 
creating more certainty for farmers, especially in rural parts 
of the country, I think that is a winner for all of us. I know 
it will be a discussion, but I certainly hope that we find some 
common ground there.
    The last piece I wanted to touch on, Mr. Secretary, as time 
runs out here, and I think I will just mention it, is the work 
that is being done, and Senator Bennet is really leading these 
efforts, Senator Hickenlooper has worked on some working groups 
here, but especially in the area of drought and what must be 
done in Western States as well as we look at this. I certainly 
look to being part of that conversation, working with Senator 
Bennet however I can, as he is continuing to lead the charge.
    Just know he is not alone and there are going to be more 
and more members that are going to be pushing with him.
    Secretary Vilsack. Madam Chair, can I, just 30 seconds on 
this?
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. We just issued the Water in the West 
Working Lands document at USDA, which is going to drive our 
efforts in terms of drought in the West. We have identified six 
major challenges that producers face, everything from 
forecasting to more precision utilization of irrigation, and 13 
different strategies that we are going to provide resources. 
Again, the Inflation Reduction Act and the conservation 
resources that are in that act can help fund that, and so we 
are interested. We have also recently announced $25 million 
toward the WaterSMART Initiative the Department of Interior has 
in terms of drought. There is a specific focus on drought 
coming out of the USDA.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Marshall.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Madam Chair, and welcome back 
to the Ag Committee, Mr. Secretary.
    On behalf of my farmers and ranchers I just want to say 
thanks for you being a strong voice at the White House, 
interacting with the Administration, especially where the EPA 
meets agriculture. The EPA reached out to USDA for comments on 
Atrazine mitigation practices on March 1, 2022. Your Office of 
Pest Management recommended EPA add additional mitigation 
practices and augment some others.
    In the proposed rule ultimately published by the EPA, none 
of the edits--let me say that again--none of the edits or 
suggesting mitigations from USDA were involved or included. EPA 
similarly has not considered your comments on rodenticides as 
well as Chlorpyrifos. Considering EPA is refusing to 
meaningfully consider USDA OPMP's comments, would you support 
legislative action requiring them to respond to your career 
experts on pesticide issues publicly in the Federal Register?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think it is important to have a 
respectful relationship between two agencies, Senator. I think 
it is important for us to continue to have the opportunity to 
provide input in terms of the impact of whatever EPA is 
considering. I would hope that under circumstances they would 
consider the career folks at USDA because they come with good 
information and good data.
    I think it would be interesting to see how you would craft 
that in terms of one department basically overruling another 
department. I am not sure I want the EPA telling me how to run 
the Department of Agriculture. I would just be careful in terms 
of value.
    Senator Marshall. Do you feel like the EPA is listening to 
your experts?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think they are in some circumstances. 
There is an honest dispute and disagreement from time to time, 
and the response that I have to that, Senator, is when there is 
a disagreement and EPA enacts whatever they are going to enact, 
then it is our job at USDA to do what we can to mitigate the 
consequence of that, to sue the resources, the programs that we 
have, if possible, to mitigate the consequences.
    Senator Marshall. In order to utilize environmentally sound 
practices like no-till farming, which we have been doing for 
over 20 years on our family farm, we have to have use of these 
pesticides. Otherwise, we are going to have to go back to 
plowing which creates an increased carbon footprint.
    Do you feel like the EPA is balancing this issue of carbon 
footprint? They are using their practices. We are going to have 
to plow the ground, which we know is a huge carbon sink.
    Secretary Vilsack. We have raised that issue with them, 
repeatedly.
    Senator Marshall. What do they say?
    Secretary Vilsack. They have a disagreement with us, 
Senator.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you.
    Next question. Before the Eighth Circuit, attorneys for the 
Justice Department suggested that USDA are not experts on the 
uses of pesticides. They used this argument to try to convince 
the Eighth Circuit judges to ignore a letter you sent to former 
Representative Hardister and Members of Congress standing by 
the science of pesticides.
    Specifically, as your Department is working with USTR to 
end the GMO ban by Mexico, do statements like these harm your 
efforts to advocate for American farmers?
    Secretary Vilsack. It makes it difficult because it creates 
confusion.
    Senator Marshall. I appreciate that.
    Next question is about the Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) discretionary fund. About a year ago we sent a letter to 
the GAO with our farmers' concerns--these are not my concerns. 
These are my farmers' concerns--about the way the USDA has been 
using the CCC. While I am still waiting on the response I am 
worried that the farm bill negotiations will be hindered, 
especially if you believe that the USDA can use the CCC for 
programs that we ultimately decide not to include in the farm 
bill.
    How can we be confident in negotiating good faith if USDA 
continues to create programs without congressional approval 
under CCC discretionary fund use?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, to be clear, Senator, we do not 
create programs without making sure that they fall within the 
direction that Congress has provided in creating the CCC. For 
example, when we did the Partnership Initiative, it is focused 
on creating market opportunities, which is clearly within the 
purview of the CCC, as established by Congress.
    We are not working outside the bounds of what you all have 
created and directed CCC to do. I will tell you, it is an 
incredibly wonderful tool to respond to things like a need for 
fertilizer, the need for us to expand production of fertilizer 
here in the U.S. CCC is giving us the opportunity to create 
resources that will allow us to be more self-reliant on 
fertilizer, and hopefully over time reduce the cost of that to 
producers.
    We are very careful to--well, there are two issues here. We 
are very careful to stay within the statutory language that 
authorizes the CCC expenditures, and we never, ever, ever put 
at risk the farm bill programs that require CCC funding.
    Senator Marshall. Certainly again we agree on the same 
goals. We certainly believe that fertilizer costs are a huge 
input problem right now. The No. 1 driver of that is the cost 
of energy. Certainly our farmers and ranchers feel like how you 
are using the CCC is outside of the law, and I think that we 
need to be able to better understand that.
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, with all due respect, when we 
did the Partnership for Climate-Smart Agriculture Initiative we 
had the farmer and the rancher and the Food Alliance, which was 
made up of the major commodity groups--Farm Bureau, National 
Farmers Union, Corn Growers, Soybean Growers. In fact, they 
were participating as participants in this effort--say to us 
two things. One, ``Mr. Secretary, do this. Do it in a 
voluntary, incentive-based, market-based way,'' and two, ``Mr. 
Secretary, fund it through the CCC.'' These are the major farm 
organizations telling us how to fund this.
    Senator Marshall. I appreciate that.
    Last one is on trade. Yesterday the Senate confirmed a new 
Ambassador to India. We are lacking strong trade agreements 
with India, EU, and the U.K. right now, and this Administration 
has not asked Congress for a new TPA (Trade Promotion 
Authority), as well.
    What concrete steps have you taken or do you intend to take 
to convince the Administration to open up new markets for 
American agriculture, especially when your department is 
predicting a record agriculture trade deficit?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, to be clear, the last two years we 
have had record exports in agriculture.
    Senator Marshall. Because of commodity prices, but go 
ahead.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, nevertheless, they are records. 
The challenge, I think, is to build trust in this country in 
trade. Farmers understand the importance of trade because of 
historic surpluses. They understand it, they appreciate it, but 
that is not true of all industries and not all parts of the 
country. There are folks who believe that trade is not----
    Senator Marshall. Do you have any concrete steps that you 
can let us know what is happening on the trade side of 
agriculture?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure. There is the Indo-Pacific 
Framework. There are negotiations with the EU on a variety of 
SBS issues. There is the issue involving Canada and trying to 
make sure that they live up to the USMCA with dairy. There is 
the issue in Mexico in terms of the ability to assure that 
biotech corn can be used. There are tariff reductions in 
Vietnam that resulted in more pork sales. There are additional 
issues in Central American countries where we have created 
additional opportunities.
    There is a whole variety of things going on in the trade 
front that do not necessarily require free trade agreements, 
but they do require breaking down barriers. They do require 
restoring trust. They do require saying when we have a trade 
agreement we are going to enforce it, and that is precisely 
what we are doing with USMCA.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and I yield 
back, Madam Chair. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Bennet.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. It is 
good to see you again. Thanks for coming back.
    It will not surprise you to know that I am going to start 
with drought, our 1,200-year drought in the Rocky Mountain 
West. We reintroduced our bill to protect our watersheds and do 
what needs to be done with our national forests, the Protect 
the West Act, this week. I was very pleased that we were able 
to work together to include $10 billion, when you combine the 
money in infrastructure bill and in the Inflation Reduction Act 
for pre-fire mitigation for forest health, for all of that. 
That is a big chunk of money. It is an unprecedented amount of 
money. It is a lot less than the $60 billion that we spent the 
last five years fighting fires in the West. As you know, and I 
know you know this, it is a much cheaper way of dealing with 
the issue that we are confronting.
    I wonder if you could just give the Committee an update 
about how you guys are thinking about spending that money, 
getting it on the landscape, and making sure we make the most 
of what Congress has appropriated.
    Secretary Vilsack. The first thing that we needed to do, 
Senator, was to identify where the most significant fireshed 
risk was in the West, and we have identified that in 21 
priority landscapes, 250 firesheds within those landscapes, 
roughly 45 million acres all told. We are in the process of 
investing nearly $1 billion over the next couple of years in 
134 of those 250 firesheds in an effort to try to mitigate and 
reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, which is a serious issue. 
There is resource being spent there.
    There is also resource being spent in helping communities 
become more resilient to fire, fire-adaptive communities. That 
is also part of what we are doing.
    Finally, we are working to reforest. We have a fairly 
significant and pretty aggressive goal of doing hundreds of 
thousands of more acres of reforestation, and that project is 
also being funded because of what you all did on the REPLANT 
Act.
    There are a variety of activities going on.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I look forward to 
staying in touch on all that.
    As the Chair knows, like everybody else on this Committee, 
I have had farm bill listening session after farm bill 
listening session. I think we have had 26 in Colorado so far, 
and we are headed to a record because people are really 
interested. I want to thank you for coming out to Talbott Farms 
in Palisade for one of those early on. There, in that 
conversation with our producers, you heard something I hear 
everywhere I go, which are concerns about programs like EQIP 
and CRP and USDA Rural Development community facilities, the 
fact that they are exceedingly burdensome in many respects for 
Coloradoans access. Sometimes it has to do with understaffing. 
Sometimes it just has to do with the bureaucracy not getting 
back.
    We have had this conversation before. You are fortunate, I 
think, and the country is fortunate, to have you in this job a 
second time. I just want to hear a little bit about what you 
are doing to make the place a little more customer friendly 
than it has been historically and what we can expect to see 
coming froward.
    Secretary Vilsack. When I came back to this job there were 
6,500 fewer people working at USDA than before. First and 
foremost----
    Senator Bennet. That is amazing. That is an amazing fact.
    Secretary Vilsack. The morale was very, very low. It was 
necessary for us to rebuild morale, and it was also necessary 
for us to rebuild the work force.
    We are doing that. We are hiring more people at NRCS. We 
are hiring more people in the Farm Service Agency. We are 
hiring more people in Rural Development. We have made an 
effort, through the budget, to be able to hire more folks.
    It is a challenge. It is a challenge because our 
compensation system now, today, is not competitive. It is very 
difficult to keep people in some of these jobs. The private 
sector attracts them once they get a little training. It is not 
only recruiting people, it is also retaining people. We are 
hiring more people, and that makes a difference.
    We are also looking at ways to simplify the application 
process. I mentioned the Farm Service folks simplifying the 
loan application. NRCS is doing the same thing with reference 
to the applications necessary to access these programs.
    The additional funding that you are providing, under the 
Inflation Reduction Act, is a big, big opportunity for us. We 
are going to continue to hire more people and we are going to 
continue to put those resources to work. We know we have a 
backlog of needed conservation programs. This is going to allow 
us to address that backlog and allow us to target these 
resources in ways that will help drought-stricken areas, help 
advance climate-smart practices, improve soil health, all of 
that.
    It is a concerted effort on our part to expand work force. 
Finally, looking at ways in which we can leverage our resources 
by--and I mentioned this to Senator Lujan earlier--the 
importance of having outreach efforts beyond NRCS, having over 
100 organizations helping us get the word out about existing 
programs at NRCS, how folks can access those programs, and 
guiding them through the process. That should also encourage 
and increase participation and increase our ability to leverage 
those resources.
    Senator Bennet. I think with your leadership we really have 
a chance to make a dent in this, and anything that we can do to 
help support that effort, we want to do.
    I do not know how long I will be in this job. I have no 
idea. I would love to be able to go home and have a farm bill 
listening session where people are saying, ``We are actually 
seeing improvements on the ground'' because of what we are 
doing together here.
    The last issue I had, you mentioned CRP. I actually do not 
have a question on the Conservation Reserve Program except to 
observe that we feel the prices for CRP in the heart of what 
was the Dust Bowl in Colorado do not make a lot of sense. I 
have raised that over and over again here.
    I did want to mention the Conservation Reserve Enhancement 
Program (CREP) also, because in the last farm bill I secured a 
provision to allow for dryland farming in the CREP. Since then 
we have been working to secure a secretarial waiver. I know you 
are well aware of this issue that is critical for Colorado's 
Republican River Water Conservation District to meet its 
compact compliance. I am sorry that Senator Marshall has left 
because I know he knows how important this is, between Kansas 
and Nebraska, and more important for all States facing 
dwindling water resources to maintain the production 
flexibility that we need while still conserving water.
    I wonder if you could commit, Mr. Secretary, to approving a 
waiver for dryland farming in the CREP program and ensure that 
rural rates are not so low that it discourages program 
participation.
    Secretary Vilsack. We are actually working on the project 
in your State specifically, and we have doubled the rates that 
would normally be paid for a CREP. We are trying to adjust 
those rates in a way that is feasible and could be applied not 
just to one particular project but to CREPs throughout the 
region.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much, and Senator 
Bennet, I appreciate your leadership, and Senator Marshall's, 
in not only having the listening sessions in Colorado but 
through your subcommittee, the important listening sessions on 
conservation and forestry with all of our stakeholders. I know 
those are coming in the next few weeks, and we thank you.
    Senator Tuberville.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Alabama's 
hard-working farmers and producers continue to face an uphill 
battle as they work to feed our Nation. Inflation is 
skyrocketing and input costs continue to rise for feed, fuel, 
fertilizer, and equipment, which cut producers' bottom lines. 
The bottom line is we are struggling.
    Despite producers' daily struggles to operate their farms 
and maintain their livelihoods, this Administration is not 
seeking to help. From my viewpoint, the USDA is only focusing 
on two areas: issuing increases in SNAP and obsession over 
climate change.
    This farm bill will have a price tag of over $1.4 trillion, 
with over $1.2 trillion of it going to SNAP benefits. We cannot 
lose sight of the importance of this farm bill, for the next 
five years, for our farmers and producers all across our 
country. Our producers need a strong farm bill with sufficient 
funding for crop insurance and farm safety net programs like 
ARC and PLC, that keep our hard-working farmers whole. We must 
ensure each producer remains in charge of what operations occur 
within their own farmland and forest land. All conservation 
programs must remain voluntary, market driven, and incentive 
based.
    Mr. Secretary, in Alabama 55 of our 57 counties are 
considered rural, and many of those lack access to sufficient 
broadband internet. Broadband access is crucial to stimulating 
economic growth, providing new opportunities, and in ensuring 
our rural communities are not left behind. The ReConnect 
program has been a successful tool to deploy broadband to rural 
areas. To date, ReConnect has awarded more than $3 billion over 
four rounds of funding. It sounds like it is more than just a 
pilot program at this point.
    Does Rural Utilities Service have any metrics to track the 
performance of this program?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes. They have an extensive effort. I 
asked the question of my team recently. There is an extensive 
follow-through with the implementation and expansion of 
opportunity that ReConnect provides. Now understand, Senator, 
ReConnect is with existing programs that basically encourages 
higher upload and download speeds. In other words, it improves 
existing programs. It does not address the issue of unserved 
areas. That issue is going to be addressed with the Commerce 
Department and FCC once the maps of States are finalized and 
approved that show where the underserved areas are. There is 
roughly $63 million from the infrastructure law that will go 
into meeting that unmet need.
    Right now we are focused on improving the service that does 
exist, and as you pointed out, we have approved a number of 
projects. There will be another round of approvals and awards 
here coming up in the next couple of months.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you.
    The poultry industry is a crucial economic driver for my 
State. It represents 65 percent of Alabama's agriculture income 
and provides 86,000 jobs. Considering the U.S. exports are 
approximately 18 percent of chicken meat production, which is 
valued at over $4 billion annually, we must maintain strong 
trade agreements in our export markets. I am concerned about 
the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) vaccine mandates 
impacting those markets as most nations do not accept imports 
from vaccinating countries.
    It is my understanding that the use of an HPAI vaccine will 
not eliminate or eradicate the virus, similar to the COVID-19 
vaccine. Since a vaccine will not keep birds from getting the 
virus or eradicating the virus from the U.S., do you think it 
is a useful tool?
    Secretary Vilsack. At the present time there is no vaccine 
for the current HPAI virus. There are a number of vaccines that 
are in the process of being developed. There is a long way to 
go, Senator, before we can say we have a vaccine. Then there 
are additional steps that have to be taken in order to 
determine the impact and effect of a vaccine on the ability to 
sell product overseas. There are a number of countries that 
will basically shut off exports if the poultry has been 
vaccinated.
    I think there is a process there, but we are a long way 
away from having a vaccine that is effective, and a long way 
from having a vaccine that the rest of the world accepts.
    Senator Tuberville. I hear concerns from my farmers in 
Alabama, especially our poultry farmers, lacking sufficient 
access to financing. To build a four-house poultry farm in 
Alabama today the cost would exceed $2 million. However, the 
FSA guaranteed loan limit is capped at $1.75 million. This 
presents a significant problem for our young farmers and people 
who want to get into poultry.
    Do you think we should increase the cap for guaranteed loan 
size?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think it is important to provide 
the Department with as much flexibility as possible to try to 
meet the need as it evolves, not only in this area but very 
specifically in the disaster area. I know that is not part of 
your question, but I think it is important for us to have 
enough flexibility to be able to use disaster programs 
creatively when we are faced with a mega-drought or faced with 
circumstances that were not anticipated when you all passed a 
farm bill.
    Senator Tuberville. Do you have a limit that you would----
    Secretary Vilsack. I do not, but I will tell you what. Let 
us think about that and we will get back to you.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, because we are struggling.
    Secretary Vilsack. The problem with a limit is that 
eventually you get to a point where the limit is----
    Senator Tuberville. Too high. Oh, I understand. Yes. 
Inflation, right?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, it is inflation but it is also the 
cost of the size of operations. I mean, there are a multitude 
of factors. Our focus, frankly, is on making sure that when you 
make that expenditure that you got a fair shake with your 
integrator so that the rug is not pulled out from under you, 
which is why we are looking at the Packers and Stockyard Act.
    Senator Tuberville. I was disappointed to hear that in the 
U.S. our trade deficit is $14.5 billion in agriculture last 
year, and I believe we need to support our producers in opening 
new markets, and we talked about that earlier. I understand 
that because of changes made to the Export Credit Guarantee 
Program after our ag exporters are using that program less.
    In light of this, what is USDA doing to ensure our 
producers have the ability and access to financing options to 
export their products?
    Secretary Vilsack. Actually, if you are talking about the 
GSM, one of the two programs, we actually did adjust those 
limits. We were under a restriction based on a resolution in a 
case involving Brazil and its retaliation against the U.S. in a 
cotton case, but we recently amended that program to comply 
with the Nairobi Protocols, which provides greater access, and 
that program is actually being used--I believe it is actually 
being used more than it was before. We can check on that.
    Senator Tuberville. Yes.
    One quick question. President Biden said in the State of 
the Union that we are going to be done with fossil fuels in 10 
years. My farmers are asking me, ``Are we going to start 
getting tax credits for farm equipment? Are manufacturers going 
to start getting tax credits for making a non-fossil-fuel 
machine?'' We do not need to start thinking about that eight 
years from now. We need to start thinking about that now. What 
are your thoughts on that?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, you know, I am interested in 
making sure that we have resources available to farmers and 
that machinery that is available is not just available to folks 
who have large-scale production systems. I was pretty struck by 
the work that is now being done to try to miniaturize some of 
this farm equipment.
    I think we are going to continue to have a need for farm 
equipment that operates in a way that farmers can use it. I am 
not sure that we are not going to see the end of combustion 
engines for a while. I mean, with all due respect, I just do 
not think that is going to happen. I do not remember him saying 
that in the State of the Union but maybe he did and maybe I 
just was not paying attention.
    Senator Tuberville. I heard it. I was sitting pretty close. 
I heard it.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Madam.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Chairwoman, and of course, 
Ranking Member, thank you as well.
    Secretary Vilsack, I was really pleased to see the release 
of the proposed rule on the voluntary ``Product of USA'' label. 
I completely agree, as your new rule proposes, that meat sold 
under the ``Product of USA'' label should be from animals born, 
raised, and slaughtered in the United States.
    I also want to mention my support and appreciation of your 
work to move forward with the key Packers and Stockyards Act's 
regulation to provide transparency and fairness for our 
Nation's livestock and poultry farmers. This is really, really 
important. The GIPSA rules are long overdue to address the 
abuse of contract farmers by big, integrated meatpacking 
companies, and it is not just the farmers that these companies 
mistreat.
    It has recently come to light that immigrant children were 
illegally employed in some of the most dangerous jobs at 
meatpacking plants owned and operated by companies such as 
Cargill, JBS, and Tyson. The meatpacking companies outsourced 
this work to egregious labor violators and now are trying to 
shield themselves from responsibility for violations committed 
by their contractors, who hire children to work long, overnight 
hours, for low pay, cleaning equipment such as skull splitters 
and bone cutters.
    These big meatpackers have a long history of failing to 
protect workers. Meatpacking plants are so dangerous that there 
are an average of two amputations every week for meatpacking 
workers. Meanwhile, these companies continue to use outsized 
influence and power to be awarded multi-million-dollar 
contracts from the Federal Government.
    Following a prior series of criminal and civil actions 
against JBS for bribery, price fixing, fraud, you stated, Mr. 
Secretary, that the U.S. Government could not stop awarding 
these contracts to JBS because the companies have so few 
competitors. I hope you agree that we should not be rewarding 
multinational corporations who exploit children and ignore our 
labor laws with lucrative government contracts.
    What does Congress need to do in this farm bill to make 
sure that USDA contracts stop going to these bad actors and 
start going to small businesses and independent family farmers 
and ranchers who treat their workers, animals, and communities 
with respect?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think, Senator, supporting the work 
that we are starting to make sure that procurement dollars that 
USDA invests do not necessarily all go to large-scale 
commercial operations but that a percentage of them be spent 
with and invested in small and regional, local food systems.
    We have got to have a companion system, I think, in my 
view, to make our food system more resilient and to address 
some of the concerns that you have just addressed. There needs 
to be a little bit more competition, and one way to get 
competition is to make sure that procurement dollars are being 
spent with good employers.
    I will tell you that the Department of Agriculture is one 
of the first departments that is look at ways in which we can 
ensure that when we use our procurement dollars we use them 
with companies that understand the importance of safety, 
importance of following the rules.
    Senator Booker. Yes. Well, the rule breaking and 
exploitation going along with these larger companies is 
stunning, and I really hope to work with the Committee on both 
sides of the aisle to try to help advance what you just 
described.
    USDA programs have a large number of different definitions 
of what constitutes rural, making it difficult and confusing 
for municipalities to determine which programs they are 
eligible for. Furthermore, some of these definitions make it 
difficult for rural companies in New Jersey and other small 
States to qualify due to how eligibility is linked to proximity 
to larger cities.
    For example, a town in South Jersey, Elmer, that is 
surrounded by farmland and has a population of only 1,347 
people, is being refused service by broadband companies because 
it does not have enough customers. Elmer is the perfect example 
of a rural area that should be able to take advantage of USDA's 
ReConnect program, but it was found to be ineligible because it 
is connected to a larger municipality through what the USDA 
calls a ``string,'' despite being over 12 miles away. In States 
like New Jersey, where rural towns are less distant from urban 
areas, rural communities like Elmer are left with really no 
options.
    Mr. Secretary, do you acknowledge that some USDA 
definitions are leaving certain rural communities behind, and 
will you work with my office to find ways to ensure that rural 
communities in New Jersey are able to participate in these 
programs?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes and yes.
    Senator Booker. Fantastic. The final question, Madam 
Chairwoman, was requested of me by Senator Fetterman, who we 
are keeping very much in our prayers. He cannot be here to ask 
the question, Mr. Secretary, but I am also interested in his 
question regarding USDA resources for urban farmers. Senator 
Fetterman has been hearing from farmers in cities in 
Pennsylvania that come from county FSA and NRCS offices, and 
believe they are unequipped to assist with resources for urban 
farmers.
    On behalf of Senator Fetterman, can you please discuss 
actions your office is taking to disseminate information on 
resources for urban farmers to local USDA staff and 
stakeholders?
    Secretary Vilsack. The first step in that process was we 
have identified 17 cities where we are trying to develop the 
program for urban farming and establishing FSA offices in those 
17 cities so that we learn a bit more about what is going on. I 
will tell you that we do have a series of innovation grants and 
a series of compost grants that are being funded to cities.
    Senator Booker. Did you say compost grants?
    Secretary Vilsack. Compost. Compost. Millions of dollars 
being invested in those programs to try to encourage more urban 
farming.
    We have established, within NRCS, a team of folks who are 
focused solely and completely on urban farming.
    I guess my advice to the Senator is for his office to 
contact us, let us know what communities, cities he is talking 
about, and we will make sure that we get information to those 
particular cities.
    We want to expand this program. We understand and 
appreciate that the definition of farming is different today 
than it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago. It is about urban 
farming. It is about rooftop farming. It is about community 
gardens. It is about vertical farming. It is about indoor 
farming. It is about horticulture. You know, hydroponics, 
agroponics. It is all of that, and it is important for us to be 
supportive of all of that. We would be more than happy to work 
with his office.
    Senator Booker. No, it is quite exciting, and I know the 
Chairwoman has been a real leader and groundbreaker, pun 
intended, when it comes to farming in urban areas. My hope is 
that we can expand it.
    The Chairman said in his testimony already that local 
systems are stronger, more resilient in times of crisis, like 
we just saw with the pandemic, so developing the capacity, I 
think there is an urgency around that, and excitement about it 
from New Jersey to Michigan and across our country, and I am 
looking forward to working with you in the farm bill in 
expanding those efforts.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you, Senator Booker, and you are 
right. There is great excitement, and I think even more 
excitement around a farm bill because we are adding to the 
breadth of who is impacted by that. We saw in the pandemic, 
certainly we saw in Michigan, where the access to local healthy 
food made all the difference as supply chains broke down.
    Thank you so much, and I also want to just indicate that we 
are so appreciative that Senator Fetterman's staff are 
continuing to work closely with us. He is our new Chair of the 
Nutrition Subcommittee, and is actively involved. I know 
Booker, as former Chair, is actively involved as well. We 
appreciate the ongoing work that is happening with Senator 
Fetterman's staff with us every day, and we know he will be 
back with us soon, and we appreciate that. We are looking 
forward to it.
    Secretary Vilsack. Chair?
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Yes, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Vilsack. Can I just add one additional comment to 
Senator Booker? It is also important for the Senator to know 
that HUD also has programs that could be of assistance. We are 
working collaboratively with HUD on community garden 
opportunities, which is an extension of urban farming.
    Senator Booker. Yes, just one piece of advice with the 
Secretary of HUD. I found out the hard way, never bring her 
vegan food.
    [Laughter.]
    Chairwoman Stabenow. We love having her in Michigan. She 
has been in several times. No vegan food, though.
    All right. Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Madam Chairman and Ranking 
Member Boozman, and I certainly appreciate you being here 
today, Mr. Secretary. I have enjoyed a good working 
relationship with you.
    I think my question to you is timely, as you talk about 
millions of dollars in investments in 17 cities for urban 
farmers and small farmers, and the exposure to agriculture that 
a lot of children do not have. In Mississippi we have 34,700 
farms, and we are large in land but we are small in population. 
We are less than three million people. Our No. 1 industry in 
Mississippi is agriculture. We have a lot of small farms, but 
we have a lot of larger family farms as well that are very, 
very critical.
    This Administration has repeatedly emphasized its desire to 
help small and organic farmers and hobby farmers, which you 
also indicated in your testimony, and this is a good thing. I 
am glad you are doing that. I have a deep respect for anyone 
who is raising crops because it is truly hard work, and I have 
respect for all farmers who do that on farms of all sizes. We 
simply cannot feed the masses without these large, conventional 
farms.
    It is so valuable for children who do not have the exposure 
to agriculture, that when you walk down the cereal aisle of 
your grocery store--and I do all of my shopping for my family, 
and when you walk down the flour aisle and the rice aisle, you 
know, you realize our job is to feed this country and to feed 
this world, and what would happen if there were shortages. You 
know, if we did stop production how that would truly impact 
this country, much more than a lot of other pandemics.
    According to USDA's Economic Research Service, three 
percent of U.S. farms, the large family farms, are responsible 
for 47 percent of production to feed this country. Larger 
operations allow farmers to capitalize on the benefits of 
economies of size and the efficiencies as they work to feed and 
clothe this world. They are the primary reason America is home 
to the most efficient and sustainable agricultural production 
system this world has ever known.
    The farm safety net exists to ensure that we have that 
safe, affordable, and nutritious farm supply that is produced 
in the U.S., and our success ensures we do not become a country 
dependent on imports for everything, especially our food 
supply.
    The farm safety net consists of programs that provide 
economic viability not only to the producers but also the rural 
communities they live in and support. I truly do support the 
smaller, hobby, and urban farming, but we cannot lose focus on 
we are here to feed this country and the tremendous challenge 
that that is.
    As we look to the next farm bill, what assurances can you 
give us that USDA will act according to the intent of Congress 
when administrating farm safety net programs? I know this is a 
tremendously delicate balance that you have there, but my 
concern is truly feeding the masses. What is the intent of 
Congress when administrating the farm safety net programs? What 
are your goals and objectives there?
    Secretary Vilsack. Our goal, simply stated, is to keep 
people on the farm. If they are suffering a circumstance or a 
disaster that results in their inability to continue farming, 
that is why you have got a safety net, is to basically allow 
them and ensure that they can stay on the farm.
    I want to be very clear about this, Senator. When we talk 
about the 90 percent of the farms that did not make money or 
the majority of their money came from off-farm income, we are 
talking about farms that sold less than $1 million. The farms 
you are talking about, the large, commercial-sized farms, sold 
more than $1 million.
    I do not think it is an either-or circumstance, and I do 
not think anybody should phrase it or discuss it in the context 
of either-or. I think we need both. We clearly need 
production--there is no question about that--and we are going 
to continue to have incredibly large, efficient, effective 
operations. If you are also genuinely concerned, as I am, about 
the erosion of rural America, you are going to want to keep 
people on the farm.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. No doubt.
    Secretary Vilsack. Okay? If it is 100 acres or 1,000 acres, 
I want to keep people on the farm. When you ask what is our 
intent, what is the philosophy, the philosophy is very simple. 
Those safety nets are designed to keep people on the farm, and 
to keep them farming so they can do what every farmer that I 
know wants to do, which is to pass it on to the next 
generation.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. That is it. What assurances can you 
provide that USDA will approach farm safety net programs for 
large farms with the same enthusiasm as the smaller ones? I 
think you have answered that as well.
    Secretary Vilsack. We want to keep people on the farm. The 
challenge has been that we spend a lot of time and focus on 
those large-scale producers because of the nature of the 
productivity. We established, back in the 1970's, we sent the 
message to farms, ``Be productive.'' We changed the 
circumstances. Earl Butz said, ``Fence row to fence row,'' and 
boy, did American farmers do that. They became extraordinarily 
productive.
    The problem is that as you become more productive the cost 
of that productivity is pretty significant. Those machines that 
allow you to farm thousands of acres are very large and very 
expensive. The problem is that farms continue to get larger and 
larger and larger, which squeezes out the small and mid-sized 
farming operation, which is what populates the rural 
communities, which supports the school, the hospital, the Main 
Street businesses.
    The challenge for us is how do you do both? How do you 
create a circumstance in a farm bill that basically says, yes, 
we have got to help those big guys. No problem with that. Do 
not forget about the rest of them, the 90 percent that are 
struggling every single year. Even in a record year they are 
struggling.
    That is my goal, is to try to figure out how do we do both, 
not just one or the other, but both.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Well, I am glad that is your goal. I 
am.
    Now I have got--well, I think I am running out of time. I 
have some questions about rice. Maybe I can hang around to ask 
you that. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. Welcome, Secretary 
Vilsack. I have been watching you during the Obama 
Administration and now, and I will make an observation: you 
know what you are doing. I appreciate that. Second, I send 
greetings from Senator Leahy who worked with you for so many 
years and a longstanding member of this Committee.
    I want to just go through what my farm bill priorities are 
briefly and just get your reaction, and at the end I want to 
ask a question on behalf of my wonderful colleague, Senator 
Fetterman. Let me get started.
    First of all, keeping farmers on the farm, I really think 
that has got to be the goal. In Vermont we are struggling, and 
we are the small and mid-sized farms that you just mentioned, 
and they want to pass their work on to the next generation.
    No. 1, rural broadband. ReConnect very important, 
obviously, and the farm bill has played a major role. Do you 
consider that Congress should consider strengthening the 
ReConnect program in the upcoming farm bill and we should 
maintain the 100 minimum broadband service required for a 
proposed service area?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Second, organic dairy. Incredible 
challenges in Vermont. Under Secretary Moffitt and I went to a 
sixth-generation organic farm. There is $100 million of aid 
that is available, and it is desperately needed as a safety net 
to keep these folks going.
    When we had our meeting an organic farmer in the valley 
asked the right question, ``Where is the money?'' Where is the 
money?
    Secretary Vilsack. The money is in the process. We are in 
the process of streamlining the application, and it is 
basically looking at 75 percent of the future marketing costs 
of 2023. We have to have a baseline upon which to determine 
what that 75 percent is going to be factored against. We are in 
the process of accumulating that. I would expect and anticipate 
sometime this summer that we will have enough information to be 
able to begin receiving applications. Farmers can take a look 
at www.farmers.gov. That is where all the information about 
this particular program will be.
    Senator Welch. Okay. I just try to convey the sense of 
urgency that these farmers had, and I know you know it, but I 
do not know that they have that much time, seriously. I know 
you have got to go through your procedures, but the Vermont 
legislature was actually considering trying to supplement or 
fill in until the money arrived. The clock is ticking here for 
these folks, so anything that we can do to speed that up, they 
really need the help.
    Secretary Vilsack. In addition, we also provided additional 
support under the Market Volatility Assistance Program to dairy 
producers and we also put resources behind the Dairy Innovation 
Center in Vermont. We are putting resources there to provide 
help and assistance.
    Senator Welch. All right. I may be a little bit of a pest 
because there is such an existential reality, but I appreciate 
that.
    Next is energy efficiency. The Rural Energy Savings Program 
has been very, very helpful to many rural families making their 
homes more efficient. The question is can we get more? There is 
a lot of funds available that are going to really help farmers 
and small businesses in rural communities cut down on their 
energy bills. Would more outreach and technical assistance 
under RESP help the program reach more of our rural 
communities, and would providing grants to entities that are 
helping administer loans broaden the reach of the program?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are looking for ways in which we can 
leverage our work force, so anything that leverages that work 
force, that gets information out to people who need the 
program, to be able to apply to the program, we would be 
supportive of.
    Senator Welch. Local operations in Vermont that may be able 
to facilities might be able to work with your Department?
    Secretary Vilsack. It is similar to what we are doing with 
NRCS and our FSA offices in terms of extending the reach of 
those offices.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Forestry, important to a lot of us. 
How would additional funding to support rapid response help 
USDA prevent the spread of invasive species? We have a real 
issue with emerald ash borer in Vermont.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is a tough issue. I would say that 
we also have to have research. We have to have a continued 
amount of research to be able to understand precisely what 
needs to be done to protect all of our species.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Research means some funding, and that 
is a priority.
    On the Rural Partnership Program, do you agree that the 
Institutes of Rural Partnership, such as the one established at 
the University of Vermont, and Senator Leahy played a major, 
major role in that, are a very effective means to research and 
address the challenges that many of our rural areas, including 
Vermont, face?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are looking forward to seeing the 
results of the investments that have been made under Senator 
Leahy's leadership and direction.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Then the organic certification cost-
share program. With the application consolidation, making it 
simpler, you are indicating an awareness of how tough that is. 
In the short term, what resources and legislative tools can 
Congress provide for the program to allow USDA to support 
producers that are seeking that organic certification, and 
would increasing the statutory cap on reimbursements from, say, 
$750 to $1,500 help?
    Secretary Vilsack. That would help, but I think also you 
want to keep an eye on what we are doing under the Organic 
Transition Assistance Program. We are providing resources to 
establish those who want to become organic to link them with 
existing organic producers so that they are mentored. We are 
establishing additional risk management assistance to reduce 
the cost. NRCS has a new practice standard that is also going 
to allow EQIP money to be used, to make it easier to do the 
tough conservation work that is required. We are also looking 
forward to figuring out ways in which we can expand market 
opportunities.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. My last question is 
from my colleague, Senator Fetterman. He is, as you mentioned, 
Chair of the Nutrition Subcommittee. His question is this. Last 
year the Department issued several proposed rules aimed at 
improving competition, transparency, and fairness in the 
livestock market. Senator Fetterman asks, how might statutes 
such as the Packers and Stockyards Act be changed to further 
improve competition and fairness in the market?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think the work that we are doing 
for greater transparency for understanding the role of the 
Packers and Stockyards Act in the face of discrimination and 
retaliation, additional support for the poultry industry in 
terms of making sure that there is a level playing field, 
understanding the scope of practice within that bill, all of 
that is going to happen over the course of the next year and a 
half. I think once you see the benefit of that you can make a 
determination whether there are additional statutory changes. I 
think it is the regulatory process that probably has the 
greatest opportunity for immediate impact.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Thank you.
    Chair Stabenow, I would like to submit the following letter 
of support from a coalition of rural broadband stakeholders 
regarding better broadband objectives in the farm bill, 
including the need for 100 symmetrical speeds.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Without objection, so ordered.

    [The letter can be found on page 95 in the Appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Smith, and let me first say, 
as Chair of the Commodities--I forget the whole name, but it is 
a long name--Subcommittee, but you and Senator Hyde-Smith, we 
are so looking forward to the important subcommittee hearing 
coming up to hear from our stakeholders, so thank you so much.
    Senator Smith. Well, thank you very much, but I think it is 
Senator Grassley's turn, is it?
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Oh my goodness. What? I am looking at 
you and I am trying to avoid Senator Grassley.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Smith. Far be it for me to step ahead of Senator 
Grassley.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. What? You are exactly right. I was 
thinking and talking about the subcommittee work and I just----
    Senator Smith. I know.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Grassley, welcome.
    Senator Grassley. She is better looking than I am. I can 
understand why you said that.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Grassley, I actually was not 
trying to avoid you. As an Iowan, you and Secretary Vilsack I 
know go back a long way.
    Senator Grassley. Yes. See, I am going to start out with my 
favorite subject every time we have a farm bill up, on farm 
payment limitations. In your testimony you mentioned that if we 
keep the agriculture policy status quo we will continue to see 
consolidation. You said that, quote/unquote, ``It is either get 
big or get out,'' and I agree with what you said there. My 
long-held belief is that farm policy should be limited to 
safety net that helps farmers weather the storm of natural 
disasters and unpredictable commodity markets or politics or 
international trade getting involved. Current law goes well 
beyond that.
    In the 2018 Farm Bill it was intentionally written to help 
the largest farmers receive sometimes millions of dollars of 
subsidy from the Federal Government each year. You have heard 
the figure of 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 70 
percent of the benefits out of the farm program.
    Not only do you, Mr. Secretary, but to the members of this 
Committee, I am asking that you would now work with me to stop 
this needless abuse of taxpayer dollars. I support farmers only 
receiving commodity payments if they are actively engaged in 
farming, and for the Republicans on this Committee I think 
some, or maybe all of us, are working to tighten work 
requirements for SNAP recipients. I hope that we would also 
look at work requirements in Title 1 of the farm bill to make 
sure that people are actively engaged in the process of farming 
if they are going to benefit from it.
    Now back to you, Mr. Secretary. In the prior 
administration, Secretary Perdue issued a final rule where the 
payment recipient must provide either 25 percent of the farm's 
total management hours on an annual basis or perform at least 
500 hours of management annually. After the election in 2020, 
USDA issued a correction to that rule and the correction, I 
believe, went against congressional intent.
    So to you, Secretary, when there are discussions about 
helping the many rather than the few, have you studied if 
having actual payment limitations could help prevent the big 
from getting bigger?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, I think there need to be 
realistic and reasonable limits.
    We recently had an initiative involving rice producers that 
are going to receive $250 million of assistance and help, 
understandably and appropriately. It is interesting the way 
that was set up. There is a payment limit that if more than 75 
percent of your income comes from farming, you get $125,000. I 
have got to make sure I get this right. No, if less than 75 
percent of your income comes from farming, you get $125,000. If 
more than 75 percent of your income comes from farming, you get 
$250,000.
    Now when you take a look at the way in which 90 percent of 
farmers are, most of them are not making the majority of their 
money from farming. The small and mid-sized producer does not 
get as much help as a larger producer. I understand large 
producers have significant capital expenditures, but it is 
interesting that the structure of that particular program makes 
it more difficult for the small and mid-sized guy to get the 
kind of help that they need to stay in business.
    As you look at these payment limits we really need to 
understand and figure out how do we do this in a way that 
recognizes the capital contribution of large producers but at 
the same time understands and appreciates that they may be in a 
better position to withstand a shock than the small and mid-
sized person, who is just on the edge every single year. It is 
tough.
    Senator Grassley. My last question along that line is, is 
it philosophically possible for you and/or the Administration 
to work with us to try to find some payment limitations so that 
we are helping the medium- and small-sized farmers as opposed 
to subsidizing the big farmers, the big farmers to get bigger?
    Secretary Vilsack. The key here, I think, Senator, is to 
figure out ways in which we can help those small- and mid-sized 
producers in a meaningful way. I think not only is it safety 
net but it is also market development. I think we have to 
create more income opportunities for those producers. I do not 
think that they are necessarily going to be able to compete 
successfully in a commodity-based market, if that is the only 
option they have. They have got to have other ways to make 
money from that farming operation in order for them to stay in 
business.
    Senator Grassley. Now I think you already had a question 
from another member about the Commodity Credit Corporation. 
Before I ask this it will have to my last question. I probably 
need to confess that when President Trump did some what I 
consider misuse of the Commodity Credit Corporation, I did not 
ask any questions about it at that time. When Congress is 
discussing farm bill reauthorizations we have to work together 
in a bipartisan manner to create new programs and then work 
through the appropriation process to get them funded.
    However, since 2017, the USDA, through the Commodity Credit 
Corporation has spent $65 billion of spending on priority set 
at the discretion of the Department and not Congress. That 
means that Congress has elected representatives of the American 
taxpayer did not go through the painstaking back-and-forth and 
compromising on how these programs will operate and how much or 
how little the programs should need.
    It is my belief that the USDA's discretionary use of CCC 
undercuts this Committee farm bill process. This farm bill will 
not be a success unless Congress takes back our 
responsibilities of setting the Nation's farm program.
    Are you in a process of creating any new programs through 
the Commodity Credit Corporation while Congress is negating the 
farm bill? In other words, I guess I am asking you to look 
ahead maybe six to nine months while we are working on this 
bill.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think there is always the 
utilization of CCC to assist food banks that are challenged in 
order to meet the increased demand for food for struggling 
families. That sometimes is a way in which the CCC fund is 
used. There are times when we obviously use it for things like 
the Fertilizer Initiative, where we are trying to help farmers 
get lower-cost inputs.
    I will say, Senator, you used a, whatever it was, $63 
billion number. I would imagine that nearly 90 percent of that 
number came from the Trump administration.
    Senator Grassley. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. What we have done with those resources, 
the biggest decision we made was in reference to Climate-Smart 
Partnership Initiative, and I will remind you that farm groups, 
major farm groups, virtually every commodity group wanted this 
program to be set up and basically outlined how it should be 
set up, which we followed to a T, and then they said, ``Fund it 
through the CCC.'' We did it within the context of the law. 
When you say discretionary, it is not like I can invent 
something. I have got to stay within the context and the 
language of the CCC charter, and we have done that, and we will 
continue to do that.
    The difference between the way we are doing this and the 
way the Trump administration, we will never put at risk the 
farm bill programs. That is what happened before. They 
basically drained the account, and then you all had to fill it 
back up again. We are never going to do that, ever, ever, ever 
going to do that. That is not what we are going to do.
    We are going to be judicious about this, we are going to 
stay within the charter, and we are never going to put those 
farm programs at risk.
    Senator Grassley. You heard me confess that I did not raise 
the same issue with the previous administration. Thank you, 
Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Smith, 
unfortunately now you have been bumped, and Senator Brown will 
be next.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Senator 
Klobuchar, thank you for ceding your time. No ceding. Delaying, 
Senator Smith. Sorry.
    I like looking at Secretary Vilsack because just to his 
left I see the new portrait of our Chair, so how cool is that? 
Secretary Vilsack, thank you for being here many times over the 
last 15 years or so.
    Last week, Senators Casey, Fetterman, and I sent a letter 
to you and Administrator Regan concerning the impacts of the 
East Palestine train derailment on farmers in the region, not 
just in that immediate, a mile away, but in the region. The 
2023 planting season quickly approaches, and a climate like 
Ohio's and farmers in Columbiana County in Ohio and across the 
line, not far away from the train derailment, Beaver County, 
Pennsylvania, are frustrated in what they see is a lack of 
guidance and assistance from, in their words, ``from USDA.''
    When I was last in East Palestine--I am going again, I 
believe, next Tuesday--I heard directly from Ohio farmers 
seeking assurance that they can safely plant and sell their 
cattle and their crops. One woman told me she lives four miles 
away. She raises beef cattle. She has regular customers who are 
now calling her that people who buy a side of beef from her, 
and they are saying, ``Is it safe?'' and she really does not 
know, and these customers probably will look elsewhere, just 
because of the uncertainty.
    Those farmers, more than anything, want certainty. Will you 
commit to working with us to expand testing to include a larger 
geographic area and including testing for dioxins and other 
chemicals in milk and beef cattle, understanding that the cost 
of that will be, should be, and we are not going to allow them 
off the hook, will be paid by Norfolk Southern?
    Secretary Vilsack. We will be happy to do that, Senator. We 
want to be helpful.
    I will say that USDA sees its role in this particular 
circumstance as supporting the farmers but also supporting EPA 
in terms of being able to figure out precisely where, how, and 
what needs to be done to reassure folks that they can continue 
to farm and continue to market their products.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, and you have been helpful and we 
will continue on that. Much of it is rebuilding trust, not just 
actually making things safer, of course.
    USDA disaster assistance programs are generally ill-
equipped to address these environmental disasters that were 
never really conceived of in places like East Palestine. What 
type of reforms need to be made to your disaster programs to 
ensure that all of USDA, including Rural Development, including 
the Farm Service Agency can respond to the next human-made 
crisis, if you will?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, as smart as the individual and 
collective members of this Committee are, you will never, ever 
be able to figure out every possible disaster to be able to 
fashion a disaster program that fits circumstances all the 
time, which is why I am encouraging you to think about 
flexibility and also the fact that as disasters strike they 
have regional differences as well.
    The reality is the impact of a particular disaster in one 
area of the country may be fundamentally different than in 
another area. To the extent that you can provide flexibility 
and allow us to have the capacity to respond to a disaster 
regardless of its design or cause or structure, that would be 
helpful.
    Senator Brown. Well, and I hope we, in the new farm bill, 
can address this and grant that flexibility because that is 
really important.
    Secretary Vilsack. Just to give you an example, when you 
established the WHIP program and so forth, nobody anticipated 
that you would have a winter storm of the magnitude that we had 
in the Dakotas. We had to kind of look at the language of that 
and try to figure out are winter storms included in the 
language or not, because we wanted to get help to folks. It is 
just really difficult to be specific, as specific as you would 
like it to be, in order to cover anything and everything that 
can happen.
    Senator Brown. Well, and I can guarantee that if this body 
does not stand up to the railroad lobby there will be many more 
train derailments. Ohio has had four in the last six months, 
including a significant one with 200-plus cars, after East 
Palestine.
    Last question, Secretary Vilsack. The Banking and Housing 
Committee, which Senator Smith sits on with me, oversees the 
Rural Housing Service. In our housing hearings we hear time and 
again that rural communities, as much as the rest of the 
country, maybe even more, struggle with a shortage of 
affordable housing, both to rent and to own, making it hard to 
attract new businesses or give the next generation of local 
families a place they can afford. We hear many homeowners just 
cannot afford the repairs to make older houses safe.
    How important, as we take steps to preserve and create 
affordable housing opportunities in rural communities, and how 
can the Rural Housing Service help us do that?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I will just give you one example. 
You mentioned rental units. We fund multifamily rental 
apartment complexes. When we provide them subsidies and provide 
them assistance we ask them to basically guarantee a certain 
percentage of their units being subsidized. When they pay off 
the mortgage those subsidy units go away, which means the 
families that have been living in those units, they have no 
place to go. You create a voucher program that gives them the 
ability to move.
    The problem is the voucher program is funded for roughly 30 
projects coming offline, when now, because of the nature of the 
way things were, we are seeing, 70, 80 facilities coming off. 
We are basically creating a very significant shortage of rental 
assistance units in the rural areas.
    That is just one example of what we need to do. We need to 
figure out ways in which we can decouple the notion of the 
subsidy and the rental assistance and the mortgage so that we 
have greater capacity to make sure those units stay in 
existence so that people have a decent place to live at an 
affordable cost.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Secretary. Madam Chair, thank 
you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    I am going to turn the gavel to Senator Boozman for a 
moment and go vote. A vote has started. I am going to be coming 
right back. In the meantime, Senator Braun.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The baseline 2018 last farm bill was $867 billion over 10 
years. The new baseline is about $1.43 trillion over 10 years. 
Being an ex-Governor of a State, are you concerned in terms of 
our total financial health? When I looked at the President's 
recent budget it shows us $51 trillion in debt in 10 years, and 
where we are getting into uncharted territory, historically, 
regardless of the tax rate, we generally average around 17.5 to 
18 percent of our GDP in what we can raise in revenues through 
the Federal Government. Occasionally it has spiked to 19 to 20. 
Sometimes it is lower.
    We are now taking total spending up to close to 25 percent 
of GDP. Is that something that worries you, and I think it 
would be something where the ag program, which is kind of chump 
change when you look at $1.43 trillion over 10 years, $140 
billion. Do you think we are in a sound trajectory so that ag 
and all the other things that we depend on here in the Federal 
Government, will it be there in a way that is going to be 
sustainable in the long run, with all this borrowing and 
spending, which is now built into the new budget?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, I am sure you and I are 
probably going to disagree on this a bit. I think the President 
is right when he says it is important for this country to 
rebuild the middle class from the bottom up and the middle out. 
That is going to require some investment. It is going to 
require an investment in a transformed economy. I think 
agriculture has a role to play in that.
    I think the President is right in terms of looking at his 
budget, where he is proposing deficit reduction with the 
understanding that those who are doing extremely well in this 
economy ought to be paying their fair share. You and I would 
probably disagree about that.
    Senator Braun. By the way, I do not disagree with that. I 
would believe everybody should pay their fair share. I am just 
saying that even if you give all of that, it still bridges the 
gap on borrowed money.
    Are you comfortable, like I am very uncomfortable with, 
borrowing this from future generations? I mean, we already do, 
and we have now structuralized it, since 2000, to where I do 
not know that that is sustainable. You cannot do it anywhere 
else. Sooner or later it impacts even programs like ag that 
need a healthy Federal Government.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, you know, I think if you take a 
look at some of the investments that are being made, 
particularly in infrastructure, I mean, how else can you 
finance? That is how businesses finance.
    Senator Braun. Well, you would have to do what you did as a 
Governor. You are going to have to find ways, like every other 
place does, to where you do not spend so much money in other 
areas. Unless you are saying that everything we do here is 
absolutely needed, and it would be like asking your kids at 
Thanksgiving, ``Will you lend me some money for something I 
want to do,'' and maybe the grandkids as well. That is about 
what we are doing as a country.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, if you want to know what my 
biggest beef is about this place----
    Senator Braun. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack [continuing]. it is this. I asked my 
team, and these numbers may not be totally accurate but I think 
the gist of them are right. I asked my team, of the 
discretionary budget, non-defense--because I understand that we 
cannot touch defense, we cannot cut defense----
    Senator Braun. That ought to be on the table too. We waste 
just as much money there as we do through the rest of the 
government.
    Secretary Vilsack. Not all of your colleagues believe that.
    Senator Braun. I would agree.
    Secretary Vilsack. All right. I asked the question, ``How 
much has that increased? How much has that budget increased 
over the last 10 years or so?'' They came back and they said, 
``Twenty-eight percent.'' That is what they told me, 28 
percent. I said, ``Well, how much has the ag portion of that 
increased?'' ``Fourteen percent.''
    I was not great in math, but if the average is 28 percent 
and I am only getting 14 percent, that means somebody else is 
getting a whole lot more than 28 percent, and my concern is 
there is not an understanding within this city of the 
significance and importance and reach of the Department of 
Agriculture.
    Senator Braun. I think we are probably on somewhat the same 
wave length. For the public out there listening, this place is 
doing it on borrowed money to make up the difference. Because 
what I said earlier, over 50 years, revenue into the Federal 
Government has averaged 17.5 percent of GDP, and we are bumping 
that now to 20 in terms of what we think we can raise in 
revenue. That has never happened in the past, and we are 
spending at 25 percent.
    WOTUS is the thing I hear the most in bailiwick of 
agriculture. I hear more complaints about that than any other 
thing because they deal with that. They have had conservation 
officers in Indiana running people down on the back 40 when 
they are doing ditch maintenance on ditches that hardly ever 
have any water in it.
    What is going on there? Are you actually tracking comments 
from farmers? Do we do that to see how much complaints you are 
getting compared to what I am hearing back in Indiana?
    Secretary Vilsack. Certainly sensitive to this, but let us 
remember two things about WOTUS. One, Congress has established 
the Clean Water Act, which is what gives rise to WOTUS, and 
courts have directed the EPA to actually implement the law. All 
right? It is not like they have a choice. They have to 
implement the law. The question is how do they implement it? We 
have had two rules. We had the Obama rule, the Trump rule. What 
this EPA has attempted to do is to take or track from the Trump 
rule and the Obama rule to come up with something that they 
think is reasonable.
    Senator Braun. Do you track comments coming in?
    Secretary Vilsack. We track.
    Senator Braun. Is that something you would share with the 
Committee here in terms of what you are hearing from farmers 
about WOTUS?
    Secretary Vilsack. What you are hearing is uncertainty. 
What you are hearing is uncertainty. Is this in or is this out? 
I think basically what we need to have is certainty in the 
program. We need to, at some point in time, get it out of the 
courts and have certainty, and then we need to determine if 
there are issues or problems, how USDA's resources, NRCS 
resources, can be used to help and assist farmers in whatever 
implementation----
    Senator Braun. Because I am running out of time here, and I 
am going to introduce a bill, the Farmer Informed WOTUS Act, 
and I hope you would be behind it.
    One quick question, and I am hearing it a lot too, is 
foreign ownership of ag ground. Senator Tester and I are 
introducing a bill on that. It is starting to cascade across 
the country among State legislatures addressing it. Where are 
you at there, and the four players that you hear mostly about--
Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran--should they be owning 
farm ground in this country?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, first of all, how much farmland do 
you think they own?
    Senator Braun. I am worried about owning more in the 
future. Do you think you are okay with those four players? Just 
them.
    Secretary Vilsack. I have concerns, and I particularly have 
concerns if they are purchasing land that is adjacent to or 
near military installations or other ways in which security 
could be compromised, for sure.
    As you look at prohibitions, understand that they own, 
between the four of them, roughly 330,000 acres. The five 
largest owners of foreign land in this country are Canada, 
Netherlands, U.K., Germany, and Japan. I think the question is, 
are you going to restrict those folks? If you do not restrict 
those and restrict other folks, how do you do this in a way 
that----
    Senator Braun. Senator Tester and I will probably be back 
to get your opinion on it, and hopefully you will be behind the 
bill. Thank you.
    Senator Boozman. [Presiding.] Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Vilsack.
    That the avian flu is a threat to so many States' 
livelihood of our turkey growers, poultry, egg layers. I want 
to first of all thank you and the USDA for responding quickly 
to this last scourge. During the last outbreak--this is a fact 
maybe you do not know--the University of Minnesota led the 
charges, testing about 20 percent of the Nation's birds 
suspected of carrying avian flu. The labs are playing a 
critical role in addressing rapid detection and response.
    What resources can be provided to the USDA and our land 
grant universities in order to combat and mitigate the threat 
going forward?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, additional support for land grant 
universities to enable them to have the kind of testing 
equipment and lab capacity to be able to provide these tests is 
one thing. We had a conversation about vaccines earlier, and I 
think it is important----
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. I know.
    Secretary Vilsack [continuing]. to continue to work on 
that. We are not there yet. There is a long way to go there.
    The other thing that needs to be focused on is the notion 
of biosecurity, the ability for us to continue to have 
producers be very sensitive to this. I think as we look at ways 
in which we indemnify producers, making sure that not only do 
they have a biosecurity plan but that it is actually 
implemented. The design of these structures, I think it would 
be interesting for land grant universities to sort of opine 
about do designs basically add to the risk or can they be 
structured in way that diminishes the risk, the location of 
these facilities.
    There are a lot of issues that I think require us to look 
at this differently, and here is why. The first time we had 
this, in 2014-2015, it was a very specific timeframe, and then 
it went away.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yep.
    Secretary Vilsack. This time it just lingers.
    Senator Klobuchar. And lingered. It is more like a popcorn 
configuration how it was landing in different producers.
    Secretary Vilsack. We actually did see improvement in 
commercial-sized operations. Backyard operations was a problem.
    The challenge, I think, for us is to recognize this is 
going to be with us, and how is it that we actually mitigate 
and minimize the risk to the disruption of the industry. I 
think you have got to look at all of this. You have got to look 
at biosecurity, you have got to look at indemnification, you 
have to look at vaccination, you have to look at research, and 
you have to look at location.
    Senator Klobuchar. Exactly. Okay. Very good. Thank you. We 
also know--this is kind of along the same lines--since some of 
this was technology and getting the data that helped to contain 
it little more, that real-time data helps our farmers and 
ranchers. Senator Thune and I lead a bill called the 
Agriculture Innovation Act to support farmers and ranchers 
getting better data to make more informed land use decisions. 
This can be everything from use of water to use of pesticides 
to use of whatever we are going to do and what temperatures. 
You name it.
    Can you update the Committee on the progress and existing 
needs for better on-farm data use and research to improve 
location-specific land use decisions?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, there is no question that several 
mission areas within USDA are very focused on the issue of data 
and the ability of data to drive better decisionmaking on the 
farm. Precision agriculture is incredibly important. ARS has 
got a number of research projects underway in this area. NRCS 
is utilizing precision agriculture in a number of their bundles 
of assistance and help in terms of EQIP and CSP resources. NIFA 
is providing resources to land grant universities to do even 
more and better work. The RCPP program has been focusing on and 
encouraging more precision. There are videos encouraging 
farmers to learn more about these techniques and the 
utilization of these techniques. Our Climate-Smart Partnership 
Initiative, I think, will also lead to a better understanding 
of all of this. A lot going on within USDA.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. As you know, the prevention 
of animal disease outbreaks like African swine fever and foot-
and-mouth disease, big priority. We already talked about avian 
flu but now let us go over to hog producers. Senator Cornyn and 
I, in the 2018 Farm Bill, authorized the National Animal Health 
Laboratory Network to further our testing capacity.
    Can you speak to the opportunities to build on this work in 
2023, and update us quickly on the work USDA is doing in the 
Dominican Republic in conjunction with Customs and Border 
Protection to keep African swine fever out of the U.S.?
    Secretary Vilsack. Two areas, the Dominican Republic and 
Haiti. The Dominican Republic, I think we have a very good 
relationship. We are providing labs. We are providing technical 
assistance to try to establish a system by which they can 
identify and ultimately eradicate that ASF in the Dominican 
Republic. Less so in Haiti because you need a functioning 
government to essentially do this. We are very careful about 
that.
    We have a zone in Puerto Rico where we are basically 
prohibiting and preventing transfer. We have significantly 
increased counter-surveillance within the U.S. We have an 
interesting training facility in Georgia that is training dogs. 
We have already impounded about 1,000 pounds of food as it is 
coming into the country, that may potentially pose a threat. We 
want to continue to increase that. We want to continue to work 
with our State ag officials and the pork producers to make sure 
that there is an awareness on the part of producers, when and 
if there is a problem how to contain it, how to minimize the 
risk.
    I mean, there is a lot going on in this space and we are 
spending significant time and resources to do this.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Let me end with biofuels. I see 
Senator Fischer over there. She and I introduced a bill for 
year-round E15. I am wondering what you think about that. I 
know it is not in your jurisdiction here right specifically but 
you know a lot about biofuels.
    Secretary Vilsack. I am supportive of it, but let me just 
simply say I think you need to go beyond that. You need to go 
beyond E15. I think you need to focus on a sustainable aviation 
fuel because that is a 36-billion-gallon industry that has not 
existed----
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. Agree.
    Secretary Vilsack [continuing]. and a significant 
opportunity.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. Very good. I know you have been 
such a champion for that.
    Just ending with this biofuel question. Last Congress, 
Senator Ernst and I had a bill to invest $500 million in 
funding for grants for fueling stations, and convenience stores 
to expand the availability of low-carbon renewable fuels. It 
was actually included in the Inflation Reduction Act and serves 
as the basis for the USDA Higher Blends Infrastructure 
Incentives Program. Can you update me on what is happening with 
that?
    Secretary Vilsack. You will see, over the course of the 
next year or two, quarterly awards under that program.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
    Senator Boozman. Senator Thune. Senator Fischer.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Senator Thune, for yielding your time to me. Secretary Vilsack, 
thank you for being here today. It is always good to see you.
    As we have discussed, I have great concern about Mexico's 
policy toward our agricultural biotechnology and their latest 
decree that bans the use of GMO white corn. I want to 
especially thank you for being a champion on this and pushing 
them about it, and also Ambassador Tai. Our work with your 
office has been excellent, and my conversations with her have 
been really, really good too, so thank you for that.
    As you know, it is a flagrant violation of the United 
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It sets a dangerous 
precedent as we look at our other international trade 
agreements. Unless Mexico relents on this I think the United 
States must be ready to swiftly move to dispute settlement.
    Could you provide an update on when technical consultations 
between the U.S. and Mexico are going to take place? Are there 
specific items the Administration will be pressing Mexico on 
during those consultations? Have you had any answer from Mexico 
at all?
    Secretary Vilsack. We received a partial set of answers to 
inquiries that were sent earlier this year that were 
unsatisfactory, which is why we began the formal process. The 
U.S. Trade Representative's Office is reaching out, and I think 
they are going to begin those preliminary conversations, which 
is a condition precedent to more formal conversations.
    There will be a focus, I think, on the safety of the 
biotech products. This was raised repeatedly by the President 
of Mexico. We tried to reassure him that indeed there were 
literally hundreds of studies on this, and I think we have to 
continue to press this point because at the crux of his decree 
is this issue of safety, and we have to overcome that concern. 
I suspect that the focus of the technical conversations will be 
on the concerns that you have expressed are not supported by 
the science.
    You are absolutely right--this is fundamental. This is 
fundamental to our whole approach to trade. If it is not 
science based, if you can inject culture or if you can inject 
non-scientific factors into trade discussions you will have a 
very difficult time having global trade.
    Senator Fischer. Yes, we will. In your written testimony 
you mentioned that it is a false choice for farmers to have to 
choose between being profitable and being environmentally 
conscious. There are a lot of innovative precision ag 
technologies out there, but the technologies can be expensive 
for farmers. I have a couple of bills on that, to be able to 
have loans through USDA that are going to make it easier for 
them.
    They also have to have that last-mile connectivity, which I 
say has to be expanded in a recognition that they have to have 
the last-acre connectivity to be able to do that too.
    Are you aware of any specific broadband efforts that are 
focused on deploying connectivity to the last acre, and how 
important is that, so that we can see our producers be able to 
leverage all the innovative technologies that are out there?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, obviously it is incredibly 
important. If you do not have access to broadband or if you do 
not have access to meaningful broadband you cannot utilize 
precision agriculture and all of the other innovations.
    What we are trying to do at USDA, with comparatively a 
relatively limited resource compared to what Commerce and what 
FCC gets, we are trying to improve the existing systems. We are 
looking at ways in which we can utilize our regular programming 
resources, which are pretty limited, to the regular budget, to 
providing access to that last mile, that middle mile. You are 
going to see a little bit more of that.
    I think you are going to see quite a bit of it, I hope, 
with the utilization of the infrastructure money when the FCC 
and Commerce resources begin to funnel through States to get 
that job done. I mean, States are going to have a very big and 
critical role here. They are going to be able to, at the end of 
the day, be the ones that will be implementing this, and I 
think it is going to be important to make sure that they 
understand the significance of this.
    Senator Fischer. I have a cattle market bill for reform and 
transparency, which I think is pretty important, and it is 
extremely important for the State of Nebraska. Livestock is our 
biggest segment, that has the largest impact on our economy. 
There is a lot of risk involved. We see farmers and ranchers 
trying to look at different tools they can use to mitigate that 
risk. I think we should look to the farm bill and how can we 
help livestock producers manage that.
    There is a large increase in the number of livestock 
producers who are getting insurance policies. Has there been 
any difficulties with those policies? Have you heard anything 
about that? Do you have any suggestions on what livestock 
producers would have to do to access some kind of protection 
policy?
    Secretary Vilsack. I have not been apprised of any 
problems. That is not to say that there may be problems. I just 
have not heard of them. I am happy to work with you and your 
staff, and our team work with your staff, to see what we do 
know, and if there are issues and problems we will try to help 
you craft a solution to them.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. [Presiding.] Thank you very much. 
Senator Thune.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, 
thanks for being here. Thanks for all your work on behalf of 
farmers and ranchers in our country.
    I want to echo a couple of things that Senator Boozman 
talked about. One is that we need technical assistance from 
USDA to ensure the Department can implement the farm bill in 
accordance with congressional intent. I am currently waiting on 
USDA's technical assistance on my bipartisan proposals to 
improve local meat processing and livestock disaster 
assistance, and would appreciate you and your team, if you 
could get back to us in a timely way. We are coming up on, as 
you know, the September expiration of the farm bill. I look 
forward to working with our colleagues on this Committee to 
advance the next farm bill.
    The other thing I want to echo, that my understanding is 
that Senator Boozman did talk about, and I think it is a real 
concern, and I think you answered it when he raised it. The 
changes that were made administratively in the SNAP program, to 
the tune of a quarter of a trillion dollars, that is not a 
rounding error. I mean, we are talking about huge amounts of 
money. The only thing that is even close is the President's 
proposal to forgive student loans is upward of $1 trillion.
    To think that, if you look at constitutionally, the Article 
I responsibility that we have and the power of the purse, and 
also the implications that has for the farm bill. I mean, we 
are now talking about, on a baseline, farm bill baseline, of 
$1.5 trillion. I mean, this is territory we have never come 
close to hitting in anything contemplated in the past.
    It seems to me that if there are changes that are going to 
be made in some of those programs that they should be made by 
Congress and not by the Administration. I know that Senator 
Boozman has raised that point already, but this, to me, is a 
serious problem, particularly on the scale we are talking 
about. I mean, it would be one thing if you were making some 
changes that were, you know, at least in relative terms, 
somewhat less consequential, but that is a huge amount of 
money, and it has huge implications for the farm bill that we 
are in the process of writing.
    Let me ask you, if I could, to elaborate or clarify a 
statement you made earlier, I think in response to a question 
asked by Senator Tuberville, that the ReConnect program does 
not address unserved areas. Could you clarify that?
    Secretary Vilsack. The ReConnect program, as we are 
currently administering it, is focused on existing--and I think 
Congress has directed this--on existing broadband systems which 
have very little capacity in terms of upload and download 
speeds. The ReConnect program is basically providing the 
resources to improve those systems, to get to the point where 
the download and upload speeds are usable, and going from, you 
know, ultimately we would like to see 100 to 100, so that 
people, a family, could have more than one person using the 
internet at the same time, or a business or a school would have 
access to distance learning.
    Senator Thune. Well, and I do not disagree with the fact 
that it would be great. Everybody, we want to get faster upload 
and download speeds. First and foremost, I think the purpose of 
the law, including the most recent funding that Congress 
provided in the ReConnect program, is for 90 percent unserved, 
in other words, those areas that do not have service.
    To me, if you are overbuilding--this is a real concern with 
these resources, because there is a lot of money in the 
pipeline right now to go toward broadband. I have chaired 
another committee in the Congress, the Commerce Committee, 
which has jurisdiction over a lot of these issues, but we work 
closely with USDA because you also have programs that deliver 
some of those services to rural areas. One of the things that I 
have been really focused on is the oversight role that we have, 
to make sure that those dollars are getting on the target, and 
the target is unserved areas, and that is in the law.
    I mean, it seems to me if you are duplicating places that 
already have service, even if the download and upload speeds 
are not, you know, perhaps what we would like to see, that, 
first and foremost, I believe, is what the law was designed to 
do.
    Secretary Vilsack. You have allocated $63 billion to the 
FCC and the Commerce Department to deal with the unserved 
areas.
    Senator Thune. Yes. The statute also says in ReConnect, 
unserved.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, but what you do not want is a 
circumstance where we are making decisions about an area and 
then a map is created, and the map instantaneously becomes 
outdated. In order to actually get this done, in order to 
actually get service to all the unserved areas, you have to 
define the unserved areas. Where are they? Then once you have 
defined them, then you direct the resources to the States with 
the understanding that it is their job to implement this as 
quickly as possible. That is what the $63 billion is going to 
go toward.
    Then, what they will create, are up-to-date servers. Then 
you are going to have communities that say, wait a minute. 
These folks just got 100/100 or they got 25/100, whatever they 
got, they got better service than we have. We are in the 
process of trying to make sure that everyone is sort of getting 
the same level of service, in essence at the same time.
    Senator Thune. All I am saying is, Federal resources should 
not duplicate places that already have----
    Secretary Vilsack. I do not----
    Senator Thune [continuing]. and that is plain in the law, 
and that applies to ReConnect just like it does to some of the 
broadband services that come through the FCC and NTIA and other 
agencies.
    Very quickly because I am running out of time, this issue 
with trade. As I talk to South Dakota farmers and ranchers, and 
I am sure you hear from folks back in Iowa too, concerns about 
the Administration's policies on trade, whether or not we are 
losing out while global competitor are acquiring new markets 
for their products.
    Now there are lots of what I think are low-hanging fruit--
U.S.-U.K., Kenya would be a good opportunity, and the Indo-
Pacific, obviously, there is a framework but there is nothing 
about market access in it.
    What do you tell farmers and ranchers, and is the 
Administration considering market access opportunities 
anywhere, whether it is U.K., Kenya, or elsewhere?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are, but there are several ways in 
which you can define market access. You do not have market 
access if you have sanitary and phytosanitary rules that 
essentially preclude market access. One of the things we are 
doing with the Indo-Pacific Framework is focusing on trade and 
focusing on those countries where there are SBS issues that 
make it more difficult for us to be able to do trade. If you 
knock those SBS issues down you actually have expanded market 
access, and that is an incredibly important market.
    Senator Thune. Well, I would say, and again, I go back to 
your previous tenure in the Obama Administration. I was for 
TPP. I think being engaged in Asia and these markets around the 
world is really, really important. All these other ancillary 
issues that IPEF contemplates do not do anything with the 
fundamental issue of market access.
    My time has expired, but thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Warnock.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Madam Chair. 
Secretary Vilsack, welcome. Good to see you.
    Section 22007 of the Inflation Reduction Act provided, as 
you know, $2.2 billion for farmers who have suffered historical 
discrimination by the USDA. This relief likely includes many 
Black farmers in Georgia, farmers I know, like Lucias Abrams of 
Burke County, Carl Parker in Ashburn, who say that they are 
still in need of financial assistance for past discrimination. 
I run into these farmers from time to time across Georgia. The 
provision was signed into law last August, and USDA started 
distributing funds for economically distressed farm loan 
borrowers in October. Bill signed in August, economically 
distressed farm loan borrowers began to see relief in October. 
It is currently March and not a dime of financial assistance 
has gone out to farmers who faced discrimination, right as they 
are entering another planting season again in the red.
    When I run into farmers like Lucias Abrams and Carl Parker, 
I cannot help but think of that old song by Sam Cooke, ``It Has 
Been a Long Time Coming,'' and I have been waiting to say to 
them, ``The change is going to come.'' That change has not 
come, and the longer they wait the deeper they are in the hole.
    Can I tell the farmers in Georgia who have been waiting for 
a very long time that USDA will start distributing this 
assistance?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes. As you know, Senator, we began the 
process of establishing and identifying a national 
administrator that will oversee this program and make decisions 
ultimately about who gets what. We have also established the 
process to begin establishing regional hubs that will help 
recover applications from folks who seek assistance, and we are 
working to get the word out that the cooperators that want to 
assist and help those hubs to identify themselves so that we 
are in a position to make sure that they are looped into the 
process, so that farmers across the United States who feel that 
they were discriminated against, who need financial assistance, 
will have an outlet, will have a place where they can go, 
people they can talk to, they will learn about the application 
process, they will learn about the system, for these hubs to 
accumulate these applications, to put them up with the national 
administrator, and the national administrator makes the 
decisions.
    Our goal, as we have indicated, will be to try to get 
resources disbursed before the end of the year.
    Senator Warnock. Before the end of the year. You describe 
this process, and you can imagine, I suspect, how this is heard 
in the ears of folks who have been waiting a very, very long 
time. Every single day matters. It is not as if they are 
standing still. It gets worse the longer it takes. I just want 
to be able to say to these folks, look them in the eye and tell 
them that relief is on the way.
    A simple yes or no. Will you commit to doing everything in 
your power to move faster to implement this program?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Senator Warnock. Will you commit to providing my office in 
writing a timeline, a timeline for outreach, application, 
decision, and the expected distribution of this financial 
assistance to farmers? I think you said you expect to have it 
all delivered by the end of the year?
    Secretary Vilsack. Resources out the door by the end of the 
year. That is the goal. Now we do not know how many 
applications we are going to receive, Senator. Do you know how 
many applications we are going to receive?
    Senator Warnock. Let me hear from you.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, how many are we going to receive? 
Are we going to receive 30,000? 40,000? 50,000? 100,000? 
200,000? We do not know. The goal here is to try to make sure 
that we get----
    Senator Warnock. I would assume your agency and the folks 
who do this work would have done some research to have a sense 
of what the universe is.
    Secretary Vilsack. We know from prior experience how many 
applications have been filed and how many people received 
compensation in Pigford, Keepseagle, Love, Garcia. We know that 
universe, but we do not know if that universe is the only 
universe of people that will apply.
    We are planning on a significant number of applications 
coming in, which is obviously going to require some time. It is 
also going to require time--you cannot just rush this from the 
standpoint of setting up the national administrator and then 
saying, ``You have got 30 days to get the applications in.'' 
You have got to give people enough time to understand what the 
system is--from prior experience we know this.
    Senator Warnock. As I talk to Georgia farmers they feel 
like they have been waiting really just to hear, to get some 
clear communication from USDA, which frankly they do not trust, 
about what is going on, and it is trust that we have got to 
work to rebuild. We have got to proactively communicate to 
these farmers who have been waiting on this financial 
assistance for a very long time.
    Let me ask you this. When was the last time you personally 
sat down with farmers who feel like they faced discrimination 
at the hands of your agency?
    Secretary Vilsack. Two or three weeks ago.
    Senator Warnock. Okay. Do you want to say anything about 
that exchange? Did people walk away with a clearer sense of the 
process? Are you satisfied with your outreach?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, am I satisfied with the outreach, 
the outreach has not really technically begun because we have 
to get the national administrator and the hubs in place. What 
we are doing now is basically asking cooperators, folks who 
want to be part of this effort to get information out about how 
you apply, where you apply, what information you have to 
provide, what the standards are going to be, we need to get 
that information out to folks.
    Senator Warnock. Do you understand that farmers feel like 
getting information from the USDA is----
    Secretary Vilsack. It is not coming from the USDA. That is 
the point of this. The point of it is we are going to have 
cooperators that these folks trust. We are going to give them 
information. We are going to give the hubs information. We are 
going to give the cooperators information, and then they are 
going to help us get information out.
    In addition to that there will also be, no doubt, some kind 
of communication system involving ads in appropriate papers and 
all of that. There is going to be a lot of work to get 
information out in a variety of ways and hopefully it will get 
to the people that absolutely are interested in this and feel 
that they deserve an opportunity to----
    Senator Warnock. Will you personally commit to hosting 
meetings with these farmers, with you and your staff, because 
at the end of the day they are looking to you?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I am happy to visit with farmers, 
Senator. At any point in time if you want to put a group of 
farmers together I am more than happy to visit with them. I 
have done that before, and you know that.
    Senator Warnock. Well, I am hearing from farmers that they 
are not clear about the process and when they can expect----
    Let me ask you this. Will you provide to my office, in 
writing, USDA's proactive outreach strategy for communicating 
with and updating farmers during the implementation of the 
process that we have discussed?
    Secretary Vilsack. Sure.
    Senator Warnock. All right. Thank you so much.
    Secretary Vilsack. Any time you have asked for information, 
Senator, I have given it to you.
    Senator Warnock. Well, I am not concerned about me. I am 
concerned about the farmers, who----
    Secretary Vilsack. If I give it to you I am assuming you 
are giving it to the farmers.
    Senator Warnock [continuing]. who have been waiting for it 
a very long time. I think if you feel impatient, imagine how 
impatient they feel. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, good 
to see you. Thanks for testifying today. I appreciate it.
    Good farm policy benefits every single American, every 
single day, because our farmers and ranchers produce the 
highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world. It 
benefits every American, every day. I know you know this.
    Fundamental to the farm bill is crop insurance and a 
countercyclical safety net. That is what helps keep our farmers 
going day in and day out, and they respond by, as I say, 
producing that food supply. The more they provide that supply 
and variety, the more choices our people have and the lower-
cost food they have. I think we not only have the best food and 
the best quality but I think Americans spend less as a 
percentage of their budget on food than almost any country in 
the world.
    As we go into this farm bill, are you committed to making 
sure that we do everything we can to support and strengthen the 
crop insurance as well as update and strengthen the 
countercyclical safety net, meaning ARC and PLC, and clearly 
PLC needs updates in those reference prices.
    Secretary Vilsack. I am happy to work with you,
    Senator, and with this Committee on that, as well as--and I 
hope that you will help and work with us to ensure that in 
addition to all of that, which is important and necessary, that 
we focus on also market development, domestic market 
opportunity for small and mid-sized operators. Because as good 
as the countercyclical program is, as good as the crop 
insurance program is, we are still losing a lot of our small- 
and mid-sized farming operations.
    One way we can maybe prevent that is by having those small- 
and mid-sized operations have more than a couple of ways to 
make money, more than just selling their crop or their 
livestock or a government payment, but maybe they get a climate 
payment, maybe they get a climate-smart premium from the 
marketplace, maybe they get renewable energy opportunities, 
maybe they get agricultural waste being converted into a 
variety of new products. We have got to create, in my view, a 
much more robust effort on the 90 percent of farmers in this 
last couple of years that either did not make any money or did 
not make enough, that the majority of their income had to come 
from someplace other than the farm.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, you and I have talked about doing 
that, and I think that is important, but it also goes to right 
now 80 percent of the farm bill is essentially transfer 
payments, SNAP, nutrition, those kinds of things. Less than 20 
percent now is the traditional ag part of the farm bill. Are 
you committed to making sure that there are adequate resources 
to do both what you have said and I have said in the 
traditional part of the farm bill?
    Secretary Vilsack. Let me answer it this way. I am happy to 
work with you on this, but I think it is important for us to 
understand that there are multiple ways to provide assistance 
and help. The farm bill is one way. The regular budget is one 
way. The CCC is one way. I mean, there are a variety of tools, 
and the more tools we have, the better job we can do. It is not 
just simply one bill or one aspect of this.
    I think it is important to look at, holistically, how do we 
meet the need and what tools do we have to have? What 
flexibilities do we have to have within the tools that we have 
to meet the need? I am happy to work on all of that.
    Senator Hoeven. Would you agree that by supporting that 
farm network the way I think we are both talking about actually 
produces more food, more variety, and lower costs that benefit 
all those other programs? That is the heart and soul, and we 
have got to make sure we do the best possible job there or 
everyone else suffers as a result.
    Secretary Vilsack. I would agree with you in terms of the 
importance of productivity. I think we have to have a broader 
view on this. I think we also have to have a view of 
maintaining life and opportunity in rural places.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, and let us go to that point. You used 
the term that I use all the time in your, I think, opening 
testimony or one of the early Q&As--farmer friendly. Are you 
committed to making sure that all these different programs we 
are talking about are truly farmer friendly and not mandatory, 
so that we can support agriculture in its diversity out there, 
and they are not running into a regulatory burden that is truly 
a problem for them?
    Secretary Vilsack. What we are trying to do within USDA is 
to focus on a voluntary, market-driven, incentive-based system. 
That is why we set up the Climate-Smart Partnership the way we 
did. That is an example of what I think we need to do.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay, that is good. Then how about in terms 
of these programs to deal with CO2 and so forth? Again, got to 
be farmer friendly, cannot be mandatory, and cannot be one size 
fits all. Do you agree with that?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, that is how we set up the Climate-
Smart Partnership Initiative. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. They should be market-based, not a large 
government-funded program.
    Secretary Vilsack. I think the CCC is providing the 
resources that allows this market-based system to get 
established. I think we primed the pump and then hopefully the 
market takes it from here. That is what we are going to learn 
from these 141 projects, Senator. We are going to learn what 
works and what does not work.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, as you know, I work pretty closely 
with the CCC, and you and I have talked about that a lot. As 
you know I am aware of those programs, and I think we have 
demonstrated a willingness to work with you on them.
    Secretary Vilsack. I do not disagree with that.
    Senator Hoeven. The other thing I would ask about is some 
of these other programs, for example, are you committed to 
maintaining the sugar program?
    Secretary Vilsack. I understand the importance of it.
    Senator Hoeven. You are committed to maintaining it?
    Secretary Vilsack. I do not know what you mean by 
maintaining it.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, we have got an existing program.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, maintaining it could be a variety 
of different definitions. I do not mean to be cute about this.
    Senator Hoeven. I am not asking you a trick question. I 
just asked if you are willing to support it?
    Secretary Vilsack. We understand the importance of it. I 
understand the importance of the sugar program. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. How about in terms of some of our 
livestock programs. What can we do to deal with the problem 
with the concentration and lack of competition?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, you know, we are attempting to do 
more by expanding processing capacity in this country. We need 
to see how that works. It may very well be that you look at 
ways in which you can provide a continuation of the opportunity 
for the Department of Agriculture to continue to do that if the 
amount of resources that we are currently committed to this is 
inadequate. I will tell you that we have gotten a lot of 
interest in this. There are a lot of applications for resources 
on both the processing side and also the fertilizer side. 
Billions of dollars of requests have come within those two 
programs.
    Senator Hoeven. Do you support both the cattle contract 
library concept, which we worked to put in place as a pilot 
project through our Appropriations Committee? Also my final 
question is on FSA staffing. Where are we there? What needs to 
be done?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are increasing staffing, but 
candidly, Senator, two things. One is our compensation 
structure and system is no longer as competitive as it once 
was. It used to be that job was maybe the best job in the 
county. That is not the case today, and so we have significant 
competition. We get loan officers in FSA, we train them, and 
then the bank comes in and says, ``Hey, we can pay you more 
with a whole lot less stress.''
    Then second, you know, it is tough to work for the 
government these days. It is tough. People feel put upon in 
terms of the criticism that is often the case with public 
service. I think we need to be very careful about making sure 
that we are bolstering public service, we are supporting public 
service so that we can continue to get enough people willing to 
do the jobs that are important to be done.
    Senator Hoeven. Thanks for being here today.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much, and Secretary 
Vilsack, let me just stress as well that public service is very 
important. What the employees do at the Department is very, 
very important, and we want to be supportive of that.
    Senator Boozman and I have been talking as we have gone 
through the hearing about just what the needs are from a 
standpoint of just updating technical support and computers and 
other kinds of things to support your work. I certainly would 
love to followup. We want to followup with you on what that 
looks like in terms of being able to give the resources at the 
local agencies and so.
    Secretary Vilsack. Madam Chair, when I got this job in 
2009, one of the first things I did is I asked the team to send 
an email to all of our employees saying how honored I was to 
have this job. I was told by a young staffer, ``Sorry, Mr. 
Secretary. We can't do that.'' I said, ``What do you mean, you 
can't send an email to all of our employees?'' He said, ``Well, 
we can't send a single email. We have 17 systems, so we will 
have to send 17 different emails.'' I said, ``Well, that's 
nuts.''
    We began a process, in 2009, to eliminate 17 systems. Madam 
Chair, I am told that by 2025, we will get that job done.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. I am shaking my head here on all of 
this, and we want to followup with you on ways that we can be 
supportive in this 2023, to be able to support you in this 
effort. I know it affects everything you do. It affects how you 
relate to farmers and relates to conservation programs. It 
relates to everything when we talk about streamlining and 
communicating and so on.
    Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Well, I certainly would agree with that, 
and those are areas that, again, I think we could really get 
some real bang for the buck, and I know that you are working 
really hard to get it done. Like I say, we would really like to 
help you in that regard.
    Madam Chair, I respectfully request to include in the 
record a letter to the Budget Committee signed by 400 national, 
regional, and State organizations that underscores the need for 
additional resources to be made available for this farm bill in 
order to adequately address the needs of our farmers and 
ranchers, including improvements to the farm safety net as well 
as investments in trade, research, and rural development, and I 
would add technology.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Very good. So ordered, without 
objection.

    [The letter can be found on page 83 in the Appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. With that let me thank you again for 
joining us before the Committee. You have done this many times. 
We very much appreciate your leadership, and your whole team's 
leadership, and look forward to working with you to get a good 
bipartisan farm bill done.
    With that we will leave the record open for five days. 
Thank you.

    [Whereupon, at 12:24 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
