         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. I call this hearing to order. 
Welcome. This is our first hearing this Congress of the 
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data 
Security. Delighted to be here doing this work and for the 
opportunity to work closely with Ranking Member Blackburn. I 
would like to wish her a happy birthday week.
    It was a couple of days ago, but we celebrate, in our 
family, the whole week as your birthday week. I look forward to 
working with Senator Blackburn and make sure that this is a 
bipartisan effort to make progress on issues that are within 
the jurisdiction of this subcommittee, ranging from strong 
privacy protections for all Americans, strengthening our data 
security of connected devices that we depend on every day, 
identifying safe guardrails for emerging uses of artificial 
intelligence.
    I think that will get a lot of attention. And obviously so 
much more. With every step we take, we are always going to try 
to keep hardworking Americans doing their--living their lives, 
make sure that as consumers, they are first in our mind.
    Today, we are going to discuss increasing price 
transparency for consumers within the marketplace, broadly--all 
the marketplaces. We all know that junk fees can be frustrating 
for consumers when they shop for products and for services. 
They raise costs and in many cases they create confusion.
    But what does a junk fee look like? How does it feel? 
Simply put, these are fees that are disclosed to a consumer 
midway, through, or at the end of a transaction, or they are 
fees that serve no tangible purpose for a consumer like, you 
know, a processing fee, and that they are mandatory or 
unavoidable.
    The Council of Economic Advisors, the CEA, has found that 
junk fees limit the ability of consumers to comparison shop 
between service providers and reduce competition between 
merchants. Companies need to give consumers the transparency 
they deserve when they shop for goods or services. Price 
transparency allows for consumers to see the total price for a 
product or service from the get-go, so they don't feel 
deceived.
    Allows for the consumer to see additional service charges 
that add to the overall price upfront, so they are not midway 
or at the end of a transaction when they find out about it. 
Behind me we have a common example of purchasing a ticket for 
an event. On the first row, the ticket price displayed is $140 
plus fees.
    No way to see or understand what the fees are until you go 
through the checkout process. Oh, I ripped the wrong paper. 
Anyway, here we see almost their transparency of--or example of 
how upfront and all-in transparency looks. All the fees are 
listed below the actual ticket price, compared with the first 
example.
    Imagine trying to buy tickets for a family of six and the 
total cost ends up being almost $200 more than advertised. Here 
is an example--it is not really ripping--of total upfront 
pricing where you will pay at checkout, whereas displayed 
before you even select the ticket. This way consumers are 
informed with the crystal clear price that they will pay for 
the product or service at checkout and not a penny more.
    Last month, we had the pleasure of discussing methods to 
increase price transparency for consumers with the Director of 
the National Economic Council, Dr. Lael Brainard. Today, we are 
going to continue that conversation by hearing from our 
witnesses panel, and I hope and believe this will continue that 
effort. By working together, we can fairly promote the upfront, 
all-in pricing across all sectors.
    Already, bipartisan legislation has been introduced to 
increase price transparency for consumers in certain sectors. 
Surely more legislation is on the horizon. Senators are going 
to have the chance to discuss those efforts today. As a former 
small business owner, I experienced firsthand the many 
obstacles one encounters in opening a new brewpub, a new 
restaurant, or literally any small business.
    Small businesses up and down Main Street live and breathe 
unfair competition in order to keep the lights on and in order 
to serve their customers, deliver what their customers desire. 
Today, large companies use their market advantage to force 
customers into paying fees that were not expected or simply 
unavoidable.
    Consumers' pockets and small businesses suffer as a result. 
Businesses need to play by the same rules to create a level 
playing field that gives everyone an equal chance to compete 
fairly. I think consumers will always be the major 
beneficiaries of such a system. As our economy continues to 
recover from the pandemic, we need do--we need to ensure 
American consumers have the information to make every dollar 
count.
    Let's be clear about what this hearing is not about. It is 
not about setting price caps for products or services. It is 
not about telling private companies how they should operate 
their business.
    I would like to operate, or I would like to operate--I 
would like to welcome each of our witnesses who are joining us 
today, Sally Greenberg, the CEO for the National Consumers 
League, Todd Zywicki, Professor of Law, George Mason 
University, Antonin Scalia Law School, and on Zoom, Vicki 
Morwitz, Professor of Business, Columbia Business School.
    I now recognize Ranking Member Blackburn for her opening 
remarks.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I am so 
pleased that we are having our first hearing, and I really do 
look forward to working with you on issues where we have so 
much agreement, Kids Online Safety Act, data privacy, data 
security, artificial intelligence, and preventing the sale of 
dangerous and counterfeit products online.
    As we had discussed previously, I was really a bit 
surprised by the Administration and now this committee's focus 
on so-called junk fees. When I am in Tennessee, the economy is 
what is at the top of the list that things that people are 
talking about. They aren't talking about junk fees.
    What they are talking about is the price at the gas pump, 
the grocery store, how high these electric bills are going, and 
they are concerned about skyrocketing inflation on the basket 
of goods that they purchase and use every single day. And they 
are worried about the out-of-control spending.
    The debt deal was very unpopular in Tennessee because it 
doesn't rein in what this Government and this Administration is 
spending. And American families, Tennessee families want 
answers to those problems, and they really don't want to hear 
bureaucrats in Washington or legislators discussing resort fees 
and food delivery fees for DoorDash or Uber Eats.
    So, this is another--the way I look at this issue, and the 
way many Tennesseans look at it, is this is another way for the 
FTC, the CFPB, DOT, and all these regulators to clamp down on 
businesses and try to micromanage businesses. Now, are these 
fees annoying? Absolutely, they are. Should companies be more 
transparent in how they bring the fees forward? And absolutely, 
they should do that.
    And consumers themselves should be more willing to walk 
away and use only businesses that are operating on the up and 
up, that are going to disclose these fees. But we have to 
remember this, these are not monopolies. These are hotels and 
airlines and banks and online retailers, and competition 
matters to these companies.
    And we see that competition making an impact on the 
marketplace every single day. So, thank you to our witnesses. I 
am looking forward to a good, frank discussion today. 
Appreciate your getting your testimony in, in a timely manner. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. 
Now, we can look forward to--we will let each of our witnesses 
do their introductory remarks.
    Why don't we start with Vicky Morwitz, who is Professor of 
Business at Columbia Business School. You are on.

        STATEMENT OF VICKI G. MORWITZ, BRUCE GREENWALD 
  PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, COLUMBIA 
              BUSINESS SCHOOL, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

    Ms. Morwitz. Thank you very much. Good morning. My name is 
Vicki Morwitz. I am the Bruce Greenwald, Professor of Business 
and Professor of Marketing at Columbia Business School at 
Columbia University.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify on the issue of 
protecting consumers from junk fees. I am a consumer 
psychologist with expertise in how consumers process additional 
fees and surcharges, a topic I have studied for over 25 years.
    I have discussed this research in my classes, and I have 
given research seminars on this topic at universities around 
the world. In my testimony, I will discuss two pricing 
practices that I have studied in depth that are central to the 
discussions taking place today, partition pricing and drip 
pricing.
    The academic research on both partition and drip pricing 
makes clear that consumers make better informed decisions when 
firms use all-inclusive pricing. My co-authors and I define 
partition pricing as a strategy where firms decide to divide a 
product's price into two or more mandatory parts, a base price 
for the main product, and one or more mandatory surcharges, 
rather than charging a single, all-inclusive price.
    For example, many hotels have a mandatory fee on top of the 
daily room rate. These are sometimes called resort fees or 
facility fees or destination fees and can range from $20 to 
over $50 a night. And many rental car agencies assess several 
mandatory fees on top of the daily rental rate, such as 
concession recovery fees, customer facility fees, energy 
recovery fees, and vehicle licensing fees.
    In general, what research on partition pricing has shown is 
that when firms separate out mandatory surcharges, consumers 
tend to underestimate the total price they will have to pay, 
and they are often more likely to complete the purchase.
    While these effects happen, even when the surcharges are 
fully disclosed, the detrimental effects are even larger when 
the surcharges are hidden in the small print and when they are 
made more difficult for consumers to process, such as when they 
are framed as a percent of the base price versus as a flat 
dollar amount.
    My coauthors and I have also studied a related pricing 
strategy called drip pricing. With drip pricing, firms 
advertise only part of a product's price upfront and reveal 
other charges later when shoppers go through the buying 
process.
    Drip fees can be mandatory or can be for optional items, 
but for today's testimony, I will focus on the dripping of 
mandatory surcharges. Drip pricing is commonly used in 
industries like the cable TV and the ticketing industries. When 
a consumer shops for a TV Internet bundle from a cable 
television provider, they may first see an attractive base 
price offer for the bundle, but later learn there are also 
broadcast TV fees, set top box fees, regional sports fees, and 
TV connection fees that raise the price considerably.
    And a consumer shopping for a ticket for a live event like 
a concert, a play, or a baseball game typically first sees the 
price for different seats in the venue. After selecting a seat, 
as the consumer clicks through more web pages, they may come to 
learn there is also a mandatory booking fee, ticketing fee, 
venue fee, and delivery fee, even when the tickets are 
delivered electronically.
    Eventually they see a total price that may be much higher 
than the first price they saw, and they may be under time 
pressure to complete the purchase, as there might be a 
countdown clock that indicates they have to complete their 
purchase in just a few minutes, or they may be told there is 
only two seats left at that price.
    But research has shown is that when surcharges are dripped, 
consumers end up being more likely to buy a product that 
appears cheaper upfront based only on the base price, but that 
is more expensive in total given the drip fees. Consumers also 
tend to buy more expensive products than they otherwise would--
with drip, such as a seat closer to the stage for a live event.
    Notably, these effects happen even when consumers are 
provided with a total price at the final stage of the 
transaction before they complete their purchase. While in 
theory, they can cancel the purchase when they see that the 
total is more expensive than they first thought, they often 
don't because they tend to overestimate the cost of restarting 
search and underestimate the benefits of doing so.
    Because of this, it is not enough to show the total price 
to avoid the detrimental effects of drip pricing. Research has 
also shown that these effects don't go away with purchase 
experience. For example, repeat ticket buyers are still 
affected by drip pricing, similar to first time buyers. That is 
not because consumers are stupid or even careless that they are 
affected by the separation and dripping of mandatory 
surcharges.
    In general, consumers try to make good decisions for 
themselves and their families. But pricing practices like drip 
and partition pricing take advantage of the fact that we 
consumers have a lot going on in our lives. We are busy and can 
be distracted.
    And because of that, we may not notice or appropriately 
consider all information important to that purchase decision, 
especially when that information is hidden in the small print, 
is presented in obscure language, or is dripped late in the 
shopping process.
    Academic research has shown that partitioned and drip 
pricing leads consumers to spend more money than they intended 
to or needed to make choices that don't reflect their true 
desires or preferences. What the research on these pricing 
practices also makes clear is that consumers benefit when all 
inclusive, upfront pricing is used, rather than when fees are 
dripped later in the shopping process or disclosed in multiple 
parts.
    As a scholar who has studied these pricing practices for 
decades and who knows well how their use can be detrimental to 
consumers and to honest businesses, I strongly advocate that 
policy be promoted that addresses the partitioning and dripping 
of surcharges like we commonly see in so many industries.
    These policies will benefit consumers if they require that 
upfront stated prices must be all inclusive. In other words, 
that all mandatory fees must be included in the total price and 
that the total price should be seen upfront.
    This is what academic research suggests will be most 
beneficial to consumers. Thank you for the opportunity to 
appear today at this hearing. I am happy to answer any 
questions that you might have.

    My co-authors and I have also studied a related pricing strategy 
called drip pricing \5\. Drip pricing is a pricing technique in which 
firms advertise only part of a product's price up front and reveal 
other charges later as shoppers go through the buying process.\6\ 
Dripped fees can be mandatory or can be for optional items, but for 
today's testimony, I will focus on the dripping of mandatory 
surcharges.

pricing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Drip pricing is commonly used in industries like the ticketing 
industry. A consumer shopping for a ticket for a live event like a 
concert, a play, or a baseball game, typically first sees the price for 
different seats in the venue. After selecting a seat, as the consumer 
clicks through more web pages, they may come to learn about all the 
additional fees that I mentioned earlier. Eventually they see a total 
price that may be 30 or even 50 percent higher than the first price 
they saw--and when they see that total price, there may be under time 
pressure to complete the purchase as they may be shown a countdown 
clock that indicates they have to complete their purchase in just a few 
minutes, or they may be told there are only two seats left at that 
price. Other industries like the telecommunications industry, might 
first show the monthly plan rate, but then drip other mandatory fees 
such as universal connectivity charges, administrative service fees, 
access recovery fees, franchise fees, and more.\7\ And when a consumer 
shops for a TV/internet bundle from a cable television provider, they 
may first see an attractive base price offer for the bundle, but later 
learn there are also broadcast TV fees, set top box fees, regional 
sports fees, and TV connection fees that raise the price 
considerably.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What research has shown is that when surcharges are dripped, 
consumers end up being more likely to buy a product that appears 
cheaper up front based only on the base price, but that is more 
expensive in total given the dripped mandatory fees. This happens 
because drip pricing makes the search process more difficult for 
consumers. Consumers also tend to buy more expensive products than they 
otherwise would have, such as a seat closer to the stage for a live 
event, when surcharges are dripped.\9\

(2020), ``Consumers' Reactions to Drip Pricing,'' Marketing Science, 39 
(1), 188-210.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Notably, these effects happen even when consumers are provided with 
a total price at the final stage of the transaction, before they 
complete their purchase. While in theory, they can cancel the purchase 
when they see that the total that is more expensive than they first 
thought, they often do not, because they tend to overestimate the costs 
of restarting search and underestimate the benefits of doing so, for 
example because they assume that the other providers also assess these 
same fees.\10\ Because of this, it is not enough to show the total 
price to avoid the detrimental effects of drip pricing. Research has 
also shown that these effects do not go away with purchase experience--
for example, repeat ticket buyers are still affected by drip pricing, 
similar to first time buyers.\11\

    It is not because consumers are stupid or even careless that they 
are affected by the separation and dripping of mandatory surcharges. In 
general, consumers try their best to make good decisions for themselves 
and their families. But pricing practices like drip and partitioned 
pricing take advantage of the fact that we consumers have a lot going 
on in our lives--we are busy and can be distracted, and because of that 
we may not notice or appropriately consider all information important 
to that purchase decision, especially when that information is hidden 
in the small print, is presented in obscure language, or dripped late 
in the shopping process, and when we are put under time pressure with 
countdown clocks or receive scarcity cues such as that there are only a 
few items left at that price.
    When firms use drip and partitioned pricing, it leads consumers to 
make decisions that differ from what they intended and that are against 
their own interest. Academic research has shown that partitioned and 
drip pricing leads consumers to spend more money than they intended to 
or needed to, and to make choices that do not reflect their true 
desires or preferences. These practices also put well-intentioned 
competitors who use all-in pricing at a competitive disadvantage as it 
makes their prices look more expensive than their competitors who use 
these pricing techniques, even when their prices are actually cheaper 
in total.\12\ What the research on these pricing practices also makes 
clear is that consumers and well-intentioned firms benefit when all-
inclusive upfront pricing is used, rather than when fees are dripped 
later in the shopping process or disclosed in multiple parts.

    As a scholar who has studied these pricing strategies for decades 
and who knows well how their use can be detrimental to consumers and to 
honest organizations, I strongly advocate that policy be promoted that 
addresses the partitioning and dripping of surcharges, like we commonly 
see in the ticketing, the telecommunication, the cable, the hotel, and 
the rental car industries, among others. These policies will benefit 
consumers if they require that upfront stated prices must be all 
inclusive--in other words that all mandatory fees must be included in 
the total price and that the total price should be seen upfront. This 
is what academic research suggests will be most beneficial to 
consumers.
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear today at this hearing. I am 
happy to answer any questions that you may have.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Ms. Morwitz. I appreciate 
you taking the time to be with us. Next, let's turn to Todd 
Zywicki. He is a Professor of Law at George Mason University 
Law School.

              STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR TODD ZYWICKI,

          GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION PROFESSOR

      OF LAW, ANTONIN SCALIA LAW SCHOOL, RESEARCH FELLOW,

                     LAW & ECONOMICS CENTER

    Mr. Zywicki. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Blackburn, it is 
a pleasure to be here with you today. I have run into junk fees 
myself. I know what the instinct is. I got tricked into one of 
these on vacation in Florida a little while back, and so I 
understand exactly what is going on here.
    But I think the most important thing here is to keep in 
mind the situations under which this can be a problem and 
situations where it is not. And I want to just briefly make 
three points, which is the first thing is to talk about the 
situations in which this can occur and be a market failure.
    Second, talk about the more important, more generalizable 
situation in which multi-part pricing is efficient and prevents 
cross consumer subsidies and inefficiencies in pricing. And 
third, I want to talk about situations in which regulation 
itself is the cause of a proliferation of fees, and can end up 
harming consumers, is some examples that are going on.
    So, let's talk first about when there can be a market 
value, when this can happen. We just heard from Professor 
Morwitz of these problems of drip pricing and the like, but 
this primarily happens in particular context, which is where we 
have non-repeat consumers who don't learn over time, and 
situations where they don't really have an alternative to.
    An obvious example is mandatory fees, like the mandatory 
resort fees we heard about. That is what happened to me, which 
is I booked online, I showed up at the hotel. At the last page, 
at some point among the list of cost was a $30 resort fee. I 
had to whip up my credit card when I got there and I thought I 
had prepaid, right.
    If there is a mandatory fee, it should be at least strongly 
presumptively part of the overall price, not something that is 
broken out. Ticket fees, I agree completely. Mr. Chairman, 
those sorts of things where you have to click--where, even 
though you know there is going to be a fee on the back end, you 
have got to click through six, eight screens in order to find 
out what the heck the fee is going to be. I don't see if it is 
going to be mandatory.
    I think presumptively it should be part of the overall 
price. But on the other hand, we see situations where it is 
also predatory. So, take this growing practice of credit card 
surcharging which has been allowed. Merchants can give cash 
discounts. Cash discounts, the option of getting cash discounts 
is pro-consumer.
    The option of a merchant imposing a credit card surcharge 
at the end of a transaction is one of most anti-consumer 
policies I have ever seen. And the reason is they impose it in 
situations where you really don't have an alternative to using 
a credit card, whether it is online, whether it is in a 
vacation area. Basically, the same places like resort fees.
    And so, we used to have credit card surcharging was 
outlawed, cash discounting has always been allowed. And I think 
that is really something that should be explored, and I think 
it is very disappointing that a lot of consumer activist groups 
actually are lobbying in favor and support this idea of credit 
card surcharging, which is a really pernicious practice.
    Those are the situations where this can happen. In general, 
though, fees, multi-part pricing prevents cross consumer 
subsidies and pays--requires consumers to pay for things they 
get. Additional toppings on pizza, for example. I don't think 
anybody has objection to that. Paying for first class and the 
like. Paying late fees--at least traditionally, people 
understood that paying late fees for people who pay late on 
credit cards would be an appropriate way of pricing risk, 
although apparently that is in question now.
    It is often the case that we can have efficient 
combinations of prices. So, in the airline market, for example, 
everybody knows bags fly free on Southwest. Everybody knows 
bags don't fly free on the legacy airlines. Everybody knows 
there is going to be a fee for bags on the other airlines and 
the like.
    Maybe there is ways you can disclose it, but nobody is 
fooled at this point. And so, that is obviously pricing for 
certain services. So, I talk about it in my testimony. There 
are aspects of that that are driven by the way taxes are 
assessed and that sort of thing. But most of what we see in 
markets is an alignment of prices with what--with the cost the 
consumers impose.
    Well, I think it is particularly problematic is the third 
category, which is where we get on bundling as a result of 
regulation. The Durbin amendment to Dodd-Frank is a good 
example of this. By imposing price controls on interchange 
fees, we took away free checking. We took away free, simple 
free checking bank accounts for millions of Americans, 
particularly low income Americans.
    Now we get multi-part pricing with high monthly fees, an 
elimination of annual fees, and other prices that are adjusted 
as a result of that. The Credit Card Act did the same thing by 
controlling the ability to price risk, risk got repriced. The 
RESPA rule that I talk about in my testimony that forces on 
bundling and the like and ends up driving up cost. And so, a 
lot of the proposals on the table right now, such as the CFPB's 
late fees rule, would be harmful to consumers by interfering 
with this risk based pricing.
    The proposal to extend the Durbin amendment to credit card 
would be disastrous for consumers and take away free credit 
cards from consumers. I see I am over my time. I look forward 
to taking any questions you have. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Zywicki follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Professor Todd Zywicki, George Mason University 
   Foundation Professor of Law, Antonin Scalia Law School, Research 
                     Fellow, Law & Economics Center
    Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Blackburn, and Members of the 
Committee:

    I am Todd Zywicki and it is a pleasure to appear before you today 
to testify on the topic of ``Protecting Consumers from Junk Fees.'' I 
am George Mason University Foundation Professor at Antonin Scalia Law 
School and Research Fellow of the Law & Economics Center. From 2020-
2021 I served as the Chair of the CFPB's Taskforce on Consumer 
Financial Law and from 2003-2004 I served as the Director of the Office 
of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission. I am also co-author 
of Consumer Credit and the American Economy (Oxford 2014) and have 
written and spoken extensively on issues of consumer protection 
generally and consumer financial protection specifically. I appear 
voluntarily today in my personal capacity and do not speak on behalf or 
represent any other party.
    I share the frustration that many consumers hold today regarding 
the proliferation of seemingly ubiquitous add-on fees that we 
experience constantly, from surcharges for using our credit cards at a 
merchant, to hotel ``resort fees,'' and others. And earlier this year I 
experienced exactly this frustration when I checked into a hotel on 
vacation and was assessed a mandatory $30 a day ``resort fee'' that was 
only disclosed in fine print on the last screen of a multi-page 
checkout process at an Internet hotel booking website. Buying a ticket 
to concert has in fact become a tedious process of searching for a 
concert or sports ticket and then having to spend 10 minutes clicking 
through multiple pages before you can discover the real price and 
decide whether to go to the show.
    So I also say, ``Enough.''
    But it is also important to stress that not all of these fees are 
``junk'' fees. Many of these multi-part pricing schemes are 
economically efficient, in that they better match consumers with the 
product terms and attributes they value. Others are appropriate as 
means to protect some consumers from being forced to subsidize others' 
choices or the higher costs that some consumers impose relative to 
others. For example, requiring upper-income jet-setters to pay foreign 
currency transaction fees hardly seems unfair to those who don't travel 
abroad and presumably nobody has an issue with requiring payment of 
``add on'' fees for additional toppings on a pizza. Requiring every 
vacation resort to be all-inclusive would force those who don't drink 
alcohol to subsidize those who do. While some use of multi-part pricing 
today is likely welfare-reducing, multi-part pricing has become more 
frequent is because paying for the services you actually use over the 
long run can be more fair and efficient for other consumers, even if 
foreign travelers, partiers, and those who pay late on their credit 
cards might disagree.
    As Howard Beales and I wrote recently:

        The term ``junk fees'' defies easy definition. But it is 
        imperative to distinguish `junk fees' that are designed to 
        extract rents and consumer surplus from consumers from 
        efficient behavior-based fees. Welfare-reducing ``junk'' fees 
        are most likely to emerge only under a relatively narrow set of 
        market conditions--particularly those markets with few repeat 
        customers where consumers are less likely to learn of the 
        hidden fees, where consumers are effectively locked-in and 
        unable to avoid paying the fee when it is imposed, or where 
        such fees may be atypical and thus consumers are not alert to 
        them.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
``Junk Fees'' are Theoretically Possible But Likely Arise in Only 
        Limited Contexts
    One example of what might be classified as a ``junk fee'' is the 
growing practice of merchants imposing credit card ``surcharge'' fees 
on consumer retail transactions.\2\ Rarely, if ever, are consumers 
informed up-front of the presence of a surcharge--I was recently on 
business travel at an out-of-town conference and after lunch was 
presented with the bill--which I happened to notice that a surcharge 
would be applied if I chose to pay with a credit card. Notably, 
businesses are guaranteed the right under Federal law to offer cash 
discounts to consumers, but this one chose to impose a surcharge that I 
did not discover until after the meal. Such situations--non-repeat 
customers visiting a tourist area, not carrying a large amount of cash, 
and eating a moderately expensive sit-down restaurant--present prime 
opportunities for the potential for exploitative ``junk fees.'' \3\ 
Hotel ``resort fees,'' which are typically imposed by hotels in similar 
contexts--namely, tourist areas with minimal repeat business--provide a 
similar example.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ See Todd J. Zywicki, Geoffrey A. Manne, and Kristian Stout, 
Behavioral Economics Goes to Court: The Fundamental Flaws in the 
Behavioral Law & Economics Arguments Against No-Surcharge Laws, 82 
Missouri L. Rev. 769 (2017).
    \3\ Ironically, the CFPB and self-identified consumer advocates not 
only have never criticized abusive credit card surcharging practices by 
merchants, they have actually supported the right of merchants to 
impose such fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fees such as credit card surcharges or hotel ``resort fees,'' in 
which the various elements of the price are not revealed until later in 
the transaction but which the consumer cannot reasonably avoid (such as 
a mandatory surcharge when paying with a credit card), are often 
referred to as ``drip pricing.'' Concert and sports tickets provide a 
variation on the theme. While most consumers today are aware that 
transaction and ticketing fees will be assessed on a ticket purchase, 
typically it is difficult or impossible to discover the size of those 
fees until one has invested a substantial degree of time picking seats 
and clicking through multiple screens to finally discover the ``real'' 
price. Moreover, these fees typically are mandatory and effectively 
unavoidable. A strong case can be made that fees of this sort should be 
disclosed as part of the price of the ticket, much like airlines are 
required to disclose all applicable taxes and fees as part of their 
quoted up-front price.
    Although mandatory ``resort fees'' illustrate the theoretical 
potential for market failure, this example remains the exception to the 
general rule that markets tend to deliver consumers the collection of 
services and prices they desire. Only approximately 6-7 percent of U.S. 
hotels charge such fees and those that do are mainly limited to resort 
hotels in certain markets, such as Orlando or Las Vegas, just as the 
theory predicts.\4\ Moreover, those hotels that do charge ``resort 
fees'' often do claim to offer more amenities than those that do not 
and of those hotels that charge resort fees, those with more amenities 
appear to charge higher fees than those with more Spartan offerings.\5\ 
Thus, even in a case such as resort fees, although a case might be made 
for requiring better pricing disclosure of these fees up-front to 
facilitate consumer shopping, it is questionable whether they should be 
entirely dismissed as nothing more than ``junk fees.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Most Instances Market Competition Delivers the Collection of Prices 
        and Services that Consumers Desire
    In contrast to these rare contexts in which market failure is 
possible, in most situations competitive markets tend to produce 
pricing terms that better align the incidence of payment for certain 
services with the cost of providing those services, such as charging 
more for additional pizza toppings or for first-class airline seats. 
Regulatory interference with prices in this context can lead to less 
efficient pricing, higher overall costs for consumers, and unfair and 
regressive subsidization and redistribution of costs among consumers.
    For example, consider the CFPB's recent proposal to impose an 
effective $8 price control on credit card late fees.\6\ Prior economic 
research has demonstrated that size of late fees is correlated with 
consumer risk and that when late fees are regulated, consumers overall 
are forced to pay higher interest rates to compensate for 
chargeoffs.\7\ A recent study has also demonstrated that when the size 
of late fees is reduced, the frequency of late payment increases.\8\ 
Moreover, these findings are generalizable--limits on the pricing of 
behavior-based and risk-based pricing fees have been demonstrated to 
lead to offsetting adjustments in other costs, such as higher interest 
rates and higher prices for other fees (such as cash advance fees and 
penalty interest rates). In addition, limiting the ability to price 
risk efficiently leads to a reduction in credit accessibility and the 
size of credit lines, particularly for lower income and higher risk 
borrowers.\9\ It is not clear why forcing those who pay their credit 
card bills on time, especially lower-income Americans, to subsidize 
those who pay late is considered to be a ``pro-consumer'' policy.

    Inefficient regulation of bank overdraft protection services also 
raise the danger of curtailing access to this service and forcing those 
who do not overdraft to pay for those who do.\10\ To date, the CFPB has 
been relatively restrained in its regulation of overdraft pricing and 
access. And several banks have adopted changes to their overdraft 
services. But economic analysis has shown that when access to overdraft 
protection is curtailed by regulation or the permissible among of 
overdraft fees is regulated, consumers are more likely to bounce checks 
(and incur NSF fees) and have attempted payments declined. A study by 
Dlugosz, Melzer, and Morgan found that when price controls on the 
permissible size of overdraft fees were relaxed following preemption, 
the minimum balance necessary to be eligible for interest checking 
declined by 28 percent-40 percent (approximately $376-$538), and 
checking account ownership by low-income households rose by 4 
percentage points (which corresponds to a 10 percent increase in the 
probability that a low-income household would have a bank account).\11\ 
Low-income households were also more likely to persist in account 
ownership and less likely to have their accounts closed. By contrast, 
they found that lifting these restrictions had no affect on bank 
account ownership by higher-income consumers, implying that the price 
controls adversely affected primarily lower-income households. It has 
also been suggested the restrictions on access to overdraft protection 
led to a reduction in access to free checking. Moreover, because 
overdraft protection and payday loans are viewed as relatively close 
substitute products by consumers, reducing access to overdraft 
protection can be expected to lead to an increase in the use of payday 
lending by consumers.

    Experience with the Durbin Amendment to Dodd-Frank, which imposed 
price controls on debit card interchange fees has similarly had the 
effect of leading to higher required monthly minimum balances to be 
eligible for free checking, reduced access to free checking (especially 
among lower-income consumers who were unable to meet the steep 
increases in minimum balance requirements that followed in the wake of 
the Durbin Amendment's imposition), higher monthly maintenance and 
other fees for those no longer eligible for free checking, and 
elimination of rewards on debit cards.\12\ According to one estimate, 
some 1 million low-income consumers might have lost access to bank 
accounts as a result of the cost increases that resulted from 
imposition of the Durbin Amendment as part of Dodd-Frank. Even more 
ironic in light of the topic of today's hearing, the imposition of the 
Durbin Amendment actually produced a change in the majority of bank 
accounts from a simple free-checking model to a new model with multiple 
price points and greater pricing complexity. It would be difficult to 
conjure a more telling example of the incoherence associated with some 
prior efforts to regulate the pricing of consumer services.

In Some Instances, Multi-Part Pricing is the Result of Government 
        Regulations that Interfere with the Ability of Sellers to Offer 
        Simpler Prices Even if Desired by Consumers
    In still other situations, the presence of multi-part pricing might 
reflect government regulations that mandate or encourage the 
fragmentation of costs into multiple parts even where doing so reduces 
consumer welfare. For example, the endless list of fees you face when 
you buy a home (such as appraisal, credit risk, flood insurance, and 
other fees) results from interpretations of RESPA that effectively 
prohibits lenders or other third-parties from offering a bundled suite 
of those services for one guaranteed price.\13\ The Federal Trade 
Commission's Motor Vehicle Dealers NPRM seems to follow the RESPA 
approach of imposing a convoluted multi-stage price revelation 
structure for consumer auto transactions and new limits on the sale of 
add-on products that is likely to simply make the process of buying a 
car more complicated and time-consuming with no demonstrable benefit to 
consumers.\14\

    Another example of regulation-induced multi-part pricing is the use 
of a variety of fees by airlines, such as baggage fees, ticket change 
fees, paying for food and snacks, etc. One explanation for the growing 
propensity and size of these fees is that airline tickets are subject 
to a hefty 7.5 percent excise tax on each ticket (in addition to other 
ticketing and travel taxes and fees), whereas these partitioned fees 
are not.\15\ Moreover, because bundling the cost of these services into 
the overall cost of the trip will increase ticket costs, this will also 
increase the amount of taxes consumers have to pay, which can be 
avoided by purchasing untaxed services instead.\16\

    As noted above, the elimination of simple free checking for bank 
accounts and the spread of a variety of new fees, especially for lower-
income consumers, in the past decade is primarily the result of the 
operation of the Durbin Amendment, Dodd-Frank generally, and 
restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve on the operation of bank 
overdraft programs.
The Efficient Pricing Scheme for Consumers will Vary By Market and Will 
        Change Over Time And Regulators Should be Cautious About 
        Arresting this Evolution
    But more to the point, is there anyone who ever travels on a plane 
today who is unaware that most airlines today charge for baggage or 
doesn't know that ``Bags Fly Free'' on Southwest Airlines? Or that 
unlike other airlines, there are no change or other ``junk'' fees on 
Southwest? According to one report, when Southwest chose not to follow 
the other airlines and impose new fees, the company opted to forego 
approximately $500 million per year in new revenues. But that was 
offset by the fact that Southwest increased its market share by two 
percentage points, increased passenger loads by 10 percent, and brought 
in an additional $2 billion per year in incremental revenues.\17\ On 
the other hand, Southwest fares are also slightly higher ceteris 
paribus than those that charge for baggage and other fees.\18\

    As the airline industry example illustrates, it is also quite 
common to see a blend of different strategies in certain markets. For 
example, some hotels offer all-inclusive experiences and others engage 
in partitioned pricing. A family of six going to Disney for a week is 
obviously going to prefer a different set of fees and services than a 
business person flying to New York for an overnight business meeting. 
High-end hotels often charge for services such as parking and breakfast 
that many budget hotels include in their price. It is hard to argue 
that the reason why the Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons charges for 
services that Motel 6 does not is because those who stay at luxury 
hotels are less sophisticated or attentive than consumers who opt for 
budget hotels that offer free parking and breakfast.
    Moreover, the optimal pricing scheme for any product or service 
tends to evolve over time. For example, cable television traditionally 
offered a large package of dozens of channels of programming in a 
limited number of ``package'' offerings and prices. Over time consumers 
balked at being asked to pay for a large number of channels they did 
not watch, notably expensive sports programming. So in response to 
consumer demand, program offerings have become unbundled, as a variety 
of specialty streaming channels have emerged that offers a smaller and 
more targeted set of viewing options at a lower price than the 
traditional multi-channel cable package. Others have continued to stick 
with the cable companies' bundled channel offerings.
    Other markets have evolved in the opposite direction. For example, 
when cell phones were first introduced, pricing was very complex, with 
separate prices for incoming calls, outgoing calls, text messages, 
different data plans, and the like. ``Competitive pressure to attract 
consumers who found such plans confusing, along with changes in 
technology, led to the much simpler pricing plans that prevail today.'' 
\19\ General-purpose prepaid cards have followed a similar evolutionary 
trajectory from more complex a la carte pricing and per transaction 
fees to greater pricing simplicity and convenience in response to 
consumer demand and without regulatory prompt.\20\

Branded Prepaid Cards, 65 Fla. L. Rev. 1477 (2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    More fundamental, determining whether regulatory intervention might 
be justified requires making a threshold determination as to whether 
there is a market failure in any given context and whether there is 
some feasible government response that can improve the situation once 
all intended and unintended consequences are considered. Attaching the 
conclusory, pejorative term ``junk fees'' to these various different 
fees not only obscures the analytical differences between these 
different types of fees but if implemented recklessly will actually 
harm consumers and the economy. In particular, where these fees do 
serve the purpose of aligning consumer costs with pricing (such as use, 
higher costs, or risk-based pricing), interfering with their efficient 
operation will force those costs to be subsidized by other consumers. 
Imposing price controls on credit card late fees or other terms and 
conditions, for example, likely will lead to higher interest rates and 
reduced credit access for most consumers (as well as an increase in the 
number of late payments), but particularly lower-income and higher risk 
consumers who pay their bills on time. It is hard to see how this 
predictable result is beneficial to consumers overall.
Conclusion
    As Beales and I concluded in our recent article:

        The notion of junk fees is a fine piece of rhetoric, but 
        useless as an analytical tool. Both the structure of pricing, 
        and the level of prices, should be determined by competition in 
        the marketplace. As we observe, the result is detailed fee 
        structures for some products and services, and bundled pricing 
        for others. But marketplace competition over pricing structures 
        is far more likely to satisfy consumer preferences than an 
        inevitably overbroad set of regulatory requirements.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ Beales and Zywicki, Junkyard Dogs, supra.

    As the examples given above indicate, consumer pricing is often a 
complex, dynamic process that undoubtedly can sometimes suggest a need 
for regulation. But even then, it is necessary to accurately identify 
the nature of the market failure and the efficacy of the proposed 
response.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ For example, Beales and I note that the FTC's example of fees 
for automotive add-ons for arguably worthless products such as 
nitrogen-filled tires provides an example. But in that example the 
problem is in the claim that filling one's tires with nitrogen does 
something useful for consumers rather than the fact that the additional 
fee is charged separately rather than it being included in a higher up-
front cost for all consumers. See Beales and Zywicki, Junkyard Dogs, 
supra.

    Thank you for your time and the opportunity to appear before you 
today and I am happy to take any questions you may have.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you, Mr. Zywicki. Now we 
go to Sally Greenberg, is with us, as the CEO of National 
Consumers League.

STATEMENT OF SALLY GREENBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL 
                        CONSUMERS LEAGUE

    Ms. Greenberg. Good morning, Chairman Hickenlooper, and 
Ranking Member Blackburn, and members of the Subcommittee. My 
name is Sally Greenberg, and I am the CEO of the National 
Consumers League.
    We were founded in 1899. We are America's pioneering 
consumer and worker advocacy organization, and my organization 
has worked for many years to try to raise awareness about the 
impact of hidden fees and junk fees and promote transparency in 
the marketplace. American companies are, in a word, addicted to 
junk fees.
    Junk fees come in many forms, encompassing a wide range of 
unfair or deceptive charges. They are, by definition, often 
unnecessary, unavoidable, or surprising charges that inflate 
costs, while adding little or no value to a product or service.
    They include fees that a reasonable consumer assumes are 
included in the overall advertised price. Mandatory hotel 
resort fees that Professor Zywicki just mentioned, are one such 
fee that comes to mind. Americans, be they Republican or 
Democrat, hate junk fees.
    A 2019 survey by Consumer Reports found that at least 85 
percent of Americans have encountered an unexpected or hidden 
fee for a service they used in the past 2 years. And a recent 
Morning Council poll found that 80 percent of Democrats, 71 
percent of Independents, and 73 percent of Republicans support 
Congressional action to rein in abuse of junk fees in 
industries like live ticketing and cellphone, cable TV, and 
Internet services.
    So, if consumers hate junk fees so much, why do companies, 
large and small, increasingly impose them? The answer is 
unsurprisingly, because they are a substantial profit center. 
The marketplace is inundated with junk fees, from hotels to car 
rentals, to utilities to apartments, to investments to auto and 
home lending. The list of industries that impose junk fees is 
virtually endless.
    The Wall Street Journal recently found one hotel in Las 
Vegas that even charged a $3.50 cent fee for so-called craft 
ice. That said, a few industries stand out as serial abusers. 
Let's start with banks. Late payment fees charged by banks and 
credit cards cost American families an estimated $12 billion 
annually.
    These fees, which can be as much as $41 for each late fee 
payment, far exceed the cost to the issuer for processing and 
do little to deter future delinquent payments. Airlines are 
also poster children for junk fees.
    Globally, revenue from junk fees, ancillary fees in airline 
speak, brought in $102.8 billion in 2022. To put this in 
perspective, junk fees last year made up 15 percent of global 
airline revenues, compared to 6 percent only 10 years ago. And 
anyone who buys tickets to a concert or sporting event is well 
acquainted with the myriad fees that are added at the end of 
the ticket buying process.
    We had the example that you showed Senator Hickenlooper. 
Primary and secondary market ticketing companies charge service 
fees, order processing fees, delivery fees, and other charges 
that increase ticket prices on average 27 percent for the 
primary market and 31 percent for the secondary market.
    Junk fees cause significant economic harm, and in 
particular they cause harm to those of modest means. Renters, 
for example, tend to have lower incomes than those who own 
their homes. These consumers are also some of the most preyed 
upon by abusive junk fees. A 2022 survey conducted by consumer 
and housing advocates found that 89 percent of landlords impose 
rental application fees.
    Nearly as many renters paid excessive late fees. And they 
also get hit with utility, administrative, convenience, 
insurance, and notice fees. Competition has not and will not 
make junk fees go away. This is because junk fees themselves 
are anti-competitive. They make comparing prices more 
difficult, distorting well-functioning marketplaces.
    Honest entrepreneurs who invest in their businesses 
innovate and strive to create better value for their customers, 
lose business. Action to address the consumer and competitive 
harm created by junk fees is urgently needed.
    First, we would urge you to support S. 916 it is the Junk 
Fee Prevention Act, which would require some of the worst 
abusers of junk fees to display the full price of services 
upfront, and it would bar excessive fees and ensure 
transparency. Second, we ask that Congress restore the FTC's 
ability to obtain strong financial penalties from wrongdoers.
    The Supreme Court in 2021 overturned the AMG Capital 
Management v. FTC, wiping out a critical enforcement tool for 
the Commission S. 4145, which is the Consumer Protection 
Remedies Act, would restore that ability to impose monetary 
relief to the Commission.
    And finally, Congress must not allow businesses to trap 
consumers with unfair and deceptive fees to escape 
accountability through fine print in their contracts. To that 
end, we are proud to support S. 1376, the Forced Arbitration 
Injustice Repeal Act, which would prohibit pre-dispute 
arbitration agreements from being enforceable if they require 
arbitration in employment, consumer antitrust, or civil rights 
disputes.
    Chairman Hickenlooper and Ranking Member Blackburn, Senator 
Cantwell, Senator Lujan. Senator, Senator Welch, thank you so 
much for inviting the National Consumers League and the 
consumer perspective into this discussion. We appreciate your 
holding the hearing, and we look forward to answering your 
questions.

    Prepared Statement of Sally Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer, 
                       National Consumers League
Executive Summary
    American companies are addicted to junk fees. These unfair and 
deceptive charges add little or no value for consumers who reasonably 
assume that such costs will already be included within the advertised 
price of a good or service. Junk fees cause significant economic harm, 
in particular, to historically marginalized and economically vulnerable 
populations. Additionally, the proliferation of junk fees harms honest 
businesses and precludes the ability of market competition to correct 
anticompetitive behavior.
    At least 85 percent of Americans have encountered an unexpected or 
hidden fee in the past two years. Two-thirds of consumers say they were 
paying more in surprise charges than they did in the previous five 
years ago. Unsurprisingly, nearly all the respondents--96 percent--were 
angry and frustrated about these surprise charges.
    To address the harms of junk fees on the American economy, the 
National Consumers League urges Congress to act. Specifically, Congress 
should pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act, restore the Federal Trade 
Commission's ability to seek monetary relief under its Section 13(b) 
authority, and protect consumers' ability to hold abusive companies 
accountable by passing the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act 
(FAIR Act).
Introduction
    The National Consumers League appreciates the opportunity to 
provide the subcommittee with our views on how junk fees harm consumers 
and competition and how the Senate can take action to rein in this 
abusive and widespread practice.
    Founded in 1899, the National Consumers League (``NCL'') is 
America's pioneering consumer and worker advocacy organization. Our 
non-profit mission is to advocate on behalf of consumers and workers in 
the United States and abroad.\1\ NCL has long partnered with consumers, 
industry, and policymakers to raise awareness about the impact of 
hidden fees and promote policies that allow consumers to know the total 
price of products and services at the beginning of a buying decision. 
For example, NCL recently worked with pro-consumer legislators in New 
York State to enact first-in-the-nation legislation to ban hidden fees 
and require all-in pricing of tickets for concerts, sports events, and 
theater performances.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Junk Fees are a Growing Threat to Consumers' Pocketbooks
    American companies are addicted to junk fees, and it is no wonder. 
Just like mosquitoes that plague our summer barbecues, junk fees are 
often small and seemingly harmless charges, but they can and do 
irritate and harm consumers. Mosquitoes are known for their ability to 
extract blood and cause discomfort, but they can also be lethal. 
Similarly, junk fees may appear as minor expenses, but they can 
accumulate and have a devastating and negative effect on consumers' 
financial well-being.
    Junk fees are often difficult to detect and swat away due to their 
small size and stealthy nature. They can be hidden within complex 
pricing structures, buried in the fine print of contracts, and are 
often presented as mandatory charges. Consumers may not notice them 
until they receive their bills or experience unexpected deductions from 
their accounts.
    The term ``junk fee'' as defined by the Federal Trade Commission 
(``FTC'') encompasses a wide range of unfair or deceptive fees that add 
little or no value to the consumers. They include fees that a 
reasonable consumer would assume to be included in the overall 
advertised price for a good or service, such as mandatory hotel resort 
fees. The term also includes ``hidden fees,'' which are fees that are 
only disclosed at a later stage in a consumer's purchasing process, if 
at all.\3\ Service fees added on to concert tickets as the consumer 
gets close to buying the ticket are an example of hidden fees.

    Americans hate junk fees. A 2019 report by Consumer Reports found 
that at least 85 percent of Americans have encountered an unexpected or 
hidden fee for a service they had used in the past two year. Two-thirds 
of respondents said they were paying more in surprise charges than they 
did in the previous five years ago. Unsurprisingly, nearly all the 
respondents--96 percent--were angry and frustrated about these surprise 
charges.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So, if consumers hate junk fees so much, why do companies large and 
small increasingly use them? The answer, unsurprisingly, is because 
they are a substantial profit center for the companies that charge 
them.
    Banks are serial abusers of junk fees. Late payment fees on credit 
cards cost American families an estimated $12 billion annually. These 
fees, which can be as much as $41 for each late payment, far exceed the 
cost to the card issuer for processing and may do little to deter 
future delinquent payments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(``CFPB'') estimates that the income generated by the largest credit 
card issuers from late fees is approximately five times greater than 
the collection costs that the companies incur for past due payment 
violations.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Airlines are the poster children for junk fee abuse. Just eight 
U.S. air carriers (Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Frontier, 
JetBlue, Spirit, and United) generated an estimated $4.2 billion in 
seat reservation fees on the domestic networks in 2022.\6\ In 2022, 
baggage fees netted airlines a record $6.8 billion in revenue, double 
the $3.4 billion the airlines collected just 10 years ago.\7\ And while 
many airlines did away with change fees during the pandemic, they 
continued to net a $1 billion annually for the industry last year.\8\

    Globally, revenue from junk fees (``ancillary fees'' in airline-
speak) brought in $102.8 billion in 2022. To put this in perspective, 
junk fees last year made up 15.0 percent of global airline revenues in 
2022, compared to 6.0 percent ten years ago.\9\ It is clear the 
airlines' addiction to junk fees is getting worse, not better, from 
consumers' point of view.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And these are just some of the more egregious cases. Junk fees have 
infiltrated nearly every facet of the economy. From hotels to car 
rentals, to utilities, to event tickets, to investments, to auto and 
home lending, the list of industries that have embraced junk fees is 
virtually endless. One hotel in Las Vegas is even charging a $3.50 
``craft ice'' fee! \10\ These fees are a flimsy excuse to extract more 
money out of consumers. This is not an issue the market can correct for 
itself. Unless Congress and Federal consumer protection agencies rein 
in these abusive fees, consumers will continue to be fleeced by 
predatory junk fees. The reason is simple: There is just too much money 
to be made off them.

II. Historically Marginalized and Vulnerable Populations are 
        Particularly Susceptible to Harms from Junk Fees
    Hidden fees and surcharges have contributed to economic harm born 
by the American middle class and the alarming rise in income 
inequality.\11\ Credit card late fees disproportionately burden 
consumers in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods. Cardholders 
in census tracts where a majority identified themselves as Black in 
2010 paid more than $25 in total late fees for each account they held 
with major issuers in 2019.\12\ Research by the Financial Health 
Network found that overdraft fees are incurred by low-to moderate-
income households at nearly twice the rate of high-income households. 
The same survey also found that Black and Latinx household were charged 
overdraft fees at rates of 1.9 and 1.4 times, respectively, of white 
households.\13\

    Auto-lending is another area where junk fees disproportionately 
harm communities of color. Car dealers push pricey add-on products such 
as service contracts, guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance, and 
window etching to increase their profit margins. Latino consumers are 
charged higher mark-ups for these add-ons than non-Latino 
consumers.\14\

    Renter-occupied households historically have lower household 
incomes than owner-occupied households and may be more affected by 
changes in household income and rental prices.\15\ Unfortunately, these 
consumers are also some of the most preyed upon by abusive junk fees. A 
2022 survey conducted by the National Consumer Law Center and the 
National Housing Law Project found that (89 percent) of respondents 
reported that landlords impose rental application fees. Nearly as many 
(87 percent) stated that landlords charge excessive late fees. Well 
over half of respondents observed utility-related fees (73 percent), 
processing or administrative fees (68 percent), convenience fees (60 
percent), insurance fees (59 percent), and notice fees (56 
percent).\16\

    Junk fees can also disproportionately harm consumers with 
disabilities. The Department of Justice brought an action against 
rideshare app Uber related to wait-time fees imposed on riders. Uber's 
policy of imposing a wait-time fee if the driver waited for longer than 
two minutes for the passenger to get to the vehicle had a 
disproportionate impact on consumers with disabilities. Uber agreed to 
credit the accounts of the eligible riders for double the amount of 
wait-time fees they were charged, which could total potentially 
hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in compensation.\17\

    Junk fees weigh heavily on the pocketbooks of the most vulnerable 
members of our society. For example, incarcerated individuals and their 
families are charged, on average, 20 percent of the principal in fees 
for money transfer services, with some states charging fees of as much 
as 37 percent. Compare this to services like Venmo, CashApp, PayPal, 
and Zelle, which often provide free automated clearing house (``ACH'') 
transfers from bank accounts and transfers from a credit or debit card 
either for free or for a typical fee of 3 percent or less.\18\

III. Junk Fees Harm Competition and Honest Businesses
    The proliferation of predatory junk fees in the economy will not be 
solved by competition because junk fees themselves make competition 
less effective. By preventing consumers from making direct price 
comparison easily, junk fees distort well-functioning marketplaces. 
Honest entrepreneurs who invest in their businesses, innovate, and 
strive to create better value for their customers thus become another 
casualty of the race to embrace junk fees.
    To put this in perspective, many hotels currently charge mandatory 
hotel resort fees that are not disclosed in the room rate. In these 
situations, a hotel room that advertises a $100 per night room rate, 
but tacks on a mandatory $25 ``resort fee'' at the end of the 
transaction will appear cheaper to the consumer than a similar room 
priced at $110 per night. A rational consumer would likely choose the 
``cheaper'' $100 per night room, taking the sale from the hotel that is 
actually cheaper.
    While the Federal Trade Commission has repeatedly warned hotels 
that such fees are likely unfair,\21\ they continue to proliferate. For 
example, the Embassy Suites Georgetown, the Grand Hyatt Washington, and 
the JW Marriott Washington respectively charge mandatory ``destination 
fees'' of $28.74,\22\ $23.19,\23\ and $25 per night.\24\ Many state 
attorneys general have sued and reached settlements with hotel chains 
over their junk fee usage.\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The harm to competition from junk fees happens countless times 
every day as consumers' patronage is unfairly directed away from 
businesses with the best price, quality, convenience, and honest 
practices to the businesses with pricing that is higher, less 
transparent, and more deceptive. The benefits to buyers, sellers, 
consumers, and workers only flow if all the participants are playing by 
a fair set of rules. The proliferation of junk fees, by contrast, 
rewards businesses that engage in ``exploitative innovation;'' finding 
clever ways to add unlisted fees, ``optional'' services, and other add-
on costs to the final price of what they are selling. Such practices 
put the onus on consumers to dispute the unnecessary charges with the 
seller, if they even know how to do so.
IV. Action to Rein in Junk Fees is Overdue
    Junk fees are an unfair and deceptive practice that harms millions 
of consumers and businesses. They have been allowed to inundate the 
marketplace because of lax regulations that too often allow the short-
term interests of Wall Street investors to trump the imperatives for a 
fair marketplace.
    The Biden Administration and agencies like the CFPB, Department of 
Transportation (``DOT'') and FTC have begun to take steps to address 
the scourge of junk fees.\26\ Congress can and should do more to 
support these initiatives.

States.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First, we urge you to support common-sense legislation to rein in 
the worst offenders when it comes to junk fees. NCL, along with our 
colleagues at Consumer Federation of America and Consumer Reports have 
endorsed the Junk Fee Prevention Act, introduced earlier this year by 
Senators Blumenthal and Whitehouse and Congressman Gallego in the 
House.\27\

    The bill would require the live event ticketing industry, airlines, 
and cell phone providers to display the full price of services upfront, 
bar excessive fees and ensure transparency. It would empower the FTC, 
Federal Communication Commission, and DOT to issue new rules and 
enforce violations.
    Congress should also follow the lead of states that have acted to 
address the proliferation of junk fees. New York recently enacted pro-
consumer legislation to require all-in pricing of live event 
tickets.\28\ In California, the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, reported 
out of committee in April, and would make it an unlawful business 
practice to advertise, display, or offer a price for a good or service 
that does not include all mandatory fees or charges other than taxes or 
fees imposed by a government.\29\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, Congress should restore the FTC's ability to obtain real 
penalties from wrongdoers. The FTC has historically prioritized 
consumer redress, mainly through its Section 13(b) authority. The 
Supreme Court's decision in AMG Capital Management v. FTC wiped out 
this critical enforcement tool, leaving dozens of pending cases with 
billions of dollars in potential consumer refunds at stake.\30\ 
Ironically, the AMG case revolved around junk fees--in the form of 
inflated finance fees--charged to borrowers by a payday lender. 
Restoring the Commission`s 13(b) authority would allow it to continue 
its successful record of securing billions of dollars in consumer 
relief. A substantial number of FTC cases have resulted in rewards for 
consumers who were the victims of deceptive and fraudulent junk 
fees.\31\ The Consumer Protection Remedies Act, introduced last session 
by Senators Cantwell, Klobuchar, Lujan, and Warnock, would fully 
restore the FTC's ability to obtain monetary and other relief for 
consumers under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act by going directly to 
Federal court.\32\ The bill passed out of committee last session. We 
would urge your support for this critical legislation.

    Finally, Congress must not allow businesses that trap consumers 
with unfair and deceptive junk fees to escape accountability in the 
courts through fine print contracts. To that end, NCL is proud to 
support Senator Blumenthal's Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act 
(FAIR Act). The bill, which currently has 39 co-sponsors in the Senate 
and 91 for the House companion, would prohibit a pre-dispute 
arbitration agreement from being valid or enforceable if it requires 
arbitration of an employment, consumer, antitrust, or civil rights 
dispute.\33\

V. Conclusion
    On behalf of the National Consumers League and consumers 
nationwide, I appreciate your continuing work to protect consumers from 
abusive junk fees and for holding this hearing. We welcome the 
opportunity to answer any questions.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Ms. Greenberg. I 
appreciate your being here as well. I am going to turn over for 
the first set of questions to Senator Cantwell, who is the 
Chair of the Commerce Committee. She has got a busier day than 
I do.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Hickenlooper, I want 
to thank you and Ranking Member Blackburn for convening this 
important hearing. Like many of you, I am frustrated by what is 
happening in the marketplace.
    In my home state of Washington, exorbitant hidden fees 
recently made news when the price of a home ticket to watch the 
Seattle Kraken play the Dallas Stars in game three of the NHL 
playoffs costs more than it would to just fly to Dallas. At the 
time, KIRO 7 reported that the cheapest resale ticket available 
was $294, or at least that is the price the platform would have 
you think.
    After a $61 ticket processing fee and a $3 order processing 
fee, the real price of the ticket before tax was $358, an extra 
22 percent on top of the advertised price. We have all 
encountered these junk fees in one form or another, and these 
are mandatory fees that are not included in the advertising 
price, providing no recognizable value to the consumers.
    And we were hearing obviously from our witnesses about this 
today. The bottom line is we can't make comparison shopping 
harder. We can't reduce competition, and we don't want to see 
things that distort the market.
    That is why Senator Cruz, and I introduced the TICKET Act, 
which has been addressed here by some of our witnesses. The 
price they say, really should be the price you pay, and that 
can be added to, but it needs to be disclosed.
    So, I wanted to, if I could--I think I know the answer 
listening to some of the testimony here. But Professor Zywicki, 
I didn't hear all of your testimony. Do you agree that the 
principle of all mandatory fees for goods and services should 
be disclosed in an upfront price?
    Mr. Zywicki. As I said--first, I succeeded Senator Cruz as 
the Director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal 
Trade Commission, so it is likely we agree on a lot. And this 
is one of which I think we agree, which is, as I said, I can't 
see any reason why that wouldn't be disclosed up front. And so, 
in general, I think that is the right approach and would 
generally agree with that.
    The Chair. So why--Ms. Greenberg, you were--I heard your 
answer, yes. You can reiterate it if you want. But why do you 
think this is so important, not just with ticket sellers, but 
the true price overall and including mandatory fees?
    Why do you think this is so important? What complexity does 
that bring to the market when you have this level of 
distortion?
    Ms. Greenberg. Well, first off, consumers can't comparison 
shop because they don't know what the end all--all-in price is 
going to be. So, it distorts the market from that perspective. 
But as Professor Morwitz described, it is a rabbit hole for 
consumers. They go, and they click, and they click, and they 
click on various price options, and they end up spending more 
money than they would if there were an all-in price.
    So there is some psychology involved, I think, in the 
businesses that impose these prices. But consumers are angry 
about it, and they feel like they get trapped into paying for 
goods and services with these add on fees that they had not 
expected.
    But they end up doing it because it is easier for them to 
just pay rather than balk it or look around for competition.
    The Chair. Thank you. Mister--Professor Zywicki, Ms. 
Greenberg mentioned the Supreme Court case that struck down 
part of the FTC's authority. We had FTC members here, both 
Democrat and Republican nominees. They all said we needed to 
replace that. Do you think we need to replace that to give 
consumers a fair deal?
    Mr. Zywicki. I would have to--I am not prepared to give an 
opinion on that today, thanks.
    The Chair. OK. We can give you a question for the record 
and you can give us an answer in writing.
    Mr. Zywicki. Sure. I will think more about that.
    The Chair. Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Madam Chair. Now, in full 
faith to alternating between Republicans and Democrats, I will 
yield my primary position of asking questions to Senator 
Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor 
Zywicki, I want to come to you. And thank you, all three of 
you, each of you for your testimony. As I said in my opening, I 
am not hearing from Tennesseans about junk fees. They are just 
not talking about it. They are talking about real economic 
harm.
    And I think for some, it has been kind of perplexing that 
we would focus on this issue. I even had one Tennesseans and 
say, well, what exactly is a junk fee, and what are the 
economic harms that come to people for fees for discretionary 
services?
    So why don't you take that question and just say, what is 
the economic harm that comes? And why would this term of junk 
fee be applied to fees with--that are for discretionary 
services?
    Mr. Zywicki. Thanks. I appreciate the question. Junk fees 
is obviously a term of rhetoric. There is no--it is a 
meaningless term. It is just a matter of rhetoric. And we have 
concepts like Professor Morwitz said of drip pricing, multi-
part pricing, partition pricing. Those are actually real 
concepts, right. Junk fees is just a conclusory label.
    Senator Blackburn. I think that is why it is perplexing to 
Tennesseans and to so many people why we would make this a 
primary point of contention rather than looking at DOT and some 
of the issues that exist with the airlines or looking at other 
forms of services. If people pay their credit card late, they 
expect to pay a late fee.
    Mr. Zywicki. And that is the important point, is this 
vaguely defined concept of junk fees sweeps a lot of things 
into it, things that can be oppressive to consumers like 
mandatory resort fees. But what it seems to reach is a lot more 
other things now, the way this is done.
    For example, as you mentioned, the credit card late fees. I 
can't see any reason why people who pay their credit cards on 
time should have to subsidize people who pay their credit cards 
late. The evidence is clear on this from the Grodzicki study 
that if you reduce late fees, more people pay late.
    The Mesud study makes clear that if you reduce late fees, 
everybody ends up paying higher interest rates. And lower 
income and higher risk borrowers get less access to credit. So, 
most of what we see in the market is efficient. It prevents 
cross consumer subsidies, and a lot of these things that are 
labeled as junk fees are actually just efficient multi-part 
pricing.
    Senator Blackburn. In Tennessee, we are a fast growing 
state. This weekend is CMA Fest in Nashville. We are going to 
have a lot of people that are visiting there. The Great Smoky 
Mountains are the most visited National Park in our national 
park system. So, when you look at people choosing these 
destinations, and then you look at a mandatory regulation on 
hotel fees, and some of the resort fees. So, talk a little bit 
about the risk of Government intervention of mandating certain 
fees for some of these services and the impact that it will 
have on tourism?
    Mr. Zywicki. Yes, that is an important point, which is you 
are going to--I am always cautious about mandating things, and 
certainly cautious about mandating new disclosures because 
people already have too many disclosures, right.
    What we do know about resort fees and the like, it is only 
about 6 to 7 percent of hotels that actually assess resort 
fees. They are overwhelmingly in places like Las Vegas or 
Orlando. And they fit this particular, the thing that I am 
talking about, which is that they are generally not repeat 
purchasers. And so, consumers don't learn from it and that sort 
of thing.
    And so, they can raise the cost of price comparison. To the 
extent though that they are mandatory, that everybody has to 
pay them, then it seems to me that they are largely part of the 
price. I think one thing we could also think about is 
incentives to provide discounts rather than surcharging.
    And I will go back to the example, which is merchants want 
to surcharge credit cards now because it is clear they want to 
extract wealth from consumers, and give them a low upfront 
price, and then slap them with a credit card on the back end. 
They charge credit card surcharges in the same context in which 
hotels charge resort fees.
    A cash discount is a totally different story, which is if 
you charge a higher price and then give somebody a cash 
discount, if they don't use the service or if they don't use a 
credit card or something like that, that then allows them 
comparison pricing, but then also allows consumers to opt-out.
    You have to make that obviously easy enough for them to do 
it. So mandating certain things that can be done in different 
ways as well.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. So, in other words, you would say 
provide more choice and options, rather than mandating 
everything be rolled into one price?
    Mr. Zywicki. Yes. And I think that these prices tend to 
evolve over time. So, for example, cellphones used to have a 
lot of disparate pricing. And now just because consumers 
demanded it, it has become all when pricing.
    Prepaid cards had the same effect. And so, they tend to 
vary over time. But there is nothing inconsistent with having 
United and Southwest both offering different services and 
different packages. And the empirical evidence indicates 
Southwest charges a little bit more per ticket than United 
because they have decided to forego these fees.
    I love Southwest. I always fly Southwest, right. But people 
pay a little bit more for a ticket on Southwest than they do in 
the United when you unbundle it. And so, allowing that option 
is generally, I think, is efficient.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you. Just following that, 
Professor Zywicki, so that when you were talking about what 
appears almost like a surcharge, if someone has to pay more 
when they use their credit card, isn't what we are really 
talking about here transparency? In other words, as long as the 
consumer knows up ahead of time whether they are going to a 
hotel in Las Vegas or a hotel in Denver, they should have some 
sense if there are going to be added costs. Is that fair to 
say?
    Mr. Zywicki. Yes. If there is going to be--yes, if there 
will be added costs.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I mean, transparency, I think is the 
one connecting thing. I look at it--I think junk fees sometimes 
is the wrong term because it does sound pejorative. Maybe 
surprise fees are another way of looking at it, but either way, 
I think most people find it very objectionable.
    Mr. Zywicki. That is right. And, you know, the logic here 
is we want to try to bundle up--we want to have all in pricing, 
right, rather than here is the price, and now here is the 
additional price if you use a credit card, right.
    And so, to be coherent about this, I think we want to think 
about sort of when we want to have all-in pricing and when 
unbundling is appropriate. Transparency is just a means to an 
end, I think, of consumers finding the right mix of goods, 
services, and prices that they are looking for.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. And let me ask each of you a 
question. Just kind of get it on the record that, you know, 
some services are offered to consumers as an option, additional 
costs, an optional additional cost.
    But obviously certain fees are generally of an 
administrative sort, are mandatory for consumers in order to 
purchase a product or service. So, if you can just a simple yes 
or no, should all mandatory fees be included in the initial 
advertised price? Start----
    Ms. Greenberg. Yes, certainly.
    Mr. Zywicki. I think generally, yes.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Professor Morwitz.
    Ms. Morwitz. I agree. Yes.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. Yes, because I think that is, 
again, part of this--the central question here is what--how 
transparent is the transaction from the beginning? Professor 
Morwitz, small businesses are the backbone of our country and 
the backbone of our economy.
    They drive that--they prioritize serving their customers 
and drive economic growth in rural and urban areas alike. If 
every company displayed all in, upfront pricing to consumers, 
small and large businesses would have a more level playing 
field on which to compete. I look at this again as the cost of 
hidden prices.
    It is not only that they mislead consumers, but they also 
put small businesses at a disadvantage against larger 
competitors. So, Dr. Morwitz, would you describe how hidden 
junk fees hurt small businesses when you are in the process of 
competing for customers?
    Ms. Morwitz. Yes, I would be happy to. When a larger firm, 
or really any firm, uses hidden fees or surcharges, it doesn't 
only hurt consumers, but it hurts well-intentioned, honest 
competitors like many of our country's small businesses that 
you are talking about.
    So when a larger firm makes salient a lower base price and 
only puts in small print or only reveals at the end of the 
shopping process that there are additional mandatory fees, 
their product offerings may appear, at least at first, to be 
cheaper than those of, say, a small business, an honest 
competitor who uses all-inclusive prices, whose prices at least 
at first then will appear more expensive, even if they are 
actually cheaper in total when the hidden fees of the large 
firm are added in.
    Now, research shows this is going to lead consumers to be 
more likely to even first consider the products and services of 
the larger firms who use this hidden surcharge because their 
products seem cheaper. In other words, their supposedly low 
prices draw consumers in. But then having first considered 
their products, consumers will also be more likely to stick 
with that firm and ultimately purchase their products even when 
they are more expensive in total with the fees.
    So, these hidden fees, they don't only hurt consumers by 
leading them to make purchases that are against their own self-
interest, but it also hurts honest competitors who are using 
transparent pricing practices. They also make it difficult for 
a firm maybe who is currently using hidden fees, but realizes 
it is wrong and wants to stop, to move away from doing so.
    Because if they move to all-inclusive pricing but their 
competitors don't, they will lose market share. So, all of this 
ultimately hurts honest, small businesses who compete for 
customers against a larger firm that has kind of perfected and 
capitalized on the use of hidden fees.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you very much. And Ms. 
Greenberg, certain sectors, as we have heard, such as aviation, 
already display upfront pricing, excludes additional fees like 
baggage fees, but people are aware of that, and they are 
informed of that prior to purchase or in the process of 
purchase.
    In other sectors, companies have started displaying all-in 
upfront pricing and consumers, but companies have adopted this 
unevenly, let's say. We are, I think, all agree that customers 
benefit from transparent upfront pricing.
    How could Federal legislation encourage upfront pricing to 
consumers evenly and fairly across all sectors?
    Ms. Greenberg. Well, first of all, we are talking about 
posting mandatory fees all in pricing on the final cost of the 
service or product. Second, there are legislative fixes that--
the junk fees bill that was introduced would be--would go a 
long way toward addressing the excessive imposition of junk 
fees on consumers.
    Third, consumers would benefit from the Congress acting on 
the recent decision by the Supreme Court to overturn the FTC's 
ability to impose monetary penalties for unfair and deceptive 
practices.
    So those are three steps that you could take. There are 
other pieces of legislation that we support that are before 
this committee. We think it would go a long way to righting the 
wrongs against consumers.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you. I want to turn now 
to Senator Klobuchar, our ace eagle on transparency.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. [Technical problems]--and especially 
that description, Senator Hickenlooper. As you are all aware, 
we held a major hearing in the Judiciary committee, and I am 
also pleased that the Commerce Committee is obviously, has 
jurisdiction as well and involved in this. We have seen, as has 
been pointed out, increased costs on everything from cell phone 
bills to airplane and concert tickets.
    And one area of this high excess of fees is ticketing. We 
had the hearing earlier this year with the President of Live 
Nation, Ticketmaster, and other witnesses. And as you are 
aware, the facts are quite startling. It is being reviewed by 
the Justice Department, including 90 percent monopoly on 
ticketing for major NFL, NHL events.
    Eighty percent for major arena events, and 70 percent 
monopoly when it comes to all ticketing. In addition to that, 
Ticketmaster now owns a number of venues and also locks in the 
number of other venues that they don't own with their services 
for in excess of 7 years, which is the subject of a bill that 
Senator Blumenthal and I have introduced because of this 
locking in, that makes for even less competition.
    And then finally, Live Nation promotes the act. So, it is 
like a three-cornered monopoly. So, the Justice Department is 
investigating, and then we go from there when it comes to other 
consumer bills that are being considered. In 2018, the GAO 
found that on average, concert ticket fees cost 27 percent of 
the tickets face value. But there have also been reports 
recently of fees totaling 75 percent of the face value of 
tickets.
    Ms. Morwitz, in your testimony, you discuss how drip 
pricing is commonly used in the ticketing industry for live 
events and concerts. Could you talk about that and how that 
misrepresents the true cost of buying a ticket?
    Ms. Morwitz. Yes. Thank you for the question. So, when fees 
are presented at the end of the shopping process, it makes the 
initial price look cheaper. So, the customer starts, they see a 
seat for--they see the price for a particular seat they would 
like for the event, the play, the baseball game, and it appears 
cheaper than it really is.
    As they click through the pages, they learn that there is a 
series of fees that they have to pay, and at the end the price 
is much more expensive, as you mentioned. 20 percent, 50 
percent, maybe 75 percent.
    They see the total, and in theory, they could back out at 
that point. But it becomes very difficult for consumers to do 
so. The tendency is to stick with the price, even though it is 
more expensive than they thought it was initially. And there is 
a variety of reasons why that happens. Often they overestimate 
how much time it would take to start over.
    They underestimate how much money they could save by 
starting over. They have to notice the fees in the first place. 
They might not even notice the fees. And also, we don't like to 
feel bad as consumers, so we might sort of have a self-
motivated component where we want to feel like we made a good 
decision.
    So, for all these reasons, consumers tend not to start over 
again. Also, the ticketing--the firms, they also put pressure 
on the consumer to complete the deal. So, there might be a 
countdown clock, and if we are under time pressure, we feel 
like we need to make the decision quickly.
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. Good point.
    Ms. Morwitz. There might be messages of scarcity, that 
there are two tickets left at that price and we feel like if I 
restart, I might lose these two seats.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you. Very good. Ms. Greenberg, 
could you talk about how increased transparency of showing fans 
the full ticket price upfront could help create a more 
functional market? I know Mr. Zywicki agrees that it is 
important to show the fees upfront. Could you talk about that?
    Ms. Greenberg. Yes, it is important. And we saw this coming 
when the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster happened on the 
Justice Department----
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes, you did.
    Ms. Greenberg. We were, this is going to create an 
impossible monopolistic situation and it is exactly what has 
happened for consumers. All-in pricing is so important because 
when you look for a ticket online, you can't tell until you get 
to the very end of the transaction how much that ticket is 
going to cost you.
    And different, you know, different secondary markets, 
primary markets have different charges. You can't compare and 
contrast. And as Professor Morwitz said, you know, most 
consumers are going to go, well, I spent 20 minutes getting 
this ticket, I am just going to finish up, what is $5, what is 
$10.
    So, all-in pricing is critical so that you can compare and 
contrast. I also want to mention that this is not just about 
middle class--junk fees, not just about middle class consumers, 
poor people, people of very modest means, are facing punishing 
fees in so many areas. Renters, for example, have six, seven 
different fees that are imposed on the--they have to pay a fee 
to even get a rental application in.
    They can least afford it. And I know Senator Blackburn was 
saying, consumers are concerned about this, they are concerned 
about basic goods and services. Well, that affects people of 
low income harder than any of the rest of us.
    So, I think it is important that we recognize that we are 
talking about middle class consumers, consumers of more modest 
means. These fees are hitting all of us across the board, and 
they are out of control right now.
    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you. And I will ask on 
the record some of the App Store issues of you, Ms. Morwitz, 
because I am out of time. Another legislation, piece of 
legislation that Senator Blackburn and Blumenthal and I have.
    And there is a lot of work to be done, and I am very glad 
this is a priority of this committee. And I thank Senator 
Hickenlooper for his leadership. Thank you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Now 
turn to Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our Denver 
Nugget----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hickenlooper. The glorious night it was last night.
    Senator Markey. The game last night. Airline fees are out 
of control and some of them are simply unconscionable. It is 
absolutely infuriating that many airlines force consumers to 
pay extra just to sit with their young children.
    We have got to put a stop to this outrageous practice. I 
was thrilled to hear President Biden call on Congress to ban 
family seating fees during his State of the Union address 
because I have been calling for that policy for years.
    Ms. Greenberg, do you agree that airlines should never 
force parents to pay to sit with their children?
    Ms. Greenberg. Absolutely. We are fully supportive of the 
Fair Fees Act, which covers that practice. And no, of course, 
families shouldn't be required to be separated from their loved 
ones or pay extra fees.
    But your bill does address many of the problems with 
transparency in the airline industry, and we are very 
supportive of that legislation.
    Senator Markey. Thank you so much. And I obviously agree 
with that. That is why yesterday Senator Vance, and I sent a 
letter to Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz with proposed 
language to be included in the FAA reauthorization bill to ban 
family seating fees.
    A parent's right to sit next to their child is not a 
partisan issue. And would you support that language, Ms. 
Greenberg, being included in the FAA legislation?
    Ms. Greenberg. Yes, certainly we would.
    Senator Markey. Thank you. Family seating fees may be the 
poster child for outrageous junk fees, but the airlines, nickel 
and dime consumers in so many other ways, baggage fees, 
boarding fees, seat selection fees, the list goes on and on. If 
it used to be a basic service on an airline, it probably costs 
money today. Ms. Greenberg, should Congress protect consumers 
from these never ending fees?
    Ms. Greenberg. We think Congress has an important role to 
play. Competition has not worked to diminish the fees. We did 
see the airlines back away from cancellation fees and we are 
grateful for that.
    That was during COVID. And of course, the COVID crisis 
really pushed that decision forward. And so, though we 
appreciate that there are so many fees related to flying, I 
want to make the point that, you know, yes, you know that you 
are--you have a baggage fee, but there are many people who are 
older, who have disabilities, who may have children with them.
    They may not be carrying their bags onto the airplane. So, 
they are forced to eat the cost of a $35 fee, something that 
used to be free before, and it has jammed our airplanes full of 
luggage up top, creating hazards for flight attendants as well.
    Senator Markey. And that is why we need to pass the Fair 
Fees Act, which would prohibit airlines from charging fees that 
are not reasonable and proportional to the cost of the services 
provided.
    And I want to turn to one other topic related to aviation. 
Consumer protection, airport service workers, The Good Jobs for 
Good Airports Act, which I have introduced with Senator 
Blumenthal and Senator Schumer, would increase the wages and 
benefits for airport service workers like baggage handlers and 
wheelchair attendants.
    And we are fighting for this bill because it won't only 
repay the sacrifices that these workers made during the 
pandemic. It will also help consumers. Higher wages and 
benefits for airport service workers means lower turnover and 
better airport security and higher service quality.
    Ms. Greenberg, do you agree that the Good Jobs for Good 
Airports Act is ultimately a good pro-consumer bill?
    Ms. Greenberg. Yes, we certainly support the Good Jobs for 
Good Airports Act. And I think many consumers had no idea that 
a lot of these workers were not making minimum wage were 
relying on tips. And many people who use the wheelchairs and 
baggage--use the baggage, the curbside baggage services did not 
know the people were living on tip wages, and many people don't 
tip as we--as some of us who have been tipped workers know, 
tipping is very up and down and certainly not a reliable source 
of income. So, yes, we very much appreciate that legislation 
and it is long overdue.
    Senator Markey. And again, that would come as all new 
information to most people who fly, that these people are 
actually supposed to be tipped for all the services that they 
are providing.
    No one actually knows that, which is why we have to ensure 
legally that they get paid what they deserve. And that is why 
we are going to continue to fight to include that legislation 
in the FAA reauthorization. Thank you, Ms. Greenberg. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Senator. I will turn it 
over to Senator Welch.

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. You know, 
the computer has been mastered by, in this case, the airlines, 
but a lot of people selling things, to be able with their 
algorithms to put a lot of pressure on people who are making a 
decision, let's say, to fly. That is a big deal for a family. 
Let's say there is a funeral, or there is a wedding.
    They want to fly, or they are making a decision about 
whether to go to a place or even take a vacation, and they 
start to look at what the price is. And the question really is 
if you get the upfront price, that that family can make a 
decision based on their budget before they get totally 
emotionally committed to doing it. And a lot of people will 
say, oh, I can afford this, and then we will get into it.
    And then as the fees pile up, they suddenly find themselves 
in a different place with a lot of anxiety. You know, there is 
a question here not just about transparency, but the time of 
transparency. When does the person be told very concretely and 
specifically what the total cost will be?
    Which is really kind of a policy question, but on my sense 
from talking to consumers is they would like to know that 
sooner rather than later. I will ask both of you to comment on 
that. That--and I am thinking about that time-frame where 
people have that clock ticking and they have got to push 
``buy'' or the whole thing goes away.
    Is there anything that we should be doing about that 
element of this? Ms. Greenberg, I will ask you, and then 
Professor Zywicki.
    Ms. Greenberg. Yes, I think right upfront information, 
including you are going to have to pay for baggage, you are 
going to have to pay to sit together if you are family. If you 
want to sit closer to the front, maybe have disability issues, 
or you have a stroller, or you have--a baby is with you, you 
should know----
    Senator Welch. There are two different areas too. Then 
there is a question of knowing upfront and then there is a 
question of what is reasonable and what is not. It is not 
reasonable, in my view, to make people pay to have a family sit 
together.
    I totally agree with Senator Markey. The baggage fee is 
different. I hate it. But if that is upfront, you can calculate 
that into the cost. Professor Zywicki, any suggestions on how 
Congress should approach this?
    Mr. Zywicki. Yes, I will say two things, which is first I 
will amplify that point--whenever possible I fly Southwest 
simply because it is easier, right. I know I can worry about my 
bags later. If my plans change, I can change my plan.
    So, there is some competition there. And as I said, I think 
people understand what is going on with bags. And there could 
be people who are affected more or less. One thing I will say, 
I have not looked at the cost of this so I am speaking a little 
bit out of order, but the idea of having 24 hours to cancel an 
airline ticket after you book it, I think that might be 
something that is worth exploring in this context.
    Which is, that if you have a transaction that has a back-
end fee, you have 24 hours to cancel without penalty, for 
example. Because sometimes it won't be until I get the 
confirmation e-mail, for example, that I will see something I 
missed when I was booking it, or if I feel like I was rushed 
into something, if there is some way in which people could 
have, say 24 hours, like you can with an airplane ticket, to be 
able to cancel the transaction, I don't know what the cost of 
that would be.
    I don't know how feasible that is. But that strikes me as 
one way of maybe getting it done.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Do we know when somebody is 
booking an airline and you are trying to get to the pricing, it 
says two left at this price. Is that true?
    Mr. Zywicki. Well, what I can say is I have booked and then 
decided--there are situations where I have booked and then had 
to rebook like, oh, because like, I had a credit in my account, 
right. And what I found is after I booked the last ticket at 
that price, when I went back in, to try to book it again, was a 
higher price. So, I don't know whether it is true or not, but 
at least sometimes it seems to be true.
    Senator Welch. So, should there be an obligation on the 
part of the seller, an airline, to make certain that that is in 
fact true?
    Ms. Greenberg. I would certainly agree. From a consumer 
perspective, you want to know if that is true, if that 
statement is based on fact. You see a lot of those in the 
ancillary services, you know, the Expedias, the Travelocitys 
will do it. You have got only two tickets remaining at this 
price. I certainly wouldn't trust it as based in fact, and I 
think it is false advertising, and should----
    Mr. Zywicki. That seems like an unfair trade practice to me 
instinctively.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. I yield back.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Senator. Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the 
witnesses being here. It is an important topic. Thank you for 
sharing this. I guess, for both of the witnesses at the table 
here. One of the issues that I think--that we are all 
struggling, not struggling with, but trying to nail down better 
is how you define junk fees.
    And it is not easily definable. So, Professor Zywicki, is 
that right? Can you take a crack at that? What I want to make 
sure is that the ones that are junk fees, we go after. The ones 
that are fees, I think the key on other kind of fees is 
transparency.
    But maybe the two of you can help us with regarding junk 
fees and then the definition. And then I have kind of a follow 
up on what you think economically their impact is, which I 
think is also an important issue. You want to take a crack at 
that, professor?
    Mr. Zywicki. Sure. Junk fees is a meaningless term, but it 
is worse than meaningless, it is actually pernicious, which is 
that by sort of using this blanket conclusory label, it 
obscures the complexity of this, the difference between drip 
pricing, risk-based pricing, multi-part pricing, partition 
pricing, and that sort of thing.
    And it kind of sweeps into one bucket. Things that are 
legitimate, things that are aren't, things that might be 
partially legitimate. And now it has even got more confusing 
because you look at the FTC rule, for example, on auto dealers, 
they take things like nitrogen filled tires, did they charge 
more money for a claim that is a junk fee?
    The problem with that is not that it is a separate price 
for nitrogen filled tires. The problem, if there is a problem, 
is that nitrogen filled tires are garbage, right. There is 
nothing there. It doesn't matter whether it is disclosed 
separately or bundled in the price, if it is a worthless 
product.
    And so, when we talk about junk fees, we can end up 
confusing ourselves, lumping in things because we want to just 
apply this label to it. Whereas I think it would be much better 
to understand risk-based pricing.
    What are things where either you are pricing for something 
that you get no value from? What are the things where they are 
pricing things simply to extract well from consumers and the 
like?
    Senator Sullivan. So, would you like to try to--how would 
you define something that falls into each of those different 
categories with different labels?
    Mr. Zywicki. Me?
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Mr. Zywicki. Well, what I am trying to say is that when we 
look at the context in which these arise--so, for example, 
mandatory fees. And mandatory fees should be presumptively, 
strongly, presumptively disclosed upfront. There may be 
scenarios of that I can't think of, or that may be the case.
    That is the only reason I am hedging. Things that are near 
mandatory may be like that, right. Like a credit card 
surcharging might be an example. So, I would start with that. I 
would also think about what exactly is the market failure, 
which is, you know, if, is it the problem that is disclosed too 
late in the process?
    Is the problem that this fee is for a worthless service, 
right. Or is it something that seems to be doing some work in 
terms of allocating the cost of using a product or service to 
the person that is actually using it, like a late fee does, for 
example, on credit cards.
    Senator Sullivan. Ms. Greenberg, do you have a view on 
that, the question that I asked?
    Ms. Greenberg. Yes. Sure, Senator Sullivan. I think and we 
think that a good working definition of junk fees is 
unnecessary, unavoidable, or surprising charges.
    Senator Sullivan. So, to Mister--Professor Zywicki's point, 
mandatory, do you think that is a good one? I mean----
    Ms. Greenberg. The example that--I used in my testimony as 
a mandatory resort fee that you are presented with when you 
check out of a hotel. It is often a daily fee. It could be $35. 
I have seen them as high as $75 for services that you didn't 
use or Internet service. In some cases, the swimming pool, the 
fitness center. They are required.
    And I am one of those consumers who always asks the hotel 
to take it off my bill, but they consider them mandatory, and 
you have no choice. So, no, they are not disclosed upfront, and 
so you can't comparison shop when you are looking for a hotel 
room.
    Senator Sullivan. OK, good. Let me ask, you know, the White 
House has been talking about this. We want to make sure we get 
it right as well. They often tout the junk fee issue as--in the 
context of fighting inflation.
    Look, my view is they have a whole host of other areas 
where they can really fight inflation, right. Like, maybe not 
driving up energy costs on American families. And the Federal 
Reserve blew the inflation issue a long time ago.
    But they do add certain costs, like the example you just 
gave. Is this really like more of a transparency issue, or do 
you think that kind of trying to bring this into fighting 
inflation is a stretch that seems, you know, like a little bit 
of junk fee, false advertising from the White House, maybe. 
What--I would like both of your views on that as well. 
Professor.
    Mr. Zywicki. Well, this obviously has nothing to do with 
inflation. It has nothing to do with inflation. The cost is the 
cost, right. Colloquially, I even said it earlier, we say bags 
fly free on Southwest.
    Bags don't fly free on Southwest, right. There is a cost 
for bags. The bags--the bag fee is either separated out and 
paid by people who use the bags, or the cost is bundled into 
the ticket. There is empirical evidence that shows, as I said 
earlier, that the price of a ticket on Southwest is higher 
because you are paying for your free bags and your free 
cancellations and everything else.
    So, the cost is the cost, whatever the cost is. It has 
nothing to do with inflation. And so, what it has to do with 
is, what is the right level of transparency, and really what is 
the scheme of pricing that will help consumers in the end find 
the products they want at the lowest prices?
    And sometimes that means unbundling the prices, sometimes 
that means bundling the prices, sometimes that means you get 
bundled prices, like in Southwest together with unbundled 
prices with United, and you get different consumers using 
different things and that sort of thing.
    And so that is really what this is about. The bottom line 
is, what we should care about is, are consumers getting the 
lowest price for what they are actually using. And that is--and 
everything, in my view, should be allocated toward that end. 
Transparency is not an end in itself. This has nothing to do 
with inflation.
    Senator Sullivan. Professor Greenberg, does this have 
anything to do with inflation?
    Ms. Greenberg. I think certainly it does, because when 
consumers are asked to pay additional prices for mandatory 
fees, let's say in a hotel, but this also hits lower income 
consumers. The junk fees on consumers--we will go with that 
term because I think it is very descriptive. Very punishing.
    And what it means is if you have to--if you are renting a 
property or you are applying to rent properties, you are paying 
a cost on each one of those rental applications. That is money 
that doesn't go for groceries, that doesn't go for childcare, 
it doesn't go for utility bills or gas.
    So, this does have an inflationary effect in our view. And 
you asked about the effect on the economy. Well, $12 billion in 
credit card junk fees is what the credit card companies and 
banks are making off late payments by families. And the airline 
industry collects--collected $102.8 billion in ancillary fees--
they call them ancillary fees--in 2022. So, it has a big effect 
on the economy.
    Senator Sullivan. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Appreciate it.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. Thank you, Senator. I have got a 
couple more questions. So, I will maybe call a second round. 
Somebody walks in, we will ask more. Ms. Greenberg, I don't 
know if you have polling or--I mean, how widespread do you feel 
is this aggravation people feel from surprise fees, junk fees, 
or however you want to call them?
    Ms. Greenberg. Well, you know, I quoted from a Consumer 
Reports article. They said 89 percent of consumers who were 
polled said that they have encountered junk fees. They are 
pervasive.
    They are across industries. We talk, you know, about banks 
and airlines, and to some extent rental car companies, although 
I will say with rental car companies, they have begun an all-in 
pricing model. Which, we used to sit with them and complain. 
You know, I don't know what I am getting charged for.
    What are all these convenience fees and delivery fees. And 
now they have gone in, and you can actually price compare when 
you rent a car, and I very much appreciate that. But the scope 
of these fees are massive and growing, and it is a huge profit 
center for industries.
    And they have not lost--that has not been lost on so many 
of the industries. And so, we are seeing them proliferate.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, certainly the oftentimes many 
industries, in anticipation of legislation, move to be in 
compliance before the legislation is passed. It doesn't mean 
you don't need still need that legislation because then they 
will backslide.
    You know, I was in the restaurant business for almost 20 
years and there used to be a restaurant called Soapy Smith's, 
which was named after an early settler of Denver, Colorado, who 
would sell soap.
    And these little packages of soap, which were half, again, 
more expensive than other soap. But in a crowd as he was 
selling the soap, someone would open, one of his friends would 
open a container of soap and there would be a dollar bill in 
there. And you go, oh my gosh, look at me, I have--this soap is 
amazing. And all of a sudden there would be a run. That is the 
opposite of a surprise fee.
    So, surprise, delight. And I think in many ways, you know, 
as a small businessperson, we were always trying to figure out 
how to create, and not with surprise fees, but create more 
delight or some--more positive experience, some level of joy so 
that we could charge more money and the people would feel good 
in the transaction.
    And I think that is part of what you guys have all been 
talking about, is the businesses providing these services and 
products will do better in the long run with more transparency. 
And sometimes one does have to legislate.
    You know, things like seatbelts don't naturally come--those 
kinds of change aren't always embraced at the very beginning, 
but in the end they increase more sales. Dr. Morwitz, I wanted 
to ask you a little bit on--you talked somewhat about the way 
consumers perceive that sudden increase in price, and that they 
think if they go back through the whole process again, they 
don't recognize--I think you said they don't recognize how much 
savings they would actually have and that they wouldn't--they 
feel that they would end up--somehow come out on the short end 
of the stick.
    Can you go into that a little more and talk about some of 
the other issues around consumers in there. Just as Ms. 
Greenberg said earlier, in the business of their lives, how 
they get shortchanged in having to deal with these late stage 
price increases.
    Ms. Greenberg. Sure. Absolutely. And I also just wanted to 
comment on a previous question. I do think inflation plays a 
role here because I think the firms are under pressure to raise 
their prices.
    Consumers don't want to see the prices rise, so they use 
hidden fees as an implicit price increase to deal with 
inflation. But to your question, my research has identified 
several reasons why consumers in this kind of situation 
complete the purchase instead of restarting. First, sometimes 
the fees are obscured in such a way that consumers don't even 
notice them or realize they have been assessed.
    So, this might happen if they are in the small print or not 
presented at all and just show up maybe later in a bill or it 
is embedded in a total in your credit card statement and maybe 
you don't even notice.
    Second, even when consumers do notice these fees and they 
see that the total is more than they initially thought, once 
hidden fees are revealed and thinking about whether to restart 
search, the consumers think about the costs and benefits of 
restarting. And my research has shown that consumers think the 
cost, the time of starting search all over again is longer than 
it really is.
    They also think that the benefits, how much money they 
could save, is less than it really is. And one of the reasons 
they think there is few benefits to restarting search is 
because they often believe that if the current firm uses hidden 
fees, well, then most likely all the other competitors do too.
    But that is not always the case. And even when the 
competitors to assess similar hidden fees, the fees may be 
different, they may go by different names, they may be 
different amounts, and all this makes search difficult and 
confusing for consumers. There are other reasons, too.
    Sometimes the fees are presented in a way that makes them 
look like a tax. Sometimes they are even grouped together with 
taxes, giving the impression there is no way to avoid them. For 
many websites, consumers actually can click on an arrow to open 
up an option labeled something like taxes and fees to see the 
details. And then even when they open them, the label may sound 
like a tax.
    For example, your cell phone bill may include a Federal or 
State universal service charge, which sounds like a tax, but 
really represents the cost the cell phone company must pay to 
support universal access. But then they pass it on to 
customers, in a way, making it sound like a tax.
    Or a rental car company may group with taxes an airport 
concession recovery fee, which represents their cost to operate 
out of an airport, but they pass it on to customers, making it 
sound like a tax customers have to pay to rent a car from an 
airport. And then finally, as I mentioned before, consumers are 
sometimes put under pressure by the firm that uses hidden fees 
to complete the purchase with these countdown clocks and the 
scarcity cues that we talked about before.
    So, consumers might then be reluctant to restart search, 
believing that those tickets may be gone if they decide to look 
a little more and then they might be gone at the end if they 
say they still want them. So those are some of the many reasons 
why consumers often stick with an offering, even after it can 
feel fees in a more expensive total are later revealed.
    Senator Hickenlooper. You know, the thing I would add to 
that, that we have had from--heard from roundtables, especially 
with older consumers when they are working online, there is a 
level of frustration where they get to a certain point and they 
are faced with higher prices and they really are reticent to 
going back through the whole process because they find it so 
frustrating and many times consuming.
    We heard that from a number of people. My last question, 
Professor Zywicki, and I welcome you to come be a visiting 
professor at the University of Colorado, right. So, make sure 
we get that out on the record. Yes, go buffs.
    Mr. Zywicki. Professor Prime, you can call me.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hickenlooper. The new football coach is Coach 
Prime, Deion Sanders. Just want to make sure everyone is 
aware--the allusion. Professor Zywicki, what are the examples 
of sectors where the upfront pricing of products and services 
is most effective in terms of informing customer choice?
    Mr. Zywicki. Where it is most effective?
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. Where the upfront pricing of 
products is, yes, most effective, most successful.
    Mr. Zywicki. Yes, I will just take a brief second to 
elaborate on something Professor Morwitz said, which I think it 
may dovetail with Senator Klobuchar's concern about markets and 
market power, which is that she talked about people don't 
restart searches.
    And I think that--I would be surprised if that was 
especially a problem in markets, say, like Ticketmaster, right, 
where you essentially have market power. What is the point of 
restarting the search if there are no other firms really out 
there competing?
    And there is some evidence that this can be a bigger 
problem in more concentrated markets, and so--so, I think there 
is a dovetailing there. And I think she also mentioned on the 
inflation point, just to clarify, I think she is right that 
inflation does create pressure to do this, and part of that has 
to do with taxes, for example, which is, as I mentioned, my 
testimony, there is 7.5 percent excise tax on an airplane 
ticket, but there is no tax on a bag fee.
    So, if ticket prices rise simply because of inflation, 
tickets rise an additional 7.5 percent for every dollar on an 
airplane ticket, which puts more pressure to try to adjust 
untaxed things. And that is a whole sort of separate question.
    With respect to your question, my general observation is, 
is that industries and firms tend to give consumers what they 
want. I mean, the classic example is Amazon Prime, right. If 
you want a classic example of essentially all in pricing, $129 
for prime and you get all this stuff, whether you use it or 
not, right. But things vary over time. It used to be you got a 
whole bunch of cable packages and people got tired of paying 
for cable channels they don't want, so now we are seeing 
unbundling.
    My guess is we will probably see bundling. It is a process 
that goes back and forth because bundling is convenient for 
people. Upfront pricing is convenient for people. But sometimes 
people say, well, I don't pay--I don't really use that. I don't 
pay for that.
    So, then you start getting these tendencies toward 
unbundling. So generalizing is something I am very squeamish 
about doing in these markets as opposed to looking at the 
combination of prices in terms and trying to figure out whether 
they make sense in particular context.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Absolutely. Well, I appreciate all of 
your time and all of your work. You have each been working on 
this for years and years and years, and it is funny how there 
are cycles, whether it is bundling and unbundling or just 
people paying attention to these surprise fees, or just 
accepting them blindly.
    But I think we are coming to that point where we are going 
to go into a new period where I think we will get to pretty 
much everything being transparent and that the customers will 
have a better--feel more confident that they are getting a fair 
opportunity to get what they want at the price of what they 
expect. Any final statements that anybody--have I overruled 
somebody's thoughts as it was coming up?
    Mr. Zywicki. I might just have one last thought, which is I 
do think the Internet has made this more of a problem, which is 
this desire of Internet merchants to make their costs look 
cheap upfront, right, on the Google search or whatever, and 
then hit you with fees on the back. And I think that does 
create a particular dynamic here.
    And I think it is particularly a problem for small 
businesses because that is, I think, a process that the larger 
businesses probably can figure out how to game a little bit 
better. So, I think that is an issue.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Well, and you are not even talking 
about the context of AI, and it is--that is going to be a 
separate hearing, but that is coming. Anybody else on that last 
statement?
    Ms. Greenberg. I would just say that all in pricing is good 
for competition, and helps consumers, and helps honest 
businesses who are trying to provide the kinds of services you 
were talking about, Senator. And that is why it is so important 
that the legislation that we have talked about here get close 
to passage.
    As you said, sometimes those pressures inspire changes 
among industry players. But thank you for holding a hearing on 
something that is increasingly a problem for consumers. And I 
look forward to questions on the record.
    Senator Hickenlooper. You bet. Dr. Morwitz, last comment?
    Ms. Morwitz. Yes, I agree. I think all in pricing is 
something that benefits consumers no matter their party. It 
benefits honest businesses, no matter their leanings. It helps 
competition, it helps small businesses. I think this is a very 
straightforward issue.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you very much. I thank 
all of you. Appreciate you spending the time. This is going to 
conclude our hearing for today. I want to thank my colleagues, 
both who were here and were online. Obviously our witnesses, I 
will thank you again and again and again.
    The hearing record will remain open for questions for two 
weeks until June 22, 2023. Any Senator who would like to submit 
questions for the record may do so until then. We ask the 
witnesses to submit their responses to those questions by July 
6, 2023. With that, the Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:26 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

      Prepared Statement of Hon. Ted Cruz, U.S. Senator from Texas
    In October 2022, President Biden stood on a stage flanked by the 
heads of the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau announcing that his Administration would target 
companies and financial institutions charging consumers so-called 
``junk fees'' to help fight inflation.
    Imagine that! After trillions of dollars of reckless government 
spending by Democrats that sent inflation soaring, the President's 
solution is to target ``junk fees.'' That's like offering a Band-Aid 
for a broken arm. It's missing the larger problem.
    Unfortunately, this is not simply an inability to diagnose our 
economic problems, but a clear effort by President Biden to avoid 
accountability and avoid admitting that we are on a reckless financial 
trajectory.
    No one here should be fooled by the White House's argument that 
targeting ``junk fees'' is the solution to fighting the sky-high Biden 
inflation that is harming ordinary Americans every day from the grocery 
store to the gas pump.
    Setting that context, let's turn now to today's conversation about 
``junk fees.'' No American, myself included, likes paying hidden or 
extra fees for any product or service. It's frustrating and confusing.
    But I think we need to first take a step back and distinguish how 
this White House's regulatory approach is flawed. Rather than gathering 
evidence and ensuring consumers are equipped with clear information, 
the Administration is instead engaging in one-size-fits all regulation 
that would harm Americans through what I can only define as rate 
regulation or price controls rather than accounting for how our markets 
actually work.
    Not all fees are ``junk fees.'' Some fees actually serve an 
economic purpose. For example, most Americans understand that paying 
``add on'' fees for additional toppings on a pizza makes sense. If you 
want more product, you pay a little extra. And we know that credit card 
late fees or overdraft charges are meant to deter certain behavior 
that, if not kept in check, could cause some Americans to subsidize the 
behavior of others. These are not ``junk fees'' but serve a larger 
function within our markets and pricing schemes.
    Competitive markets, in fact, do produce lower prices for goods and 
services. In those markets where consumers are confused by pricing or 
prices are misrepresented, I would argue that rather than resorting to 
government price controls, which will create higher costs for 
Americans, we should instead consider price transparency and 
disclosure. Transparency and disclosure provide consumers the 
information they need to make informed decisions in the marketplace, 
which instills more market competition.
    The market for event tickets, like sports games and concerts, is 
one example where Americans would benefit from additional transparency 
and disclosure. Every sports fan and concertgoer--myself included--can 
recall a time buying a ticket online expecting to pay an advertised 
price only to learn at checkout that the total cost was substantially 
higher because of additional fees that were not disclosed upfront.
    A 2018 GAO report found that ticket fees, which are often not 
disclosed to Americans early in the ticket buying process, averaged 27 
percent of the ticket's costs with some fees totaling 58 percent of the 
total ticket cost. Tacking on fees at the end of a transaction is 
frustrating and confusing for consumers who expect that the price 
listed for a ticket is the actual price they will pay.
    That's why Chairwoman Cantwell and I have introduced the TICKET Act 
(S. 1303). Similar to how airlines have to advertise the full ticket 
price upfront, the TICKET Act works the same way for tickets to 
concerts, sports, and large gatherings. The TICKET Act's transparency 
requirements would promote competition for the benefit of all American 
ticket buyers.
    Rather than resorting to one-size-fits-all government price 
regulations, I believe the TICKET Act is a reasonable, bipartisan 
response that identifies a known problem and provides a targeted 
solution that would benefit all Americans. I am pleased to report that 
multiple stakeholders in the event ticket industry have expressed their 
support for the TICKET Act, including StubHub.
    I look forward to moving this bipartisan legislation through the 
Committee and Congress soon.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to 
                            Vicki G. Morwitz
App Store Purchase Fees
    My bipartisan bill with Senator Grassley, the American Innovation 
and Choice Online Act, addresses abuses of gatekeeper power by dominant 
tech companies, including those operating app stores for mobile 
devices. App stores charge fees of typically 30 percent to app 
developers, which are often passed on to consumers making in-app 
purchases or buying subscriptions. This practice hurts small companies 
and independent creators that develop apps by holding back their 
ability to scale their businesses, and hurts consumers who have to pay 
a higher price.

    Question. How do App Store fee policies limit competition and 
ultimately raise prices for consumers?
    Answer. Consumers are often unaware that when they purchase a 
subscription or make an in-app purchase through an app store they may 
be paying a higher price than if they made the purchase directly from 
the small business (if possible), and this is because the small 
companies that develop the apps pass on the fees they are charged by 
the large tech companies who host the platforms to consumers. This 
practice also hurts small businesses and competition. Because the large 
tech companies who host these platforms have significant market power, 
they are able to assess these significant fees onto small businesses 
and require them to offer purchase/subscription options through the 
app, where the fees will be assessed versus allowing them to offer 
these in some other way to avoid the app and be able to offer lower 
prices to customers. While the large tech companies do offer small 
businesses a platform where small businesses can distribute their apps, 
they are abusing their market power, and hurting competition and 
consumers, by collecting extremely high fees.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ben Ray Lujan to 
                            Vicki G. Morwitz
    Question 1. What effect do early termination and cancellation fees, 
particularly in the telecom industry, have on consumer behavior?
    Answer. These fees are often not made salient to consumers when 
they are shopping for telecom plans and thus they tend not to be able 
to easily consider them when making their initial decisions. In 
contrast, if customers sign a contract for long time service, what is 
salient is the substantial discounts customers are offered. Thus these 
deal appear more appealing to customers than they really are if the 
early termination and cancellation fees were made salient enough to 
take into consideration. In general, firms create many obstacles that 
make it difficult for their customers to defect from services, for 
example having to call to cancel a plan versus being able to do so on 
the website using customer portals or on apps. When customers finally 
do reach a stage where they can cancel, they may be presented with 
these fees, which prevent a further obstacle. Thus, it leads to 
stickiness in markets where customers tend to stick with their current 
providers, even when they are not fully satisfied.

    Question 2. Do companies use tactics such as drip pricing because 
they know it confuses and misleads customers?
    Answer. I suspect so, but have not been privy to internal firm 
discussions when these tactics are put in place. What I can say is that 
their presence does make shopping more confusing and difficult for 
customers in a way that benefits firms that use these tactics. It also 
leads to consumer perceptions (e.g., that a total price is lower than 
it actually is) and behavior (e.g., an increased likelihood to buy) 
that benefit firms.
    So, while I cannot say for certain that this is why firms use these 
tactics, use of these tactics certainly benefits firms at the expense 
of consumers.

    Question 3. Will a confused, misled, or frustrated customer likely 
spend more money than they originally intended?
    Answer. Yes, my research and research of other scholars studying 
drip pricing has shown that it leads consumers to spend more money than 
they needed to and more money than they would spend if upfront pricing 
was instead used.

    Question 4. How do hidden fees make air travel less accessible for 
both low-income and inexperienced travelers?
    Answer. I'm not sure I can answer that. What I can say is that they 
lead consumers to be more likely to purchase a ticket that they thought 
was cheaper than it really was and to pay more than they expected. 
While it has not been directly studied, there is good reason to believe 
that these adverse effects are larger for more disadvantaged consumers.
    Question 5. How do these fees hurt economies that depend upon 
tourism such as New Mexico?
    Answer. These fees hurt economies because they stifle competition. 
Well intentioned firms who want to honestly and fairly present their 
prices to consumers lose market share to firms who use these deceptive 
pricing tactics. When firms compete on pricing tricks rather than on 
product quality, businesses, consumers, and industries, like the New 
Mexico tourism industry, suffer.

    Question 6. What is your response to those who argue that these 
fees actually benefit the consumer? Aren't cost-conscious and savvy 
consumers able to save money by opting out of these add-ons?
    Answer. People who make those arguments are conflating two things. 
There is nothing wrong with add-on pricing models where consumers chose 
the options they want and save money by not paying for options they do 
not want. For example, some consumers prefer a cheaper, plain cheese 
pizza, while others prefer a pizza loaded with many toppings, that is 
more expensive. But these are options, not mandatory fees. What is 
important in cases that involve fees for optional add ons, like 
toppings for pizzas, or a a travel plan for a cell phone service, is 
that the prices for the add-ons be fully disclosed upfront so that 
consumer can make fully informed decisions.
    In contrast, imagine if a pizzeria charged $10 for the pizza and an 
additional $2 for cooking the pizza, and only let consumers know about 
the $2 fee late in the decision making process. That type of pricing 
would be misleading just as is separating out mandatory resort fees 
with hotels. If a fee must be paid no matter what, then the total price 
is the same to the consumer if the firm decides to partition the price 
or if they decide to use all inclusive pricing. There is no benefit to 
the consumer of partitioned pricing, but there is harm--this tactic 
leads consumers to underestimate total costs.
    Now some firms may claim that they use partitioned pricing to 
transparently communicate different aspects of their pricing model. For 
example, a ticketing agency might want to communicate how much of what 
consumers pay for tickets goes to the venue, how much to the artist, 
and how much to the ticketing agency. That is fine, but there is no 
reason a ticketing agency cannot first give the total price, and then 
explain how that price breaks down.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                         Professor Todd Zywicki
    My answers are below. Please note that these responses are 
tentative and answers depend greatly on the details of various 
proposals.

    Section 13(b). In AMG Capital Management, LLC v. Federal Trade 
Commission, the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Trade Commission 
(``FTC'') lacks statutory authority to seek monetary relief when the 
FTC brings an action under Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (``Section 13(b)'').

    Question 1. Do you believe that the FTC, when bringing a case under 
Section 13(b), should have the authority to ask the Court to award 
monetary relief for consumers who have been harmed by unfair or 
deceptive business practices? Why or why not?
    Answer. Under certain circumstances, subject to due process 
protections, and calibrated appropriately, the authority of the FTC to 
seek and courts to award monetary remedies on an emergency basis to 
prevention dissipation of assets. However, such authority must be used 
in appropriate cases, with proper due process protections, and 
appropriate in amount.

    Question 2. How does the FTC's inability to seek consumer redress 
and disgorgement under Section 13(b) impact consumers and honest 
businesses?
    Answer. I am not aware of any evidence as to how the FTC's 
inability to seek consumer redress and disgorgement under Section 13(b) 
impacts consumers and business. As the FTC's use of Section 13(b) 
evolved over time, however, its use expanded beyond the narrow 
situation for which it was originally designed to aid in remediation of 
consumer fraud and to be used in other cases such as antitrust cases 
and more traditional consumer protection cases.

    Question 3. Do you support legislation that would authorize the FTC 
to seek, under Section 13(b), monetary relief for consumers who have 
been harmed by unfair or deceptive business practices? Why or why not?
    Answer. It would depend on the details of the legislation, 
including the circumstances, types of cases under which such relief 
might be made available, method of calculation of monetary relief, and 
due process protections.

    Question 4. Do you support legislation that would authorize the FTC 
to seek disgorgement of unlawful gains under Section 13(b)? Why or why 
not?
    Answer. It depends on the factors previously stated.

    Question 1. How do Junk fees harm the most vulnerable and price-
sensitive consumers, such as families on a fixed income?
    Answer. Data from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System found that in 2022, 18 percent of U.S. adults indicated the 
largest emergency expense they could cover was less than $100.\1\ 
Another 14 percent said the largest expense they could cover was 
between $100 and $499. With one-third of Americans unable to cover an 
unexpected expense of more than $500, junk fees can quickly eat into 
vulnerable consumers' savings as they are unable to accurately budget 
for such charges.

    Credit card late fees disproportionately burden consumers in low-

nearly twice the rate of high-income households. The same survey also

rates of 1.9 and 1.4 times, respectively, of white households.\3\

    Question 2. Would true pricing transparency encourage competition 
and improve customer access when it comes to telecom services such as 
high-speed broadband?
    Answer. Yes, pricing transparency is the foundation for marketplace 
competition. For telecommunication services such as high-speed 
broadband, the Federal Communications Commission's (``FCC'') broadband 
consumer labels \4\ will transform the industry by implementing 
industry-wide pricing transparency.

    The FCC's broadband consumer label addresses this problem directly 
by standardizing pricing disclosures. To facilitate comparison 
shopping, the FCC will require broadband providers to break out their 
monthly price, itemized fees, discounts and bundles, and information 
regarding connection speeds within one label.
    While the FCC's broadband consumer label is a critical step toward 
eliminating anticompetitive behavior in the telecommunications 
industry, other barriers to universal access remain. Additional and 
continued funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program \6\ as well 
as ensuring that all regions are serviced by at least two \7\ Internet 
service providers are necessary to removing these barriers and
