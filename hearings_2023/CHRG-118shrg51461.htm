                        THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
    Today we will be discussing the U.S. nuclear fuel life 
cycle and the issues that our Committee must work to address 
this Congress. With the passage of the Energy Act, Inflation 
Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS 
and Science Act, Congress has authorized new programs and 
provided significant financial investments to ensure the 
continued operation of our current nuclear fleet and the 
development of the next generation of advanced reactors and 
technologies. We have also created programs to ensure the 
energy communities which have powered our country to greatness 
have the opportunity to lead the way forward by building 
advanced nuclear reactors at shuttered fossil fuel sites. 
Before the enactment of the bills, half of our nuclear fleet 
faced premature retirement by the end of this decade. But now, 
the approximately 95 gigawatts of reliable, baseload generation 
from our existing 92 reactors can be preserved into the next 
decade. This is an important accomplishment that highlights a 
win-win for our energy security and our climate goals. Without 
these critical pieces of legislation, the U.S. nuclear future 
would be grim, yet we still have a lot of work to do.
    Putin's war in Ukraine has brought the geopolitical risk of 
not having energy independence from those who do not share our 
values into clear focus. But it is not just Europe that became 
reliant on cheap Russian energy. We, as the superpower of the 
world, are still dependent on Russian nuclear fuel. Right now, 
our country is deficient in nearly every aspect of the fuel 
cycle. This must change and it must change quickly. Whether it 
is uranium, mining, milling, conversion, enrichment, nuclear 
fuel fabrication, power generation, or nuclear waste storage 
and disposal, there is much work to be done, starting with 
conversion and enrichment. Simply put, Russia dominates the 
global market, representing nearly half of the international 
capacity for both processes. We have bipartisan bills to remedy 
this situation, and I look forward to continuing to work 
closely with my friend, Ranking Member Barrasso, Senator Risch, 
and Senator Warner on this important issue.
    The U.S. has become dependent on Russian enriched uranium 
to meet our commercial nuclear generation requirements. Prior 
to the war, we planned to supply our advanced reactors using 
Russian high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). This must 
change, and initial steps have been taken to alleviate these 
issues. We included $700 million in the IRA to supply our 
advanced reactors with American HALEU, however, more needs to 
be done, including working closely with our allies and partners 
to increase nuclear fuel production and greatly expanding our 
efforts to onshore both uranium conversions and enrichment 
activities.
    Last month, I introduced the Nuclear Fuel Security Act with 
Senators Barrasso and Risch, which provides the authority 
required to expand our uranium conversion and enrichment 
capacity to meet our domestic fuel requirements. We very nearly 
got this enacted at the end of last year with the support of 
the Department of Energy. And I hope we can move quickly on it 
this year. Nuclear energy currently constitutes just about 20 
percent of our electricity generation, and it represents half 
of our clean electricity, and it is clear, nuclear will 
continue to be an essential part of the mix well into the 
future. The baseload power it provides is an integral part of 
our energy security and it will be impossible to reach our 
emission reduction goals without the continued operation of the 
current fleet and the construction of the next generation of 
advanced reactors. But that means we need to stop kicking the 
issue of nuclear waste down the road. And by that, I mean what 
to do with all the waste that is accumulated to date and waste 
that is yet to come.
    We must act to provide a path forward to safely and 
responsibly dispose of our nation's nuclear waste. It is 
Congress's responsibility to act. Specifically, it is this 
Committee's responsibility to come to an agreement on 
legislation to provide a fair path forward. Nuclear waste is 
not a technical problem, it is a political problem. Since the 
1957 National Academy of Sciences report, we have known the 
safe and responsible solution for disposing of our nuclear 
waste is in deep geologic disposal.
    Inaction is also fiscally irresponsible. About $8.6 billion 
has been paid in settlements and final judgments because 
Congress has not provided a solution. That is approximately $2 
million a day, or $167,000 over the course of today's hearing, 
due to our inability to establish a permanent program to handle 
our nuclear waste. There are sites in the U.S. that present 
ideal conditions for safe disposal, but we must have a consent-
based program in place that can thoughtfully and effectively 
engage with state, local, and tribal governments to find a 
suitable means to site a repository. We have text ready to go, 
the Nuclear Waste Administration Act, which incorporates 
recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission, the Department 
of Energy, the national labs, the Government Accountability 
Office, and the National Academy of Science, on how to properly 
site, construct, and operate nuclear waste storage and 
repository facilities. It is my hope that we can finally find a 
path forward on this critical issue that we cannot ignore any 
longer.
    Finally, we also must extend the Price-Anderson Act, which 
expires at the end of 2025. For almost 70 years, this law has 
helped protect our commercial nuclear and R&D activities from 
civil litigation. Without extending this act, it is not an 
exaggeration to say our nuclear industry will cease to exist. I 
know members of our Committee and the communities you represent 
hold strongly held beliefs regarding nuclear energy. I also 
know that our constituents sent us here to create solutions to 
tough problems. So I look forward to a lively and productive 
discussion today.
    We have a wonderful group of witnesses representing both 
commercial and federal stakeholders whose viewpoints are 
critical for having this discussion today. I appreciate our 
witnesses joining us to discuss these important issues.
    With that, I am going turn to Ranking Member Barrasso for 
his opening remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you for holding today's very important hearing.
    Nuclear power is our nation's largest source of carbon-free 
electricity. It is also the most reliable, operating over 90 
percent of the time. Nuclear energy is fundamental to meeting 
our energy, our environmental, and our national security 
objectives. It is also critical to global security. The United 
States generates more electricity from nuclear power than any 
other nation in the world. We are the global leaders in nuclear 
technology development. Yet, we are heavily reliant on foreign 
sources of uranium to fuel our existing nuclear reactors, and 
we lack the ability to fuel our advanced nuclear reactors. 
Russia seeks a commanding share of the global nuclear energy 
market. It wants to undermine America's nuclear industry, and 
by several metrics, Russia is succeeding.
    For decades, Russia has unfairly dumped uranium into our 
market. It has undercut America's nuclear fuel producers, 
driving our companies out of business. American uranium 
production is now at a level not seen, as a low level, since 
the 1940s. That is why I am introducing today legislation, 
along with Chairman Manchin and Senators Risch, Heinrich, 
Lummis, Coons, and Marshall, to ban Russian uranium imports. 
Russia also controls half of the world's enrichment capacity. 
We are on the brink of finding ourselves completely reliant on 
foreign nations to fuel our nuclear power plants. This is 
completely unacceptable. We must reestablish the United States 
as the global leader in nuclear energy. America's advanced 
reactor developers are ready to accept the challenge. They are 
making strides in the United States and around the world to 
deploy their innovative reactors. This includes TerraPower, 
which will build its first Natrium reactor in my home State of 
Wyoming. Advanced reactor developers do not want to depend on 
Russia for their fuel supply. They want to purchase American 
nuclear fuel.
    We need to revitalize our nation's uranium mining industry. 
U.S. uranium is critical to America's energy security. It is 
required for our national security. We need to restart our 
nation's lone conversion facility. This is the facility that 
transforms mined uranium into the form needed for the 
enrichment plant. We also need to expand uranium enrichment. 
Thanks to Russia, our one domestic enrichment facility provides 
just a fraction of the low-enriched uranium needed for 
America's existing reactors. We need to protect this facility 
from Russia's abusive trade practices. We also need a 
commercial capability to enrich uranium to the levels needed 
for advanced reactors. Currently, there are only two sources of 
high-assay low-enriched uranium--Russia and the Department of 
Energy. This has to change. Last year, Chairman Manchin, 
Senator Risch, and I pursued legislation to accomplish all of 
these objectives. And in December, the Senate did pass the bill 
by voice vote. We reintroduced the legislation last month.
    We also have work to do on nuclear waste, as the Chairman 
just mentioned. Since the inception of nuclear power, nuclear 
waste has been safely stored onsite at existing reactors. On-
site storage does not meet Congress's mandate to establish a 
permanent repository, and American taxpayers are paying dearly 
for it. As the Chairman mentioned, each day without a permanent 
waste solution costs taxpayers up to $2 million. At a minimum, 
we must allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to finish its 
review of the Yucca Mountain license application. Getting past 
the nuclear waste stalemate is important. We owe it to the 
taxpayers to move forward with a solution.
    So I want to thank the witnesses for joining us today. I 
look forward to the testimony. And Mr. Chairman, right before I 
turn this back over to you, Senator Risch regrets that he is 
not able to attend today's meeting. He is such a big supporter 
of the Idaho National Lab, he wanted to personally welcome Dr. 
Wagner here today, and so I am doing that on his behalf. And I 
ask unanimous consent to enter Senator Risch's entire statement 
into the record.
    [Senator Risch's statement follows:]
    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And I would like to turn to our witnesses. We are going 
begin with Assistant Secretary, Dr. Kathy Huff. Then, she will 
be followed by Idaho National Laboratory Director, Dr. John 
Wagner, and finally, Constellation President and CEO, Joe 
Dominguez.
    So we will start, Dr. Huff, with you.

STATEMENT OF HON. KATHRYN HUFF, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR NUCLEAR 
               ENERGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

    Dr. Huff. Thank you, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and distinguished members of the Committee. It is an 
honor for me to appear before you today and represent the 
Department of Energy at this hearing related to the nuclear 
fuel cycle and supply chain.
    To meet our ambitious carbon reduction goals and rebuild 
U.S. leadership globally, the Biden-Harris Administration is 
prioritizing activities that keep the existing fleet of nuclear 
reactors in operation, deploy advanced reactor technologies, 
and sustain the fuel supply, as well as expand international 
nuclear energy cooperation. Nuclear energy will play a major 
role in the transition to a carbon-free energy economy by 
fundamentally underpinning our nation's targets for carbon-free 
electricity as well as non-electric energy markets. Ensuring 
this future for our nation and our allies must include a secure 
and reliable source of fuel for today's nuclear power plants as 
well as those of tomorrow.
    The Russian Federation's brutal invasion of Ukraine has 
demonstrated the grave threat to global energy security posed 
by dependence on Russian-supplied fuels. Russia is the largest 
supplier, globally, of enriched uranium, and currently supplies 
a significant portion of the nuclear supply chain to the United 
States, as well as our international allies and partners. 
Today, conversion and enrichment services from trusted sources 
are insufficient to replace current imports from Russia to the 
United States. The United States cannot reliably make 
sufficient low-enriched uranium or high-assay low-enriched 
uranium available to support the needs of today's power reactor 
fleet, advanced reactors, research reactors, or medical isotope 
production facilities, without expansion of the domestic fuel 
cycle capacity and the capacity of our international allies and 
partners.
    The Department is working to address these energy security 
challenges in the face of ongoing global events. We cannot 
continue to infuse the Russian State with this source of income 
and must eliminate U.S. reliance on Russia in the nuclear 
energy area. To do this, we must act swiftly to kick-start 
investment in domestic enrichment capabilities. DOE greatly 
appreciates Congressional support for stimulating a sustainable 
and diverse commercial supply of high-assay low-enriched 
uranium. Ending our reliance on Russian supplies also requires 
additional appropriations and authorization to implement this 
program via a revolving fund that could reduce the need for 
additional appropriations and address our national security 
vulnerability as well as that of our allies and partners 
looking to reduce their reliance on Russian nuclear low-
enriched uranium.
    I want to thank this Committee for its leadership in the 
development of proposed legislation aimed at tackling this 
critically important issue facing our nation and the world. The 
department supports the continued safe operation of our 
existing reactors, but also supports a very robust and 
aggressive uranium strategy for low-enriched uranium, including 
HALEU. We are preparing to issue a draft HALEU acquisition 
strategy pursuant to the Energy Act of 2020 within the context 
of a broader uranium strategy for the department. The 
investments provided in the Inflation Reduction Act for HALEU 
are allowing the Department to begin helping the private sector 
establish a U.S. HALEU production and supply chain capability 
for the long-term, and thus begin mitigating U.S. reliance on 
Russia for various uranium products, including both low-
enriched uranium and HALEU needed to support the current fleet 
and advanced reactors.
    The department held the first meeting of the HALEU 
Consortium, as directed by the HALEU Availability Act, with 
over 50 members from across the nuclear industry. But the 
promise of new advanced reactors can only responsibly be 
realized in conjunction with progress on the management of 
their spent nuclear fuel. The department believes a consent-
based siting process should be used for developing interim 
storage and disposal options to fulfill our obligations to 
safely and securely dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-
level radioactive waste generated by these reactors. Consistent 
with direction provided by Congress, DOE is making progress on 
consent-based siting for one or more federal consolidated 
interim storage facilities. DOE is actively working with 
national laboratory experts and reactor designers to collect 
data on proposed advanced reactor fuel forms to prepare and 
manage spent nuclear fuel from those reactors. More work in 
this area will be needed to fully understand how these fuels 
can safely and securely be incorporated into an integrated 
waste management system.
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the 
Committee today. I greatly appreciate your leadership and the 
support of the programs and policies that my office and the 
Department of Energy conduct. I look forward to continuing work 
with you toward a more sustainable, equitable, reliable, 
affordable, safe, and secure energy system for our nation. I 
look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Huff follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Huff.
    Now we will have Dr. John Wagner.

                 STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN WAGNER, 
              DIRECTOR, IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY

    Dr. Wagner. Thank you.
    Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and members of 
the Committee, it is a pleasure and an honor for me to be here 
with you today. My name is John Wagner. I am the Director of 
the Idaho National Laboratory, the national center for nuclear 
energy research and development.
    The United States once maintained a robust domestic nuclear 
fuel cycle capability, from mining to conversion, to 
enrichment, to fuel fabrication. That is no longer the case. In 
the United States, uranium mining has decreased 92 percent 
since 1980. The only U.S. conversion facility was idled in 
2017. Only one enrichment facility currently operates 
domestically, with the capacity to support about one third of 
the current reactor fleet. As we look to the future of nuclear 
energy in the United States, I would encourage members of this 
Committee to consider three questions related to the nuclear 
fuel cycle.
    First, how do we leverage our existing nuclear energy 
industry to ensure our domestic energy security? Today's 
nuclear reactors run on what we call low-enriched uranium 
(LEU). This is fuel that is enriched up to five weight-percent 
in uranium-235. The U.S. currently imports over 90 percent of 
the uranium needed to support our current nuclear reactor fleet 
of 92 reactors. Of that, approximately 14 percent is from 
Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine puts the United States 
and many other countries, including our allies, in a precarious 
situation. Developing new domestic mining, conversion, and 
enrichment capabilities would provide fuel certainty to our 
existing fleet and help ensure our energy security.
    Second, how do we ensure successful deployment of new 
nuclear energy that is critical to our energy security, global 
leadership, and climate objectives? Advanced nuclear 
technologies will run on something called high-assay low-
enriched uranium, or HALEU, fuel that is further enriched, 
enriched up to 20 weight-percent in uranium-235. HALEU enables 
reactor developers to achieve smaller designs with higher power 
densities and to optimize their systems for increased 
efficiency.
    The Department of Energy projects that the initial 
deployment of advanced reactors will require more than 20 
metric tons of HALEU before the end of the decade. Currently, 
the only commercial source for HALEU is Russia. This presents 
both a challenge and an opportunity for our nation. Ideally, we 
would expand from a LEU fuel cycle to a HALEU fuel cycle, but 
this is not possible given the crippled state of our domestic 
capabilities. By developing a 100 percent domestic HALEU fuel 
cycle, which would include mining, conversion, enrichment, and 
deconversion capabilities, we would address both LEU and HALEU 
needs.
    In the meantime, at INL we are actively working to supply 
HALEU from legacy spent fuel materials and are making it 
available to companies such as Oklo for their microreactor 
demonstration, literally turning waste into the needed 
resource. With private and government investments supporting 
the deployment of advanced reactors, the global HALEU market is 
projected to significantly expand.
    Third, how do we address the back-end of the fuel cycle? We 
have the technical capacity and knowledge to responsibly manage 
spent nuclear fuel, but we need the support from an appropriate 
policy solution. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and as 
amended in 1987 reflects the national priorities and concerns 
of the time. Several attempts have been made to amend the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, but none have yet succeeded. The Blue 
Ribbon Commission report provides a comprehensive review of the 
issues, as well as thoughtful recommendations. The near-term 
deployment of consolidated interim storage would be a useful 
component of an integrated waste management system. And while 
recycling of advanced reactor spent fuels is possible, there 
will always be a need for deep geologic disposal capacity. The 
time has come to revisit this approach. I appreciate your 
leadership on that. And to fulfill our spent nuclear fuel 
management responsibilities, and further, to support nuclear 
expansion, a new nuclear waste management policy framework is 
very much needed.
    I will conclude with this: Private-sector companies and 
investors contemplating investments in nuclear energy, many of 
them drawn to the clean, reliable, and firm power attributes, 
understandably have concerns. A fuel supply dependent upon 
imports and a broken Nuclear Waste Policy Act are sources of 
significant uncertainty that stifle investments. Gaining more 
certainty in the fuel cycle by developing a 100 percent 
domestic HALEU supply and actions to develop a workable Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act would inspire investments in microreactor 
technologies, small modular reactors, and other advanced 
nuclear technologies our nation needs. Thank you for this 
opportunity to testify and for this Committee's attention to 
this important issue. I look forward to your questions.

    And now, we have Mr. Joe Dominguez. Joe.

 STATEMENT OF JOSEPH DOMINGUEZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
                 OFFICER, CONSTELLATION ENERGY

    Mr. Dominguez. Good morning, Chairman Manchin, Senator 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee. My name is Joe 
Dominguez. I am President and CEO of Constellation Energy. We 
are the largest private nuclear company from an operations 
standpoint in the world. We operate about a quarter of the 
nation's reactors. Last year, we produced about 11 percent of 
the nation's clean energy from our reactors--vital, reliable, 
clean energy. So on behalf of the 13,000 talented women and men 
that work in our company, I just want to thank you for the 
privilege to appear before you today. It is from a personal and 
professional standpoint, quite an honor.
    I want to distill my testimony, really, down to three 
points, and they are points that have already been made this 
morning. The critical nature of nuclear energy, and I want to 
give you some real-life, recent examples where this has played 
out. Second, of course, talk about the issue regarding fuel, 
the cycles of fuel that we do not have from mining, enrichment, 
conversion, domestic capability, and the challenges that 
presents to the industry. Third, I want to speak very briefly 
about the need for DOE funding for laser technology, for 
enrichment. This is different than the centrifuges that 
typically separate the 235 and 238 through centrifugal force 
and use a laser excitation process, and it presents an 
excellent opportunity for us to enhance and really develop 
technologies.
    First, let me talk about the importance of nuclear energy. 
You know, we have had a pretty spotty ten-year record of 
electric reliability if we pay careful attention to it. A lot 
of focus on California, a lot of focus on Texas, but frankly, 
in 2014, we almost lost the PJM system to blackouts during the 
middle of the polar vortex that year. We thought we fixed it. 
But then, leading into the Christmas holidays this year, we 
again got into an emergency situation where a lot of generation 
failed to operate, and we were going to go into emergency 
measures. Fortunately, that was averted. The reason, if you 
look at a common thread through all these events, where we 
either averted a crisis or prevented a deeper crisis, it has 
been the performance of the U.S. nuclear fleet. Happily, our 
assets performed at 100 percent of their capability during this 
most recent crisis. Had they not, Christmas would have been 
affected for millions and millions of Americans and businesses.
    So what we are dealing with is vital to the energy security 
of the nation. And we often talk about the energy transition, 
but we saw in this last year that if we do not get 
affordability right, if we do not get reliability right, we are 
not really going to be able to make the full-throated effort at 
the transition that we all want to make. And I believe, and I 
think most experts believe, that the importance of having a 
firm fuel source that is also zero emission, a baseload fuel 
source, is only going to grow in importance. I am afraid to say 
that the challenges we recently faced are not the last 
challenges we are going to face as we transition to more 
intermittent resources. I like to say we are in an 
``everything, every time, anywhere'' business, right? Anything 
you want to power, anywhere it exists in the grid, anytime you 
want power, whether it is a blow dryer or an electric vehicle, 
or a steel factory, all of it depends on the electric grid 
functioning, and that depends on a robust nuclear industry.
    Right now, that industry is dependent on fuel sources that 
are not domestically produced. And the risk of that is--a 
cutoff by the Russians to those fuel sources could, in turn, 
turn into a reliability crisis and would particularly be felt 
when we need the energy most during some of these events that I 
alluded to earlier. So we strongly support the work that this 
Committee has done. We got very close, as Chairman Manchin 
mentioned, to the finish line last year. But we have got to get 
over the finish line. Five years is a blink of an eye. Right 
now, internationally, we have a gap from a conversion 
standpoint of about 25 percent that would be realized if the 
Russians stopped delivering to us and allies, of conversion 
services. Twenty percent of the international market is 
dependent on the Russians. If we are going to address those 
gaps, we have to begin that work immediately.
    So I am here to just emphasize that the industry, and 
Constellation in particular, wants to be a strong partner. We 
believe a cost sharing model makes a great deal of sense, but 
what we are addressing here is not just a fuel issue, that is a 
commercial issue, but an issue that reverberates through 
national security and electric reliability issues that the 
country is facing presently. So I look forward to the 
discussion and to any of your questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Dominguez follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you, all. We appreciate you very much 
for your input and also making an effort to be here today. It 
is much appreciated.
    We'll start with the questioning, and I will begin.
    You know, we made a lot of extraordinary progress during 
the last Congress, maintaining that the U.S. is going be an 
energy leader, a nuclear energy leader. We did everything we 
could to save the industry and to propel it so it will be 
totally reliable as we need it and also helping all of us in so 
many different areas, as far as dependability, reliability, and 
also emissions. So with that, I am going ask kind of rapid-fire 
questions, a few of them for all of you.
    Do you all believe, and I will go down the line, do we need 
to eliminate our dependence and allies' dependence on Russian 
nuclear fuel and conversion of enrichment? Are we too dependent 
right now? Do we need to eliminate that?
    Dr. Huff. Yes.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Dr. Wagner. Yes.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes.
    The Chairman. How about do we need to extend Price-
Anderson?
    Dr. Huff. Yes.
    Dr. Wagner. Yes.
    Mr. Dominguez. I almost went out of turn. Yes.
    The Chairman. That's okay.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. That's okay. You were getting anxious.
    Do we need to create a federal agency to use the community 
consent-based approach to establish nuclear waste facilities?
    Dr. Huff. Yes.
    Dr. Wagner. Yes.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Finally, do you believe that we are eliminating baseload 
fuels faster than we are replacing with dependable, reliable 
energy?
    Dr. Huff. Are we, or should we?
    The Chairman. I mean, you know the statistics as well as I 
do.
    Dr. Huff. Could you repeat the question?
    The Chairman. Do you believe that we are eliminating 
baseload faster, and I will just--PJM just filed a report. I am 
relying on PJM's report.
    Dr. Huff. Yes.
    The Chairman. If you want to go to that one. They are 
taking off coal-fired because in our state----
    Dr. Huff. Yes.
    The Chairman [continuing]. They are trying to accelerate 
elimination of baseload, which we have nothing to replace it 
with, and they are running--and I think, Mr. Dominguez, you 
mentioned how close you are running to that blackout. So I am 
just asking your questions.
    You said yes?
    Dr. Huff. Yes.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Dr. Wagner. Yes.
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, yes, I do.
    The Chairman. Mr. Dominguez, if you would like to elaborate 
a little bit since you are in this mix right now. I have always 
understood there are only two baseload fuels. They are totally 
dependable, reliable, and affordable, but there are only two 
that you can count on 24/7, and those are nuclear and coal. 
Now, we have replaced coal with gas. That is great. We have a 
lot of that. Okay. But we have seen what happens because then 
you have pipelines that can freeze up. You got pump stations. 
You have got a lot of things that might not be as reliable.
    Are we getting ourselves into position--and my other 
concern, the reason this whole Committee, both Democrats and 
Republicans, came to the aid of nuclear--we knew that we had to 
save that industry. But here is my concern--I don't know if you 
all can make it in a merchant market. Day-to-day pricing, 
coming on, you know, when renewables come on, they have to go 
because they can't hold them. They have to use it. But you 
can't ramp down, I know that. So it puts you in a very 
precarious situation where your cost is going be pretty 
constant and higher.
    So if you can address how the pricing of nuclear, how we 
can maintain it and build it in on our national grid?
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, if I could start, just with your 
point. Look, I think we are getting dangerously close to 
papering over what is going to be one of the most difficult 
engineering challenges our nation will face, and that is, 
again, trying to replace an energy system that has these 
guarantees to families and businesses that it will be on all 
the time, with resources that do not operate when people 
dispatch and when Mother Nature permits them to operate. And I 
do believe that we have overlooked these problems in the early 
days of the introduction of some of these intermittent 
resources, and the consequence has been fairly small so far 
because the percentage of penetration has been minimal.
    So the issue you pointed out around the coal plants is 
pretty evident. We have replaced them with natural gas, but it 
is notable that in the 2014 incident with the polar vortex 
event and PJM, we lost about 40 percent of the natural gas 
resources. Again, we thought we had addressed that, and here 
again, just now, a matter of months ago, we lost over 30 
percent of the natural gas resources when we needed the power.
    The Chairman. I'm just saying that people need to 
understand.
    Mr. Dominguez. It is a big issue.
    The Chairman. We are depending, and we are taking for 
granted that the system has been very robust, if you will, and 
predictable, but basically, it is very fragile.
    Let me just say this--we passed the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act. Can 
you tell me, from a professional standpoint, what effect do you 
think that has had on our energy grid, energy mix, and the 
amount of attraction as far as investments in our country?
    Dr. Huff.
    Dr. Huff. I think, in particular, the prospect of the tax 
credits is expanding the likelihood, from our assessment, that 
existing nuclear power plants will extend their licenses and 
that new nuclear power plants will have the financial 
incentives to be built out. I expect that similar expansion on 
the grid, based on some of the provisions in those bills, will 
also increase grid reliability and security and sustainability.
    The Chairman. Right.
    Dr. Wagner.
    Dr. Wagner. There is a lot in those bills. I will say, 
briefly, the Civil Nuclear Credit Program is incredibly 
important for some of the reactors in the fleet. The Production 
Tax Credit and the Inflation Reduction Act, is already being 
very much welcomed, and particularly the fact that the 
Production Tax Credit and the Investment Tax Credit include 
nuclear, where nuclear had been excluded from some of these 
credits in the past, is very, very helpful.
    The Chairman. Have you seen overseas investments coming?
    Dr. Wagner. Yes.
    The Chairman. And----
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, total game changer. It allows our 
investors to support us when we are extending the lives of the 
assets. The conversation for the last ten years has been about 
closing nuclear plants. Now, we are in this welcome discussion 
about continuing their operation for generations to come.
    And as to your question about international investment, I 
would simply say that what the U.S. has done is recognized the 
gap in so-called ESG investing around clean energy resources 
that many investors have now closed. In other words, they have 
included nuclear energy as a part of that picture. That is 
important to our investor base and ultimately, to our success 
as a company. So total game changer, transformational.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Huff, thanks so much for being here again. Great to see 
you. You know, for the past couple of years, I have urged the 
Department to accelerate its efforts to establish a U.S. source 
for high-assay low-enriched uranium. As a result of the 
inaction by the Department, TerraPower recently announced that 
it anticipates a two-year delay in the operation of the Natrium 
reactor. When will the Department request proposals from 
industry to establish commercial production of high-assay low-
enriched uranium?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you, Senator. I really appreciate your 
support of the funds to move forward in this. Our initial 
acquisition and strategy to support the DOE needs for enriched 
uranium products, including everything you have mentioned, is 
in progress. It is currently under interagency review, and we 
expect it to be out very soon. We are getting very close to the 
release of that acquisition strategy.
    Senator Barrasso. Yes, you use the phrase interagency 
review, which is the whole process, because I actually believe 
that you, and I believe the Secretary of Energy, really want to 
speed this up and are not the cause of the inaction. So who's 
slowing it down?
    Dr. Huff. You know, we want get this exactly right, and it 
is critically important that the whole of government have an 
opportunity to review. So of course, it goes through a process 
where, you know, other agencies and the Office of Management 
and Budget and everyone has an opportunity to weigh in, and I 
expect that when we do release it, it will be exactly right and 
there will be no question across the entire whole of 
government.
    Senator Barrasso. So then in the whole of government, are 
you facing pushback from the White House or another agency?
    Dr. Huff. There is certainly support from the White House 
that we release this soon, but getting it right is even more 
important.
    Senator Barrasso. Is the Office of Management and Budget 
delaying the progress?
    Dr. Huff. The Office of Management and Budget is involved 
in this interagency review, sir.
    Senator Barrasso. It does seem that there is some roadblock 
there and I think it's not you and I think it's not the 
Secretary. So then, I am looking to see where that is. There 
are some people that just oppose nuclear energy. And I am 
wondering to see if there is somebody that is out there trying 
to slow things down intentionally because of their concerns 
regarding the issue of nuclear energy.
    Dr. Huff. My understanding and hope is that it is 
collectively a desire to get it out, get it out soon, and get 
it out correctly.
    Senator Barrasso. Okay.
    Mr. Dominguez, domestic suppliers can produce nuclear fuel 
for our reactors. They need clear market signals to justify the 
increased production. America's nuclear utilities have helped 
send these signals by committing to buy U.S. uranium. What is 
Constellation doing to provide America's nuclear fuel suppliers 
with these market signals?
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, it is not only what we are doing 
but what we have done for some time. We were a part of Exelon 
before the split in the company about a year ago. And we 
traditionally have been helping at all cycles--the miners, we 
have done some work with miners, converters, and enrichers, to 
continue to create that capability. We understand that that 
commercial signal is a critical part of making progress in 
getting this domestic production and we have done it for years 
and years. The details of all of that are spelled out on page 
four of the testimony in terms of all of the different steps we 
have taken, but we recognize we have a big role here.
    Senator Barrasso. You know, Chairman Manchin and Senator 
Risch and I introduced legislation to authorize the Department 
to execute its plan to ensure U.S. nuclear fuel availability, 
but the program needs to be funded. Last month, the Nuclear 
Energy Institute and three other organizations sent letters 
endorsing a proposal to use funds from the Civil Nuclear Credit 
Program to ensure U.S. nuclear fuel availability.
    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter these 
letters into the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [The letters referred to follow:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. So Mr. Dominguez, do you agree that we 
can repurpose a portion of these funds without negatively 
affecting operating nuclear reactors?
    Mr. Dominguez. You know, I think Dr. Huff is probably the 
best person to opine on the usefulness of that program. What I 
can simply tell you, Senator Barrasso, is that we do not intend 
to use the Civil Nuclear Credit Program. Our focus here is not 
where the money comes from, necessarily, it is in getting this 
work started. And so I think that is a question more for the 
Department and appropriators than for us. But I can tell you 
the CNC program is not something that we will be using in our 
fleet. And historically, we have had the most challenged units.
    Senator Barrasso. Maybe in a second round, I will ask Dr. 
Huff to opine, but first I have one for Dr. Wagner.
    The Department of Energy has limited quantities of high-
enriched uranium that can be downblended for use in advanced 
reactors. The Department also has stockpiles of spent fuel and 
nuclear waste. These resources can be processed and fabricated 
into fuel to meet the near-term needs of advanced reactors. 
What is the Idaho National Lab doing to make high-assay low-
enriched uranium available to advanced reactors?
    Dr. Wagner. Thank you for the question. There are two 
categories I would think about, and one is unirradiated high-
enriched uranium that could be utilized--potentially 
downblended into HALEU, and then there are irradiated 
materials. You can think about high-enriched uranium spent 
nuclear fuel, fuels such as what was used in the Experimental 
Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II), for example. What we are doing, 
very specifically, is processing that EBR-II material to 
separate the uranium, clean it, then downblend it to just under 
20 weight-percent of the isotope uranium-235 to make that 
available for small reactor demonstration projects, things like 
the Oklo reactor demonstration, as well as provide that 
material for uses in fuels designed to test fuel performance. 
It is a limited amount, but it actually is serving, or will 
serve an important need in the near term.
    There are additional stocks of those materials that could 
be utilized for similar purposes. I will note that that 
material is not ideal for all reactor types and does introduce 
some complications in fuel fabrication that have to be 
considered.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman.
    Secretary Huff, as you know, New Mexico is home to a plant 
that provides roughly a third of the domestic demand for 
enriched uranium, and the state is certainly poised to play a 
key role in the DOE's upcoming implementation of its HALEU 
Availability Program. However, DOE--their previous HALEU 
demonstration program was awarded as a sole-source contract. 
That left this plant unable to participate. Can you assure me 
that this new program will be awarded through a competitive 
process that would allow this plant to compete for this work?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you, Senator.
    I also appreciate the importance of competing these awards. 
The role that the Urenco facility plays in New Mexico is world 
class and critically important to this and yes, I can 
absolutely commit to this being a fully competitive process.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you. I appreciate that very much.
    I want to ask you a bigger philosophical question that you 
may not want to answer, but given that the NRC has a 48-year 
record of saying no to nearly--nearly, all the time, is the NRC 
broken? Do we need to consider a different regulatory 
framework, especially as we are on the front end of what could 
be an era of small modular nuclear reactors for at least the 
last 20 percent of our decarbonization goals?
    Dr. Huff. Senator, I could not agree with you more that the 
need for our regulatory system to work efficiently to enable 
these deployments is absolutely critical to get to our carbon 
reduction goals. It is essential. And the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission has a huge job facing it. I do not envy them this 
task. Their approach to streamline and improve their 
efficiencies, I hope, will result in success, but in my role in 
the Office of Nuclear Energy, I cannot really guide that or 
opine on what they should do, but I will say, I am fully in 
agreement that they deserve an opportunity to sort of get more 
efficient, and they are going to need to in order to support 
our climate goals.
    Senator Heinrich. I think we can all agree on that.
    Mr. Dominguez, I wanted to ask you, you know, just to be 
straightforward and honest about this--one of the challenges 
with traditional light-water nuclear reactors has been the cost 
issue. The cost per kilowatt-hour has not been competitive in 
recent markets. We addressed some of that through the 
Production Tax Credit, obviously. It is, what, two and a half 
cents per kilowatt-hour, I believe. But this is mature 
technology, so how can we bring down those costs, because I 
think that has been a fundamental limit for deployment, 
certainly of more traditional designs. It remains to be seen 
what we can do with future SMR designs.
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, just a couple points. I don't think 
the nuclear fleet has been uneconomic. I believe that it is 
uneconomic in an unlevel playing field. As you pointed out, 
there have been tax credits.
    Senator Heinrich. I mean, everybody has benefits. You have 
a tax credit. Price-Anderson was a benefit. I mean, that was 
basically socialization of insurance cost. And I am not saying 
that is a bad idea. I am saying, how can we drive down those 
costs? Because if they were truly competitive, we would have 
been deploying more than one light-water reactor in the last 
decade.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes. I think the issue, in terms of the 
existing fleet, is probably slightly different than in terms of 
introducing new technologies. In the case of new technologies, 
I think it is pretty clear that the cost of building these very 
large sites, just the cost of money over the period of 
construction, is prohibitive. There are licensing issues 
associated with that that contribute to some of the cost 
pressures, things that we have talked about a little bit 
already today.
    But I think what we need to do is change the philosophy 
around how we build reactors, and I think these small modular 
reactors being built in factories over a much shorter period of 
time has got to be the way to go here. I think, certainly for 
our company, and we are the largest in this space, right?
    Senator Heinrich. Right.
    Mr. Dominguez. For our company there is no way we could 
undertake the construction of a large, dual-unit site. Think 
about the irony of that. We own 23 of these things already and 
we cannot build the next two on our balance sheet, okay? Small 
modular reactors--different story. Smaller bite in capital, but 
you get the machine up and running and producing energy sooner, 
meaning revenues are in the door and the cost of interest--
carrying costs--are substantially lower. So I think it is 
already headed in that direction. This fuel issue is also a big 
part of that. As you look to attract investors, one of the 
questions that we get constantly is, where are you getting your 
fuel and what happens if Russia shuts you off?
    Senator Heinrich. I am pretty much out of time, but I do 
want to just bring up the fact that I also think we need to 
make sure that small modular reactors are actually small and 
modular because if they are complicated reactors masquerading 
as SMRs, because that is popular in the moment to say you are 
an SMR, then we are going to have some of the same challenges 
that we have had with traditional light-water reactors.
    The Chairman. What is the size?
    Senator Heinrich. The size is less important than the fact 
that you can sort of stamp these things out exactly like each 
other to avoid the complexity that we have experienced with 
one-off nuclear reactors.
    The Chairman. Yes, my two cents on that--as I am 
understanding, there are like 300, 340 megawatts. You can stack 
them, but they will be exactly the same and he was explaining 
the molten salt cooling. You kind of peak them up and peak them 
down, which is a little bit, I mean, you get more flexibility 
than you have now.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes, that is right, Chairman.
    The Chairman. We are just trying to dumb it down a little 
bit so that we understand it, but that makes sense to me.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes, Senator Heinrich, I think, nailed the 
issue with his point.
    The Chairman. He got it, yes.
    Mr. Dominguez. There is really no definition here. So some 
of the designs are as small as 50 megawatts, okay, maybe 70, 
megawatts. Some of the designs are as big as 500 megawatts----
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Mr. Dominguez [continuing]. Which is the size of some of 
the early generation units. So it gets into which technology 
are you talking about here.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Thank you so much, Senator Heinrich.
    And now, we have Senator Cassidy.
    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Huff, I am excited to see the X-energy 
and Dow Chemical partnership to use high-heat nuclear reactors 
to create lower carbon products. My state makes a lot of these 
products essential for modern life. How is DOE approaching 
working with these major manufacturers, not just the nuclear 
technology company, to make sure that the ARDP program is 
successful?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you, Senator. We are also really excited to 
see that advanced nuclear capabilities can support industrial 
decarbonization like this. It is critically important to use 
these unique sources of high heat for what they are best at and 
what would otherwise be very hard to decarbonize, as you say.
    DOE supports this through lots of research and development 
at our national laboratories and, of course, through the cost-
shared ARDP program, but continued oversight and observation of 
that ARDP award is now taking place under the Office of Clean 
Energy Demonstrations. My office, of course, continues to 
support the TerraPower deployments and the X-energy deployments 
and NuScale deployments through support at the national 
laboratories as well, including Dr. Wagner's.
    Senator Cassidy. So this general kind of atmosphere of 
support doing the R&D et cetera, if you will, Senator Heinrich 
put it well, everybody gets some benefit. This is the benefit 
that you think would make this more economically feasible?
    Dr. Huff. Absolutely. We are exploring all kinds of 
different markets, clean molecules of all types, hydrogen and 
advanced fuels, enhanced aviation fuels.
    Senator Cassidy. So let me ask, then, to what degree are we 
going to be able to take this from an occasional sort of, yes, 
we can do it here into which it is more commonplace?
    Dr. Huff. Well, I am an optimist and I believe that we 
should and must take it to the fullest degree in order to 
return net-zero carbon reduction goals by 2050. To get a net-
zero economy, we must fully commit to this. Whether it is 
possible or not, is bound to see, but that is the purpose of 
these demonstrations is to demonstrate the first-of-a-kind that 
we hope will be the end-of-a-kind.
    Senator Cassidy. If you had to bet your first-born male 
child upon it, do you think we will be successful?
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Huff. That's funny.
    Senator Cassidy. I mean, I know you are an optimist, but to 
what degree, what are the prospects of this? Do we think it is 
truly possible?
    Dr. Huff. I actually once bet a lot of beer to the American 
Nuclear Society that we will have a small modular reactor 
operating by the end of the decade. So quite a bit. I am quite 
committed.
    Senator Cassidy. I understand you are about to release a 
request for proposals (RFP) on developing a new high-assay low-
enriched uranium development capacity. I think this is 
positive. There needs to be more than one producer. So can you 
speak about DOE's commitment to making sure that the RFP 
results in multiple American developers of HALEU, not just one?
    Dr. Huff. Senator, I absolutely agree with you. Thank you 
for this question. It is an important and nuanced point that 
diversity of supply is security of supply. We are committed to 
ensuring that the acquisition approach is flexible enough to 
incorporate the possibility of supporting as many suppliers as 
can make our system as robust as possible.
    Senator Cassidy. To what degree are we creating 
international markets for all these products that we are 
developing, which, obviously, has the ability to lower the 
marginal costs of producing the next one, but also achieve 
other goals?
    Dr. Huff. The list of nations interested in engaging with 
us on this particular topic is growing every day. It is almost 
exponential. All of our partners and allies involved in the 
fuel cycle supply chain, I expect, will be engaging with us, 
you know, over the coming years in really public ways around 
strategic investments, and of course, the customers are coming 
every day. I have a long, long list of nations that are 
interested in small modular reactors, gigawatt-scale reactors, 
microreactors. Nuclear newcomer counties and nuclear operating 
countries are all interested in engaging in this and they all 
need a secure fuel supply.
    Senator Cassidy. That's great. And not just a secure fuel 
supply, but also in terms of the technology itself.
    Dr. Huff. That is right.
    Senator Cassidy. And you feel, again, optimistic about 
that?
    Dr. Huff. American technology is well trusted 
internationally. This is part of the reason why our Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission is such an excellent resource, but also, 
you know, our technology is ahead of the game, especially in 
small modular reactors.
    Senator Cassidy. Last question. As part of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure bill, we developed a Civil Nuclear Credit 
Program, which provided funding to keep existing nuclear 
online. This may have been discussed before I was here, I 
apologize. Now, since the creation, we have seen discussions of 
the funds being used for maintenance in a California nuclear 
plant, but these were not at risk of being shut down, and of 
reopening previous closed. Can you just detail how DOE is 
looking to use this program to otherwise promote nuclear?
    Dr. Huff. Yes, absolutely. So that program started in my 
office, and has actually moved over to the Grid Deployment 
Office inside the Department of Energy for its second round and 
future rounds of credit allocation opportunities. The second 
round was recently opened for a broader set of plants to apply. 
We expect that even with the production tax credits in the 
Inflation Reduction Act, there will still be plants at some 
economic risk, and competition in merchant markets that will 
continue to apply for that program. It is a long-term program 
and there is, you know, plenty of opportunity for those plants 
to apply for multiple later rounds.
    Senator Cassidy. So the answer is you have matured the 
ability to deliver the dollars where they are needed and you 
think there will be an ongoing demand?
    Dr. Huff. I do.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay, thank you. I yield.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    And now we have Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you to 
the panelists here.
    You know, in one of the hearing rooms across the way there 
is a hearing going on regarding the train derailment in East 
Palestine, Ohio. And let me just say, I think we should be 
doing everything to support the people living there, the 
businesses there, and hold accountable anybody who contributed 
to that negligence. But this derailment is one of the many 
reasons we, in Nevada, have serious concerns with any potential 
efforts to move spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive 
waste to the proposed repository, Yucca Mountain. It is worth 
noting that the Yucca Mountain project would not be a small 
project. It would require the shipment of over 9,000 casks of 
high-level nuclear waste on 2,800 trains over the next 50 years 
through some of Nevada's most visited and populated areas and 
many other communities across this country. It is a prime 
example of why state consent is critical. Shipments would pass 
through communities throughout Nevada. It is vital we have a 
buy-in from all impacted levels of government.
    When we are talking about nuclear waste storage, I 
appreciate the Chairman's comments on this and continued 
support. I also appreciate, Assistant Secretary Huff, your 
comments earlier today in your opening statement and the Biden 
Administration's continued commitment to consent-based siting 
for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. It is 
something we have to address. We all agree. We have to move 
forward to address this issue. And I am hopeful we can all work 
together to find a solution, because I think that is what it is 
going to require, not just for us, but the future generations, 
and moving into the 21st century with the technology that is 
out there that is going to provide us these opportunities to 
really find a solution here.
    Assistant Secretary Huff, let me ask you this: your written 
testimony touched on existing nuclear waste recycling policies 
in France, other European countries, as well as Russia, China, 
and Japan. I am going to ask, and Dr. Wagner, you touched a 
little bit on this. How do these efforts compare and differ 
from ongoing U.S. recycling efforts, and Dr. Wagner, can you 
just speak to, a little bit more, what the laboratory is doing 
and conducting in this space? Is recycling possible?
    So let me start with you, Assistant Secretary Huff.
    Dr. Huff. I will just briefly say that the United States, 
while we currently do not encourage commercial reprocessing 
actively, we are continuing and will continue to do research 
and development as the economics and safeguards and security of 
that technology evolve. We are supporting lots of research and 
development in advanced fuel cycles that improve those 
economics and improve the security of those technologies. I 
think there is a lot of hope for making sure that there are 
options in the future.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Dr. Wagner.
    Dr. Wagner. If I may, first, let me say the concerns there 
with the train derailment, I hope that that does lead to 
reforms. I will note that having been directly involved in 
designing and licensing spent fuel transportation casks, the 
level of rigor, as required by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission on those packages, is substantially different. There 
are some really interesting videos of trains being intersected 
directly perpendicular with casks and what happens. They are 
very, very robust systems. So I just would like to share that 
with you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Dr. Wagner. In terms of recycling, what are we doing, 
specifically? So you know, if you look back in history, a lot 
of that recycling technology, spent nuclear fuel recycling 
technology, was developed here in the United States. And for 
years, actually decades, we did recycle, particularly high-
enriched uranium spent fuel from the DOE reactors. That was an 
active thing that was being done. In many different cases, 
including naval spent nuclear fuel, as well as the Experimental 
Breeder Reactor-II, it demonstrated a closed nuclear fuel 
cycle. So again, a lot of that technology was developed here.
    What we are doing currently is, we were already processing 
the HEU, high-enriched uranium material, for disposal. That was 
the intention initially. And as this need for HALEU developed, 
it was realized that rather than preparing this material as 
waste, we could actually clean it up a little bit further and 
use it as fuel again. And so that is what we are doing. But 
what we are doing is limited to the Department of Energy-owned 
material with specific goals of filling the near-term gap, in 
some cases, for HALEU.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate this. And I 
appreciate your comments about the trains. And let me just say 
this, I am third-generation Nevadan. We were also told by the 
scientists in the Federal Government that atomic testing in 
Nevada deserts was safe for everyone. And that has proven not 
to be the case. So my concern is, we need to get this right and 
we have an opportunity now to really focus on moving forward. 
We know the science isn't safe at Yucca Mountain. It is proven. 
We have an opportunity to work together with new technology, 
moving forward to address this issue. We are operating under an 
archaic law. It is an archaic law that is basically saying, go 
back and review the Model T in a Ford manufacturing plant and 
tell us whether it is safe or not, when we are moving into the 
21st century with new technology that gives us the ability to 
really focus on this for the future. And all I am asking--and I 
think many of us are--is let's get it right. We spent 40 years 
not doing anything, and it's wrong. It's wrong. And so let's 
get it right moving forward. Let's take the science. Let's take 
it and move this ball forward for everybody in our future.
    And finally, and I appreciate, I know I am over my time. 
There is an opportunity with advanced nuclear reactors. And I 
am here to tell you, just because we are fighting to protect 
Nevada and the people and businesses that live there and the 
over 40 million tourists that come here from a storage site 
that is not technically sound by the science, does not mean 
that we do not support clean energy and this idea that this 
technology is going to take us in a new direction. But we also 
know that we have to get it right. And that is why we need to 
work together, not play politics with this important issue.
    So I thank you for being here. I appreciate the comments 
today. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks to 
our panelists for being here.
    Mississippi is home to one of the largest U.S. nuclear 
power reactors at Grand Gulf in Port Gibson, Mississippi. And 
so nuclear energy is very important to Mississippi. It is not 
that far from my house. I have church members who work there 
and tell me about it all the time.
    But Dr. Huff, this one is for you. Throughout the past 
decade, nuclear energy has proven to be one of the lowest cost 
and most reliable energy sources--things that we have talked 
about, utilized by the U.S. electric grid. And as we have 
discussed, the war in Ukraine has made it even more urgent that 
we reduce our dependence on Russia's enriched uranium. In your 
testimony you talked about doing just that. However, this 
Administration has made clear its hesitancy in doing so, given 
that is still has not sanctioned Russian uranium, unlike oil 
and the petroleum products, natural gas, or the coal. And I am 
of the mind that it is critical we cut off all Russian imports, 
including uranium. That has been discussed by many of my 
members here. The U.S. should strengthen its domestic nuclear 
fuel supply chain and again establish itself as a global energy 
leader.
    What is stopping the U.S. from eliminating its reliance on 
Russia in the nuclear energy area?
    Dr. Huff. Senator, thank you so much for your support of 
nuclear energy in general, but also for this question. I think 
it is important and nuanced. And you are absolutely right that 
we must stop fusing the Russian government with the resources 
from purchases of uranium. However, it takes a while, a few 
years, to stand up new fuel cycle capacity to replace the 
capacity that we currently import from Russia and we have only 
a finite amount of inventory available inside this country. And 
so we want to make sure that the timing is appropriate such 
that we have incentivized the expansion of that fuel cycle 
capacity at the same time as pairing it with import 
restrictions. So these two must be paired in order to make the 
timing work out because it will take longer to stand up new 
capacity than the resources we have on hand to ensure the 
continued operation of our existing nuclear power plants 
without fuel disruption.
    And so, what we need is a pairing of the import 
restrictions and incentives for that fuel cycle capacity to be 
stood up. Combining those financial incentives with an import 
restriction protects both. You can't do one without the other, 
and largely this is because of the very few, countably many, 
enrichment capabilities in the world. The only ones that are 
not state-sponsored or state-owned are ours, so, that is why.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Very good way of articulating that. I 
am very impressed the way you could deliver an answer that is 
well said.
    And what options could the Federal Government consider to 
accomplish the goal of increasing domestic capacity for uranium 
conversion and enrichment without competing with our commercial 
nuclear operators for a scarce resource, and are you 
considering other financing tools such as cost shares or loan 
guarantees?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you, again, for this question. It is an 
important one. So importantly, loan guarantees are available 
and I think can be used currently by the enrichers that may be 
interested in considering that. It would have to be because of 
rules about those loan program office guarantees. It would have 
to be separate from anything that I do out of my office, but 
currently that is available, but would just have to be 
carefully managed.
    In terms of grants or cost shares, we identify the need to 
ensure some protection to the American taxpayer by structuring 
a strategy that would use long-term commitments for offtake 
agreements. We ensure that this is payment on receipt of the 
material, ensuring that, you know, the United States taxpayers' 
investment really goes to the production of material from new 
capacity. So that is the current plan of our uranium strategy. 
And we did consider, you know, grant opportunities and cost-
share strategies, and we decided that the best way to protect 
the American taxpayer and really ensure that, you know, 
enrichers and converters get the, kind of, insurance that they 
need, would be through potentially long-term offtake 
agreements.
    Now, this is all continuing to go through interagency 
concurrence, but I do expect something with an acquisition 
strategy to come out soon that does precisely this.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay, thank you. I have got 20 seconds 
left, so.
    The Chairman. Oh, I thought you wanted to use them.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. That is exciting.
    Senator King.
    Senator King. First, I want to ask Senator Cortez Masto, 
because I am a little confused--how do you really feel about 
Yucca Mountain?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. I think that came through.
    I wrote in big letters in my notes, the word ``when.'' So 
let me start with small modular reactors, Dr. Wagner. I have 
been hearing about small modular reactors for a long time. It 
keeps getting further away. How close are we? Is this going to 
happen in the reasonably near future?
    Dr. Wagner. Absolutely, it is. And I certainly understand 
that it feels like it is been a while.
    Senator King. My father used to say if you drive straight 
at the Pentagon, it keeps getting further away, and that is 
sort of the way I feel about this.
    Dr. Wagner. Again, I certainly understand that. We, 
actually, at the Idaho National Laboratory, have published and 
made available what we see as a timeline of new nuclear reactor 
operations. And currently on that timeline you will find the 
UAMPS NuScale project, which is targeted for first commercial 
modular operation in 2029. They recently received the design 
certification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which, 
admittedly, probably took longer than they had anticipated, 
which is part of the delays that you might see.
    Senator King. Do you think within the decade we are going 
to see commercial small modular reactors?
    Dr. Wagner. That is the----
    Senator King. This is being taped, you know, so.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Wagner. Yes, I mean, they have been working toward that 
schedule of summer of 2029 for the first commercial module for 
some time now. And as far as I understand, they are on 
schedule, provided, you know, they continue to have the 
financial resources that they need to do that, of course.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    The other ``when'' question is nuclear waste. There are now 
21 stranded nuclear waste sites in the country. One of them is 
in Maine, which is essentially a high-level nuclear waste site, 
and there are about 80 or 90 others that are operating nuclear 
plants. So it is not as if to say we do not have nuclear waste 
storage. We have it. It is scattered all over the country, 
which is probably the worst solution. When, Dr. Huff, do you 
anticipate having an answer to a question that has been pending 
since the early 50s?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you for this question. It is certainly the 
case that having 76 locations of interim storage is 
significantly worse than consolidating and having one or two or 
just a couple of federal interim storage sites. We are excited 
to be actually making progress now with the appropriations from 
Congress around consent-based siting. We have released, closed, 
and are now reviewing applications for a funding opportunity 
announcement of $26 million that will be sent out to 
communities to explore their own interests and understanding of 
spent nuclear fuel interim storage, and we----
    Senator King. There are places in the country that are at 
least interested in considering hosting one--this site. Is that 
correct?
    Dr. Huff. Yes. We expect--yes.
    Senator King. And then you have to deal with the 
transportation issue, which, I think, is a very relevant one.
    Dr. Huff. A couple of years.
    Senator King. A couple of years, Okay. You are on record as 
well.
    Mr. Dominguez, one of the questions about nuclear power--
and I realize that you are in the operation, not the 
construction business--is the cost. Do you have--offhand, do 
you know a rough figure for cost per megawatt of the 
construction of a new nuclear power plant?
    Mr. Dominguez. Well, you know----
    Senator King. I have seen the figure $5 or $6 million a 
megawatt. Is that accurate?
    Mr. Dominguez. My own view, and you rightfully pointed out 
that this isn't our business model, but my own view is that 
probably your first-of-a-kind costs are going to be in that 
area. I think you can trend down to about $3,500 is the 
ambition. Now that----
    Senator King. $3.5 million, you mean.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes.
    Senator King. Per megawatt.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes.
    Senator King. But now let me ask a question you may know 
the answer to, and that is, what is the cost of maintaining or 
life extension of an existing nuclear plant per megawatt?
    Mr. Dominguez. The process is about $35 million to $60 
million for the entirety of the plant, and the reason for that, 
Senator, is that throughout the life of the plant we are 
consistently replacing pumps and other big modules in the 
plant. So at any given moment, even if we are approaching the 
end of license life, the plant is in the operating condition 
that it can continue to operate. So it is effectively 
licensing. You might have some cable work that you are doing, 
some underground piping work that needs to be replaced, but it 
is an incredibly modest cost there.
    Senator King. It is in the realm of fiscal feasibility.
    Mr. Dominguez. Not only is it feasible, it has been done, 
and we did it at Peach Bottom to go to 80 years. We are in the 
process of doing it at other dual-unit sites. It is a very 
modest cost.
    Senator King. Because one of the problems with our energy 
markets today is that it favors today cost and does not take 
into account capital costs. So low capital costs--gas is the 
example.
    Mr. Dominguez. Right.
    Senator King. Where it is low today, but you are on the 
fuel roller coaster, but you are talking about investments that 
are high capital, but low operating once you get going.
    Mr. Dominguez. Right. In our case, again, because the 
machines are already operating and we are consistently 
replacing component parts, the machine is as good or better as 
the day it started, and it is perfectly capable of continuing 
to operate beyond license life.
    Senator King. One final question, for the record, because I 
am out of time. What lessons have we learned from Zaporizhzhia 
about the vulnerability of nuclear plants? Because Zaporizhzhia 
has not been attacked directly, but just this morning, they cut 
the power lines and it does not have the energy to cool the 
plant. They are having to use diesel. They have three weeks 
supply of diesel. I hope we are learning something from this 
experience, and I would be interested in your thoughts on that, 
for the record.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes, I think----
    Senator King. That means give me a written answer because I 
am out of time.
    Mr. Dominguez. Okay.
    Senator King. The Chairman will scold me, and I don't want 
that.
    The Chairman. I am not going to scold you. If you want to 
answer, you can answer.
    Senator King. Well, there you go.
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, I think those lessons largely have 
been learned by the industry through a similar occurrence in 
Japan, right, where the lack of onsite fuels to support 
continued operation of cooling systems ended up becoming a 
pinch point for the operation of bad assets. So I think we have 
adopted a number of technologies already to ensure that we 
continue to operate if we are disconnected from the grid. Now, 
the question of actual, physical military attack on a reactor 
is quite a different thing, but I think you are focused on----
    Senator King. No, I understand that. I am more worried 
about a cyberattack that would disable the grid.
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes, and I think we have already built in 
that capability based on what happened at Fukushima.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Huff, you stated in your prepared testimony the 
importance of appropriately locating nuclear waste disposal 
locations. Have I got that right? And you talked with Senator 
Cortez Masto just a second ago at some length about this. Can 
you agree--can we agree that at the very least, wherever we 
think about locating nuclear waste--probably not a great idea 
to have it in proximity to school children?
    Dr. Huff. School children are very important and their 
safety is very important, yes, sir.
    Senator Hawley. So you are aware, I hope, that is 
unfortunately exactly what happened, however, in my home State 
of Missouri. At Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School 
District in the St. Louis area, we have nuclear material that 
is not only in proximity to a school, it is actually on school 
grounds. The school has had to be closed as a result of this. I 
know that this is not your portfolio at the Department of 
Energy, but you do work for the Department of Energy. So I just 
want to register, once again, my displeasure at the fact that 
the parents and teachers at this school cannot get any answers 
from the Department of Energy. I can't get any answers from the 
Department of Energy. I can't get any answers from the Army 
Corps, and currently, the Department of Energy and the Army 
Corps of Engineers are each blaming each other for this 
situation, which is decades in the making. And as a result, 
these school kids, who knows what they have been exposed to, 
and they can't go to school at this location.
    So I am just pointing this out, once again, and you can 
take this message back that I am serious about this. I have 
written to the President about it. I need him to get his 
Administration into line. I don't care whose jurisdiction is 
what--this, that, or the other. I want this fixed for these 
school kids, and until we get some answers here, and frankly, 
some justice for these school kids, I am going to hold every 
nomination at the Department of Energy. And I have done this 
before. We have been down this road before. And I will do it as 
long as it takes. I want to be on the record. I want to be 
crystal clear about this. I will do this as long as it takes 
until we get some fidelity for what happened to these school 
kids. And just because these kids and their parents are not 
big-time donors, doesn't mean that they can be ignored. And 
frankly, I am pretty mad about it, and I am tired of getting 
the run-around, and I am even more mad that they have gotten 
the run-around for years.
    So that is just--you can take that message back and say 
that Senator Hawley was not in a good mood.
    Let's talk a little bit about China, if we could. Just give 
me a sense, Dr. Huff, how reliant, to your knowledge, are U.S. 
nuclear power producers on Chinese suppliers, whether that is 
for the reactors themselves or for components? What's your 
sense of this?
    Dr. Huff. Yes, so it is increasing, certainly in the 
context of components, as you think about the amount of supply 
chain capability that China has. Their ability to supply 
components for nuclear reactors is increasing over time, but it 
is pretty limited, actually, in terms of the fuel, and it is 
actually possible that Mr. Dominguez might be better at 
describing this in terms of his own company, but----
    Senator Hawley. Go ahead, Mr. Dominguez, weigh in on this, 
if you would.
    Mr. Dominguez. I think Dr. Huff said it right. It is, 
compared to Russia, a relatively minor piece of the supply 
puzzle, as speaking principally for our company. Look, we are 
going to buy from everyone, and we have bought from everyone 
historically, certainly before this geopolitical event, just 
from a risk management perspective. So we have got a toe in the 
water in a lot of places, but China is a very small thing.
    Senator Hawley. Let me come back to you, Doctor, if I 
could. What steps is DOE taking to move our nuclear energy 
supply chains out of China so that we don't have any reliance 
on them?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you for this question. It is important to 
the Department of Energy that we diversify these supply chains. 
We have written a supply chain report, actually, on a number of 
different energy technologies, including advanced and small 
modular nuclear reactors that expands on what the bottlenecks 
are and where industry can contribute to increasing the 
robustness of those supply chains and which particular 
components are going to need more, you know, domestic and 
allied support. So I would refer you to that report, which is 
pretty great, actually.
    Senator Hawley. Let me ask you about espionage in this 
space. Beijing has said that it intends to double China's 
nuclear power capacity by 2035. We know that they have used--
they meaning Beijing--has used economic espionage to advance 
all aspects of its industrial agenda over decades now and have 
had, sadly, quite a bit of success at using espionage to do 
that. Are you aware of Chinese intelligence services targeting 
employees or others in the U.S. nuclear industry for purposes 
of gathering intelligence that Beijing that can then use for 
their own goals?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you, Senator. I take classified information 
very seriously, and I would refer you to our intelligence 
colleagues and maybe in a more classified setting for some of 
this specific information, but I will say the following--that 
it is certainly the case that the United States has indicted 
one Chinese company in relation to this a couple years ago.
    Senator Hawley. Great. Well, my time is expired. I have got 
a couple more questions for you along these lines for the 
record and I will give them to you there.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank all of 
you for spending time with us today. I appreciate your 
testimony.
    Dr. Huff, let me start with you. So much of today's 
conversation is focused on how the nuclear fuel cycle supports 
commercial reactors, but it also supports reactors for 
research, for education. Small research reactors are, I think, 
a big part of the U.S. infrastructure, supporting numerous 
scientific disciplines. Our CHIPS and Science Act passed last 
Congress. That anticipates more investment in this capacity. 
Some of these research reactors are held by federal agencies 
other than DOE--by university partners. One example is the U.S. 
Geological Survey research reactor in Colorado, which is 
operated in conjunction with the Colorado School of Mines. As a 
former geologist, I take this all very close--I hold it very 
closely.
    How can the Department of Energy ensure effective 
coordination with other agencies to ensure the most intelligent 
deployment of resources to meet the national need for research 
and workforce?
    Dr. Huff. I am so grateful for this question. This is in an 
area really close to my heart, as a former professor. I know 
personally students and faculty at the Colorado School of Mines 
that leverage the reactor you are talking about. It is 
absolutely essential, and is part of my office's university 
programs, to support those reactors through fuel provision and 
through infrastructure support. Now, within that, you know, 
universities and such have an opportunity to ask for 
infrastructure support to upgrade their capabilities, to 
digitize their control systems, et cetera, and it's critical 
for our students and for our workforce to have hands-on 
experience with a reactor before they go work for Mr. Dominguez 
at a really big commercial-scale plant.
    And so, in our University Programs Office, we are 
constantly engaging with the TRTR committee, the Test Research 
Reactor Committee that operates these reactors to get more 
information about what they need and what should the future be 
of, perhaps, future reactors.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great, thank you.
    Dr. Wagner, you talked about how your laboratory can inform 
policy debates on the technology for interim storage, 
geological disposal and certainly, the eventual resolution of 
these longstanding debates is going to require Congressional 
action to create a consent-based nuclear waste management 
framework. Obviously, and I think it is not just me that would 
think this, the key is going to be an informed community. 
Senator Cortez Masto has already talked about the importance of 
that. How might your laboratory's technology development and 
outreach be helpful to a community that might be considering 
hosting a facility, and how should that be reflected in the 
framework?
    Dr. Wagner. So first of all, thank you for that question. 
As Dr. Huff mentioned, the Department is actively processing 
grant proposals for helping communities do just that. That 
being to understand the technologies and the issues around 
spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation and ultimate 
disposal. And then, we can be a resource to any of those 
communities through those grants or otherwise for such 
information, but we would work in coordination with the 
Department of Energy.
    Having said that, one of the things that we do is, as the 
nuclear energy laboratory, all the time, is to try to help 
people understand questions that they have about nuclear 
energy, about spent nuclear fuel, about recycling, you know, 
whatever is on their minds. So on our own, we frequently host 
town-hall type sessions in communities to do just that as well. 
So I can see an opportunity and a need to expand that even 
further.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. I think it is going to be one of 
the real keys of resolving this, is making sure that we have 
much, much more outreach, and well-structured outreach so it 
really connects with people.
    Dr. Huff, again, I understand spent fuel is being stored 
safely at sites today, and you said the Department is working 
under existing authorities to make progress on federal interim 
storage facilities. You mentioned further constraints that need 
to be addressed before DOE can construct and operate a federal 
interim facility. What are the constraints that need to be 
addressed? What should we be working on?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you, Senator. I really appreciate that.
    The Nuclear Waste Policy Act currently links the siting of 
a final repository with the construction of an interim storage 
facility. And so, in order to actually construct an interim 
storage facility, one may need to reevaluate that linkage. Now, 
I recognize that it is critically important that an interim 
storage facility not become the de facto permanent repository. 
And so that is the motivation that led to that linkage. 
However, right now, of course, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
also identifies the final repository as Yucca Mountain, which, 
I think you have heard, you know, is not politically feasible 
and we do not need to continue to move forward that way.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Certainly not popular.
    Dr. Huff. There you go.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it. All right. Point made. Thank 
you. I appreciate it. I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
the hearing this morning as we are talking about our nuclear 
fuel cycle. Sometimes I get people looking at me a little bit 
quizzically, like why would an Alaskan Senator really be caring 
about nuclear. We do oil. We do gas. We do coal. We do 
everything else--wind, solar, everything out there. We have 
tried a little bit with nuclear, but the reality is that given 
our geography, given our small size, and given our challenges 
in accessing our own energy resources, we are looking with 
great, great interest to the small modular reactor, the 
advanced reactor concepts. And so this is something that when I 
am going to speak to the state legislature, people want to know 
when are these going to be commercial? They are excited about 
it in ways that you can't even imagine. Small villages that are 
currently dependent on diesel-powered generation are looking to 
the small modular reactor for that energy lifeline.
    And so there is great interest, not only in villages, but 
remote resource projects where you have extraordinary 
resource--maybe it is mineral wealth--but what you don't have 
is any means to power your facility there short of barging in 
diesel up the river at extraordinary cost, and just not the way 
of the future. So we are very, very, very keenly interested in 
it, and the promise of advanced reactors, of course, is set to 
be realized in the state. We have the Department of Defense and 
DOE who chose Eielson Air Force Base to pilot a program there 
to increase resilience in DOD buildings. So there is going to 
be one microreactor by the end of 2027. So that is coming 
online sooner. DOD released their RFP in September of last year 
to supply one microreactor. It's on schedule, we understand to 
select a vendor, begin the permitting and the licensing process 
later this year.
    But again, when you think about the nexus between energy 
security and national security, it's right here. It's right 
now. The microreactor will supplement the current energy 
sources as a redundant resilience measure, which they really 
need in the interior there. But it's a big deal for the 
military to ensure that operational capacity. So there is a lot 
of interest in this.
    So I am going to ask a question to you, Dr. Wagner, and 
then to you, Dr. Huff, on the advanced reactor. Idaho National 
Lab is also in the process, again, of the Advanced Reactor 
Demonstration Project. You have a small modular reactor with 
six modules planned for deployment. You indicated that by 2029, 
it will achieve first commercial operation. Can you share with 
the Committee how the permitting and the licensing is 
proceeding for this and what more we can do to improve the 
process out there because, again, there is a great deal of 
interest, but 2029, 2030, sounds like a long ways off. Do you 
think these timelines are reasonable?
    Dr. Wagner. There are several questions there.
    Senator Murkowski. There are.
    Dr. Wagner. First of all, thank you for the questions, and 
I am very excited about what is happening in Alaska. I have had 
the opportunity to visit your state and actually to talk to 
representatives from different communities up there, 
particularly remote communities that are very reliant on the 
diesel fuel situation that you articulated. And also, this 
gives me an opportunity to maybe elaborate a little bit on the 
question about SMR timelines. So I specifically responded to 
that question in the context of what I consider small modular 
reactors. Small modular reactors, I consider in the order of a 
few hundred megawatts. So it's the X-energy technology, for 
example. It's part of the ARDP. It's the TerraPower, also part 
of the ARDP. It's the NuScale reactor, which will be deployed 
by UAMPS. GE also has a boiling water SMR, so it's in that size 
range that I was referring to that timeline, to be clear.
    At the laboratory, we are working with several different 
partners, including the Department of Defense, to demonstrate 
several reactors this decade, before that 2029 date that I 
mentioned. The ones coming before that, in particular, are what 
we call microreactors. So anywhere from several hundred 
kilowatts in size, to maybe ten or a little bit more megawatts 
in size, and the kind of microreactors, I think, that you are 
referring to.
    We do intend to have three new microreactors demonstrated 
on our site by 2025--I will say 2026, at the latest. And those 
are going to be DOE-authorized. We are a DOE laboratory, and so 
there is a different authorization process for that, and they 
are smaller systems than say a gigawatt-scale system that my 
colleague here operates, so we can move at a much faster pace. 
I would expect NRC-regulated microreactors to be operational 
in, say--and I am approximating here, these are commercial 
schedules--2026 to beyond. That kind of timeframe is what I 
would expect.
    I do think there are opportunities within the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission to accelerate the time it takes to 
license these systems and I would welcome further dialogue on 
that.
    Senator Murkowski. I think we are all interested in that.
    Mr. Chairman, I am over my limit, but can I just ask one 
quick question to Dr. Huff?
    The Chairman. Absolutely.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you.
    And this, also, is staying on the topic of advanced 
reactors, but you had mentioned in your written testimony that 
advanced reactor fuels have several advantages over standard 
light-water reactor fuel forms, but that safely and securely 
storing the waste needs to be more fully studied, is what you 
have shared. Can you, very quickly, given the generosity that 
has been provided here with me for time, share some of the 
advantages and the challenges on both the front and the back 
end when we are talking about advanced nuclear?
    Dr. Huff. Certainly. Many advanced nuclear fuels can reach 
extremely high temperatures, like tri-structural isotropic 
fuels, which have silicon carbide spheres around the kernels of 
fuel, keeping them, you know, at robust to extremely high 
temperatures, well beyond the temperatures of lava or the sun. 
I mean, this is a real advantage right, because it is well 
beyond what you would expect in the temperatures of a reactor 
loss of coolant accident or anything like that.
    They also have efficiency improvements, you know, with 
high-assay low-enriched uranium, you can be much more space 
efficient with the size of your reactor, which is why we are 
seeing a number of small modular advanced reactor designs 
leveraging that higher assay enrichment. And generally 
speaking, when we talk about the spent fuel question, we have 
stored, managed, and safely contained spent nuclear fuel from a 
variety of nuclear reactors, including high-temperature gas 
reactors and sodium-cooled fast reactors, all the kind of 
classes of spent nuclear fuel that we expect to see for this 
new set of advanced commercial reactors, but for every type of 
new fuel there is certainly a little bit of extra attention 
that one needs to pay to make sure that every package is fully 
certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the fullest 
extent for those particular fuel characteristics. And so we are 
ready to support those analyses at national labs like John's.
    Senator Murkowski. Very good.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for the extra time.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    We are going start our second round while we wait for 
Senator Hoeven, and I am going to defer and go right to Senator 
King.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    I appreciate Senator Murkowski's question and I just want 
to point a fine point on it. Is the delay--whatever it is, 
whether it is three years, six years, eight years, ten years--
in commercializing this technology technological or permitting?
    Dr. Wagner. So----
    Senator King. In other words, could one be built tomorrow? 
Is the technology settled? Is the design--are there completed 
designs that are shovel-ready, if you will?
    Dr. Wagner. So the most important thing that affects a 
schedule is to get approval from the safety authority.
    Senator King. So that is permitting.
    Dr. Wagner. Yes, we usually refer to it as licensing, but 
yes, it is permitting, and for a commercial project that wants 
to put power on the grid, that has to go through the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, and that does take, you know, a 
significant period of time. So even if the design is 100 
percent set, which usually through a licensing process there 
are, you know, there are things that change to some degree, you 
still have to go through that licensing process and also, we 
haven't talked as much about it--work through the supply chain 
issues with actually building and demonstrating the reactor.
    Senator King. Well, no one wants to short-circuit the 
safety process. On the other hand, it is a question of how long 
does it take? Eisenhower retook Europe in 11 months. Pretty 
complicated challenge. So I just hope that is something--I 
would like to follow up, Mr. Chairman, about the timing of the 
permitting process and how long that takes.
    Second question, I just wanted to follow up, Mr. Dominguez. 
You mentioned that the U.S. nuclear industry has taken account 
of what is happening at Zaporizhzhia already. Does that mean 
that every nuclear plant has onsite fuel storage and diesel 
generators that would support its operation if there is a 
transformer taken out or a high-KV line is taken out?
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes, but Senator, I am glad you came back to 
the issue because the Zaporizhzhia example does give me a 
little bit of pause because what we are talking about here is a 
weather event or a grid emergency that prevents the ability to 
bring on energy from the grid for days.
    Senator King. Right.
    Mr. Dominguez. What they are facing there is, of course, 
exponentially more challenging, the destruction of the grid, 
repairs of which could take many weeks. So I don't want to 
overstate the point. What we have done is a risk analysis for a 
multi-day event where you don't have offsite power, and all of 
the stations in the U.S., to my knowledge, are capable of 
dealing with those emergencies. That is more similar to 
Fukushima, frankly, than what is going on in the Ukraine, which 
is unparalleled.
    To the extent you are asking the question of whether or not 
we have taken the next step, and kind of tried to imagine that 
sort of event occurring where is there is a military attack on 
the grid that takes it out, or a cyberattack that takes it out 
for multiple weeks, I wouldn't say the protection would last 
that long, nor do we see the risk profile the same way, 
obviously, as the Ukrainians are facing.
    Senator King. Well, if there is anything we have learned 
over the last 20 years, it is that we have to think the 
unthinkable. September 11th was a failure of imagination on our 
part as to what the risk was. So this is one where we are 
seeing it happen in real life. I hope the industry will take 
cognizance of this because in case of a conflict, and even 
short of a conflict, a cyberattack on the grid is likely to be 
one of the first steps. So I hope that is something that the 
industry will take account of.
    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks, Mr. Chairman, just a couple 
of quick questions.
    Dr. Huff, you know, you led the Department's efforts to 
ensure domestic supply of uranium for existing and advanced 
reactors and you are in a leadership role there. This includes 
having the Department buy uranium. How are we going to ensure 
the Department's efforts won't compete with utilities, which 
also need domestic uranium to eliminate their own reliance on 
Russia?
    Dr. Huff. Yes, so our intent is to buy and then 
redistribute to those commercial interests, so you know, 
utilities in need of that fuel would be assured that fuel 
supply through our purchases, but we would not be amassing it 
over time, but rather making it available.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you.
    And then, Mr. Dominguez, the Nuclear Energy Institute says 
that it supports Yucca Mountain as the nation's first 
repository site. The Nuclear Energy Institute believes that we 
need to reach a decision on Yucca Mountain. Why is it important 
for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reach a decision on 
the Yucca Mountain license application?
    Mr. Dominguez. The industry's view is that we need to get 
through a licensing process, even if, ultimately, that site is 
never used, that it is important to exercise this muscle and to 
make sure we get through the licensing process, recognizing the 
strong opposition, frankly, to Yucca and the reality that it 
may never be used.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I am happy to follow up on that.
    The Chairman. Let's go. You go, girl. You go.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cortez Masto. Because, as we all know, short of 
licensing, there could be legislation that outlaws or does away 
with a failed site that obviously is not moving forward, that 
actually puts us on a path to address this waste. Isn't that 
correct, Mr. Dominguez?
    Mr. Dominguez. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Yes. So there is an option, and 
obviously there is a role for us in Congress to play and we 
should just be paying attention to it. Listen, we have been 
living in the past for a long time now. Let's start moving 
forward, including bringing our laws with us, and that is the 
consent-based siting. There is an opportunity here for all of 
us, including the nuclear industry, to move forward. Don't you 
think?
    Mr. Dominguez. I should hope so.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Yes.
    Mr. Dominguez. To your point, it has been talked about for 
quite some time. It is time to get to the finish line.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I agree.
    While I have an opportunity, Assistant Secretary Huff, 
there are experts that have recommended taking the Civil 
Nuclear Waste Program out of DOE. And I believe when we talked 
last time, in December, I had asked you about whether the 
Administration had taken a position on that. And I am just 
curious, has there been discussion about a new waste management 
organization since then or is that off the table?
    Dr. Huff. Thank you for this question. Yes, it is certainly 
the case that the Blue Ribbon Commission recommendations 
include a new nuclear waste management organization that would 
have a more fulsome capability to control the fund. I think 
that does have significant merit. It is a constant topic of 
conversation internal to my office because as we explore the 
full universe of options that a consent-based siting process 
for interim storage--it would result in, sort of, informing 
that permanent storage capability. We expect that this will be 
definitely on the table and in those conversations, and I think 
it has some merit, yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And then finally, going back to Senator Heinrich's 
conversation about the definition of advanced nuclear 
technology, I have heard here micro, but also small, but is it 
an industry term or do we need in Congress to be defining this 
so others are not having the ability to abuse it somehow based 
on the conversations that we have had this morning? I am just 
curious and I don't know if anybody wants to take a stab at 
that.
    Dr. Wagner. I will throw in with an opinion. The industry 
does have working definitions for what is a microreactor. I 
think the common definition, there may be some variations, just 
to be clear, but I think the common definition is up to 20 
megawatts. And then small modular reactors are kind of above 
that, up to several hundred megawatts. I think at one point the 
definition might have been up to 600 megawatts. And then, the 
traditional gigawatt scales are the large reactors.
    Senator Cortez Masto. But you say the industry has defined 
it. So everybody is consistent and believes that? So that's a 
question--that we in Congress would just automatically use that 
definition?
    Mr. Dominguez. Senator, what I was saying--referring to 
earlier--it is a definition, but it is an incredibly broad one, 
right? We are really talking about over 20 megawatts, and up to 
500 or 600 megawatts is an enormous, you know, difference. I 
think it is less important, ultimately, the size from the 
commercial standpoint than the ability to manufacture the 
components in a production line in a way that is going to 
reduce the time to get these assets built. And while that is 
largely size-dependent, it is not entirely size-dependent.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.
    The Chairman. Well, let me just say thank you to all three 
of you. It has been tremendously informative and we 
appreciate--I think you can tell by the questions and the 
staying for the second round. I truly believe what we have been 
able to turn around in a very short period of time is the 
rational, responsible, reasonable thinking of what we are going 
to do as a nation, how we are going to deliver the dependable, 
reliable, affordable power we need and continue to do so.
    I have one idea. I said, you know, if we don't change the 
pricing structure basically in merchant markets, we should 
maybe think of creating a national nuclear market. A national 
nuclear market will basically--it would not subsidize but it 
would solidify the normal pricing, because if you are in one 
state, my state is a cost-reimbursed state. I have no nuclear. 
Other states that are in, like, let us say, Illinois, which is 
a merchant state, they have a hard time. They can't ramp up and 
down and compete. So that is the problem they are facing. We 
know that, but we have to have nuclear in the mix.
    One question I have--do you think 20 percent is the right 
mix for nuclear, or can it go higher?
    Anybody?
    Joe, you want to start?
    Mr. Dominguez. Well, look, I think it could certainly go 
higher.
    The Chairman. It stayed about 20. It has been about 20 for 
quite a while, right?
    Mr. Dominguez. It has been 20 for a long period of time.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Mr. Dominguez. But it's 20 percent of what, right?
    The Chairman. Exactly.
    Mr. Dominguez. We are talking about this energy 
transition----
    The Chairman. Right.
    Mr. Dominguez [continuing]. Where we are electrifying 
everything, light duty vehicles, everything. That pie is going 
to get bigger, so the 20 percent is going to be relatively 
larger. That is where SMRs play. In my view, the need for 
baseload power is far greater than 20 percent, and I think that 
has been demonstrated time and again. So if what you are really 
looking for is a zero-emission resource that is also baseload, 
start getting in your head replacing the percentage that coal 
and nuclear together historically occupied in the grid. That is 
really your target.
    The Chairman. Same question.
    Doctor.
    Dr. Wagner. I agree with that completely.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Dr. Huff. And I will just add that the President's 
``Pathways to Net Zero'' report that does some analysis on 
this, completely agrees with this assessment that the amount of 
clean, firm power needs to increase to completely fill what is 
currently, you know, all firm power.
    The Chairman. Yes, okay.
    Well, again, let me say thank you. I appreciate it very 
much.
    Members will have until the close of business tomorrow to 
submit any additional questions for the record.
     And with that, thank you, and the Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
