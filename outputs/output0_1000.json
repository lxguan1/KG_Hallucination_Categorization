This implies that the federal government's overreaching regulations, as represented by Mr. STAUBER, may be hindering the industry's ability to provide safe and environmentally prudent operations.\n\nPath 2 suggests that states are collaborating on issues such as ocean conservation, which implies that there is a willingness to work together to address environmental concerns. This could potentially lead to a streamlined process for federal government regulations, which would benefit the industry.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred with complete confidence that BOEM must continuously improve their ability to provide for safe and environmentally prudent operations, and that the industry would benefit from a streamlined process."

This implies that Mr. McCumber is a legitimate entity and that Nebraska is taking steps to ensure that he is legitimate.
