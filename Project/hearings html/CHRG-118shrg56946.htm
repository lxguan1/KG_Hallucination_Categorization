          OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN WHITEHOUSE \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Prepared statement of Chairman Whitehouse appears in the 
appendix on page 39.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Chairman Whitehouse. Good morning, everyone. The hearing of 
the Senate Budget Committee will come to order. We will be 
discussing this morning an issue of concern to all Americans, 
namely housing.
    Secure and affordable housing is a building block of 
financial well-being, being able to afford a home provides not 
just shelter, but community and stability. When families cannot 
afford housing, they face increased barriers to education and 
employment, they have worse physical and mental health 
outcomes, and they likely face generational poverty.
    Unfortunately, families across America for paying the price 
for a housing market failure that was years in the making. 
Nationwide, the U.S. faces a shortage of four to seven million 
housing units available for sale or rent, which of course 
drives up cost.
    Barriers to getting a mortgage are making it harder for 
first-time buyers to purchase a home. With fewer people able to 
purchase homes, demand in rental markets has soared, creating a 
shortage of available rental units, driving up costs. Helping 
families afford a safe, stable place to call home should be 
neither controversial nor partisan, and I will take a moment to 
recognize Ranking Member Grassley for his work in past years to 
do bipartisan housing work. And I thank him and congratulate 
him for that from the Finance Committee Chair.
    Key to addressing the shortage of units and bringing down 
costs for families is, as my friend Speaker Shekarchi from 
Rhode Island would say, production, production, production. 
When Speaker Shekarchi took the gavel in 2021, he promised to 
become the housing speaker, a promise he has more than kept.
    In just three years, he has shepherded over 30 bills into 
law to tackle Rhode Island's housing shortage. Coupled with 
historic budget investments, his legislation has addressed 
long-lagging housing production, expanded the state's housing 
supply and blunted upward pressure on rents and home purchase 
prices.
    Nationally, there is evidence we are turning the corner in 
communities across the country. New construction is way up. 
Home prices are coming down, and the Fed is finally cutting 
interest rates, as many of us have repeatedly urged them to do, 
and that makes mortgages more affordable.
    Construction of multi-family housing developments increased 
22 percent in 2023, the highest annual increase in more than 
three decades. The pace of single family homebuilding climbed 
steadily throughout 2023, and has stayed elevated. Vacancy 
rates in professionally managed apartments rose to nearly six 
percent this year, more than twice the record low of 2.5 
percent set in early 2022, which in turn stabilizes the rental 
market.
    This is thanks in large part to important steps Congress 
and the Biden-Harris administration have taken to increase the 
housings supply, to protect renters and to ease cost burdens. 
More than $18 billion of the American Rescue Plan's state and 
local fiscal recovery funds have gone towards expanding housing 
supply, investing in homeless services and providing nearly 
four million additional households with rent, mortgage and 
utility relief.
    Senate appropriators, Chairman Murray present, continue to 
support housing programs like the home investment partnerships, 
community development block grants and housing choice vouchers. 
Last week, the Congressional Budget Office released a report on 
long-term projections for new housing starts, finding that the 
housing shortage will persist unless policymakers take decisive 
action.
    Yesterday, I introduced new legislation to significantly 
expand our nation's supply of affordable housing by bolstering 
the low income housing tax credit. The Affordable Housing 
Construction Act would more than triple states' funding for 
affordable housing under the program, loosen financing 
requirements and extend the period during which housing must 
stay affordable.
    With Congressman Panetta and Blumenauer, I have also 
introduced a $15,000 first time homebuyer's tax credit for 
lower income Americans, refundable, advanceable and available 
for homebuyers at the time of purchase, to help make home 
ownership a reality for more families. I thank Vice President 
Harris for her pledge of a $25,000 similar credit.
    Other proposals to make housing more affordable include 
Senator Wyden's Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing for all (DASH) 
Act, Senator Van Hollen's bipartisan Family Stability and 
Opportunity Vouchers Act, the Fair Housing Improvement Act led 
by Senators Kaine and Sanders, the Delivering Essential 
Protection, Opportunity, and Security for Tenants (DEPOSIT) Act 
led by Senators Luhan and Padilla, and Senator Padilla's 
Housing For All Act. We have a busy Budget Committee on the 
subject.
    Vice President Harris also called for the construction of 
three million new housing units through historic expansion of 
the low income housing tax credit. Today's witnesses will 
hopefully point the way towards creative solutions to our 
nation's housing shortage. One thing we know for certain is 
that inaction is not an option.
    As I turn to our Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, let me 
welcome Senator Reed, who has joined us. When it comes time for 
witness introductions, he will be helping with the introduction 
of our very dear friend, Speaker Shekarchi, and I want to thank 
the Committee for allowing Jack to participate in that. He will 
be staying through the Speaker's testimony, I understand. 
Chuck, over to you.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears in the appendix 
on page 41.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Grassley. I appreciate your calling of today's 
hearing on housing affordability. It is an issue that is 
central for Iowans and all Americans, something they care about 
deeply. It is very central to what both Republicans and 
Democrats call the American Dream. Over the past four years, 
Americans saw home prices and particularly rents skyrocket, as 
inflation ran rampant, thanks to the policies of this 
administration.
    Thanks to Bidenflation, prices throughout the economy are 
up 20 percent since the start of administration. Even worse, 
housing prices have skyrocketed nearly 40 percent, and are 
currently at an all-time high according to Case-Shiller Home 
Price Index. Inflation has thankfully eased over the past year, 
largely due to action taken by the Fed.
    But that should not be used as an excuse to once again open 
up the spending spigot, risking further inflation.
    Unfortunately, that is exactly what some of the proposals 
out there do, and I refer particularly to Vice President 
Harris, touting the advocacy of hundreds of billions of dollars 
in demand-inducing housing subsidies.
    Economists from across the political spectrum have noted 
how such policies would backfire by pushing up housing prices 
even further. Ed Pinto, who I have invited to testify, is going 
to quantify exactly how Vice President Harris' policies will 
make housing less affordable. In addition to calling for more 
subsidies, the Vice President has also touted plans to 
implement a version of rent control.
    Rent control policies have been disastrous at the state and 
local levels, and it would be a huge mistake to adopt them at 
the federal level. And that is not just this Senator's point of 
view. We have Jason Furman, who served as President Obama's 
chief economist, panned Harris' proposal saying ``rent control 
has been about as disgraced as any economic policy in the 
toolkit. The idea that we would be reviving and expanding it 
will ultimately make our housing supply problems worse, not 
better.''
    Before we add new housing programs or expand existing ones, 
we should have a good look at the ones we already have 
currently. There are more than 100 federal housing programs. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal 
government will spend over $750 billion over the next ten years 
in housing assistance alone, and that does not include billions 
in additional housing programs and federal loan subsidies for 
mortgages provided by government agencies, which would include 
at least the Department of Agriculture, Defense and Veterans 
Affairs.
    On top of that, the Tax Code includes incentives for home 
ownership, and the construction of low income housing, and the 
Chairman has referred to my efforts in that category. Instead 
of adding to the list of federal housing programs, Congress 
should focus on increasing the effectiveness of existing 
policies by eliminating duplication and complexity.
    That is why at this Committee's previous housing hearing, I 
invited Bill Slover to testify. Mr. Slover provided a firsthand 
account of waste and inefficiency presently in our housing 
programs. Moreover, he highlighted the lack of accountability 
in the state housing agencies. Mr. Slover's testimony was 
consistent with what I have discovered as part of my oversight 
work.
    For decades, I have conducted oversight of the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development and local housing agencies, 
and during that investigation we were able to expose rampant 
waste, fraud and abuse. Too often government overpays for 
poorly executed policies, and the maze of housing programs 
create inefficiencies.
    And what I just said about my investigations applied to 
both Republican and Democrat administrations, not properly 
supervising from the federal level the oversight that they 
should have on these, because I found that the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) does very little, if any 
oversight of housing authorities.
    So they get away with lavish office spending on salaries, 
vehicles, parties and travel. Meanwhile, those less fortunate 
wait in line sometimes for years for actual housing assistance.
    So we should be focusing on forcing HUD to do its job, but 
the majority is not doing that while HUD fritters away tons of 
taxpayer money. I also welcome Jack Salmon, who will refocus 
the debate on this Committee's fiscal policies with deficit, 
debt and interest expenses. I am sure the administration is 
counting on the Fed's recent interest rate cut to lower housing 
costs.
    However, interest rates are but one of a host of factors 
driving housing costs. Moreover, lower interest rates may be 
fleeting if we do not do our job to rein in unprecedented debt 
and deficits. Thank you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much. Speaker Shekarchi 
and I came into politics together as young staffers for 
Governor Bruce Sundlun, a crucible experience that forged 
lasting friendships. So I am personally thrilled to have him 
here today. Senator Reed, the senior senator in our delegation, 
will introduce him.
    But as he does, let me point out that Jack has a position 
on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing 
and Urban Development, and he is also the senior Democrat on 
the Banking Committee, which has authority over housing, and 
his work on housing has earned him, I think every housing award 
that housing organizations give around here, some of them 
twice. So he knows whereof he speaks, and over to you, Senator 
Reed.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR REED

    Senator Reed. Well, thank you very much, Chairman 
Whitehouse and thank you for your kind words. I am proud to 
join you today to welcome and introduce the Committee's first 
witness, Rhode Island Speaker of the House Joe Shekarchi.
    When I first met Joe over 30-years ago, he was a fresh-
faced lawyer at the very beginning of his career. But his 
intelligence and extreme competence were evident even then. 
Across the past three decades, Joe has become a respected 
member of the Rhode Island Bar, and a dedicated servant to 
hometown of Warwick, Rhode Island.
    In 2012, Joe was elected to the Rhode Island State House of 
Representatives, and in 2021, his colleagues selected him to be 
their Speaker. Joe's accomplishments as Speaker are numerous, 
passing tax cuts for small businesses and families, enacting an 
historic pay equity law, and bringing thousands of new jobs to 
Rhode Island.
    But nowhere has his work been more impactful or important 
than his efforts on housing. Indeed, when Joe became Speaker, 
he quickly focused on the significant housing shortage that was 
making housing unaffordable in Rhode Island. He understood that 
for over a decade, we had been underbuilding in Rhode Island. 
In fact, we were last in the country.
    With far too few homes available, the costs were far in 
excess of what the family or any family could afford. Joe 
tackled Rhode Island's crisis head on. In less than four years 
as Speaker, working collaboratively with state leaders and 
various stakeholders, he has guided nearly 50-50 housing bills 
into law.
    These include our state's first ever dedicated annual 
funding stream for affordable housing, creating a new cabinet 
level position for a Secretary of Housing, and new investments 
totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in housing supply and 
assistance. Each of these successes, on their own, would have 
been one of the state's most important housing accomplishments 
in recent memory.
    Collectively, they are a giant leap toward ensuring every 
Rhode Island family can afford a safe, comfortable home. I'm 
glad we have Joe leading the charge for greater housing 
affordability in Rhode Island, and I'm very glad that Chairman 
Whitehouse has invited him to be here today, to share his deep 
insights and experience on housing policy with us and our 
colleagues.
    Once again thank you, Senator Whitehouse, not only for your 
kind invitation but for your great leadership.
    Thank you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much Senator Reed. Our 
second witness is Mr. Paul Williams, the founder and Executive 
Director of the Center for Public Enterprise, an organization 
focused on broadening public sector economic development 
capacity, particularly in housing. His organization provides 
technical assistance and guidance to state housing finance 
agencies across the country. Welcome, Mr. Williams.
    And our next witness will be introduced by our esteemed 
colleague from Virginia, Senator Tim Kaine, whose timing is 
near perfect. Senator Kaine.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Ranking Member 
Grassley and thanks to all the witnesses for being here. I am 
very honored to introduce a long-time friend and neighbor, an 
admirable Richmonder and Virginian, Greta Harris. Greta is the 
president and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Better 
Housing Coalition (BHC), and she's the pride of Danville, 
Virginia.
    And then after getting a degree in Architecture at Virginia 
Tech and then graduate studies in Architecture and Urban 
Planning at Columbia, has become a passionate and successful 
advocate for affordable housing for a very long time. She 
served as vice president of an organization called the Local 
Initiative Support Corporation, which is a national non-profit 
that works in community and economic development. She led 
many--well, she led local offices in both southern and 
midwestern regions, and then she began her tenure as the CEO 
and president of the Better Housing Coalition in 2013.
    Greta's impact on the BHC and affordable housing in the 
Richmond region has been absolutely remarkable, and her 
leadership has positioned the BHC to realize the same success 
in five years as it had over the previous 30-years combined. 
BHC is the largest non-profit provider--non-profit development 
corporation in Richmond, and they create high quality homes for 
low and moderate income residents, empowering them to reach 
their fullest potential.
    Many of these homes are created in neighborhoods that I 
used to represent back in my time as a City Councilperson, and 
I have seen firsthand the tangible impact that Greta has had. 
The organization's portfolio includes an array of multi-family 
rental communities, rental units, single family homes.
    Its services support 1,100 residents a year, and I am proud 
to have secured funding for two of HBC's upcoming affordable 
multi-family projects through the Congressionally directed 
spending process. I acknowledge the head of the Appropriations 
Committee as I comment upon that. That has been really great 
work.
    For over two decades, Greta has been a true champion of 
affordable and accessible housing. She has won every award that 
anybody in Richmond gives. She is on numerous boards and has 
been a true success. So I am super-happy that Greta is able to 
be here today. And with that Mr. Chair, I will yield back.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Senator Kaine. I 
will now turn to my distinguished Ranking Member to introduce 
his witnesses.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Ed Pinto, a Senior Fellow and Co-
Director of the Housing Center at the American Enterprise 
Institute (AEI). A focus of his work continues to be the role 
of federal housing policy and how it continues to create 
unwelcome distortions on the housing market.
    More recently, his research has focused on using light 
touch density to increase the supply of naturally affordable 
and inclusionary housing. Before joining AEI, Mr. Pinto was the 
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer for Fannie 
Mae until the late 1980's.
    Our final witness, Mr. Jack Salmon, Director of Public 
Policy of the Philanthropy Roundtable. His work focuses on 
research, commentary and analysis of issues facing charitable 
sector and philanthropic freedom. Prior to joining the 
Roundtable, Mr. Salmon served as program manager and researcher 
at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he 
oversaw policy relating to budgets, taxation, institution and 
economic policy. We welcome both of you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. And with that Mr. Speaker, you are 
recognized for five minutes, and your full statement will be 
made a part of the Committee record.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH SHEKARCHI, SPEAKER, RHODE ISLAND HOUSE 
                     OF REPRESENTATIVES \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Prepared statement of Hon. Shekarchi appears in the appendix on 
page 44.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Speaker Shekarchi. Good morning. Thank you, Senate Budget 
Committee Chair Senate Whitehouse, for inviting me to speak 
before you today, and thank you Senator Reed for the kind 
introduction. Thank you also to Ranking Member Senator 
Grassley, as well as all the distinguished Senate Budget 
Committee members.
    I appreciate all of you taking the time to consider this 
critical issue, housing. My name is Joseph Shekarchi, and I am 
the Speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, and I 
am passionate about housing. Serving the legislature of a small 
state is very hands-on. You become deeply aware of the wide 
variety of complex problems that your constituents face.
    You eventually realize that many of the solutions to these 
problems are tightly interwoven and interconnected. During my 
time in the legislature, I have recognized a fundamental truth. 
Housing is the core issue. In fact, the housing crisis 
complicates almost all other challenges facing our communities.
    If we do not solve the housing crisis, how can we improve 
our educational outcomes or shore up the job market? How can we 
ensure a proper health care workforce, grow our economy or lift 
our families out of poverty? Very simply we can do all the 
policy programming we want, but if a child does not have a safe 
place to sleep at night, what does it all mean?
    When I became Speaker in 2021, I pledged to make housing my 
top priority. Let me quickly paint Rhode Island housing picture 
for you. Rhode Island is the smallest state in the nation, but 
we are very densely populated, with just over one million 
residents living in about 1,500 square miles of land.
    We have some of the oldest housing stock in the country, 
and for too many years, Rhode Island has ranked dead last in 
the nation for new housing starts. The price of a single family 
home in Rhode Island has nearly doubled in five years. In 2019, 
the median home price in Rhode Island was about $250,000. This 
year, the median price is $494,000.
    These factors have created a perfect storm, bringing us to 
where we are now, in the midst of a severe housing shortage. It 
took many years to get where we are, and I am acutely aware of 
the scale and duration of effort required to get to a remedy. 
Rhode Island is not standing still. I am passionate about 
housing, and I have made it my top legislative priority.
    Over the last four years, working with my colleagues in 
state government, we have passed almost 50 new housing laws. As 
a foundation to our legislative work, we have created two year-
round study commissions comprised of legislators, housing 
advocates, planners, builders and other stakeholders. The work 
of these commissions have shaped much of our legislation.
    We are listening to the experts, following the data and 
making real sustained progress. I am incredibly proud that each 
of the four comprehensive packages of housing legislation that 
we have passed in Rhode Island have enjoyed strong bipartisan 
support. In terms of our legislative housing policy, my mantra 
has been production, production and more production.
    The legislation we have passed has focused on reducing 
barriers to development, eliminating red tape and redundancy. 
With the goal of increasing housing production, we have created 
the first ever permanent revenue stream for housing, 
development of affordable housing.
    We have created and committed funding to a new cabinet 
level position of Secretary of Housing, as well as a new 
Department of Housing to coordinate our focus and our efforts. 
We created a dedicated court calendar for housing appeals. 
Developers complained that many communities were using the 
appeals process as a stalling mechanism. For developers, time 
is money. Cases were being delayed indefinitely, sometimes for 
years.
    Reducing the backlog of pending appeals has already had a 
significant impact. We are not changing the rules for 
development. We are making the process clearer, more consistent 
and more streamlined. We are also looking to new and innovative 
solutions. We passed legislation making it easier for 
homeowners to develop Accessory Dwelling Units or ADUs, also 
known as in-law apartments.
    ADUs are a great option for seniors wishing to age in 
place, for recent graduates looking for cost-effective housing, 
and for the disabled to live independently but in proximity to 
family members. ADUs offer gentle density by adding housing 
units to existing blueprints without changing the character of 
a neighborhood.
    Rhode Island's legislation allows ADUs by right when 
meeting certain requirements, eliminating zoning approval and 
saving additional costs. I am incredibly proud of this 
legislation, which was a top priority of AARP nationally. Like 
ADUs, manufactured housing is also another option with lesser 
lead time and lower cost.
    Rhode Island passed legislation to expand land available 
for siting of manufactured homes. I am also intrigued and 
curious about the Montgomery County, Maryland model for public 
housing. We have invited Maryland officials to present before 
our commissions, and we are working to determine how that model 
could work here. Additionally, we have proposed $10 million for 
a pilot program. Rhode Island has enacted a first time 
homebuyer program, which has funded using state fiscal recovery 
funds and including assistance for down payment.
    It has been a huge success, resulting in participation of 
1,672 homebuyers in Rhode Island, 46 percent of whom are 
minorities and 47 percent are female-headed households. Housing 
issues are not unique to Rhode Island. At a recent National 
Governors meeting, every single state listed housing as a top 
issue, and HUD estimates that the national shortage of housing 
units is more than six million homes.
    There are many misunderstandings about what affordable 
housing is and what it looks like. Housing is considered 
affordable when it comes--costs no more than 30 percent of an 
individual's family gross income. When housing prices soar, 
people at the lower end of the economic spectrum are 
disproportionately impacted.
    The reality today is that working families are priced out 
of the housing market, not just for home ownership but also for 
renting. In Rhode Island, a household earning our state's 
median income of $74,000 would not be able to buy an affordable 
house in any of our cities and towns.
    These families include our teachers, nurses, firefighters, 
health care aides. These workers are the backbone of our 
community, and they should be able to afford to live in the 
communities they serve. I respectfully request that Congress 
provide states with greater funding mechanisms and grant 
opportunities to develop more housing to foster public-private 
partnerships.
    I would like to see further expansion of financial 
assistance for renters like rental vouchers, as well as a down 
payment support for first time homebuyers. Senator Whitehouse's 
proposed legislation, the Affordable Housing Construction Act 
of 2024, would leverage federal tax credits to encourage 
investment in housing.
    Rhode Island's small size makes us the ideal partner for 
the federal government on housing issues. We are a nimble 
state. We have shown that we can quickly move on housing 
legislation. I come before you because we are ready in Rhode 
Island to act on this offer. We could become an incubator to 
pilot innovative, creative housing programs with the federal 
government.
    As long as I am in the Office of Speaker of the House, I 
pledge that affordable housing will continue to be a core 
mission for me. I will bring my unshakable passion for the 
development of a modern policy that ensures every Rhode 
Islander has reliable access and a safe place to live.
    I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration, and 
I would be happy to take any questions. Thank you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you Mr. Speaker for your many 
successes, and for being here today. Mr. Williams.

STATEMENT OF PAUL E. WILLIAMS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 
                CENTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISE \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Prepared statement of Mr. Williams appears in the appendix on 
page 48.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. Williams. Thank you Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member 
Grassley and Members of the Committee. As you know, housing 
affordability is critical for American families. Housing 
expenses are far and away the largest single item in most 
American households' budgets, taking up 20 percent, 30 percent 
or as high as 50 percent or more in severe cases of a family's 
household income.
    Ensuring that housing costs remain stable and affordable 
helps those families by giving them more flexibility to invest 
in other necessities, and also to save for the future.
    But housing affordability does not just help families. It 
also helps businesses thrive in the economy. When families have 
more income to spare, they can support more small businesses in 
their communities, and when more families can afford to live in 
a neighborhood, businesses have an easier time growing.
    To promote housing affordability across the country, 
consensus among policymakers, economists, developers and 
advocates is clear. We need more housing supply. Bringing new 
housing supply online requires addressing zoning and land use 
issues, streamlining permitting and easing financing 
constraints.
    My message to the Committee is that the federal government 
should help bring more stability to the housing investment 
cycle. Today, a lack of liquidity in the construction financing 
market has led to hundreds of thousands of would-be homes 
sitting on the shelf unbuilt.
    Let me begin by sharing with you a key statistic from the 
Census Construction Survey. From 2000 to 2020, there is an 
annual average of about 50,000 multi-family homes that were 
authorized or permitted but never started construction, as you 
can see to the chart to my right. Over the past several years, 
that figure has dramatically increased, reaching a peak of 
165,000 in early 2023, about three times more than the prior 
two decade average.
    Today, that figure still sits at about 131,000, more than 
double the prior average. In other words, there are hundreds of 
thousands of homes that have received their permits to build, 
but they have not started building. What is going on here? 
Construction financing. My organization, Center for Public 
Enterprise, works closely with public agencies across the 
country, including many of our state housing finance agencies.
    This summer, we described this issue in a report which I 
have included as an addendum with my testimony, and provided 
several strategies for addressing it, including by enabling 
federal instrumentalities to provide countercyclical support to 
construction financing. That is, a tool that can be active in 
difficult financing environments, and scale back when financing 
becomes more forthcoming in the market.
    A key issue in the way of more housing supply, in addition 
to zoning and permitting issues, is a lack of liquidity in 
housing construction finance. To give a pointed local example, 
in Massachusetts today there are more than 40,000 multi-family 
homes that have been permitted or authorized, but are stalled 
due to financing constraints.
    The permits are in place, the housing demand is there, 
rental vacancy rates are below four percent, but the financing 
challenge remains. At some points in the business cycle, when 
loan to cost ratios are higher and products like mezzanine 
financing are more readily available, this issue is not so 
predominant.
    But at other points in the business cycle, countercyclical 
tools are crucial to ensuring that these viable projects can 
move through the pipeline, create good jobs and create high 
quality homes for American families. One of the difficulties 
that a cyclical investment cycle creates for housing 
affordability is a difficult trap that hampers our ability to 
provide supply that matches demand over the long run.
    For many commodities like eggs or N-95 masks, a spike in 
consumer demand leads to producers making quick investments in 
new supply that can become available in a matter of weeks or 
months. Multi-family housing, on the other hand, takes not 
months but years to come online. From the time a housing demand 
spike begins to the time keys are in families' hands, often two 
or three years may have passed.
    In economic parlance, the supply response of housing, 
particularly multi-family housing, has significantly lagged 
relative to the demand events. This dynamic magnifies the 
already-existing boom and bust shape of a business cycle.
    If we are going to create the level of housing supply 
needed in the market to meet housing demand, we will need 
support of tools that can provide some smoothing to investment 
cycle, by providing construction financing liquidity throughout 
that cycle.
    There are many ways to structure this support. In fact, 
many of our nation's housing finance agencies have begun to 
implement small but scalable local solutions to this problem. 
Montgomery County, Maryland's Housing Opportunities Commission 
has a tool called the Housing Production Fund. Massachusetts 
recently created a tool called the Momentum Fund, and 
municipalities in Georgia and Tennessee, in partnership with 
our organization, have recently created local investment 
vehicles to provide similar support for multi-family 
development.
    To build on this local innovation across the country, 
policymakers could look to federal agencies that could support 
smoothing the housing investment cycle. The GSEs have a history 
of exploring construction financing tools, and could be 
authorized to create a new product that supports this type of 
financing in times of low liquidity, but pulls back in times 
when financing is more readily available.
    Congress could explore options for supporting construction 
financing, such as through those GSEs, and with support such as 
through a letter to the Federal Housing Finance Agency on this 
topic. The success of these innovative local models is clear. 
Imagine the boom in construction that could occur if such a 
tool were available nationwide.
    Such a tool could create stability not just for housing 
investment, but also for many things that depend on housing 
investment: good construction jobs, healthy housing supply, 
housing affordability for American families, and a stronger 
economy for everyone. Thank you for your time and your 
consideration. I am more than happy to follow up in greater 
detail with you and your staff should you be interested in 
exploring these topics further, and I am happy to answer any 
questions.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much. Ms. Harris, 
welcome. The floor is yours.

 STATEMENT OF GRETA HARRIS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BETTER HOUSING 
                         COALITION \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Prepared statement of Ms. Harris appears in the appendix on 
page 67.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ms. Harris. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Grassley, Members 
of the Committee and other distinguished guests, thank you for 
the opportunity to address an issue that touches the core of 
our economy and the well-being of millions of Americans, 
affordable housing.
    My name is Greta J. Harris, and I lead the Better Housing 
Coalition, a NeighborWorks chartered organization and Central 
Virginia's largest affordable housing developer. We are honored 
to provide service-enriched quality rental housing for nearly 
3,000 lower income individuals and seniors, while offering 
opportunities for home ownership.
    Over the last 3\1/2\ decades, we have invested $300 million 
into our community, with another $300 million in our pipeline, 
ensuring that more of our neighbors have a good place to call 
home. America stands at a critical juncture. The lack of 
affordable housing is not just a challenge for lower income 
families; it is a systemic issue affecting nearly every facet 
of our society and economy, and the consequences of inaction 
ripple far beyond the housing market.
    As housing costs outpace wages, today more than ten million 
Americans spend over half of their income on housing, leaving 
little for essentials like food, health care and education. 
This suppresses consumer demand and hampers economic growth. 
Businesses in both urban and rural areas struggle to attract 
and retain talent, because workers cannot afford to live 
nearby, thereby stifling business expansion, innovation and 
productivity.
    The societal costs of unstable housing are also severe. 
Studies show that housing instability is linked to worse health 
outcomes, increased mental health issues and lower learning 
achievement for children. Families forced to move frequently 
disrupt their children's education, which has long-term 
consequences for their development and future economic mobility 
success.
    Moreover, the brunt of the crisis falls hardest on 
vulnerable populations, communities of color, single parents, 
veterans and the elderly. For communities of color, this crisis 
deepens the racial wealth gap, perpetuating cycles of poverty. 
And homelessness, a growing manifestation of the housing 
crisis, comes at a steep social and economic cost.
    A study from 2019 found that homelessness costs taxpayers 
upwards of $35,000 per person per year, while providing 
permanent, supportive, affordable housing costs significantly 
less as a more humane solution. Affordable housing is also tied 
to environmental challenges. Housing shortages often push 
modest income families to the outskirts of cities, leading to 
urban sprawl, increased traffic and higher greenhouse gas 
emissions. Addressing this crisis it not an economic 
imperative, but also an environmental one.
    The core truth is that affordable housing is a public good. 
It strengthens communities, supports families, empowers our 
economy by contributing 16 percent to the U.S. Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). When we invest in affordable housing, we create 
jobs, spur local economies and provide families with the 
stability they need to thrive.
    At the Better Housing Coalition, we have seen lives 
transformed when families gain access to stable, quality, 
affordable homes. Households can begin to breathe, and then 
believe that their future can be better than their present. 
Individuals further their education, secure better jobs and 
even sometimes transition to home ownership, creating a cycle 
of positive economic and social outcomes.
    The longer we wait to address this housing crisis, the more 
costly it will become. The question is not whether we can 
afford to act, but whether we can afford not to. We need a 
scalable, multi-pronged approach to this crisis, including 
investing in low income house tax credits, home ownership tax 
credits, community development financial institutions, 
expanding federal housing vouchers, funding housing trust 
funds, and strengthening intermediaries like NeighborWorks 
America, Housing Partnership Network and Local Initiatives 
Support Corporation (LISC), that build non-profit capacity to 
serve lower income households across the country.
    We must also support local zoning reforms to remove 
barriers to building affordable homes and reduce NIMBY, Not In 
My Backyard opposition. We have many of the tools to address 
this housing crisis, but we need the political will to use 
them.
    As you deliberate on future federal budgets, I really urge 
you to prioritize affordable housing. Not just because it is 
the right thing to do, but because our economy and our society 
depend on it. Thank you very much.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much. My eyes are 
failing me. Mr. Pinto?
    Mr. Pinto. Yes.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Over to you. Thanks.
    Mr. Pinto. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF ED PINTO, SENIOR FELLOW AND CO-DIRECTOR, AMERICAN 
            ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE HOUSING CENTER \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Prepared statement of Mr. Pinto appears in the appendix on page 
69.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. Pinto. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley, 
Committee Members, thank you for the opportunity to testify on 
this most important topic. First of all, allow me to thank 
Senator Kaine, along with Senator Warner and Senator Van Hollen 
for your support of the Low Income First Time Homebuyers Act, 
LIFT Home. The LIFT Home is a concept I developed in 2015, and 
it uses 20-year loans to build wealth, rather than relying on 
30-year loans, which would only increase demand.
    So history offers a cautionary tale against inappropriate 
federal action in the housing market. From the 1930's to 2008, 
Congress passed and Presidents signed into law at least 43 
urban renewal, housing and community development programs. 
Despite each program's lofty promises, these initiatives 
consistently failed in making housing more affordable, and a 
number were downright disasters.
    The root cause for housing affordability is a shortage of 
three to eight million housing units, which is fueling both 
unaffordability and a homeless crisis in many areas. Nationally 
we have had a seller's housing market since 2012, and we remain 
in a strong seller's market today, especially at the low price 
end.
    Sellers markets provide upward price pressure, which 
worsens if demand is further stimulated. So I will start with 
what not to do. Vice President Harris' plan to provide $25,000 
in down payment assistance to four million first time buyers 
over four years is almost certain to lead to higher home 
prices, thereby more than eliminating the intended benefits.
    Millions of program recipients would become price-setters 
in their neighborhood for all the buyers in those 
neighborhoods, other first-time buyers and repeat buyers. Our 
research shows that home prices in those neighborhoods that are 
affected would rise by 3.6 percentage points, that 77 percent 
of all home purchases made in the United States would be 
subject to this homebuyer tax, and this tax would total $175 
billion over four years, more than the $100 billion cost of the 
program.
    This would be a wealth transfer to existing homeowners, and 
really rewarding NIMBY opposition to added supply. Vice 
President Harris' proposal calls for the construction of three 
million new housing units over four years. History shows that 
this approach can lead to significant market distortions.
    The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 provided easy 
credit terms and substantial subsidies, resulting in a 2\1/2\ 
million unit surge in housing starts by 1973. Only this boom 
dissipated by 1975, and left lasting scars on cities like 
Detroit, Chicago and Cleveland, they are still trying to 
recover from.
    Similarly, the 1992 Congressional Government-Sponsored 
Enterprises (GSE) affordable housing goals, combined with 
President Clinton's National Home Ownership Strategy, led to an 
easing of credit and a run up to the great financial crisis. 
Housing starts increased by 3.7 million from 1992 to 2006, but 
then collapsed by 2009, leaving behind millions of 
foreclosures. We still have a persistent housing supply 
shortage dating to that crisis.
    Without massive credit easing, the Harris proposal would 
incent--would only incent new construction that would have been 
built mostly in any event, and any incremental construction 
would be unevenly distributed, causing even more supply-demand 
imbalances. Most housing today gets built in the southern 
region of the United States, which includes the south and 
southwest, and it accounts for about 60 percent of all new 
construction.
    That is where a lot of this new construction would go, 
because it is roughly shovel-ready. Harris' $40 billion fund 
for local governments to explore innovative housing solutions 
will also funnel money into projects burdened by self-defeating 
government mandated affordability requirements, which HUD loves 
but markets abhor. The fundamental problem holding back housing 
construction, as has been mentioned here, is not insufficient 
subsidies but structural issues, restrictive zoning, land use 
rules and building codes.
    This makes buildable land scarce and expensive, and 
increases construction costs. We need to increase that market 
rate housing supply. The federal government has several levers 
it could use. First, a ten year plan to auction surplus federal 
lands for new market rate home construction could add 200,000 
homes per year.
    However, for this to be effective, the rules need to follow 
the ``keep it short and simple'' or KISS rule. And it also 
could generate about $10 billion in revenue annually to the 
federal coffers. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction 
for second homes would add to supply by turning second homes 
into primary residences, and reduce demand, freeing up these 
700,000 homes over ten years.
    Reducing regulatory costs that hold back builders is also 
crucial. Adopting a critical plan to reduce deficit spending 
could lower the ten year Treasury and mortgage rates by 75 to 
100 basis points. Lastly, establishing accountability in 
expenditures for federal housing subsidy dollars, as Ranking 
Member Grassley said, is critically important.
    In 1953, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) 
said public housing is not low cost housing. It is high cost 
housing offered for low rent. We currently have a revolving 
door of projects that go through subsidy, rehabbing, tearing 
down and rebuilding. These measures in combination with state 
and local efforts to deregulate land use and zoning could more 
effectively address housing affordability, all at no taxpayer 
cost, and without unintended consequences.
    Thank you, and I look forward to the discussion of the 
hearing.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Mr. Pinto.
    Mr. Salmon.

    STATEMENT OF JACK SALMON, DIRECTOR OF POLICY RESEARCH, 
                  PHILANTHROPY ROUNDTABLE \7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Prepared statement of Mr. Salmon appears in the appendix on 
page 71.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. Salmon. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley 
and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify before you today. My name is Jack 
Salmon, and I am the Director of Policy Research at the 
Philanthropy Roundtable.
    Philanthropy Roundtable is a mission-driven organization 
which believes that a strong private sector supported by a free 
enterprise system is the bedrock for the creation of private 
wealth that makes philanthropy possible.
    In my remarks today, I will talk about the bigger picture, 
considering our nation's fiscal condition, and why worsening 
this condition through yet more spending would be harmful to 
the long-term well-being of all Americans. I would also 
highlight the fact that the often overlooked charitable sector 
is rising to the challenge of addressing homelessness and 
housing affordability.
    Proposals from the Harris campaign include plans such as a 
$25,000 down payment for first-time homebuyers, which would add 
$224 billion in new deficit spending. Attempts to address 
housing affordability by further subsidizing demand will be 
counterproductive and make housing affordability worse.
    But more than this, such policies ignore the broader 
economic challenges we face, particularly the nation's 
deteriorating fiscal situation. The nation's fiscal situation 
has never been worse. Debt held by the public is now more than 
$28 trillion, while total public debt outstanding is over $35 
trillion.
    If economic growth is slower or interest rates are higher 
than baseline models currently forecast, then public debt could 
reach 217 percent of GDP in the coming 30 years. As our debt 
burden has continued to grow unabated, rising interest rates 
have spiked the cost of servicing this debt.
    This means that policymakers have less fiscal space to 
commit spending towards their policy priorities. More than 
public spending crowdout, the higher public debt burden 
diminishes the economic growth potential of our broader 
economy. This should be especially concerning for those who 
care most about Americans at the lower end of the income 
distribution.
    Lower rates of economic growth mean less revenue potential 
for governments to support those who need it most. But it also 
means less job creation, low wage growth and diminished living 
standards. Another way in which our spiral debt burden 
diminishes living standards is through inducing spikes in 
inflation. In recent years, we have experienced the largest 
spike in inflation in four decades. Prices today are 20 percent 
higher than they were at the start of 2021, while the cost of 
shelter is 23 percent higher.
    An academic article published last year found that the 
American Rescue Plan fiscal stimulus was primarily responsible 
for the spike in inflation we have witnessed in recent years. 
The authors noted that due to unfunded spending, it may take 
until 2025 for inflation to retrench back to two percent 
target.
    As economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas have 
pointed out in research published last year, high inflation 
disproportionately hurts low income households the most. 
Proposals by policymakers to further induce demand will only 
worsen the cost of living crisis that American families are 
already dealing with.
    But it is not all doom and gloom. While most people know 
someone who has been impacted by either the homeless crisis or 
who struggle to find affordable housing, charities around the 
country have been doing inspiring work, alleviating 
homelessness by addressing the underlying causes, such as 
mental health, unemployment and addiction recovery.
    Take for example Texas-based organization Mobile Loaves and 
Fishes, which helps the homeless by providing meals, housing 
and income opportunities to help those in crisis get back on 
their feet. Residents in the Community First Village have an 
opportunity to earn income by different onsite programs, 
instead of getting stuck in the never-ending cycle of poverty 
and homelessness.
    Another example is Step Denver, a Colorado-based 
organization that works men through a Steps for Success 
program, which helps them end the cycle of addiction and become 
productive members of society. The program appears to be 
working. 82 percent of alumni are currently employed, and 89 
percent live in stable housing.
    The program has done so well that they have plans to expand 
to Colorado Springs, Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities in 
the future. Finding a solution is not simply about providing 
affordable housing. It is about adequately addressing what 
created the problem in the first place.
    Private philanthropy is already rising to the challenge of 
alleviating homelessness and affordable housing crises. But 
their work is undermined when government pursues anti-growth 
policies. Rather than subsidizing demand through increased 
government spending and redistribution, policymakers should 
focus on policies that induce economic growth, not more 
government debt.
    Thank you, and I look forward to answering any questions 
you may have.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Very well. As I have said before, I 
think there is a strategy for dealing with spiraling government 
debt. Number one is avoiding shocks to the economy, a third of 
the debt is from shocks to the economy. So avoiding the carbon 
bubble, avoiding property values crash from climate risk 
cascading into insurance markets, into mortgage markets would 
be job one.
    Reforming health care, so that we are no longer the most 
expensive health care system per capita, while providing 
mediocre life expectancy results would be another. Tax Code 
reform, so we are not sluicing so much money out the back door 
of the Tax Code to the already rich and powerful, and Budget 
Committee reform so we are focusing on that.
    So let me just make that clear. I am also going to give up 
my time to Chairman Murray of the Appropriations Committee, who 
has important business elsewhere, and I will swap with her. So 
the order will be Murray, Grassley, Whitehouse and then on.
    Senator Grassley. I am going to swap with Johnson. He has 
got to go.
    Chairman Whitehouse. All right. Murray, Johnson, 
Whitehouse, Grassley. We got it. Chairman Murray.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much for 
your accommodation. The housing crisis is hitting everyone. I 
am from Washington state. I hear about it all the time. We have 
got a long way to go, a lot of people to house.
    But to me, the bottom line is more affordable housing. In 
Washington state, we face a shortage of almost 172,000 
affordable homes, meaning that for every ten extremely low 
income Washington state families, there is only three 
affordable homes.
    So I really believe this is an all hands on deck crisis 
that requires every level of government to step up and do their 
part. On the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was really 
proud to help create the Pathways to Removing Obstacles to 
Housing Program or the Yes in My Backyard Program, as we 
originally referred to it, to help identify and remove barriers 
to producing and preserving affordable housing.
    We were able to provide $100 million for that program in 
fiscal year '24, even under the very difficult Fiscal 
Responsibility Act caps. That is in addition to other important 
investments the federal government is making to boost supply. 
The Home Program, low income housing tax credit.
    But clearly the current levels of investment are not 
sufficient, and not moving quickly enough to meet really the 
urgency of this crisis. So Mr. Williams, let me start with you. 
What have been some of the most effective federal interventions 
to address our housing shortage?
    Mr. Williams. Thank you, Senator. I think our--the best way 
to measure our most effective programs is by looking at the 
number of units of supply that they have brought online. And so 
I think in recent decades, the low income housing tax credit 
program is responsible for the most production of new supply of 
affordable housing.
    But in the every recent past, I am also very optimistic 
about the Pathways to Removing Obstacles Program, as it is kind 
of addressing the issue from a different angle, which is 
encouraging municipalities to remove some of the zoning and 
permitting obstacles that prevent new housing supply, 
affordable and market rate housing from being able to come 
online.
    I understand that I believe Seattle in your state was--
received a Pathways to Removing Obstacles award, and so I am 
optimistic that that will result in some changes in your state 
as well.
    Senator Murray. Very good. Thank you very much, and Ms. 
Harris, I am curious what have you seen in building additional 
housing over the last decade? You have seen a lot. How could 
the federal government better support the kind of work that the 
Better Housing Coalition is doing?
    Ms. Harris. Well Mr. Williams--thank you Senator. And Mr. 
Williams is correct, the low income housing tax credit program 
has been extremely effective in allowing us to produce more 
housing units and also preserve existing affordable housing 
units.
    You know, the cost of a unit of housing, whether it is 
market rate or affordable is almost identical, and the only way 
that we are able to offer rents at 50, 60, 70 percent off of 
market rate rents is the capital stack that we use by holding 
our debt down to about 30 percent of the overall development 
cost versus a market rate development that is somewhere between 
70 and 90 percent.
    The low income housing tax credit equity allows us to do 
that, and then there is usually 15 to 20 percent left of gap 
financing that is needed. And we have used creative things like 
Capital Magnet Funds from the Community Development Financial 
Institutions (CDFI) Fund, American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) 
dollars, in some cases Community Development Block Grants 
(CDBG) and philanthropy to be able to fill those holes and 
deliver quality housing options for families.
    The one thing I would say, while we are cobbling together 
sometimes 12, 13, 14 sources of financing, that adds another 12 
to 24 months to the delivery time, and the demand is so high, 
every time we open up a new community, we have four or five 
times the amount of applications that we have units to help 
families find quality housing.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, is it is 
an honor to have you here. Thank you so much for joining us.
    I am curious to ask you, because we have heard Donald 
Trump's Project 2025 agenda proposes leaving HUD's 
responsibilities to states and localities, without any federal 
funding or oversight, and proposes selling off the nation's 
public housing stock, which is a critical piece of our 
country's affordable housing priorities.
    Here in Congress, we also saw the House Republicans put 
forward a 2025 budget that would slash HUD funding. So as you 
are watching all this from your seat, can you talk a little bit 
about how those kinds of proposals would affect your state's 
housing efforts?
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you, Senator. It would have a 
disastrous effect, not only on Rhode Island but the rest of the 
country. Look, there is clearly some things that we can all 
agree on, which was we need some local zoning reform. But to 
privatize the public housing sector would exasperate an 
already-existing crisis we have and a shortage.
    Where are the people who are living in these homes going to 
go? How are they going to afford to rent them or buy them? It 
is a very short-sighted solution to a very complex problem. We 
need both. We need federal subsidies and we need land use 
reform on a local level, and we need the federal government to 
step in because the states and the local communities cannot do 
it alone, Senator.
    So it is a combination of an effort that would work, and 
you will see sustainable progress in affordable housing. 
Clearly, the biggest solution, how we get there we can differ, 
but is to create more housing. We need more housing at every 
single level. The market level of housing, the workforce 
housing, the low income housing and even homelessness needs 
more shelters.
    So you can take your pick as to which one you want to fund 
or to what degree, but all of them need attention from the 
federal government, and they need to use local reforms to make 
it easier. The private sector will step up and the private 
sector is ready, willing and able to build in Rhode Island and 
probably throughout all 50 states.
    This is not a red state issue or a blue state issue. This 
is an every state issue, and we--the private sector will do its 
part, but we need the federal government as well. We need both 
to partner, if you will.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much. I have heard the same 
from my governor and local officials, so I really appreciate 
that. Thank you.
    Senator Grassley. Could I have 30 seconds of personal 
privilege? I want to correct that Project 2025 is not a Trump 
program. It is a Heritage Foundation program, and they have 
been doing it for every new President since 1980.
    I yield.
    Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman----
    Chairman Whitehouse. And with that----
    Senator Johnson [continuing]. And Mr. Ranking Member.
    Chairman Whitehouse [continuing]. Senator Johnson.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHNSON

    Senator Johnson. First of all Mr. Pinto, thank you for 
pointing out the insanity for throwing more federal dollars 
that we do not have, print dollars and how--at the housing 
situation you only drive up prices, making housing even more 
unaffordable. So thank you for that.
    One of the things you pointed out and one of the reasons 
housing is so unaffordable is just the lack of permitting and, 
you know, that friction created. But also the fact that we are 
running a $35 trillion deficit. A dollar we held at the start 
of the Biden administration is now only worth 83 cents. That 
also has driven up housing.
    I do not know if you have ever done a calculation in terms 
of how much is attributed to, you know, the actual inflation 
over the last three and a half years, versus the inability to 
permit these housing units.
    Mr. Pinto. Thank you, Senator Johnson. So we did look at 
that and we looked at the total increase in housing. I do not 
have the numbers in front of me, but it was substantial, 30 
plus percent over a number of years and it started right during 
the latter part of 2020 and extended. It continues, actually. 
House prices are continuing to go up about five and a half 
percent every year on cost and quality. They are not going 
down; they are actually going up, continue to go up.
    And most of that increase we can attribute to actions from 
the deficit spending that occurred later in response to COVID-
19, and secondly to the actions of the Fed, keeping interest 
rates below three percent for so long. That really lit a fire 
under the housing market.
    Senator Johnson. So certainly a solution is not more 
deficit spending. That would exacerbate the problem. Mr. 
Salmon, I really appreciate the fact that you pointed a 
different way, you know, different programs that actually help 
people buy a house or afford a house.
    We have got a great program in Milwaukee called the Acts 
Program. This is run by a Catholic priest. They are able to buy 
homes in foreclosure, very low value for 15 to 30 thousand 
dollar loans, you know. The individual owner fixed up that home 
and they have cut their rental payments from maybe $800 payment 
to a mortgage payment of three to four hundred dollars a month. 
It works.
    Another program I have got to tout is something I have been 
involved with four eight years called the Joseph Project. Four 
days of three hours a day training for people who were formerly 
incarcerated, alcohol and drug abusers that want to turn their 
lives around. We just instill them with the necessity of 
committing themselves to success and having the attitude, teach 
them how to interview, and we get them career type of jobs in 
manufacturing.
    We have serviced well over three--you know, we have 
transformed the lives of well over 3,000 people, and I use that 
figure. I don't have the exact figure, but it is well over 
3,000 people compared to what Ms. Harris talks about in her 
testimony. She said they have served 3,000 low income 
individuals and seniors at a cost of $300 million.
    I do not know the exact amount, but the Joseph Project is 
all, you know, privately funded. I will say over eight years, 
probably less than $2 million. But we will just put it at $3 
million. That is a thousand dollars per individual saved, and 
again I think it is way under that, because we have transformed 
more than 3,000 lives, and I think we have spent way less three 
million, compared to $100,000 in a government program.
    Again, government programs, again a lot of the solution 
here is, you know, more federal--more federal funding. Well, we 
do not have the money. It is just more deficit spending. That 
is going to just drive inflation. It is just going to continue 
to decrease the value of the dollar. Do you want to kind of 
speak to the difference of approach, and how much more 
effective helping people get a job is, so they can provide for 
themselves, reduce the permitting friction and stop spending 
money we do not have?
    Mr. Salmon. Sure. Thank you for the question, and I--and I 
would like to hear more about those examples you mentioned, 
because I am interested in uplifting these sorts of stories. We 
do not hear enough about these sorts of stories around the 
country.
    But you are absolutely correct. The approach is very 
different from government. Government often takes a top-down 
approach to these sorts of issues. And so it does not really--
it is not as effective at tackling the underlying issues. When 
it comes to issues like homelessness as you mentioned, these 
things are often driven by different types of issues.
    Whether it is detachment from the labor market, you know, 
that they cannot find a stable job, or they have addiction 
problems or mental health issues. And so philanthropy is better 
at specifically targeting these issues and helping these people 
get back on their feet, get stable jobs, to live independently, 
to have that self-responsibility and that pride and that 
dignity.
    And I think philanthropy is doing a much better job of this 
in examples all over the country. I mentioned a couple in my 
opening, but we have so many at the Roundtable.
    Senator Johnson. So again I have--you know, contact us. I 
would love to tell you about both those programs. I do want to 
point out that the low income housing subsidy has actually 
impaired the Acts Program because those individuals, those tax 
credits are buying up those foreclosed homes. They are putting 
hundreds of thousands of dollars into them, and so it is no 
longer available for low income individuals.
    They are taking those homes out of that program and, you 
know again, providing housing to people who can afford the 
housing and taking away from people who cannot. It is again, 
unintended consequence, but it is the real consequence of 
again, another federal government program that we cannot 
afford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much, Senator Johnson. 
Speaker Shekarchi, no one has done more to focus on the Rhode 
Island housing crisis than you have. Among all the different 
measures that you have pushed forward, what do you see as your 
favorite success story that we should know about in this 
Committee?
    Speaker Shekarchi. I think the--we have done a tremendous 
amount of area that we are seeing in increasing building permit 
with land use reforms, making it easier for developers, 
streamlining the process. We have not substituted state-
control, you know, for local control. All the decisions on any 
land use projects are still being made locally.
    But we have made the process easier. We cut down the 
hearing and the permitting. Instead of three hearings, there is 
two. Instead of two hearing, there is one. We have created a 
land use calendar in the Superior Court in Rhode Island, which 
if there is a dispute between neighbors or a community or a 
competitor, it gets an expedited review through the court 
system. So those have been very successful.
    In addition to that, we have made substantial reforms, the 
ADU legislation. A lot of the bills that we passed we have 
delayed implementation so they started for the most part, the 
bulk of them, January 1st of 2024. So it is hard to quantify 
the exact successes, but overall you are seeing an increase of 
building permits. You are seeing an opportunity where we have a 
revenue stream, and we have a Department of Housing focusing on 
it.
    We have the single largest bond in the history of Rhode 
Island before the voters in November, which I will predict--I 
do not like to predict elections, but will pass overwhelmingly. 
$120 million, of which $10 million there is a home ownership 
component in there, which we--I talked about in my testimony 
earlier, Senator, which has been a huge success in Rhode 
Island.
    It allows the middle class, the lower middle class, the 
workers that we talked about to attain ownership and start to 
create generational wealth. In addition to that, we are 
studying and looking at the Montgomery County, Maryland, and 
there is an allocation in our bond to start a public housing 
developer.
    As I said earlier to Senator Murray, there is enough of a 
problem here that we could attack it many different ways, from 
land use reform, from regulatory approvals, creating more 
planners in the system. The housing situation, the crisis that 
we have developed in Rhode Island is 30-years in the making, 
and we can look at this from a lot of different ways and attack 
it.
    But certainly, the efforts that you have proposed in your 
Act, the low income tax credits, the tax credits for home 
ownership are all a vital and important tool, and they will be 
successful. It has been proven time and again, it is the way to 
go.
    Chairman Whitehouse. You mentioned home ownership as the 
gateway to future wealth, intergenerational wealth, and I would 
like to ask you and Mr. Williams and Ms. Harris, just to 
quickly, in two minutes, expand on how first time home 
ownership changes a family's economic trajectory?
    Speaker Shekarchi. I will start briefly and turn it over to 
them. But it is--it gives people a sense of community. It gives 
them a sense of pride. They are building equity in their home. 
They are putting roots down. They are more committed to their 
community, and they can start planning to raise a family. They 
are selecting homes in areas that have good school systems. We 
are creating an opportunity for the American Dream, for the 
people of Rhode Island or people across this country to have 
the opportunity to have a sense of community.
    They become more productive. They live and they work in 
their communities, and it creates an opportunity for them to 
start affording, with the tax write-offs for interest income, 
the opportunities to build wealth so they can support college 
educations and a good lifestyle for their family.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Mr. Williams, you agree on that 
trajectory shift?
    Mr. Williams. I do. I also think Ms. Harris is more poised 
to speak to this----
    Chairman Whitehouse. Let us turn to you, Ms. Harris, 
because you live this every day in Virginia.
    Ms. Harris. I do. Thank you, Senator. And you know, in 
America, most wealth creation is through equity appreciation 
and through home ownership. And we have seen that, you know, 
our goal is not to get people into home ownership, but to keep 
them there. Because the benefit ultimately comes through 
longevity of that--owning that asset.
    And when we do, just as the Speaker of the House to my 
right said, you know, people can use that equity for 
retirement, to help their kids go to college, to start a 
business and to be able to breathe a little bit more easily.
    I would also say that with the costs, rising costs of home 
ownership, having critical down payment and closing cost 
assistance is critical, and to be able to ensure that people 
are not house poor once they get into the house, that they are 
able to live their best lives and still be able to see an asset 
grow to their benefit.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Well, thank you very much. Let me turn 
to Senator Grassley, and I think it will be Senator Kaine after 
that.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Pinto, when President Biden was still 
running for President, his campaign released a plan in July 
that promised to build two million homes in five years. Two 
months later, the Harris campaign proposed roughly the same 
plan, but now promised to build three million homes, and now do 
that in four years instead of five years.
    Mr. Pinto, the homebuilding industry already builds over a 
million homes each year. Is the industry able to roughly double 
its production and meet these expectations? In addition to 
whether or not the housing supply increase is attainable, what 
is the impact of the housing market on the economy of the 
Harris plan, to offer subsidies of $25,000 down payment 
windfall?
    Mr. Pinto. Thank you, Senator Grassley. So in 2023, there 
were about 1.4 million building permits or excuse me, housing 
starts for both single family and multi-family, and if you 
think about the three million over four years, you would be 
starting out at a smaller number. You would probably end in the 
fourth year without about a million.
    So you would be taking the $1.4 million up to about $2.4 
million at the end of four years. That is commensurate with the 
increase, as I said in my testimony, that occurred from 1969 
after the 1968 Housing Act was passed, to 1972.
    And the results of running things up so quickly with all 
the subsidies that accompanied it and the loose lending, was 
disastrous. So I think that is one scenario. The temptation 
will be to then loosen lending at the same time, which will 
lead to disastrous results.
    In terms of the homebuilders being able to handle that, I 
think it would be very difficult. But again what happens when 
you throw all that money at it, you end up with a lot of 
corruption. There is a book that was written that I keep on my 
bookshelf in about 1972 or 1973 by a reporter from Detroit 
called ``Cities Destroyed for Cash.''
    The scandal at Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and it 
was just documenting the corruption that occurred at FHA during 
these programs. The 235 program is the specific program that 
was largely involved. In terms of the down payment assistance, 
as I mentioned, there would first of all be an increase of 3.6 
percent in all of the areas that these first time buyers 
receiving this assistance would be price-setters.
    How do we know that? Well, we studied other times that the 
federal government has made changes that allows us to measure 
this impact. In particular in 2015, when FHA lowered its 
mortgage insurance premium from 135 basis points to 85 basis 
points, we had a similar experiment.
    Certain people, FHA borrowers, were getting extra buying 
power. The other people in the market did not, because they 
were not affected by the decline in the premium. We then could 
study the impact on home prices, and we found that that impact 
was substantial and it was widespread, that again this price-
setter impact occurred.
    We also know then we can calculate what the total cost that 
would be spent on the--due to the increase in home prices, and 
that is the $175 billion that I mentioned. That is more than 
the cost of the program. That money is going directly to 
existing homebuyers. That would perpetuate a practice that 
Congress has had of providing demand supply--demand side 
subsidies, which then go directly to benefit the existing 
homebuyers, not the first time buyers they are intended to 
help.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Salmon, you testified that this 
nation's fiscal situation is very bad. We will pay more 
interest payments on our national debt than the cost of all 
housing assistance over the next ten years. Vice President 
Harris proposed to increase federal spending, which means the 
national debt will continue to grow. So for you, would piling 
on even more federal spending drive up interest rates and make 
the goal of home ownership even less attainable?
    Mr. Salmon. Thank you, Senator Grassley. So more government 
spending deficits and debt will make this situation worse. We 
know from the economic literature on debt and economic growth 
that more debt impacts living standards in several ways, one of 
which is crowding out private investment, which means low wage 
growth, it means less job creation.
    One of which you mentioned is higher interest rates. About 
one percent increase in the debt ratio is correlated with about 
a three or four basis point increase in interest rates. And of 
course these interest rates have a causal effect on mortgage 
rates, so that drives up the cost of home ownership in that 
respect.
    Another way is through higher future distortionary taxes, 
which are not good for economic growth and development, and 
then finally the one that we have become familiar with in 
recent years is inflation. We essentially inflate away the 
debt. At the same time, we inflate away the purchasing power of 
American families to save.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much, Senator Grassley. We 
now turn to Senator Kaine, followed by Senator Braun.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR KAINE

    Senator Kaine. Thank you for 17 years before I was in 
elected office, I was a fair housing attorney in Richmond, and 
this is a topic that means a lot to me. There are differences 
of opinion around this table and at the witness table. But 
there are some common themes that I hear emerging, and it is 
good to just put a pin in the things are common.
    I am intrigued with the Rhode Island ADU legislation, and I 
think others on the panel, including Mr. Pinto, may have 
written about similar strategies, and you see this happening in 
other states and in other localities. I think that is something 
that has merit.
    I think the idea of the use of surplus public land, whether 
it is federal or state or local, to bring down costs by, you 
know, reducing the land portion for construction I think has a 
lot of merit, and I see many states and localities exploring 
that strategy.
    I think the LIFT bill, Mr. Pinto, that you mentioned that I 
have filed together with Senators Van Hollen, Warner and 
Warnock to develop a 20-year mortgage product to allow people 
to develop equity faster. I think that is a positive and can be 
bipartisan.
    And another one I will mention, the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure bill had a lot of funding for wastewater and 
utility extensions, and a lot of my rural communities in 
Virginia, they are using those dollars to extend utility 
service to land where they can then build workforce housing. 
But because the Infrastructure bill is paying for the utility 
extension, that also has a way of bringing down costs for the 
workforce housing that is built.
    So there are a number of strategies that I think can be 
bipartisan. Here is one that should be bipartisan; it is the 
low income housing tax credit. I was disappointed when we had a 
vote here in the Senate not long ago on an overwhelmingly 
bipartisan House proposal, that would have increased the low 
income housing tax credit, that would have strengthened the 
child tax credit, and that would have restored the corporate 
R&D tax credit that in my view was sort of mangled by the Trump 
tax reform of 2017.
    That passed the House in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 
but when we pulled it up for a vote here in the Senate, it 
failed, largely on partisan grounds with Democrats supporting 
it and Republicans opposing it.
    Ms. Harris, when you were asked a question like what can 
the federal government do, the first thing you said was the low 
income housing tax credit. I think you said that you have about 
3,100 units that you were involved in in the Richmond Metro 
Area. How many of those projects relied significantly on the 
low income housing tax credit to, you know, get built?
    Ms. Harris. 100 percent.
    Senator Kaine. 100 percent.
    Ms. Harris. Of all of our communities, and in Virginia, we 
are over-subscribed every year 4 to 1 on four applications for 
tax credit developments, with only enough tax credits at the 
state level to be allocate for one project.
    So if the federal government were to increase the amount of 
allocation that went out to the states, we would be able to 
produce or preserve more quality, affordable housing.
    Senator Kaine. I think I met you once at one of those 
projects that was about to open, right near Greater Mount Zion 
Church in Richmond.
    Ms. Harris. Yes, uh-huh.
    Senator Kaine. And you were saying the same thing. It is 
about to open, but already you are significantly over-
subscribed in terms of the number of people that wanted to move 
in?
    Ms. Harris. That was a 75 unit relatively small development 
for us, and we had 400 applications in about three weeks for 
those 75 affordable units.
    Senator Kaine. And just, you know, for the folks who might 
be here or watching this who aren't like super-familiar with 
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), Congress sets this 
allocation. It gets allocated to states. The Virginia agency 
that are sort of the allocators for Virginia housing, the terms 
of the financing are so favorable that developers who want to 
build low and moderate income housing really want to LIHTC for 
the reason that you described.
    They compete very hard for that. You know, sometimes we 
need to think of a new program, but if you have one that works, 
you know, why you know, turn yourself into a pretzel to come up 
with something new. Why not just take the one that works and do 
more in Virginia? Just, you know, kind of order of magnitude.
    Since 1990, LIHTC has financed construction or rehab of 
115,000 units, and it is so powerful the opportunity to expand 
the LIHTC in the way that we have before us, because of this 
bipartisan House action, I think is very palpable.
    Last thing, I do not have time really to get an answer, but 
I just want to--maybe I will ask this for the record. In 
cities, there is a tremendous move now toward people working 
remotely, which is leaving a lot of office space, commercial 
real estate vacant. Richmond experienced beginning in the 
1990's a lot of frankly white flight to the suburbs of 
companies and offices, that left a lot of vacancies in Richmond 
in office space.
    And we began to convert office to residential about 1995. 
30-years later, the downtown, which probably had hundreds of 
residents when I moved to Richmond, has tens of thousands of 
residents living in converted commercial and office space. So I 
am going to ask a question for the record of all of you.
    As other cities grapple with the new telework phenomenon 
and the commercial and office space has higher vacancy rates, 
what are things that could be done at the state, local or 
federal level that could enhance conversions and create new 
housing in these spaces? And I will put that in for the record. 
I thank you, Mr. Chair and yield back.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Terrific, Senator Kaine. Thank you. 
That is a really interesting question, and we are seeing that 
same issue in Rhode Island, including with our perhaps most 
iconic downtown Providence building, which we call the Superman 
building, because it resembles the building in the Superman 
comic strips. Senator Braun.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR BRAUN

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have been coming 
to the Budget Committee sessions since I have been here, and I 
wish we had spent more time on the budgeting mechanics. I want 
to throw a few tidbits out there so the American public 
understands what we are doing here.
    I do not think we have done a budget that we have adhered 
to in over 25 years. I think that would have been in the late 
90's, and every time we have had a little bit of gumption to 
discipline ourselves, it seems like we are most enterprising at 
how to undo it. We have never generated more than 18 percent of 
our GDP in federal revenues.
    High taxes, you generate a little more out of the gate; you 
lessen economic growth as it goes on. Lower taxes, you starve a 
little bit of revenue into the Treasury, but you generally gain 
ground over time because the underlying economy is healthier.
    We have now evolved into a place that borrows 30 cents on 
every dollar we spend. That means that when I got here almost 
six years ago, that was offset with a trillion dollars 
borrowing annually. But since we have grown the federal 
government to nearly 25 percent of our GDP, it is now a 
trillion dollars every six months.
    And here we are talking about affordable housing in the 
context of what the federal government might do. I can 
guarantee you, we will be borrowing every penny of it, because 
we do not offset it. We do not ever raise revenues because that 
is painful politically, and when this is your business plan for 
the country, I would be scared to death for our kids and 
grandkids in terms of how they are going to sort it out.
    What are the consequences? Well, if you pay attention to 
the news, which many people will not hear because it would be a 
narrative against the practice over the last 25 years, our 
largest creditor in the world, Japan, an ally, just unloaded 
one-third of its portfolio. Well, you could say well, maybe 
they needed the money. They didn't have it to lend. I have got 
a feeling it has more to do with even a place like China, maybe 
our second largest creditor, have been reducing their exposure.
    That is kind of listen to the market. See what others are 
doing that have to enable you to run these chronic structural 
deficits. There is no good ending to that. When you have got 
Jamie Dimon, the biggest private banker in the world saying 
that his main concern is deficits and cumulative debt, you have 
got Jerome Powell, that is finally now on record as saying it.
    I would say we ought to start listening to it here, and 
before we are offering up more from the federal government that 
has knocked nothing out of the park when it comes to spending 
money and effecting results, I think there probably ought to be 
a different approach.
    This may be my last time to harp about it. I am not going 
to let the subject just go away. We owe it to our kids and 
grandkids that we do not keep doing more of the same, digging 
the hole even deeper. I would like each panelist to tell me 
what you think on this particular subject. We will start over 
on the end.
    Should we be enterprising through the federal government 
when everything we do will be more borrowed money behind it, 
digging the hole even deeper, or should we rely on maybe state 
governments and entrepreneurs to maybe have a little better 
chance at trying to do what is probably not going to involve 
borrowing more money through the federal government? We will 
start over there.
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you, Senator. Respectfully, I 
think you need to do both. I really do. I think you----
    Senator Braun. So you are willing to borrow more money?
    Speaker Shekarchi. Yes, I am sir.
    Senator Braun [continuing]. In a place that is not really 
given us results in the past?
    Speaker Shekarchi. That is correct.
    Senator Braun. Okay.
    Speaker Shekarchi. And let me explain to you why. Because 
that is a choice, a policy decision that this honorable body, 
the Senate as a whole and the Congress as a whole has to make. 
The argument about spending and the deficits is very real one 
and a very valid one.
    But that argument should not be limited to just housing. 
You can make that argument for tax cuts for the wealthy. You 
can make that argument for a lot of spending that the federal 
government does.
    So I appreciate that, and I am fiscally concerned with 
these runaway deficits. But the pain of fixing that----
    Senator Braun. So you are for doing both, and I understand, 
and I want to get to the other panelists, so they have a chance 
to weigh in.
    Speaker Shekarchi. Okay, certainly.
    Senator Braun. Mr. Williams.
    Mr. Williams. Thank you, Senator. Yeah. I believe that the 
federal government, state government and private enterprise all 
have an interest in well-designed programs that create economic 
growth across the country and across states.
    Senator Braun. And you are still confident that we can keep 
borrowing more money, because whatever we do here to help, it 
would be 100 percent fiscal financed by debt, not by raising 
revenues to pay for it. You are okay with that too?
    Mr. Williams. I am okay with well-designed programs that 
promote economic growth.
    Senator Braun. Okay, thank you. Ms. Harris.
    Ms. Harris. Thank you, Senator. I think it is a 
combination. As the previous two witnesses have said, if left 
to its own devices, the market is not equitable, and it serves 
certain portions of our society and not all.
    And so there is a role for government to play, even if 
there is--it impacts the deficit. It could be offset by other 
cuts, to be able to ensure that all Americans have an 
opportunity to thrive.
    Senator Braun. And you would err on the side of the federal 
government doing it, as opposed to the state governments?
    Ms. Harris. Federal, state and local.
    Senator Braun. Okay.
    Ms. Harris. The size of the crisis is such that all levels 
of government need to participate.
    Senator Braun. Thank you. Mr. Pinto.
    Mr. Pinto. The federal government should not spend any more 
money. I have suggested they sell off some land and actually 
bring some money in. So that would be my suggestion, and rely 
on state, local and private sector. We have put out numerous 
proposals on how to meet the housing supply shortage over a ten 
year period through zoning and land use changes, changes that 
would cost no money at the state, local or federal level. And 
would bring in a grassroots explosion of participants from the 
bottom up rather than top down.
    Senator Braun. Mr. Salmon.
    Mr. Salmon. Yes. So state governments, local, private 
enterprise, but I am going to have to add philanthropy as well 
to that list, should keep doing more on this front. No, the 
federal government should not engage in more spending deficits 
and debt. You mentioned some good points about the foreign 
buyers of our debt, and they are losing the appetite.
    The fact that investors are losing an appetite for our debt 
now and that is already spiking interest rates, when they are 
going to have to buy another $114 trillion in Treasuries in 
next 30-years, we should be very worried.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Senator Braun. 
Senator Warner.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR WARNER

    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
holding this hearing, and I will get right at it. I have got a 
couple of different questions. You know, one of the things I 
wanted to talk about is home ownership. We all know, you know, 
racial wealth gap in this country in many ways is due to the 
failure to have true equality in terms of home ownership.
    And so I have been thinking on some issues and I am going 
to bring this to Mr. Pinto, because I understand he, you raised 
this in your testimony and you--and you may have been one of 
the original thinkers on this. So I want to give you full 
credit, because so far I have only got Democrats signed on the 
bill.
    So I am going to ask you to help me recruit somebody like 
Senator Kennedy or someone else. This notion that--the notion 
of the LIFT Act, which we had put out, was to say, you know, if 
you are a first generation, first time homebuyer within certain 
income strata and you qualify for a 30-year mortgage and we can 
meet--you can meet those terms, what we would provide is a 20-
year mortgage that would in effect allow doubling of the amount 
of equity in the first ten years on a mortgage.
    You know, I am supportive of things like down payment 
assistance and others. But this notion of how you incent home 
ownership and to try to have a governmental program that 
supports that. Mr. Pinto, I know you raised some of this in 
your comments. If you could take it away and talk about this, 
and I am anxious after the hearing to see if we can put our 
heads together and see if we can make this a much more 
bipartisan approach.
    Mr. Pinto. Well, thank you. Thank you, Senator Warner, for 
those words. Yes, I came up with this concept around 2015. We 
have tried numerous ways to try to get it implemented, 
including going to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), 
including FHA and we have not had any success.
    The one way to do it is to have FHFA, which has instructed 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to establish about eight or ten 
billion dollars in cross-subsidies that they use. And those 
subsidies go to make loans more risky rather than less. And so 
you could put people into these 20-year mortgages through LIFT 
Home, put them into a safer mortgage and then build wealth over 
time, and use money that is already being used for other 
purposes within the GSE system.
    FHA, on the other hand, could--they do not have a 20-year 
interest rate. They have a 30-year interest rate.
    I do not even know that they have 15-year interest rate. If 
they do, it is very minimal, excuse me not interest rate, a 
loan term. And so FHA could establish a 20-year rate. There are 
ways and tools. We have suggested many to FHA of how they could 
do that.
    That again would allow homebuyers to get a 20-year loan at 
basically the same----
    Senator Warner. And again I think--and I appreciate it and 
I look forward to talking on it. I will not--the economist that 
first cited this idea to me only about three years ago, I am 
going to make sure he recognizes that you did the original work 
on this and we will figure out a way to pursue that.
    Mr. Pinto. Thank you.
    Senator Warner. John Kennedy, I have got my eyes on you, 
and others on the other side, because I do think this is a tool 
that we have not used in the toolbox. I want to move along 
quickly.
    Ms. Harris, I appreciate all that you do in our 
Commonwealth. I have been a huge advocate of CDFIs as part of 
the financial network, and again bipartisan. We actually got 
$12 billion under President Trump and Senator Crapo is a great 
partner. We have got a broad Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (CDFI) Caucus now in the Senate.
    One of the things we have--since we have been able to put a 
number of--actually through government assistance deposits into 
the--I am sorry, Tier 1 capital into CDFIs, we need long-term 
patient capital as deposits. We have got a couple of tax 
provisions that we are going to take up in the Finance 
Committee.
    But if you can spend a moment talking about--talking about 
the value of CDFIs, particularly as we think about, you know, 
low and moderate income housing, how we can better utilize that 
tool?
    Ms. Harris. So we have been working with CDFIs, Senator 
Warner, for close to 30-years now, and the below-market 
flexible capital that they are able to offer our organization 
allows us to be creative in how we acquire properties, land for 
future development.
    We have utilized a variety of the tools that come through 
the CDFI program, including new markets tax credits to promote 
home ownership. It is a little squirrely the way we have to 
make it work, but we are able to have an additional subsidy to 
work with families just over the income limits at 80 percent 
Area Median Income (AMI) that CDBG and Home Resources sort of 
cap out at that level.
    And we have used the Capital Magnet Fund to be able to be 
creative in structuring new rental communities throughout the 
Richmond region.
    Senator Warner. I appreciate that, and one of the other 
things that we are also trying to work on is the secondary 
market, because the almost bespoke nature of some of these 
loans, it is really important. Mr. Chairman, if I can get one 
quick question in to Mr. Williams?
    Chairman Whitehouse. It had better be very quick, because 
you are already well over your time, and we have two Senators 
waiting that you are holding up.
    Senator Warner. I would love to hear you talk briefly about 
LIHTC. We have got to make sure the GSEs, because of some of 
their tax provisions, are now able to access. They have been 
very active in LIHTC because of that tax provision. We have to 
get that fixed very quickly, Mr. Williams. The Chairman's been 
very lenient.
    Mr. Williams. Yes, yes. I am familiar with this issue with 
the multi-investor pools that the GSEs participate in to 
support low income housing tax credit properties, especially in 
rural communities, where you need those multi-investor pools 
for the tax credits to function.
    And I know you have some legislation that you have 
introduced to address this issue, and I know that the National 
Council of State Housing Agencies, who we work with, is very 
supportive of that work and thankful that this is on the way to 
being addressed.
    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much. Senator Kennedy, 
over to you.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR KENNEDY

    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and Senator 
Warner, I appreciate your comments. Very perceptive. Thank you. 
Let me say first Mr. Speaker, I have served with a lot of 
Speakers of the House back in Louisiana. God bless you, you 
know. You have got an automatic place in heaven.
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. I would not have your job for all the 
money in the world.
    Speaker Shekarchi. I could say the same about yours, 
Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, no. You have got to herd all these 
free-range chickens that wonder off and go catch them, and 
sometimes you can catch some and sometimes you cannot.
    Speaker Shekarchi. It is very true, thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you for your service. Mr. Williams, 
if the price of electricity goes up, does that make a house 
more expensive?
    Mr. Williams. Not in a direct sense, but I mean electricity 
is an input to a lot of things, both on the construction side 
and the----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, it makes home ownership more 
expensive?
    Mr. Williams. Sure, yes.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. If property taxes go up, does 
that make home ownership more expensive?
    Mr. Williams. It sure does.
    Senator Kennedy. If homeowners insurance goes up, does that 
make home ownership more expensive?
    Mr. Williams. Indeed.
    Senator Kennedy. If interest rates, particularly mortgage 
rates go up, does that--does that increase the cost of home 
ownership?
    Mr. Williams. It does.
    Senator Kennedy. A lot, right?
    Mr. Williams. Depends on a lot of factors, but sure, it 
could.
    Senator Kennedy. If the--I mean when you own a home, you 
are going to have repairs. If the--if the cost of home 
maintenance and repairs goes up, does that make home ownership 
more expensive?
    Mr. Williams. Indeed.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. If you--whether you agree with it or 
not, if you admit 10 to 12 foreign nationals, illegal into your 
country, all of whom need housing, does that make the cost of 
home ownership go up?
    Mr. Williams. You know, I think that all of these questions 
and all of these inputs to housing costs----
    Senator Kennedy. Yeah, but what about first, about illegal 
immigration? Does that make--does that increase demand for 
housing and make the cost of home ownership go up?
    Mr. Williams. I think that is a distributional question. I 
think the question we are here to talk about today is 
bringing----
    Senator Kennedy. Yeah. But does it make the cost of home 
ownership go up?
    Mr. Williams. We are here to talk about housing supply 
today and creating jobs.
    Senator Kennedy. No. We are here to talk about home 
ownership and cost of owning a home. You are a bright man. Does 
that make the cost of home ownership go up when you increase 
demand that much?
    Mr. Williams. I think that is a distributional question.
    Senator Kennedy. You do not want to admit it, do you?
    Mr. Williams. I think that is a distributional question and 
the problem that we are facing is housing supply.
    Senator Kennedy. With all due respect, I think you are 
being disingenuous. Let me ask you Mr. Pinto, if you admit--if 
you increase immigration by 11 million people, does that 
increase the cost of home ownership?
    Mr. Pinto. Senator, yes. We have tried to figure out what 
that impact is.
    Senator Kennedy. I mean duh.
    Mr. Pinto. Yeah. But the federal government does not 
publish where they are distributing these individuals around 
the country, so we cannot do the kinds of experiments that we 
normally do.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, it causes home ownership to go up in 
some places.
    Mr. Pinto. Certainly, certainly. But we cannot figure out 
exactly what it is. We would love to----
    Senator Kennedy. I am not here to play games. I am here to 
try to get some answers.
    Mr. Pinto. But if you could get more data, that would be 
great.
    Senator Kennedy. I am sorry?
    Mr. Pinto. If you could get the data released by the 
federal government as to where----
    Senator Kennedy. I will give you some data. Mortgage rates 
are up 123 percent. Premiums for homeowners are up 16 percent. 
The average electricity bill in America is up 28 percent. That 
affects the cost of home ownership. No wonder people cannot buy 
a home.
    This dollar, thanks to President Biden and Vice President 
Harris' inflation, they have been inflation machines. This 
dollar was worth a dollar when President Biden and Vice 
President Harris took office. It is worth 75 cents today. That 
is the fundamental problem with home ownership.
    The other problem is government regulation. HUD and the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently adopted 
the International Energy Conservation Code. Do any of you know 
that that is? Okay. Well, I am not going to ask you because it 
is going to take time.
    They have recently adopted the International Energy 
Conservation Code put out by the International Code Council, 
and the Biden-Harris administration just said, they just told 
HUD and the USDA to adopt it. So if you want a HUD or USDA loan 
or access to the housing assistance, you have got to build a 
home that complies with the--with the International Energy 
Conservation Code.
    You know how much it is going to add to the price of a new 
home? $31,835. Are you kidding me? You know how much energy you 
are going to save?
    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Kennedy, you are well into 
Senator Padilla's time now.
    Senator Kennedy. $657. We need to start with the basics, 
folks. It is inflation that is killing our people, and it this 
crazy whack job regulation.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Kennedy, you are well into 
Senator Padilla's time now.
    Senator Kennedy. I am sorry, Senator.
    Chairman Whitehouse. That is all right. Senator Padilla.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR PADILLA

    Senator Padilla. Thank you Mr. Chair, and Senator Kennedy, 
I would happily give you 75 cents for that dollar bill in your 
hands. This is the Budget Committee, so let us make some smart 
investments here. Look I--I do have a couple of questions I 
want to get to, but I do want to follow up on some of the 
questions, some of the issues that my colleague raised, beyond 
just the supply side of the housing conversation, which is the 
emphasis of the hearing today.
    If we are going to go down the road of the impact of 
significant numbers of migrants that have come to the United 
States over the years, not just the impact on supply and demand 
and the cost of housing, the request for more data. But I think 
if we want to do so intellectually honestly, we also need to 
consider and incorporate how existing homeowners equity in 
their homes has gone up, because of the impact of supply and 
demand.
    When home prices are higher, existing homeowners have that 
wealth in their nest egg known as home ownership. I think that 
should be recognized and considered as well. If we are going to 
consider the impact of immigrants in the housing market, let us 
consider the impact of migrants in the workforce, because a lot 
of contractors I have talked to have been working hard, working 
feverishly, working desperately in recent years to find more 
and more workers to keep up with the number of construction 
jobs that are available.
    So migrants fill those very important workforce spots 
without which the cost of construction would be much higher if 
it was more of a shortage of folks working in construction. And 
I can go on and on and on. So again, happy to entertain the 
conversation, happy to work with my colleagues to obtain more 
insightful data. But let us be intellectual honest and 
comprehensive in our thinking and analysis.
    That being said, the shortage of affordable housing is not 
a new issue, as you all I imagine would agree. But the 
magnitude of the crisis that we are facing today certainly 
impacts nearly every American, in urban area, in rural areas 
and everywhere in between. In red states and blue states and 
everywhere in between, while disproportionately impacting low 
income families and communities of color. The data is the data.
    That is why I was proud to introduce last Congress and in 
this Congress my Housing For All Act, which is a bill that 
calls for a strategic surge in federal funding, investments in 
existing programs to reduce housing insecurity and increase 
funding for innovative, locally developed solutions that cities 
across California and other states have successfully utilized. 
So proven to work programs developed bottom up.
    We know that our local and state partners are doing 
innovative things on the ground to try to solve housing 
insecurity every single day, but they need the federal 
government to step up, to do its part, to treat the crisis with 
the funding and seriousness that it deserves.
    Speaker Shekarchi, how does the lack of federal investment 
limit the supply of housing and the ability of state and local 
governments to deal with this crisis?
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you, Senator. It is a significant 
issue. The lack of or the limited amount of federal assistance 
means that it is just fewer homes, and it exasperates the 
problem. We need the federal government to be involved in this 
space, and I understand the budgetary pressures on the federal 
budget. I understand that.
    But you can make that argument about budgetary pressures on 
every single issue, from defense spending to corporate tax cuts 
to every issue that you face, which is a myriad of issues and I 
respect and understand that. But housing is an immediate 
problem. It is families.
    As I said earlier in my testimony, it affects everybody. We 
can make all the policy programs we want to affect outcomes, 
health care, all kinds of things, etcetera. But if you do not 
have a home to go home to, a sustainable home, your education 
outcomes are poorer, your health outcomes are poorer.
    The federal government has a critical and important role to 
play, and it must play that role. This is not--I try to 
emphasize this--this is not a blue state or a red state issue. 
This is an every state issue. Governors at the National 
Governors Association met earlier this year. It was a top issue 
for all 50 governors. We need the federal government to 
partner. We need the states to play a role in this, we need our 
local communities, either the county government or our cities 
and towns, whether it is land use reform----
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, thank you. I hate to cut you 
off, but I have got to get one more topic in here, and I will 
thank you for being so articulate, and I will work with you to 
communicate your position to your United States Senators.
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you.
    Senator Padilla. The topic of GSEs came up a little while 
ago. Government-sponsored enterprises play a central role in 
the modern mortgage market, by purchasing loans from financial 
institutions, GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac enable 
lenders to offer lower interest rates, thereby expanding home 
ownership opportunities while leveling the playing field for 
lenders of all sizes.
    The system was created to stimulate lending in response to 
the Great Depression. But today we face a different crisis, 
lack of housing supply. As you know, construction is highly 
sensitive to economic conditions, with lasting effects. We saw 
this in California during the 2008 financial crisis and more 
recently during the pandemic, when rates of new housing 
construction dropped significantly.
    I know Senator Warner brought up the topic of GSEs in the 
context of the investor pools. My question is different. When 
we acknowledge that construction loans are consistently given 
at higher rates, much higher rates than traditional mortgages, 
sometimes as high as 14 percent, that is what led me to secure 
language in the recent spending bill to study the idea of 
establishing a secondary market for construction loans, to help 
drive down the cost of construction of new housing to help 
address the affordability concern.
    Mr. Williams, I see your head nodding. How would a 
secondary market help incentivize new construction, while also 
being a stabilizer during economic downturns?
    Mr. Williams. Thank you, Senator. Yes, my organization 
Center for Public Enterprise has also done work on this same 
topic, and it is not just that construction interest rates have 
gone up. Also construction loan, loan to costs have gone down. 
So you are no longer able to get a mortgage for 65 percent of 
your construction project. It may now come down to 50 percent.
    What remains needs to be filled with equity investment, 
which is also particularly expensive. So one thing that we have 
explored is whether the GSEs can support construction financing 
by providing a secondary market for mezzanine investments that 
can come in at a, you know, a portion of the total project cost 
and bring down the total cost of capital in a lot of these 
projects. We believe that there is hundreds of thousands of 
stalled multi-family units across the country that are stalled 
due to these financing constraints, and this is a way that the 
GSEs could explore addressing that issue and working----
    Senator Padilla. I look forward to working on this with 
you. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Van Hollen.

                STATEMENT OF SENATOR VAN HOLLEN

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank all of 
you for your testimony. I have been trying to follow the 
discussion from C-SPAN, and thank all of you for the points 
that you have made, you know. Clearly, we have an affordable 
housing crisis. We have a shortage of housing supply, and we 
are all here to try to learn more about what we can do to 
address those issues.
    So Mr. Williams, I was pleased to see that you participated 
in the ground-breaking of the Hillendale Gateway, you know, 
Project in Montgomery County, Maryland, a project that is a 
463-unit affordable housing complex, that uses the HOCs, the 
Housing Opportunity Commission's Housing Production Fund in 
some innovative ways.
    So I know it has been mentioned, but if you could go a 
little bit in-depth as to what that model means, whether you 
see it as something that we can emulate in other places around 
the country?
    Mr. Williams. Thank you Senator, yes, and it was pleasure 
to be at the ground-breaking event in Montgomery County last 
week.
    It is a fantastic project, and the Housing Opportunity 
Commission's Housing Production Fund is a very unique and 
innovative model that is allowing a local housing agency to 
bring additional supply online that otherwise would not be 
possible with the allocation of subsidies that they have.
    So this is totally outside of the allocations they get from 
the federal government. It is something that they are able to 
do on their own, and that is what is so exciting about it. So 
what it does is it provides a short-term construction loan at 
low cost from their revolving loan fund, into a project, and it 
replaces what would be loan capacity and tax credit equity in a 
conventional affordable housing development.
    Now they are obviously not able to get the same level of 
affordability that a conventional low income housing tax credit 
property can get. But they get that housing built on a mixed 
income basis. And so they are really interested in building 
these kind of mixed income communities, using their own 
revolving funds, and we have actually seen uptake of this model 
across the country.
    Georgia, Tennessee, Chicago and many other states and 
localities are exploring creating--those states have created 
programs and many others are exploring creating programs 
modeled after Montgomery County's innovation here. I think what 
I was talking about with Senator Padilla just a moment ago, the 
GSEs providing this kind of mezzanine construction financing is 
something that can support it outside of the housing agency 
realm.
    But for housing agencies, I think there is opportunities to 
support local governments to--in the capitalization of these 
revolving loan funds that are really directed at expanding 
housing supply.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. So you anticipated my next 
question, is what can we do here at the federal level to 
incentivize what seems to be a good model, and so what are some 
of the vehicles you think that we could look at?
    Mr. Williams. Yeah. I think there are opportunities to 
support innovation at HUD, to provide those kinds of support to 
local jurisdictions that want to create these revolving loan 
funds.
    At this point, they are really becoming a tested and proven 
model for allowing local agencies to expand their housing 
supply significantly, and I think also pushing for agencies 
like FHFA to become more comfortable with kind of construction 
financing and, you know, even secondary markets for those 
construction loans or mezzanine loans, is something that would 
be really helpful.
    You know, I think something like a letter to FHFA that 
there is bipartisan interest in exploring these ideas would 
prove beneficial.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that, and I think it is 
important that people hear the revolving loan fund, because 
these are investments made by these, in this case, Montgomery 
County, in partnership with the private sector, and then the 
County gets its return back and it stays in what is I think is 
a $100 million fund, is that right?
    Mr. Williams. That is right. It is a $100 million fund and 
it revolves quite quickly, and the fund plus interest is 
returned to the County.
    Senator Van Hollen. If I could ask you about another 
approach that Montgomery County, Maryland has taken for some 
time now toward more affordable housing, which is an 
inclusionary zoning process, and we have a process whereby if 
someone wants to develop, you know, a whole bunch of new 
houses, perhaps that should include some moderately priced 
dwelling units.
    Do you see that also as an important model, and to what 
extent is that something we should try to further incentivize?
    Mr. Williams. Yeah. I believe the Moderately Priced 
Dwelling Unit (MPDU) program, moderately priced dwelling units 
was created back in the 1970's, and Montgomery County again was 
a kind of innovator and early leader. Those kinds of 
inclusionary programs have now been adopted by many 
jurisdictions around the country, and in fact to go back to the 
Housing Opportunities Commission, they include MPDU units in 
these mixed income projects that they are building with their 
production fund.
    Senator Van Hollen. Good. I do not know, Mr. Speaker, if 
you want to--I know you have worked on these areas a long time. 
What do you think of two, two approaches, especially the more 
recent approach that we see through the Housing Production 
Fund?
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you, Senator. I congratulate Mr. 
Williams and State of Maryland as well, because they are on the 
forefront. And we in Rhode Island are looking at it very 
seriously. We have made a commitment to study the public 
housing option. We have created a fund with--and a bond to do 
that, up to $10 million.
    We have done a due diligence study, a feasibility study if 
you will. So we are looking at all creative ways. There is no 
monopoly on good ideas, and we need to look outside the box. 
This is an all hands on problem. I know that term gets used a 
lot, but this is a significant problem that affects every facet 
of life, of every facet of government assistance that we give 
as a government to our citizens.
    So we need to look creatively and outside the box. I do not 
necessarily disagree with a lot that was said, but I just think 
the emphasis should be on working together. You do not have to 
pit one segment or one program against another, and we do not--
we should not look at past failures as a way to absolve our 
responsibility of getting the job done.
    If there has been a program that has failed, we need to ask 
why has it failed, what could we do to make an improvement, is 
it worth it, or let us look at a new program and see. The 
problem is not going away.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Those are good words to end on. The 
bat signal has gone up on the floor for me to get over to the 
floor on an budget matter.
    Speaker Shekarchi. Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
    Chairman Whitehouse. I thank the witnesses for being here. 
Please, we have one question for the record from Senator Kaine. 
Others are due by noon tomorrow. When they come in, if the 
witnesses would be kind enough to respond within seven days, 
that would be helpful.
    With no further business before the Committee, the hearing 
is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., Wednesday, September 25, 2024 
the hearing was adjourned.]
