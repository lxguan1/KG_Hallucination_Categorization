  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DON BACON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
           NEBRASKA, CHAIRMAN, QUALITY OF LIFE PANEL

    Mr. Bacon. Welcome, everybody.
    I will apologize right up front. I lost my voice. A certain 
other member of our panel lost his voice last week and I think 
I caught it. So you know who I'm talking about.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Bacon. So something going around.
    The hearing will now come to order. I ask unanimous consent 
that the chair be authorized to declare a recess at any time. I 
think we're safe now.
    I ask unanimous consent to include in the record testimony 
from Mike Garcia involving a pay raise. So without objection, 
so ordered.
    Mr. Bacon. Okay. Let me welcome everyone to this Quality of 
Life Panel. I want to thank our colleagues for providing 
testimony. I appreciate you both. We may have a third member 
here soon.
    I look forward to hearing your perspective on the issues 
this panel has been chartered to consider. Service members and 
their families making untold sacrifices to protect this nation.
    I'm looking at two veterans, speaking of two and a third 
one's another veteran and I am one, too. So we know we're--we 
have our hearts on this.
    They should not have to sacrifice or be concerned with 
their basic necessities such as food, living conditions, access 
to health care, basic quality of life due to their military 
service.
    These men and women deserve better. Over the past six 
months this panel has heard from military spouses regarding the 
struggles of obtaining childcare and maintaining employment due 
to multiple military moves.
    We have heard from the Government Accountability Office 
about the abhorrent condition of unaccompanied housing. We 
talked to military compensation experts about the adequacy of 
junior enlisted pay.
    Throughout these events we found that although the 
department has done some work to improve service members' 
quality of life, significant gaps remain.
    As the panel begins to consider legislative recommendations 
for the House Armed Services Committee and the Military 
Personnel Subcommittee, I very much look forward to hearing 
from our colleagues about concerns they're hearing from their 
constituents.
    I want to welcome our witnesses. We've got Representative 
Derrick Van Orden, also Representative Mike Garcia, and 
hopefully soon Representative Salud Carbajal. Before we go 
further I'd like to allow Ranking Member Houlahan a few minutes 
to deliver her opening remarks.

   STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISSY HOULAHAN, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
      PENNSYLVANIA, RANKING MEMBER, QUALITY OF LIFE PANEL

    Ms. Houlahan. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Since last June this bipartisan panel has diligently 
engaged with service members, with spouses, advocacy groups, 
the Department of Defense officials and leaders across our 
military services on ways to improve pay and compensation, 
housing, childcare, spouse employment, and health care.
    By taking time to listen to these various stakeholders we 
have identified best practices as well as gaps in how the 
department and the services are meeting the needs of service 
members and their families.
    This hearing affords us a chance to hear from our own 
colleagues who will share with us how their experiences and 
their constituents' experiences have shaped what they see as 
opportunities to improve the quality of life of those who 
currently serve us today.
    As the panel develops its recommendations we will take into 
account the very true adage that we recruit the service member 
but we retain the family, and it is the quality of life issues 
that are often the deciding factor when somebody is either 
considering joining the military service or remaining on active 
duty.
    Lastly, I do want to thank my colleagues on the panel who 
have been very engaged in all of our briefings and hearings as 
well as the panel's chair Mr. Bacon, again, for encouraging 
such bipartisanship throughout this entire process.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Ms. Houlahan, and your voice is 
sharper than mine. I'll give you that.
    This has been a bipartisan effort. It's been a great team 
trying to solve the needs for our men and women in the military 
and their families.
    So with that I'd like to recognize Representative Van Orden 
for five minutes, otherwise known as DVO. Fire away.

   STATEMENT OF HON. DERRICK VAN ORDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

    Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I'd like to personally thank you for losing your voice.
    That was Mike.
    Hey, I appreciate very much coming here to be able to speak 
about something that's near and dear to my heart, the lack of 
appropriate compensation for our enlisted folks.
    However, I want to preface all these comments with this 
and, unfortunately, due to the lack of leadership of the Biden 
administration and the Department of Defense we're experiencing 
a crisis in confidence from those willing to join the all-
volunteer force.
    After witnessing the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan 
where I have two combat deployments and a projection of 
strategic weakness which has led the world to become a much 
more dangerous place, I am concerned that even if this Congress 
does authorize a pay raise for the men and women commensurate 
with their sacrifice, the morale, recruiting levels, quality of 
life, and the quality of life of our service members will not 
return until we have a strong leadership back in the executive 
branch meaning a competent Commander-in-Chief.
    I'm a 26-year veteran of the United States Navy. Over 22 of 
those I served as a Navy SEAL. I spent approximately 16 years 
of my marriage away from home in training and combat.
    I've had over 50 of my friends killed in combat and as of--
with Mike Day. I've had 21 of my friends commit suicide, and 
I'm coming here to testify for those that can't speak and for 
our junior enlisted.
    I was literally being shot at by various terrorist 
organizations as my wife was standing in a checkout line in a 
grocery store handing people coupons for WIC to get milk and 
cheese to feed my children and I just think you cannot square 
that circle.
    Our men and women are sacrificing their time, something you 
never get back, some their lives, and our families are living 
below the poverty line and that's not okay. We spend trillions 
of dollars on everything you can possibly imagine and we forget 
that nothing works without the person.
    This conversation on our military compensation and benefits 
is critical because we are facing recruiting challenges with an 
all-voluntary force. I want to highlight some stuff for you 
just to put this into perspective for people who do not have 
experience with the military.
    Our junior enlisted--that's the E1 to E4--on average, if 
you did an hourly salary for them, excuse me, it'd be about $11 
an hour. Let's juxtapose that with working at Kwik Trip, which 
is essentially a Midwestern 7/11. It's headquartered in my 
district.
    You start at Kwik Trip at $15-plus an hour, you have full 
medical coverage including clinics that they run, and you have 
a 401K plan. At Trane Technologies they'll pay for your 
training at a technical college.
    You're going to start at about $23 an hour with full 
benefits, and those job skills that train they translate into 
something that you can take anywhere with you.
    Unlike killing terrorists, you know, that's a pretty 
focused line of work and hopefully you're only doing that as a 
member of the government.
    So these people are getting this training and compensation 
and they can move around the country at will. They don't have 
to leave their families, they don't have to worry about getting 
shot at, and they sure as hell don't have to worry about their 
wife standing in line at a checkout stand handing in WIC 
coupons.
    So this has just got to stop. The number-one SOF maxim is 
men are more important than machines. Humans are more important 
than hardware.
    And I'm asking you humbly, understanding that there are men 
and women today who are standing with a weapon in their hand 
and they are wearing body armor and they are protecting us from 
the savages that live around the world that want to see us dead 
simply because we're Americans.
    So, again, I'm imploring you take this as seriously as you 
and assert yourself and right this very easily correctable 
wrong.
    Again, I want to thank you very much for your bipartisan 
work on this matter. I'd ask that God bless you and your 
families. God bless the United States of America and our troops 
that are watching over us as we sleep.
    With that I yield back, sir.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Mr. Van Orden--Derrick.
    Before I recognize Mike Garcia I want you to know we do 
take this serious. I know this is a number-one issue that we 
got to adjust compensation for our junior enlisted. So thank 
you. You're reaffirming why it's so important and I'm grateful.
    Mr. Van Orden. Mr. Chairman and the rest of the committee, 
I just want to thank you and Ranking Member. I know you're 
taking this seriously. I wouldn't be here if I thought I was 
wasting my time, and if there's any way I can ever help you at 
all I'm at your disposal.
    Mr. Bacon. We appreciate your testimony.
    With that, Mr. Garcia is recognized for five minutes.

  STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE GARCIA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I realize--it's not lost on me that everyone in this room 
today is a veteran. Thank you for your all service.
    I also want to commend my friend Salud Carbajal who despite 
being the last one to show up to this hearing today is a good 
Marine, and he and I actually wrote together the Spouse 
Licensing Relief Act that was actually signed into law by 
President Biden last January--January of '23.
    This gives wives of active duty members, husbands of active 
duty members, reciprocity across state lines for their 
professional licenses. So it shows that if we come together to 
solve these problems, especially for our enlisted troops, as a 
bipartisan organization we can actually get it done and the two 
of us are very proud of that legislation.
    Thank you for your commitment to have these conversations 
on pay. As a former division officer, as a former combat naval 
aviator in charge of 50 to 60 enlisted troops--sailors--aboard 
my squadron and my aircraft carrier this is something I saw 
firsthand.
    I saw my sailors--a third of them--qualify for food stamps, 
a third of them below the poverty line, and I want to echo the 
sentiment that the most important weapon system in our 
inventory DoD wide are our people and especially our junior 
enlisted, the E1 through E6. So this is why I have written 
these compensation bills to adjust pay for our junior enlisted, 
the E1s through E6.
    I know this panel has been waiting for the QRMC--the 
Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation--studies to come 
back. That has, I think, an interim review that's come back and 
it's validating some of this.
    So I want to talk about the bills that I've written in the 
past as well as the language that I wrote in the House 
Appropriations Committee for Defense Subcommittee that will be 
coming up here on a vote here shortly.
    To put things in perspective, the starting salary for a 
junior enlisted is about $12 an hour. In California a starting 
salary for an In-n-Out worker is about $20 to $22 an hour.
    So adjusting the pay table so that the floor starts at $15 
an hour, which is what my HACD language does, with a $2,600 a 
month salary for an E1 puts them about $15 an hour. It's still 
not enough, in my opinion. We can't do too much for our junior 
enlisted troops.
    Inflation over the last three years is 19.3 percent 
cumulative. The pay raise that we have given our troops in the 
NDAA and appropriated through the approps process sums up to 
16.4 percent. So as legislators we have actually aggravated the 
deficit problem in the households of our junior enlisted by 
about 3 percent. So we're moving in the wrong direction.
    It takes three promotions, as you can tell on the tables 
behind me here on this side--it's not until you are basically 
promoted three times and serve more than four years do you 
actually get to the salary of a fast food worker at $15 an hour 
with the FY23 pay table.
    In 2021 I testified in front of the services and on HACD 
and I was told there was no recruitment and retention problem. 
I was appalled that they made that assertion. But the Army 
missed recruiting by 14,000, the Navy 7,000, the Air Force 
3,000, and all combined with reserves we missed our recruiting 
numbers by 40,000.
    So my text in the HACD bill, which is coming up on a vote 
here very shortly, is effectively this pay table behind me--
taking this pay table from here starting at $1,900 a month for 
an E1 to here, starting at $2,600 a month for an E1, and it 
raises the pay raise up all the way through E6 and you can see 
E6 above eight years ends up at the same spot.
    So we are raising the floor, compressing the pay table. I 
personally wrote this so that I know that there's no pay 
inversion. There is compression, but I think that the enlisted 
will be okay with that as long as they are getting paid these 
higher levels.
    A good friend of mine, Captain Chris Wilson, wrote an op-ed 
that talks about the fact that actually this gets worse for 
their troops when they go on deployment. When they go on 
deployment they actually lose some of their food subsidies.
    Captain Chris Wilson, U.S. Army, he's commander of Bravo 
Company 12th Infantry Second Brigade and he's in charge of 139 
soldiers and he says that basically when we go on deployment we 
actually--our junior enlisted actually make less because we 
lose some of our meal stipends.
    Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Honea, who I would 
never argue with, says pay and compensation reform is going to 
be one of those big problems that we need to start today.
    The only thing I would say he's wrong about is that we 
should have started yesterday, two years ago, three years ago, 
before we had this retention problem, and I think focusing on 
the pay is one of the facets that you all are chartered to look 
at.
    But raising the floor on this base pay is absolutely 
essential and I, you know, would like the board members to read 
the text that I have in the HACD bill. It's sitting in front of 
you. It's got the pay table that I rewrote. I am helping you by 
literally creating the document that hopefully the Pentagon can 
adopt.
    As an appropriator who sits on HACD I will do everything to 
make sure that we get the money to support the adoption of that 
pay table and I'll end with this, that the utilization of 
bonuses are not bad things but they are not the cure all.
    We should allow the bonuses to continue to be used to 
address shortfalls in certain communities or to incentivize 
people to recruit and to stay in certain communities, certain 
MOSes.
    But bonuses alone will fail and we can't afford to pay that 
amount of the bill that would come with a bonus. So on behalf 
of the 750,000 junior enlisted folks that would be affected by 
this pay raise that I've written I am imploring you, I'm 
begging you, to adopt it into the next year's NDAA.
    I know it was in last year's NDAA before it went to 
conference. I appreciate that. We're going to try to get it in 
the HACD bill.
    But these folks deserve to be above the poverty line. They 
deserve to be off food stamps and there's not enough that we 
can pay them. But happy to answer any questions.
    And by the way, I'm not claiming I have the 100 percent 
right answer with these pay tables but I think I'm in the right 
coordinate system and combined with other housing and other 
things you guys are looking at I think we can get to a good 
solution for especially our junior enlisted.
    So thank you for the opportunity. I yield.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Congressman Garcia.
    And I got to tell you, it was very well thought out. I 
appreciate the--all the brain bites that went into those. So 
we're going to give it a good review and I think we're going 
down--somewhat down this path. So I really like what you're 
doing.
    Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Bacon. With that, my friend Congressman Carbajal. You 
are recognized.

STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD CARBAJAL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the 
good work that Representative Garcia is doing on this issue.
    I was a little bit late because I thought I'd give the Air 
Force and the Navy a win for a change being that the Marine 
Corps is usually on top of things.
    With that, let me just say that a lot has been raised about 
the regrettable situation of many of our enlisted that have to 
resort to our safety net programs--WIC and other type of 
programs like that.
    But it also reminds us that those programs are so important 
to keep going and that we pass and must move forward for that 
circumstance where until we fix this pay scale we need to make 
sure that we continue to provide that safety net for all food 
insecure Americans.
    Thank you, Chairman Bacon and Ranking Member Houlahan and 
the rest of the task force subcommittee for holding this 
hearing today. I commend you all for your leadership and work 
as part of this panel since its creation and I look forward to 
the recommendations that will come from it.
    I'm a proud Marine, an enlisted Marine, having served eight 
years in the reserves. This is my eighth year serving in 
Congress and on the Armed Services Committee, which has given 
me a great perspective on the great things and good things that 
DoD does for the quality of life of our service members but 
also in the areas where we need to address.
    When I think about how to improve the quality of life of 
our service members two things come to mind: pay differential 
between enlisted and officers and childcare access and 
affordability.
    I know my good friend and chairman of this panel Mr. Bacon, 
along with Representative Garcia who just spoke, are already 
working on this important first issue so I will only touch on 
it slightly.
    The pay gap between enlisted and officers is concerning, 
especially for junior enlisted. I know this committee has 
worked hard to deliver pay increases in the last few years but 
we need to do more for junior enlisted.
    In your report to the Military Personnel Subcommittee I 
urge you to prioritize this disparity. Without any actions on 
it we will continue to struggle as a nation to meet recruiting 
goals and potentially create retention problems or, should I 
say, exacerbate retention problems.
    Nationwide, there are a lack of childcare options and costs 
are unaffordable and wait lists are months long. This is 
negatively impacting our service members not just in the day-
to-day productivity but also their morale as we heard it from 
senior enlisted leaders last week.
    Part of the affordability issue is directly related to the 
pay issue I just discussed. However, that is not the only 
concern. We need DoD to act more swiftly on this growing issue.
    For example, DoD is working to increase staff recruitment 
and retention for child care development centers. As a way to 
improve recruitment and retention at CDCs in the fiscal year 
2023 NDAA Congress gave the DOD the authority to discount fees 
for civilian child care development center employees whose 
children are enrolled.
    Under this authority DoD could offer discounts of up to 100 
percent. But as of this year the military departments are still 
in the process of establishing policies and implementing the 
childcare employee discount program.
    The House-passed fiscal year 2024 NDAA included a provision 
that would have required the DoD to implement this 100 percent 
discount but was taken out during conference negotiations.
    This should signal to the DoD that this is an issue 
Congress is paying attention to. Military families should not 
need to worry how they are going to find or afford childcare.
    In this panel report--in this panel's report I encourage 
imploring the DoD to use their existing authorities to 
alleviate this issue and to work with Congress where they need 
new authorities or funding. Quality of life issues are not just 
morale issues. They're also recruitment issues, readiness 
issues, and retention issues. Without addressing them all we 
will struggle with recruitment and retention.
    I thank you for this opportunity to testify and look 
forward to any questions you might have.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Congressman Carbajal. I think we're 
making some progress on childcare. We have got more work to do.
    Going by memory I think we have gone from 65 percent 
manning to about 83 percent manning. But we got--we have to--
and they've done this by making it more competitive to work on 
base.
    So we're very competitive with the off base facilities. But 
we have some ideas on this panel how we can further attract 
more workers who are going to incorporate this in the plan.
    So I want to thank you for your comments.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. My name was misspelled so I hope 
that doesn't bode well for the product that's going to come out 
of this wonderful committee.
    Mr. Bacon. On your name tag?
    Oh, I thought--I thought maybe I just didn't know all this 
time.
    So I appreciate both of your testimony. Very much needed. 
I'm just going to yield to the ranking member and see if you 
have any questions.
    Ms. Houlahan. No, I don't have any questions other than to 
concur with you guys in terms of where our priorities ought to 
be. Whether it's with pay or benefits or the focus on the 
family I think those are all things that would have certainly 
affected my choices when I was a young officer and certainly 
would affect the choices of everybody who's active duty today.
    So thank you for sharing with us.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you.
    One thing we have learned, 18 years ago the pay scales were 
right sized and since that we have been doing across the board 
pay raises, which over time means the junior enlisted and the 
senior that pay grows farther apart. I do think it's time that 
we fix that. So that gets to both of your comments.
    Mr. Garcia. Mr. Chairman, if I may.
    Mr. Bacon. Yes?
    Mr. Garcia. The pay raise in the NDAA, just to put that 
comment in perspective, for an E1/E2 the last NDAA I forget the 
percentage, 6 something, 7 something, comes out to about $75 a 
month after taxes.
    So that--to put that point in perspective, the officers are 
certainly getting a bigger chunk of change but the junior 
enlisted are getting effectively another bag of gas if they're 
stationed in California that--you know, so it's really--the 
disparity there is real. So appreciate you making that 
observation.
    Mr. Bacon. I want to thank some of our senior enlisted 
leaders who brought this to our attention about a year ago and 
they explained it just the way you all did. So our senior 
enlisted leadership of our services are looking out for the 
troops and I'm grateful to them.
    So I'm going to close but, Chrissy, do you have anything 
you want to add?
    Ms. Houlahan. No. I yield back to you.
    Mr. Bacon. So service members need and deserve these basic 
quality of life issues to be addressed so they can focus solely 
on their mission.
    I want to thank each of our witnesses for their 
perspective, valuable insights. I look forward to working in a 
bipartisan manner to address these challenges and we will.
    Thanks.
    [Whereupon, at 2:41 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
