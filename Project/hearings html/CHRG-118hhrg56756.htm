    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE 
 COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
                           WISCONSIN

    Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will 
come to order.
    I note that a quorum is present.
    Without objection, the chair may declare a recess at any 
time.
    Today we will consider multiple pieces of legislation that 
showcase the work of this Committee over the Congress. We will 
consider legislation that will enhance election integrity, 
something this Committee has been working on since the 
beginning of the Congress.
    As Chairman of this Committee, my focus has been on 
increasing participation and restoring Americans' confidence in 
our elections.
    My bill, the Secure Handling of Internet Electronic 
Donations, or the SHIELD Act, will do just that. The SHIELD Act 
strengthens donor verification standards for political 
committees.
    Increasing election integrity should be a nonpartisan 
issue, and I hope today's discussion will help prove that.
    Other pieces of legislation we will be considering today 
are also nonpartisan in nature.
    Our first bill will sunset the Advisory Committee on the 
Records of Congress. This Advisory Committee was established in 
1990, a time when records management was not clearly 
established for the legislative branch. The Advisory Committee 
met its objective to set good management standards, which makes 
it redundant to ongoing efforts in the House, the Senate, and 
the Center for Legislative Archives. This legislation will save 
taxpayer dollars while ensuring good legislative record 
keeping.
    The second bill will make small changes to the House Office 
of Legislative Counsel. This office provides a critical 
function--to take our ideas and craft them into legislation. 
Specifically, this measure will designate one deputy to manage 
this office should there be any vacancy with the Legislative 
Counsel.
    We will also be considering a bill to establish a 
commission to study the potential transfer of the Weitzman 
National Museum of American Jewish History to the Smithsonian 
Institution.
    Since 1976, the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish 
History, based in Philadelphia, served as the only museum in 
our Nation dedicated to telling the full story of the American 
Jewish experience.
    This legislation would commission a study to determine the 
feasibility of the Smithsonian Institution to incorporate the 
Weitzman Museum into its collection.
    Additional pieces of legislation that will be considered 
will honor American values and our history. From honoring one 
of our Founding Fathers with a publicly accessible statue in 
the Capitol to the creation of a congressional time capsule, 
each piece of legislation would preserve and honor this great 
country's history.
    I look forward to a thoughtful discussion on the 
legislation before us today, and I yield.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE 
 COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
                            NEW YORK

    Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
convening today's markup.
    I am pleased to see several important bills aimed at 
improving legislative branch operations and supporting our 
cultural institutions on the agenda, and as each bill is called 
up I will offer some very, very brief remarks.
     I do want to express my appreciation for your efforts and 
the work of the staff to reach bipartisan consensus on these 
measures.
    I am also looking forward to our discussion on the 
elections-related measures on the agenda and expect to support 
a bill on the integrity of our campaign finances. I want to do 
some comments with regard to that, however.
     I appreciate this. We look to have, I hope, a consensus 
and support from our Members on the bill. Again, I want to 
thank you and your staff and all the Members for the 
cooperation with that.

                 ADMINISTRATION JOSEPH MORELLE

     I do want to express my appreciation for your efforts and

thank you and your staff and all the Members for the 
cooperation with that.

    I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
    I will now call up H.R. 9488, the Secure Handling of 
Internet Electronic Donations Act, the SHIELD Act.
    As noted, the SHIELD Act would prohibit political 
committees from accepting contributions from debit or credit 
cards without the disclosure of the Card Verification Value, or 
the CVV, and the billing address associated with the card.
    Additionally, the legislation would prohibit the acceptance 
of contributions from prepaid debit or gift cards.
    Finally, the SHIELD Act will strengthen laws that prohibit 
aiding and abetting making a contribution in another person's 
name.
    This has been a top legislative recommendation from the 
Federal Election Commission for years. This bill will 
strengthen campaign finance laws and enhance election 
integrity.
    As we approach election day, it is more important than ever 
that we continue our work to protect American election 
integrity.
    I want to thank my colleagues for their work and co-
sponsorship of this important legislation.
    I also want to thank our staff and my Democratic colleagues 
and their staff for their collaboration on getting this bill 
into final form.
    I will now recognize Ranking Member Morelle if you would 
like to give a statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I am, as others are, deeply committed to protecting the 
integrity of our campaign finance system. Preventing fraudulent 
fundraising practices is an important endeavor, and for that 
reason, I anticipate supporting the Amendment in the Nature of 
a Substitute before us today.
    Indeed, the question on whether to include CVV numbers with 
contributions or ban gift cards and prepaid card contributions 
is not a new one. Prohibiting aiding and abetting the making of 
a contribution in the name of another has been a longstanding 
bipartisan FEC legislative recommendation.
    I do want to, however, make a broader point, which is, in 
my opinion, the majority could and should have brought forward 
these reforms at any point over the last 20 months. In fact, 
the Committee has instead focused its efforts on other 
elections-related endeavors.
    We had, for instance, a multi-panel hearing on a paper 
ballot shortage in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania; a hearing 
assessing the law enforcement response to the multiple pipe 
bombs on January 6--3 years after the attack on the Capitol; a 
long markup last July on the ACE Act, a bill full of measures 
hostile to voting rights that perpetuated the former 
President's big lie and would flood even more dark money into 
our political system; and the Committee's stewardship of the 
SAVE Act, former President Trump and Speaker Johnson's extreme 
MAGA bill that would harm every American, but particularly 
military voters and married women.
    This bill, the SHIELD Act, was introduced 2 days ago. The 
majority did not seek our input on drafting the bill. If they 
had, I would have suggested to my majority colleagues there are 
some critical issues that I think the bill should address.
    For starters, the bill misunderstands how online payments 
processing works and would severely restrict donors from being 
able to contribute through online platforms.
    The bill would require platforms to collect CVV information 
for all online contributions made with a credit card or debit 
card at the time the contribution is made.
    Payment card industry data security standards requirements, 
however, prohibit payment processors from storing CVV 
information.
    In turn, this requirement will prohibit processing 
transactions, contributions to political candidates, involving 
saved payment information.
    Saved payment information is a key to donors making 
recurring contributions, something candidates on both sides of 
the aisle receive. Donors would likewise be unable to use 
common third-party payment processors like Apple Pay, PayPal, 
and Google Pay, which frequently do not provide CVV 
information.
    The legislation confusingly includes requirements for 
lawful permanent residents living outside the United States. I 
am not sure how familiar the majority is with the requirements 
of obtaining a green card, but green card holders do not 
typically seek to live outside the United States.
    The language is confusing at best. It certainly needs to be 
looked at and revised. The bill gives the FEC 10 days to issue 
regulations, something that will force the Commission to 
regulate without the benefit of public comment.
    Finally, campaign treasurers are required to retain all 
contributor information, but the bill fails to specify for how 
long they have to retain that information, which could mean 
forever. In fact, if I were a treasurer, I would assume it 
means forever. That is a big change when you consider the 
standard 3-year retention policy applicable at FEC regulations.
    Those are just a few of the examples of problems of the 
bill. I do not think they argue against doing it. We would have 
liked the opportunity and our staff to work to create solutions 
to these problems, which can be overcome, but there was just 
not enough time to do it from the bill's introduction to markup 
to fix what I consider are some serious problems.
    Here is the rub. We know what this is about. The majority 
introduced the bill this week without input from the minority. 
We are marking up the bill 55 days before the election. This is 
not promoting election integrity.
    Committee Democrats, we are not going to fall for it. We 
care deeply about it. That will be our North Star, making sure 
that elections are protected.
    I recommend colleagues support the measure, but we should 
be clear-eyed about the flaws with the bill, and we should in 
the future take some time to make sure that we get this right. 
With those reservations, I will support the bill.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
    The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 9488----
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the 
bill is dispensed with. Also, without objection, the bill shall 
be considered as read and open to amendment at any point.
    [House bill H.R. 9488 follows:]

Substitute at the desk. The clerk will please report the

    [Chairman Steil's Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute 
to H.R. 9488 follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Chairman Steil. Does any Member seek recognition for 
amendment or debate?
    Congresswoman Bice?
    Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am proud to cosponsor the SHIELD Act, common-sense 
legislation that will close loopholes currently allowing 
illegal donations to fund campaigns.
    This is necessary because some online portals are not 
taking steps to protect against fraudulent donations. When 
enacted, the bill will require the same information you submit 
when making an online purchase, a CVV and an address.
    I urge my colleagues to support it.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.
    I will recognize myself for 5 minutes--or for purpose of 
striking the last word.
    Per the Ranking Member's remarks in our sidebar just now, 
we would love to engage in working on any potential adjustments 
prior to this bill coming to the House floor. We could work on 
a manager's amendment at that time.
    The speed at which this is coming I think is important, 
because I think we have seen some anecdotal evidence of illegal 
contributions.
    We have identified this loophole through a robust review of 
our campaign finance laws, and as this loophole was exposed, we 
think this is the opportunity to make sure that it is closed.
    I am proud of the work that this Committee has done over 
the course of 2 years to further election integrity. As this 
loophole is identified, I think it is imperative for all of us 
to come together to close the loophole.
    I thank the Ranking Member's support of the legislation and 
will be open to any further adjustments that may be necessary 
between now and this legislation seeing floor action.
    Does any other Member seek recognition?
    Representative Kilmer?
    Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Chairman. Just briefly.
    If we are looking at ways in which the Federal Election 
Commission can be more effective, Representative Fitzpatrick 
and I have a bipartisan bill called the Restoring Integrity to 
America's Elections Act that looks at some changes to the 
Federal Election Commission that are bipartisan, with an eye 
toward professionalizing it and getting it out of persistent 
stalemate.
    If between here and the floor there is an attempt to look 
at potential changes, I would just request that that be a bill 
that is incorporated.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. I will take that 
under consideration for sure.
    Does any other Member seek recognition for amendment or 
debate?
    There being no further amendment or debate, the question 
now occurs on the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute.
    All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
    All those opposed, no.
    In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the 
Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute is adopted.
    The question now occurs on ordering H.R. 9488, as amended, 
reported favorably to the House.
    All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
    Those opposed, no.
    In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the 
motion to report is agreed to.
    A majority having voted in favor of H.R. 9488, as amended, 
the bill is ordered favorably reported to the House.
    Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the 
table.
    I now call up H.R. 7764, the Commission to Study the 
Potential Transfer of the Weitzman National Museum of American 
Jewish History to the Smithsonian Institution Act.
    The nonpartisan legislation would create a commission to 
study the absorption of the Weitzman National Museum of 
American Jewish History into the Smithsonian Institution.
    We are in a critical time where our ally Israel needs our 
support. With the rise of antisemitism in this country and 
around the world, it is crucial that we are protecting Jewish 
American history and expanding education efforts. By studying 
this potential absorption, we can ensure that the museum is 
maintained for years to come.
    I will now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if he 
would like to give a statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am very grateful to you for working to advance H.R. 7764, 
as you indicated, a bipartisan bill creating a commission to 
study the potential transfer of the Weitzman Museum of American 
Jewish History to the Smithsonian.
    Since the first Jews fled the Portuguese inquisition in 
1654 and arrived in New Amsterdam, what is now called New York 
City, Jewish Americans have contributed to the country in 
innumerable ways, which includes my hometown of Rochester, New 
York, where Jewish Americans have been an integral part of our 
community, establishing our first synagogue in the 1840's and 
building a thriving business community around Joseph Avenue in 
the early 20th century, and contributing to the cultural 
diversity that makes my community such a wonderful place to 
live.
    Across this Nation, Jewish Americans have served at some of 
the highest levels of Government, won Nobel Prizes, created 
enduring pieces of art and literature, and been at the 
forefront of virtually all fights for social justice, freedom, 
and equality.
    It pains me, as I am sure it does you, Mr. Chair, and all 
the Members, that antisemitism in the United States has 
increased significantly, fueled by attacks on Jewish Americans 
after the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel, as well as the 
seemingly unbridled growth of racism, extremism around the 
country.
    I just want to, again, thank you. The historic levels of 
antisemitism have to be addressed. This is one way to do that 
in a thoughtful way and move this commission forward.
    I, again, want to thank you, want to thank my colleagues 
and the staff for advancing this, and we will certainly be in 
the affirmative.
    Thank you, sir.
    Chairman Steil. I thank the Ranking Member for his support 
and his remarks.
    The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 7764----

    A majority having voted in favor of H.R. 7764, as amended, 
the bill is ordered favorably reported to the House.
    Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the 
table.
    I now call up H.R. 6394, the Semiquincentennial 
Congressional Time Capsule Act.
    This nonpartisan legislation would authorize a time capsule 
to be buried on the Capitol Grounds to mark the 250th 
anniversary of America's founding.
    The bill has the support of House Members on the America 
250 Commission, established to celebrate the 250th anniversary 
of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026. 
Additionally, the bill already has the support of the Architect 
of the Capitol.
    I would encourage my colleagues to support the legislation.
    I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if he 
would like to give a statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    As you indicated, July 4, 2026, we will celebrate our 
semiquincentennial, and I want to thank my staff for 
phonetically placing that before me so I would not stumble over 
it.
     I think this really is significant. The time capsule, as I 
understand, will be determined by bipartisan, bicameral 
congressional leaders, include written materials, 
representations of important legislative milestones, and a 
message to our future colleagues in the 244th Congress, if we 
have counted properly.
    I am looking to see what goes into the time capsule. I am, 
frankly, looking forward to when we open it, because I will be 
here one way or another. I----
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Morelle. I appreciate everyone bringing it forward. I 
think this is a great idea.
    With that, I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. I have no doubt there are current Members 
that may be here in the 244th, but it will not be me.
    The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 6394, to provide----
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the 
bill is dispensed with. Also, without objection, the bill shall 
be considered as read and open to amendment at any point.

    Chairman Steil. Does any Member seek recognition for 
amendment or debate?
    There being no further amendments, without objection, we 
will consider the question to report the measure at the end of 
the markup.
    I now call up H.R. 6969, to Direct the Joint Committee on 
the Library to procure a statue of Benjamin Franklin for 
placement in the United States Capitol.
    This bill would authorize the placement of a statue of 
Benjamin Franklin in the U.S. Capitol accessible to the public 
during guided tours.
    I will recognize Mr. Morelle, if he would like to give an 
opening statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Just to be very brief.
    I spoke with Representative Chrissy Houlahan, who is a 
sponsor of the bill along with Representative Fitzpatrick, and 
while there are certainly some references--and this may be 
interesting to people who have both been here and to Americans 
who have not--certainly references to Benjamin Franklin across 
the Capitol in paintings. I believe there is a statue tucked 
away in the back hallway on the Senate side. There is no statue 
prominently displayed in the Capitol of one of the most 
important Founders of our Nation. Millions of visitors who come 
by here should see that, and I think this legislation would 
change that.
    He was a statesman, a diplomat, scientist, inventor, 
political philosopher, businessperson, and really mentored so 
many people during the most difficult times of this Nation's 
founding, negotiated the Treaty of Paris, which ended the 
Revolutionary War, helped draft the Declaration.
    On and on we could go. I think we all appreciate it. I 
think it is appropriate that we honor him and have him 
displayed prominently in the Capitol.
    I thank you for taking up the bill and for your leadership, 
and, again, thank the staffs on both sides for working this 
out.
    Looking forward to support it enthusiastically.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 69----
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the 
bill is dispensed with. Also, without objection, the bill shall 
be considered as read and open to amendment at any point.
    [House bill H.R. 6969 follows:]

    Chairman Steil. Does any Member seek recognition for 
amendment or debate?
    Mrs. Bice?
    Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 6969, which adds to the U.S. 
Capitol's National Statutory Collection a new piece to honor 
one of our Nation's foremost Founding Fathers, Benjamin 
Franklin.
    As was mentioned by Ranking Member Morelle, he was the 
first American diplomat, fostering our Nation's relationship 
with the French Government, which helped us win the 
Revolutionary War, and that continues, endures to this day.
    I am excited to see this statue placed ahead of America's 
250th birthday. As Benjamin Franklin would say, a penny saved 
is a penny earned, and this statue comes at no cost.
    I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of the 
legislation.
    Chairman Steil. Does any other Member seek recognition?
    There being no further amendments, without objection, we 
will consider the question to report the measure at the end of 
the markup.
    I now call up H.R. 9489, to sunset the Advisory Committee 
on the Records of Congress and for other purposes.
    This bill sunsets the Advisory Committee on the Records of 
Congress, which is no longer needed, and be replaced with a 
reporting requirement for the Clerk, Secretary of the Senate, 
and National Archives.
    The ACRC convenes twice per year to discuss records 
management for the House and Senate. However, the Clerk and 
Secretary of the Senate agree that this Committee can be 
replaced with a reporting requirement.
    I support this legislation due to the feedback from these 
agencies that are directly involved with records management.
    I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if he 
would like to give a statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Simply that I appreciate you bringing it 
forward, and look forward to supporting it.
    I will yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 94----
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the 
bill is dispensed with. Also, without objection, the bill 
should be considered as read and open to amendment at any 
point.
    [House bill H.R. 9489 follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]    

    Chairman Steil. Does any Member seek recognition?
    There being no further amendments, without objection, we 
will consider the question and report the measure at the end of 
the markup.
    I will now call up H.R. 9487, to amend the Legislative 
Reorganization Act of 1970 to authorize the Legislative Counsel 
of the House of Representatives to designate more than one of 
the attorneys of the Office of the Legislative Counsel as a 
Deputy Legislative Counsel, and for other purposes.
    In the event the Legislative Counsel position is vacant, 
the Deputy Legislative Counsel would be given formal authority 
to perform all the functions of the Legislative Counsel under 
this legislation.
    I strongly support this legislation for continuity of 
operations and succession purposes.
    I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if you 
would like to give a statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Yes. Just very briefly. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    It has been more than 100 years since the inception of the 
House Office of Legislative Counsel, which I believe began as 
an experiment with the House Ways and Means Committee and has 
become truly a critical House support entity. The expert 
attorneys in the Office of Legislative Counsel now draft tens 
of thousands of bills and resolutions each Congress, and the 
number is growing exponentially when you account for the many 
drafts of a measure as it is being refined.
    It is an increasing number of amendments as well being 
submitted by Members as we have seen on both legislation large 
and small.
    As the demands of the office continue to increase, it is 
vital we provide the attorneys with the support they need to do 
their jobs effectively. That certainly includes both increasing 
the resources, but also it requires ensuring the office engages 
in succession planning, as you said, to ensure continuity of 
Government.
    While this may seem like a sort of a pedestrian matter, it 
is actually a big deal in my view in terms of ensuring that 
Congress does the job it needs to for the American people.
    I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the current 
Deputy Legislative Counsel, Noah Wofsy. He and his team do a 
masterful job working closely with Members and staff on the 
Committee, and on this Committee in particular, and we would 
quite literally not be able to have this or any other markup 
without both his talents, dedication, and patience, and also 
Legislative Counsel Wade Ballou and the entire team in the 
Office of Legislative Counsel for the work they do.
    We are very, very grateful for their service. The American 
people do not know their names but benefit from them every day. 
I am anxious to be able to be in support of this measure.
    With that, I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 9----
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the 
bill is dispensed with. Also, without objection, the bill 
should be considered read and open to amendment at any point.
    [House bill H.R. 9487 follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Chairman Steil. Does any Member seek recognition for 
amendments or debate?
    Seeing none, there being no further amendments, without 
objection, we will consider the question to report the measure 
at the end of the markup.
    I now call up H.R. 6242, the VOTES Act of 2023. I will 
recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if he would like to 
give a statement on the bill.
    Mr. Morelle. Just briefly.
    Again, I am really grateful for the opportunity to have 
this in front of us and to speak in support of the VOTES Act 
bill. It is an important bill, championed by my friend and 
colleague Maxwell Frost of Florida as well as a number of 
Members on this Committee. I cosponsored it, but I know Ms. Lee 
is a lead sponsor of the bill, and I want to thank her for her 
leadership and her efforts on that as well. I believe Mr. 
Kilmer is a cosponsor as well.
    It is a common-sense update to the UOCAVA to ensure that 
our overseas servicemembers can participate in our democracy. 
It is essential that we guarantee every American, we have 
talked about that at length today, no matter our opinion, we 
believe every member of our Armed Forces should be able to cast 
a ballot.
    Those ballots--we are 10 days from the deadline for States 
to send out those ballots to our men and women in uniform, and 
this deadline is a meaningful reminder of our duty as Members 
to protect the right of all servicemembers.
    I am grateful for the bill being before the House. Thank 
you. Thank your staff. Thank Ms. Lee. Thank Mr. Kilmer and Mr. 
Frost for their leadership on this.
    With that, I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.
    The clerk will please report the bill.
    The Clerk. H.R. 6242----
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, the first reading of the 
bill is dispensed with. Also, without objection, the bill 
should be considered as read and open to amendment at any 
point.
    [House bill H.R. 6242 follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Chairman Steil. Does any Member seek recognition?
    Ms. Lee is recognized.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would like to thank my Florida colleague, Congressman 
Maxwell Frost, for introducing this important bill, which I am 
proud to cosponsor.
    This bill amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens 
Absentee Voting Act, otherwise known as UOCAVA, which is how 
that we ensure that our servicemembers overseas have their 
right to vote protected and facilitated.
    This bill expands UOCAVA provisions to ensure that we 
include men and women who are serving in our National Guard or 
in an inactive service status so that they, too, are covered by 
UOCAVA.
    With that, I encourage the Members of the Committee to 
support this bill.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.
    Does any other Member seek recognition?
    There being no further amendments, without objection, we 
will consider the question and report the measure at the end of 
the markup.
    There being no further amendments or debate, the question 
now occurs on ordering 6394, 6969, 9489, 9487, and 6242 
reported favorably to the House.
    All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
    All those opposed, no.
    In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the 
motion report is agreed to.
    A majority having voted in favor of H.R. 6394, H.R. 6969, 
H.R. 9489, H.R. 9487, and H.R. 6242, the bills are ordered 
favorably reported to the House. Without objection, the motion 
to reconsider is laid on the table.
    This concludes the order of business for today's markup. 
Pursuant to House Rule XI, clause 2(l), I ask that the 
Committee Members have the right to file with the clerk of the 
Committee supplemental additional minority and dissenting views 
on each of the items marked up today.
    Without objection.
    Also, without objection, the staff is authorized to make 
necessary technical and conforming changes.
    If there is no further business, I thank the Members for 
their participation.
    Without objection, the Committee on House Administration 
stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

                                 [all]
