                    AND THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION
                      OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

                              ----------                              


                         Monday, July 22, 2024

                     U.S. House of Representatives

               Committee on Oversight and Accountability

                                           Washington, D.C.

    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in 
room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. James Comer 
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Comer, Jordan, Turner, Foxx, 
Grothman, Cloud, Palmer, Sessions, Biggs, Mace, LaTurner, 
Fallon, Donalds, Perry, Timmons, Burchett, Greene, McClain, 
Boebert, Fry, Luna, Langworthy, Burlison, Waltz, Raskin, 
Norton, Lynch, Connolly, Krishnamoorthi, Khanna, Mfume, Ocasio-
Cortez, Brown, Stansbury, Frost, Lee, Crockett, Goldman, 
Moskowitz, Tlaib, and Pressley.
    Chairman Comer. This hearing of the Committee on Oversight 
and Accountability will come to order.
    I want to welcome everyone here today.
    And I know we also want to welcome Speaker Johnson, who is 
also in attendance today.
    Without objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any 
time.
    I now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening 
statement, but, first, without objection, Representative Mills 
of Florida and Representative Miller of Ohio are waived on to 
the Committee for the purpose of questioning the witness at 
today's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Good morning. Today's hearing is for the American people, 
who are seeking answers about the attempted assassination of 
President Trump.
    A little over a week ago, Americans watched in horror as a 
shooter attempted to assassinate President Donald J. Trump at a 
campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The gunman nearly 
succeeded. The bullet that struck President Trump's head was 
less than an inch from taking his life.
    President Trump survived, but one rally goer, Corey 
Comperatore, tragically did not. Two others were seriously 
injured. It was a horrifying moment in American history.
    The horror was exceeded only by the bravery of the law 
enforcement agents who threw themselves in harm's way when 
shots were fired, the bravery of a crowd unwavering in its 
refusal to panic, and the bravery of a bloody President Trump 
refusing to run.
    While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret 
Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this 
tragedy was preventable.
    The Secret Service's protective mission is to protect U.S. 
and visiting world leaders and safeguard U.S. elections through 
protection of candidates and nominees.
    The Secret Service has a zero-fail mission, but it failed 
on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally. The Secret 
Service has thousands of employees and a significant budget, 
but it has now become the face of incompetence.
    The Committee has a long track record of providing 
oversight of the Secret Service. Our predecessors, both Jason 
Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings, among others, worked together to 
issue warnings and recommendations to address obvious 
shortcomings in the agency's makeup and operations. 
Unfortunately, those warnings and recommendations have gone 
unheeded.
    A former President and current candidate for President was 
shot in the head by a sniper within 500 feet of the podium. 
This is unacceptable. And we are concerned the Secret Service 
lacks the proper management to keep protectees safe from bad 
actors.
    Americans demand answers, but they have not been getting 
them from the Secret Service. We are instead learning about new 
facts about the events surrounding the attempted assassination 
every day from whistleblowers and leaks.
    Americans demand accountability, but no one is yet to be 
fired for this historic failure.
    Today's witness, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, 
is here under subpoena to answer questions about how the agency 
failed President Trump and the victims who attended the rally 
in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    It is my firm belief, Director Cheatle, that you should 
resign.
    However, in complete defiance, Director Cheatle has 
maintained she will not tender her resignation. Therefore, she 
will answer questions today from members of this Committee 
seeking to provide clarity to the American people about how 
these events were allowed to transpire.
    We will ask these questions because the Secret Service and 
its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, have 
been unwilling to provide answers to the American people. DHS 
has sought to push this hearing to a different time, Secret 
Service has suggested the hearing occur without media presence, 
and both agencies have provided only shallow explanations to 
Congress about what happened on July 13.
    Indeed, DHS and Secret Service's lack of communication with 
the Oversight Committee required me to issue a subpoena 
compelling Director Cheatle to attend today. And, still, DHS 
requested more time to prepare.
    It should not take this much time or preparation, Director 
Cheatle, to tell the truth and to be transparent with the 
American people.
    I am thankful to the Ranking Member, Mr. Raskin, for 
joining me in insisting that Director Cheatle appear today. God 
knows the Ranking Member and I disagree on many things, but 
that does not matter today.
    The safety of Secret Service protectees is not based on 
their political affiliation. And the bottom line is that, under 
Director Cheatle's leadership, we question whether anyone is 
safe--not President Biden, not the First Lady, not the White 
House, and certainly not the Presidential candidates.
    The July 13 assassination attempt is one of the darkest 
days in American political history. It represents the ugliest 
parts of what American politics has become--hatred of each 
other and a dangerous turn to extremism.
    Before we are Republicans or Democrats, we are Americans. 
If we place our political affiliations above our duty and love 
of country, we cannot maintain a country. We must ensure our 
Republic is strong. And our Republic cannot be strong when our 
leadership, our elections, our institutions, and our candidates 
are threatened by extremism and violence.
    Today, Director Cheatle will answer questions about why she 
deserves to continue to play a critical role in preserving this 
country's safety and, at the very least, what led to the 
catastrophic deadly events on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    Again, I do not believe Director Cheatle deserves to 
maintain her position as head of the Secret Service, but 
members and the American people will make their own decisions 
based on her answers today.
    I urge Director Cheatle to be transparent and forthcoming 
in her testimony today. Americans deserve no less. We have a 
duty to find out how this happened and to ensure it never 
happens again.
    I now yield to Ranking Member Raskin for his opening 
statement.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you kindly, Chairman Comer.
    Elijah Cummings, whose beautiful visage looks down upon us, 
taught us that the way to find common ground in a crisis is to 
look for the higher ground. And, last week, Chairman Comer and 
I came together to reach for that higher ground. We made a 
joint statement condemning the mass shooting and assassination 
attempt against former President Trump as a grave assault our 
on democracy. As we wrote, we are united in condemning all 
political violence.
    I join the good Chairman in expressing condolences to the 
family of Corey Comperatore and in sending healing wishes to 
the wounded victims also of this atrocious act of violence.
    Some are calling it a miracle that former President Trump 
escaped this AR-15 attack unlike so many thousands of our 
fellow citizens who have been killed or seriously wounded in 
other AR-15 shootings.
    Whether this miracle is of divine providence or of an 
adventitious nature will be up to each of us to ponder, but our 
job in Congress is not simply to marvel at miracles or count on 
good luck but to act as public policy legislators to do 
whatever we can to prevent future political violence, attempted 
assassinations, and mass shootings.
    The Chairman and I are thus determined to get to the bottom 
of the stunning security failures that enabled this 20-year-old 
lone gunman who borrowed his father's AR-15 to perpetrate a 
mass shooting and assassination attempt at an event protected 
by the Secret Service as well as state and local police.
    We will ask hard questions of Director Cheatle today in 
order to identify and understand the shocking security failures 
that occurred and to help transform the operations of the 
Secret Service to prevent anything like this from happening 
again.
    But we cannot let ourselves off the hook either, dear 
colleagues. What happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, was a double 
failure--the failure by the Secret Service to properly protect 
former President Trump and the failure of Congress to properly 
protect our people from criminal gun violence. We must 
therefore also ask hard questions about whether our laws are 
making it too easy for potential assassins to obtain firearms 
generally and the AR-15 specifically.
    Mr. Comperatore, former President Trump, and the other 
rally attendees wounded in Butler are now members of a club no 
one wants to belong to--the thousands of people who have fallen 
victim to mass shootings.
    Last year, we had 655 mass shootings in America, defined as 
4 or more people being shot or killed in a single event, not 
including the shooter. Seven hundred and 12 people died and 
nearly 2,700 people were wounded in these attacks in 2023.
    Mass shootings are commonplace. They happen at political 
rallies and constituent meetings; in our elementary schools, 
middle schools, and high schools; in churches, synagogues, and 
mosques; in movie theaters and parades; in nightclubs and 
grocery stores; in concerts and on street corners.
    Here are the worst mass shootings in the last 11 or 12 
years. The list is a grim reminder of the horrific damage and 
death wrought by assault weapons, and the AR-15 in particular, 
that have taken the lives of our children, parents, colleagues, 
and neighbors. This is a very partial list.
    Mass shootings have become so frequent that we do not even 
hear about them anymore. Since the mass shooting in Butler, 
there have already been at least 10 additional mass shootings 
in America, 2 of which took place the same day that former 
President Trump was targeted.
    One of the mass shootings on that violent Saturday, July 
13, happened at 11 p.m. at a nightclub in Birmingham, Alabama, 
where 4 people were shot dead and 10 others wounded. This 
means, amazingly, that the Butler attack was not even the 
deadliest mass shooting to happen in America on that day.
    A weapon that can be used to commit a mass shooting at an 
event under the full protection of the Secret Service, together 
with dozens of state and local police, is obviously an 
intolerable threat to the rest of us who do not receive such 
protection and obviously does not belong in our communities.
    It is time to pass universal background checks and build on 
this Administration's work to ensure that we permanently close 
the loopholes in the Brady Law for gun show purchases, online 
purchases, and private sales to prevent those weapons from 
getting into the hands of people we know to be a threat to 
others.
    What happened in Butler shows why even closing these 
loopholes, however, will not keep assault weapons out of the 
hands of potential assassins and mass murderers. Under Federal 
law and in the vast majority of states, even young people not 
old enough to buy a beer legally can legally purchase and own 
the AR-15 and carry it in public. The shooter in Butler used 
his father's AR-15.
    We have to find the courage and resolve to pass a ban on 
the AR-15 and other assault weapons. A ban has broad support. 
Even the New York Post loudly endorsed such a ban in 2019.
    We have passed an assault-weapons ban before. Republicans 
and Democrats, together, passed it in 1994. Alas, in 2004, we 
allowed the ban to expire.
    We know this weapons ban worked. One study found that in 
the decade that followed the ban's lapse mass shootings went 
back up 183 percent and deaths from mass shootings went up 239 
percent.
    But even as we change the Secret Service and act to ban 
weapons of war like the AR-15, we still will have fallen short 
of our duty if we fail to denounce every instance of 
politically motivated violence in whatever form it takes.
    Republicans and Democrats again have come together to 
denounce this assassination attempt, just as we did the violent 
attempts on the lives of our colleagues Representative Steven 
Scalise and Representative Gabby Giffords and on Paul Pelosi, 
the husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was attacked and 
brutalized in his home.
    And in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 mass 
violence waged against Congress and the Vice President and the 
constitutional transfer of power, Democrats and Republicans 
alike, including Senator McConnell, Chairman Comer, and other 
colleagues, all denounced this violent assault on our democracy 
that wounded approximately 140 officers from the U.S. Capitol 
Police and the Metropolitan Police Department. And I commend 
them for acting to denounce that attack, just as Democrats 
moved swiftly to denounce the attack on Congressman Scalise.
    Political scientists tell us that authoritarian attacks on 
democratic institutions begin with political parties refusing 
to disavow or openly embracing political violence. We have to 
reject that on a strong bipartisan basis, as Chairman Comer and 
I have done, even as we ensure our Secret Service is up to its 
vital task of protecting Presidents and candidates and as we 
work to ensure that America, the streets of our country are 
free from the violence of weapons of war.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back to you.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you.
    The gentleman yields back.
    Today we are joined by Kimberly Cheatle, who was sworn into 
office on September 17, 2022, as the Director of the United 
States Secret Service.
    Prior to her appointment, Director Cheatle was Senior 
Director of Global Security at PepsiCo. Before her role at 
Pepsi, she served 27 years in the Secret Service.
    Pursuant to Committee rule 9(g), the witness will please 
stand and raise her right hand.
    Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you 
are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do.
    Chairman Comer. Let the record show that the witness 
answered in the affirmative.
    Thank you.
    We certainly appreciate you being here today and look 
forward to your testimony.
    We normally limit testimony to--opening statement to 5 
minutes, but take all the time that you need.
    Obviously, the rules that we will abide by, when you are 
finished with your statement, we will then turn to questions. 
Each member will have 5 minutes.
    And just a note to the members: I am going to strictly 
adhere to the 5 minutes. Once 5 minutes is up, I will hit the 
gavel. If the Director is in the process of answering a 
question, we will certainly let her finish her answers, and 
then we will move on.
    We are going to have about 100 percent attendance here 
today, plus a few additional add-ons, so this will be a very 
lengthy hearing, and we want to make sure every member gets 
their 5 minutes, uninterrupted, to be able to ask these 
important questions in this very bipartisan hearing today.
    I now recognize Director Cheatle for your opening 
statement.

                     STATEMENT OF KIMBERLY CHEATLE

                                DIRECTOR

                          U.S. SECRET SERVICE

    Ms. Cheatle. Thank you.
    Good morning Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and 
distinguished members of the Committee. My name is Kimberly 
Cheatle, and I am the Director of the United States Secret 
Service. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you 
today.
    The assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump 
on July 13 is the most significant operational failure of the 
Secret Service in decades. And I am keeping him and his family 
in my thoughts.
    I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to the 
family of Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief and a hero, 
who was killed in this senseless shooting.
    I would also like to acknowledge those who were injured in 
Butler--David Dutch and James Copenhaver--and I wish them a 
speedy recovery.
    I would be remiss if I did not also extend my condolences 
on the passing of your colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson 
Lee. Ms. Jackson Lee was always engaged in the oversight of the 
Secret Service, and her passing is a great loss to this body.
    The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our 
Nation's leaders. On July 13, we failed.
    As the Director of the United States Secret Service, I take 
full responsibility for any security lapse of our agency.
    We are fully cooperating with ongoing investigations. We 
must learn what happened, and I will move heaven and earth to 
ensure that an incident like July 13 does not happen again.
    Let me state, unequivocally, nothing I have said should be 
interpreted to place blame for this failure on our Federal, 
state, or local law enforcement partners who supported the 
Secret Service in Butler. We could not do our job without them. 
We rely on the relationships built over years of working 
together to secure events and conduct investigations.
    Our agents, officers, and support personnel understand that 
every day, we are expected to sacrifice our lives to execute a 
no-fail mission. As witnessed on July 13, our special agents 
shielded former President Trump with their own bodies on stage 
while shots were being fired, selflessly willing to make the 
ultimate sacrifice without hesitation.
    I am proud beyond words of the actions taken by the former 
President's detail, the counter-sniper team who neutralized the 
gunman, and the tactical team who was prepared to act.
    I will be transparent as possible when I speak with you, 
understanding, though, at times that I may be limited in 
providing a thorough response in this open setting due to 
associated risks with sharing highly sensitive protective 
methodologies. I do not want to inadvertently provide you today 
with inaccurate information.
    Since January 1, 2024, the Secret Service has successfully 
secured over 7,500 sites. Every protective advance comes with 
its own set of challenges and requires a customized mitigation 
strategy, including specific assets. Security plans are 
multilayered, providing 360 degrees of protection. These layers 
include personnel, technical and tactical assets, which are a 
force multiplier for our protective posture.
    During every advance, we attempt to strike a balance 
between enabling the protectee to be visible and our protective 
requirements to be secure. I know this because I have spent 29 
years in this agency.
    I came up through the ranks. I have secured events for 
every President since President Clinton, supervised on Vice 
President Cheney's detail, led our Training Center, oversaw all 
of the investigations and protective visits in the state of 
Georgia, supervised on Vice President Biden's detail and the 
agency's entire protective mission during the Trump 
Administration.
    The comprehensive advance process involves collaborative 
planning between our Secret Service, the protectee's staff, 
local law enforcement partners, and the level of security 
provided for the former President increased well before the 
campaign and has been steadily increasing as threats evolve.
    The security plan included a full assessment of the Butler 
Farm Show grounds to identify security vulnerabilities and 
craft a security plan for the protectee, attendees, and the 
public.
    Immediately following the assassination attempt, I directed 
the activation of my Crisis Center, I assembled my executive 
team to begin surging more protective resources to the former 
President and to ensure the wellness of our people post-
incident, all while securing an active crime scene.
    I immediately ordered a reevaluation of the Republican 
National Convention security plan, and I increased the security 
posture in the National Capital Region for all permanent 
protectees and sites.
    At the same time, I initiated a mission assurance 
investigation within our agency. I have instructed my team that 
all necessary resources will be dedicated to investigating 
these manners. We will not rest until we have explored every 
option, and we will leave no stone unturned.
    But I want to be clear: I am not waiting for these 
investigations to be completed prior to making changes.
    Over the past 2 weeks, we successfully led the planning and 
execution of the 75th NATO summit and the Republican National 
Convention. Over the next few months, we will implement 
security plans for the Democratic National Convention, the 
United Nations General Assembly, and have already begun 
planning and coordinating the 2025 inauguration.
    It is now more important than ever for the men and women of 
the Secret Service to remain resilient and to focus on what is 
necessary to carry out our critical mission.
    Our agency needs to be adequately resourced in order to 
serve our current mission requirements and anticipate future 
requirements. The Secret Service currently protects 36 
individuals on a daily basis, as well as world leaders who 
visit the United States, like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, who arrived in Washington, DC, today. The coming 
years will bring an unprecedented heavy protection tempo.
    I have no doubt that the processes that I have implemented 
during my tenure as Director, in addition to my nearly 30 years 
of experience in this agency, have positioned the Secret 
Service to be stronger.
    Our mission is not political; it is literally a matter of 
life and death. And the tragic events on July 13 remind us of 
that.
    I have full confidence in the men and women of the Secret 
Service. They are worthy of our support in executing our 
protective mission.
    I will now answer any questions that the Committee may 
have.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you very much, Director Cheatle.
    We will now begin our 5 minutes of questions, and I will 
begin.
    Just for the record, the Secret Service has an annual 
budget of around $3.1 billion and, I believe, around 8,000 
employees. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir.
    Chairman Comer. Obviously, there were many security 
failures on the day of the attempted assassination and leading 
up to that day. Let us start with the building that the shooter 
used to shoot President Trump from.
    At any point Saturday, did the Secret Service have an agent 
on top of that roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I am sure as you can imagine, we are just 
9 days out from this incident and there is still an ongoing 
investigation. And so, I want to make sure that any information 
that we are providing----
    Chairman Comer. So--so--so----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Providing to you is factual.
    Chairman Comer [continuing]. You cannot--OK.
    Why did the Secret Service not--can you answer why the 
Secret Service did not place a single agent on the roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are still looking into the advance process 
and the----
    Chairman Comer. All right. All right.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Decisions that were made----
    Chairman Comer. OK. OK.
    Was that building not within the perimeter that should be 
secured? Do we agree with that?
    Ms. Cheatle. The building was outside of the perimeter on 
the day of the visit. But, again, that is one of the things 
that, during the investigation, we want to take a look at and 
determine whether or not other decisions should have been made.
    Chairman Comer. One of the things that you said, I believe 
in an interview, that there was not an agent on the roof 
because it was a sloped roof, is that normal? And do you fear 
that that immediately creates an opportunity for future would-
be assassins to look for a slanted roof?
    I mean, this is a huge question that every American has: 
Why was a Secret Service agent not on the roof? And there have 
been reports that agents were supposed to be on the roof, but 
it was hot that day and they did not want to be on the roof.
    Can you answer any of those questions, Director?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I appreciate you asking me that question, 
Chairman. I should have been more clear in my answer when I 
spoke about where we place personnel in that interview.
    What I can tell you is that there was a plan in place to 
provide overwatch, and we are still looking into 
responsibilities and who was going to provide overwatch.
    But the Secret Service, in general, not speaking 
specifically to this incident, when we are providing overwatch, 
whether that be through counter-snipers or other technology----
    Chairman Comer. OK.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Prefer to have sterile rooftops.
    Chairman Comer. Did the Secret Service use any drones for 
surveillance that day?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, again, I am not going to get into 
specifics of that day in itself, but there are times during a 
security plan that the Secret Service does deploy an asset like 
a drone.
    Chairman Comer. There were reports that the shooter used a 
drone just a few hours before the rally start time. Is that 
accurate?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have heard those same reports and, again, am 
waiting for the final report.
    Chairman Comer. Do you know--if you cannot answer the 
question, that is your answer, but can you answer this? Do you 
know--do you know--I am not asking ``yes'' or ``no,'' but do 
you know if the shooter used a drone before the shooting?
    Ms. Cheatle. That information has been passed to us from 
the FBI.
    Chairman Comer. How many Secret Service agents were 
assigned to President Trump on the day of the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I am not going to get into the 
specifics of the numbers of personnel that we had there, but we 
feel that there was a sufficient number of agents assigned.
    Chairman Comer. There are reports that several agents 
assigned to the rally on July 13 were temporary agents, agents 
not normally assigned to President Trump. Is that accurate?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that the agents that 
were assigned to former President Trump are Secret Service 
agents that provide close protection to him, and that was what 
was actual on that day.
    Chairman Comer. How many temporary agents were there that 
day?
    Ms. Cheatle. Quite frequently, sir, during campaign events, 
the Secret Service utilizes agents from HSI or the Department 
of Homeland Security----
    Chairman Comer. But you do not know how many?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. To supplement----
    Chairman Comer. Or you cannot answer it?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Our plan.
    Chairman Comer. Have the investigators reconstructed the 
shooter's precise movements over the past days, weeks, and 
months?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again----
    Chairman Comer. We need to have confidence that, if the FBI 
is leading this investigation, that they are leading a credible 
investigation. Because there is some of us sitting up here 
today that do not have a lot of confidence in the FBI.
    So, I will repeat the question. Have the investigators 
reconstructed the shooter's precise movements over the past 
days, weeks, and months?
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand your question, Chairman, and I 
share your concerns about wanting to make sure that we have 
factual information.
    The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation. The Secret 
Service is conducting an internal investigation. There are a 
number of OIG investigations. And there is the external 
investigation----
    Chairman Comer. OK.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. The President has initiated----
    Chairman Comer. Last question for me: before July 13, had 
the Trump detail requested additional resources?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that, for the event on 
July 13, the details that were--the assets that were requested 
for that day were given.
    Chairman Comer. OK.
    My time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes Ranking Member Raskin for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    It has been reported that, before former President Trump 
got up on the stage at around 6 p.m. on Saturday, July 13, that 
the local police had identified and even photographed a man who 
was acting suspiciously, and this man, who turned out to be the 
gunman, had been flagged as a potential threat.
    Is that accurate?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can say is that the individual was 
identified as suspicious.
    Mr. Raskin. So, he was known to be suspicious before former 
President Trump took the stage.
    Ms. Cheatle. That is the information I have received.
    Mr. Raskin. Why was he allowed to take the stage with a 
suspicious person having been identified in the crowd?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I appreciate the question, and I would 
like to make two points.
    If the detail had been passed information that there was a 
threat, the detail would never have brought the former 
President out onto stage. That is what we do, and that is who 
we are. We are charged with protecting all of our protectees.
    Mr. Raskin. So, you distinguish between someone who is 
suspicious and someone who is threatening? Is that----
    Ms. Cheatle. I do.
    Mr. Raskin [continuing]. Right?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of times at protective 
events where suspicious people are identified, and those 
individuals have to be investigated and determined what is it 
that identifies that person as suspicious.
    Mr. Raskin. So, did you deny a request for additional 
resources that had been made by the Trump campaign?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were no assets denied for that event in 
Butler on the 13th.
    Mr. Raskin. I see. So, you are saying there were requests 
made for additional assistance for other specific events rather 
than for the campaign as a whole. Is that right?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am sorry. I am not understanding----
    Mr. Raskin. Well, you seemed to say that there were not 
additional resources requested for that event. And forgive me 
for being unfamiliar with this. Is it requested event by event, 
or is it requested just in general for the campaign?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, if I can explain the advance process, when 
an event or a venue is identified by, in this case, campaign 
staff, then the campaign staff works together with Secret 
Service agents who go out and conduct an advance.
    Generally, that is a 5-day time period where those 
discussions are had about what the perimeter is going to look 
like, what the size of the event is, what the venue is.
    And then, from there, there is a request made to mitigate 
potential risk and threat. And I am saying that, on that day, 
the requests that were pushed forward were granted.
    Mr. Raskin. So, the Secret Service did not know that the 
gunman actually had a weapon before President Trump was allowed 
to get up on the stage?
    Ms. Cheatle. To the best of our knowledge and the facts 
that we have at this point, that is correct.
    Mr. Raskin. So, can you answer this question, which I think 
is on the mind of most Americans thinking about this? How can a 
20-year-old with his father's AR-15 assault weapon climb onto a 
roof with a direct 150-yard line of sight to the speaker's 
podium without the Secret Service or local police stopping him?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again, sir, I will say, we are 9 days out 
from this event, and I would like to know those answers as 
well, which is why we are going through these investigations to 
be able to determine that fully.
    Mr. Raskin. OK.
    It has been reported that the shooter was not carrying a 
driver's license or any form of identification. They had no 
idea who he was. But then he was quickly identified, I think 
within 30 minutes, by using the serial number on the AR-15 
under a tracing system that is now controversial. Some people 
say we should get rid of it; some people want to keep it.
    But is that right, that the serial number was the key 
information which led to the identification of the shooter?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is my understanding, sir, yes.
    Mr. Raskin. OK.
    If an American citizen were just to stop you and say, 
``Director Cheatle, we support your work, to the tune of 
billions of dollars and thousands and thousands of employees; 
what went wrong?'' what would you say?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, knowing that we are 9 days out, I would 
say, as I have said from the very outset: I accept 
responsibility for this tragedy. We are going to look into how 
this happened, and we are going to take corrective action to 
ensure that it never happens again.
    Mr. Raskin. Well, I appreciate that, and I hope you will 
act with vigor and focus and intensity. And it seems you 
understand the gravity and solemnity of this to the American 
people.
    Millions and millions of Americans do not feel safe with 
all the AR-15s out there. We thought at least the President of 
the United States or a former President of the United States 
would be safe, but now that is not even clear.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back to you.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee, Mr. Jordan from Ohio.
    Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director, were you guessing or lying?
    The day after President Trump is shot, Secret Service 
spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, quote, ``The assertion that a 
member of the former President's security team requested 
additional security resources that the U.S. Secret Service or 
the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely 
false.''
    The next day, Secretary Mayorkas said, ``That is an 
unequivocally false assertion. We had not received any requests 
for additional security measures that were rebuffed.''
    But 5 days later, the Washington Post said this: ``Top 
officials repeatedly rejected requests from Donald Trump's 
security detail for more personnel.''
    The next day, The New York Times said this: ``Mr. Guglielmi 
acknowledged that the Secret Service had turned down some 
requests for additional Federal security assets for Mr. Trump's 
detail.''
    So, which is it? Because both statements cannot be true. 
Were you guessing or lying when you said you did not turn down 
requests from President Trump's detail?
    Ms. Cheatle. Neither, sir. And I appreciate the question--
--
    Mr. Jordan. Well, what were you doing? Because those 
statements do not jibe.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, what I can tell you is that, for the event 
in Butler, there were no requests that were denied. As far as 
requests----
    Mr. Jordan. Well, maybe they got tired of asking. Maybe you 
turned them down so darn much they said, not worth asking.
    How many times did you turn them down ahead of that?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that it is important to distinguish 
between what some people may view as a denial of an asset or a 
request and not----
    Mr. Jordan. Well, is Mr. Guglielmi your spokesperson? He 
said--he acknowledged the Secret Service had turned down some 
requests. I am asking how many?
    Ms. Cheatle. A denial of a request does not equal a 
vulnerability.
    Mr. Jordan. Well, tell me what it is.
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of ways that threats and 
risks can be mitigated with a number of different assets, 
whether that be through personnel, whether that be through 
technology or other resources.
    Mr. Jordan. Well, tell the Committee which it was. They 
asked for additional help in some form or another. You told 
them no. How many times did you tell them no, and what did you 
tell them no to?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I cannot speak to specific incidents, 
but I can tell you, in general terms, the Secret Service is 
judicious with their resources based on----
    Mr. Jordan. What does ``some requests'' mean? How many 
times? ``Some'' indicates--``requests'' is plural, so more than 
once they asked for additional help, and you turned them down. 
What did they ask for, and how many times did you turn them 
down? Pretty basic questions.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again, without having all of the details 
in front of me, sir, what I can tell you is that there are 
times----
    Mr. Jordan. You did not get briefed on how many times you 
turned down the Trump detail when they asked for additional 
help?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am sorry----
    Mr. Jordan. You did not get briefed on that before you came 
to this hearing, knowing you were going to get asked that 
question?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that, in generic terms, 
when people--when details make a request, there are times that 
there are alternate ways to cover off on that threat or that 
risk.
    Mr. Jordan. But that is not what he said. He said they were 
denied certain requests--some requests.
    Ms. Cheatle. I--I----
    Mr. Jordan. This is your spokesperson, not me, talking. 
This is the Secret Service talking.
    Ms. Cheatle. I----
    Mr. Jordan. And what a change, from ``absolutely false,'' 
``unequivocally false,'' to, ``oh, by the way, there were some 
times where we did not give them what they wanted.'' That is a 
huge change in 5 days.
    And the fact that you cannot answer how many times you did 
that, that is pretty darn frustrating, not just for me but for 
the country.
    Ms. Cheatle. I hear your frustration----
    Mr. Jordan. Let me ask you this: were any of those requests 
denied to President Trump's detail after you knew about the 
Iranian threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you--again, I do not know the 
specifics--is that there are times when we can fill a request--
it does not necessarily have to be with a Secret Service asset 
or resource; we can fill that request with locally available 
assets and resources.
    Mr. Jordan. Have you spoken to anyone at the White House 
since July 13?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I have.
    Mr. Jordan. Who did you talk to?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have briefed the President and the Vice 
President.
    Mr. Jordan. Did you talk to the First Lady?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I have not.
    Mr. Jordan. Did you talk to the White House staff, anyone 
in White House communications?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I have not.
    Mr. Jordan. Have you talked to the counter-sniper who took 
the shot that took out the bad guy?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I have.
    Mr. Jordan. And can you tell us about that conversation?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would not want to reveal conversations that 
I have had with my employees.
    Mr. Jordan. But that is exactly the kind of information the 
American people want to know, the American people who pay your 
salary.
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand. This is an ongoing 
investigation, and I want to----
    Mr. Jordan. Who is all doing the investigating at Secret 
Service? I know the Inspector General, but is there also an 
internal investigation in addition to the Inspector General?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are conducting a mission assurance 
investigation internally, yes.
    Mr. Jordan. You know what it looks like, Director? It looks 
like you will not answer some pretty basic questions. It looks 
like you got a 9-percent raise and you cut corners when it came 
to protecting one of the most important individuals, the most 
well-known individuals on the planet, a former President, 
likely the guy who is going to be the next President. It looks 
like you guys were cutting corners. That is what it looks like 
to me.
    Is that true?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am here today because I want to answer 
questions, but I also want to be----
    Mr. Jordan. You might want to, but you have not answered--I 
do not think you have answered one question from the Chairman, 
the Ranking Member, or me. We have got a lot of other people to 
ask them; we will see if your record improves. But right now, 
you have not answered, I do not think, any questions.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Ms. Norton from Washington, DC.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    In the summer of 1963, as a law student, I traveled to the 
South to work in the civil rights movement. When I arrived in 
Jackson, Mississippi, I was met by a civil rights activist who 
showed me around town and tried to convince me to work in 
Jackson that summer. I recall talking with him and his wife 
about the raw atmosphere in Jackson.
    Later that day, he took me to the bus station for my trip 
to my assignment. That night, he was assassinated outside his 
home. His name was Medgar Evers.
    I condemn the political violence. It is a threat to 
democracy.
    I want to discuss one of the roots of political violence: 
guns.
    For years, Republicans, including a member of this 
Committee, have introduced legislation and amendments to repeal 
or block the District of Columbia gun violence protection laws, 
including its bans on assault weapons and large-capacity 
magazines.
    The shooter at the Trump rally used the mass shooter's gun 
of choice, an assault weapon, specifically an AR-15-style 
rifle, and presumably a large-capacity magazine, which is 
defined in D.C. as a magazine that can hold more than 10 
bullets.
    Under current D.C. law, D.C. does not recognize concealed-
carry permits issued by other jurisdictions, but it does issue 
concealed-carry permits to both residents and nonresidents.
    However, D.C. imposes a number of requirements on 
concealed-carry applicants, including suitability, such as not 
having exhibited a propensity for violence or instability. 
Moreover, D.C. residents--restricts where the guns can be 
carried, such as a political demonstration near the White House 
and Naval Observatory or near people under Secret Service 
protection, provided the permit holder has been given notice.
    This week, the House is expected to consider the Fiscal 
Year 2025 Financial Services and General Government 
Appropriations bill. This Republican-drafted bill would allow 
an individual with a permit to carry a concealed handgun issued 
by a state or territory--to carry a concealed handgun in D.C., 
regardless of that jurisdiction's permit requirements.
    A Republican has filed an amendment to that provision to 
allow such an individual to carry a magazine of any size with 
that handgun.
    In short, the pending bill and amendment would allow any 
person with a carry permit issued by another jurisdiction to 
carry a concealed handgun with a magazine of any size in any 
location in the District of Columbia.
    The Secret Service is responsible for protecting a large 
number of people and facilities in D.C.
    Director Cheatle, would Secret Service protectees in D.C. 
be safer or less safe if people who have exhibited a propensity 
for violence or instability could carry a concealed--concealed 
handguns in D.C.?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think being a Secret Service agent and an 
officer or a law enforcement officer in any state is difficult. 
They are required to make decisions and snap judgments in the 
blink of an eye. And I think that the officers and the agents 
that work here in the D.C. area do a great job of monitoring 
the public and reacting to threats as appropriate when they 
arise.
    Ms. Norton. Well, would Secret Service protectees in D.C. 
be safer or less safe if people in D.C. could carry concealed 
handguns with large-capacity magazines?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think, ma'am, that we work in parameters 
where we travel around North America, and the rules on open 
carry and concealed carry are different from state to state, 
and that is part of what the Secret Service takes into account 
when we develop a security plan.
    Obviously, anyone that comes into one of our protective 
sites, we would establish magnetometer support, metal detectors 
that personnel would have to process through, eliminating that 
potential.
    Ms. Norton. Would Secret Service protectees in D.C. be 
safer or less safe if more people could carry handguns in D.C.?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think, again, as I stated, ma'am, we want to 
make sure that we provide a safe environment for all of our 
protectees, and whatever measures we would need to put in place 
for a secure site, we would do so.
    Ms. Norton. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentlelady's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the House 
Intelligence Committee, Mr. Turner from Ohio.
    Mr. Turner. Director Cheatle, your opening statement 
indicates that the Secret Service constructed a security plan 
for the site in Pennsylvania.
    I am assuming that security plan would also include the 
security footprint for the site, but it also would be based 
upon a threat assessment for the risk threats associated with 
Donald Trump and the crowd in attendance.
    Would it not include a threat assessment?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, it would.
    Mr. Turner. So, that threat assessment, as we know, 
basically would have started with, there is a generalized 
threat against Donald Trump because he is a Presidential 
candidate. Then it would have gone to, he is a former 
President, and he gets the security coverage just as Bush, 
Clinton, Carter, and Obama do. And then you also have the 
heightened political environment.
    Even for those, it is clear that the security footprint, 
that the threat assessment was insufficient, which permitted a 
20-year-old to actually enter with a weapon and shoot Donald 
Trump.
    But I want to ask you about two other aspects of the threat 
assessment.
    It is known and public that Iran is a threat risk for 
Donald Trump. They are a threat risk for John Bolton, former 
Secretary of State Pompeo, and Donald Trump because they have 
indicated they want to assassinate them as a result of 
retaliation for the killing of Soleimani.
    That is both, for Iran, a generalized threat--they are 
targeting these individuals--but also, most recently, a 
specific threat to Donald Trump himself.
    Now, I want to enter into the record by UC a Department of 
Justice public affairs release, a CNN article, an article from 
FOX News, and an article from CBS, all of which acknowledge----
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Turner [continuing]. That this threat exists for Donald 
Trump from Iran and that there are specific threats, most 
recently, that have been acknowledged.
    Mr. Turner. Director Cheatle, have you read the 
intelligence of the generalized threat to Donald Trump by Iran 
as a result of their desire to retaliate for the killing of 
Soleimani?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have.
    Mr. Turner. Have you read or been briefed about the 
intelligence of this specific recent threat to Donald Trump 
from Iran?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I have.
    Mr. Turner. Director Wray, when we were getting our 
briefing, indicated that he thought the threat assessment 
should have included this threat from Iran.
    Is it your testimony today that the threat assessment, 
since you have read this intelligence, was sufficient to 
protect him from this threat from Iran?
    Ms. Cheatle. My testimony today is that the information 
that we had at the time was known--that is----
    Mr. Turner. Was it sufficient? Director Cheatle, was it 
sufficient for the Iranian threat that you said you have read 
the intelligence briefings for?
    Ms. Cheatle. That information was passed to----
    Mr. Turner. Well, I am not asking the bureaucratic issue of 
who did it get passed around to.
    Director Cheatle, was it sufficient for the specific and 
generalized threat to Donald Trump's life from Iran?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I do believe it was.
    Mr. Turner. Director Cheatle, is an Iranian assassin more 
capable than a 20-year-old?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I think we have acknowledged that there 
was gaps and a failure that day. We are----
    Mr. Turner. When I raised this issue with Director Wray, he 
was incensed. He was shocked that the threat assessment of Iran 
did not seem to be, as he and I discussed, baked in to your 
security footprint and your threat assessment.
    And he went on to say that the generalized threat that he 
has told the whole country that we are under from a terrorist--
a potential terrorist threat--he has said, we are under the 
highest threat level since 9/11, that the lights are flashing 
red.
    And he has specifically indicated that people have crossed 
the southern border as a result of the Biden Administration's 
policy and that there are in our country today terrorists and 
individuals who are affiliated with terrorist groups and 
organizations.
    That would be a heightened threat environment, Director 
Cheatle, would it not?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Turner. In his public statements, he has said he is 
making these statements because he wants people to take them 
into consideration in threat assessments specifically.
    Ms. Cheatle. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Turner. Now, that would be a threat not just to Donald 
Trump, but it would also be a threat to the crowd there, would 
it not?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Turner. Are ISIS terrorists and al-Qaida terrorists and 
international groups and terrorists more capable than a 20-
year-old in pulling off either a mass shooting or an 
assassination of Donald Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, again, there was clearly a breakdown----
    Mr. Turner. Right.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And a failure that day.
    Mr. Turner. Have you read the intelligence of the 
terrorists that are currently in the United States that 
Director Wray speaks--and those individuals that are here that 
are affiliated with terrorist groups and organizations that are 
in the process, as Director Wray said, of representing a 
significant threat of a terrorist attack occurring in the 
United States?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have read reports that apply specifically to 
the Secret Service's mission.
    Mr. Turner. Director Cheatle, because Donald Trump is 
alive--and thank God he is--you look incompetent. If Donald 
Trump had been killed, you would have looked culpable.
    There is no aspect of this that indicates that there has 
been any protection to Donald Trump. The threat was identified 
before he took the stage, and the shooter was only killed after 
Donald Trump himself was killed [sic].
    Not only should you resign, if you refuse to do so, 
President Biden needs to fire you. Because his life, Donald 
Trump's life, and all the other people which you protect are at 
risk because you have no concept of the aspect that the 
security footprint needs to be correlated to the threat.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Lynch from 
Massachusetts.
    Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, there were multiple security failures at 
the former President's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    First of all, there was a failure to isolate the podium 
from exposure to direct fire. Do we know who made that 
decision, to allow that rooftop to remain as an unprotected 
area? Do we know who came up with that security plan that 
omitted that?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I do not have a specific person to 
identify for you----
    Mr. Lynch. OK. Well, that is what I am looking for, so let 
us move on.
    There was also a breakdown in security in failure to 
confront the shooter over an hour before the former President 
began his remarks when the shooter was identified as a person 
of interest.
    What, particularly, allowed agents or law enforcement to 
identify him as a person of interest?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I appreciate the question. And, again, I 
will say that we are 9 days out, and there are a multitude of 
interviews that are still taking place----
    Mr. Lynch. OK.
    So, did he have a rangefinder? There were some reports that 
the individual had a rangefinder. That would certainly raise my 
suspicion. Did he have a rangefinder?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, he did. But----
    Mr. Lynch. OK.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. May I explain that, at a number 
of our sites, especially when you are at outdoor venues, a 
rangefinder is not a prohibited item. It is sometimes an item 
that is brought in by individuals that----
    Mr. Lynch. But did anybody----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Are going to be in the back----
    Mr. Lynch [continuing]. Confront him on that? Anybody ask 
him questions, what are you doing with a rangefinder? Anybody 
confront him on his presence where he was in proximity to the 
President?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again, to my knowledge, I believe that 
that was the process that was taking place, was to locate the 
individual----
    Mr. Lynch. Did they--did they confront him? Did they go up 
to him? Did they talk to him?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have those details at this time.
    Mr. Lynch. OK. Those are important details.
    There was also a failure to communicate between law 
enforcement to act quickly upon information, provided by either 
local law enforcement or rally attendees, that the suspect was 
positioned on the roof. There were minutes of delay before any 
meaningful action was taken even though he was several hundred 
feet from the podium, and this was obviously minutes before the 
shooting.
    Let me ask you--there was considerable delay in removing 
the President from the podium after the shooting began. He was 
shot in the ear; it was still over a minute before he was 
removed from the stage.
    Meanwhile, this shooter had multiple clips, several clips. 
He got off eight shots, and he had the capacity and the 
ability, if he was not neutralized, to basically mow down that 
whole Secret Service detachment as well as the President.
    What, from your own investigation, caused that delay under 
the circumstances?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that, when the agents 
identified that the shooting was taking place, in under 3 
seconds they threw themselves on top of the President----
    Mr. Lynch. Oh, I understand that. There was heroism there, 
no question about it, no question about it.
    But protocol would indicate--and these are--you know, these 
are the opinions of various former Secret Service agents, 
people who have done this work in the past--that over a minute 
of exposure on that podium, with a shooter with a high-capacity 
weapon who had already wounded the President and could have got 
off we do not know how many more rounds, and yet the President 
remained exposed, even though he was joined in that exposure by 
the Secret Service in their heroic acts.
    It just--it--I do not know if there is a good explanation 
for that.
    Ms. Cheatle. Our personnel created a body bunker on top of 
the President----
    Mr. Lynch. I get that. I get that.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Shielding him----
    Mr. Lynch. Yes. This was--this was an AR-15-style weapon 
that would have made pretty quick work if he was determined and 
able to do so.
    This is not the first investigation that we have had of the 
Secret Service during my time here on this Committee. And the 
last one we had; our previous investigation determined that the 
Secret Service was experiencing a staffing crisis ``that poses 
perhaps the greatest threat'' to the agency. And that is a 
quote.
    Is that staffing crisis still in place? Is that still 
something that you deal with on a daily basis?
    Ms. Cheatle. As of today, the Secret Service has just over 
8,000 employees. We continue to hire, knowing that we need to 
ensure that we keep pace with a----
    Mr. Lynch. What would be the full complement of----
    Chairman Comer. And the gentleman's time has expired, but 
please answer the question.
    Mr. Lynch. Yes.
    Ms. Cheatle. I am sorry?
    Mr. Lynch. What would be the full complement that you are 
looking for? You have got 8,000, and how many would be a full 
complement for the Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, we are still striving toward a number of 
9,500 employees, approximately, in order to be able to meet 
future and emerging needs.
    Mr. Lynch. OK.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Dr. Foxx from North 
Carolina.
    Ms. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, what grade would you give the Secret 
Service's performance in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13?
    Ms. Cheatle. As I have stated, ma'am, this was clearly a 
failure.
    I would grade the agents and officers who selflessly threw 
themselves in front of the President and neutralized the threat 
an ``A.''
    I think that we need to examine the events that led up to 
and prior to that day.
    Ms. Foxx. You stated in 2021 that the Secret Service has a 
zero-fail mission.
    It is clear that the events of July 13 show a cascade of 
failures that cost Corey Comperatore his life, nearly cost the 
former President his life, and injured David Dutch and James 
Copenhaver.
    When an agency fails spectacularly in its mission, those 
responsible must be held accountable and the problems must be 
fixed so they cannot happen again.
    Why should the American people or the officials you are 
responsible for protecting have confidence in your ability to 
lead the Secret Service after such a spectacular failure?
    Ms. Cheatle. I appreciate the question, and I am committed 
to finding answers so that we can make the agency stronger 
after this.
    Ms. Foxx. You said on July 15 that ``the buck stops with 
me.'' How are you taking accountability for the Secret 
Service's failures during the July 13 assassination attempt on 
President Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have taken accountability, and I will 
continue to take accountability. I am responsible for leading 
the agency, and I am responsible for finding the answers to how 
this event occurred and making sure that it does not happen 
again.
    Ms. Foxx. So, I would like to explore how you got the job 
as Director of the United States Secret Service.
    Is it typical for the Director of the Secret Service to be 
recommended for the role at the behest of a President's family 
and senior staff, perhaps at the request of Jill Biden or 
Anthony Bernal?
    Ms. Cheatle. I got the job as the Director of the Secret 
Service because I spent 27 years in an agency with a mission 
that I absolutely love. I started my career in Detroit. I 
worked my way up through investigations and protection----
    Ms. Foxx. Were you--was there competition for the position?
    Ms. Cheatle. You would have to ask those who were involved 
in the interview process.
    Ms. Foxx. But you think you are the best person in the 
country to head the Secret Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that I am the best person to lead the 
Secret Service at this time.
    Ms. Foxx. The Secret Service receives billions in funding 
each year, as has been explained by my colleagues here. In 
fact, you have had an increase in real terms of 55 percent.
    As you are no doubt aware, staffing levels for those 
assigned to protect the President, former Presidents, and other 
senior officials has decreased by about 350 between 2014 and 
today.
    Clearly, a lack of financial resources is not to blame for 
the staffing shortage.
    In 2022, the Secret Service saw nearly half its work force 
leave in 1 year. And, during the same year, it was ranked dead-
last among law enforcement agencies in the Best Places to Work 
in the Federal Government.
    Can you explain why your agency was so poorly rated and why 
so many staff left in just 1 year?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, with all due respect, I dispute the 
statistic of half of the employees leaving in 2022. I think 
that that has been inaccurate data that has been reported out 
there.
    But what I can tell you is, as I have returned as the 
Director of the agency, we have had an increase in hiring and 
staffing and an increase in resources, and we are committed to 
continue to hire so that we can be staffed appropriately to 
meet the dynamic mission that we have.
    Ms. Foxx. Well, you may want to dispute it, but it is out 
there.
    My understanding---given the high-profile failures and 
rotten culture at the Secret Service during your nearly 2-year 
tenure, why should the American people have any confidence in 
your ability to lead the Secret Service to perform its zero-
fail mission to protect our senior leaders?
    Ms. Cheatle. The Secret Service has an incredible culture. 
Our men and women place service over self. They come in every 
day willing to risk their lives for our protective mission, and 
they work investigations that thwart people who would do harm 
to children, child exploiters. We have an incredible mission, 
and our culture is we will get the job done no matter what.
    Ms. Foxx. Well, those on the front lines certainly have a 
great culture, and they were willing to risk their lives for 
President Trump, but I am not sure the leadership at the agency 
has the right kind of culture.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Connolly from 
Virginia.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Well, I hope the American people do appreciate the 
incredible daily risks Secret Service agents take on our 
behalf.
    You mentioned there are 36 regular clients you have got 
that you protect constantly, but I was participating in the 
NATO summit just 2 weeks ago. We had 32 heads of government and 
heads of state plus visiting heads of state and heads of 
government. Presumably, you provided protection for all of 
them.
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct.
    Mr. Connolly. Just saying.
    Help us understand, however--I will stipulate that there is 
an ongoing investigation and you do not want to go into too 
much detail on that until you have been able to ascertain all 
the facts and analyze what they mean.
    You can understand, however, the anxiety we and the 
American public have about how could this happen and how can we 
ensure it cannot recur.
    Now, there are some things my friends on one particular 
side of the aisle do not really want to talk about, like AR-15s 
and access to them by a 20-year-old, or anybody for that 
matter.
    Presumably, Director Cheatle, the ubiquity of weapons, guns 
in America, especially assault weapons or semiautomatic 
weapons, that has helped your job and the mission of your 
agencies, right? It has made it less complicated. Is that not 
true?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am sorry. I am not understanding your 
question.
    Mr. Connolly. Real simple. More guns, especially dangerous 
ones, have made your job protecting people easier. Is that not 
right?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think from every----
    Mr. Connolly. Director Cheatle, this is simple English. 
More guns, do they make your job more complicated or less 
complicated in protecting these 36 clients and visiting heads 
of state and heads of government that come to Washington?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the Secret Service needs to take into 
account----
    Mr. Connolly. I did not ask that. I am sorry. I asked a 
simple question which deserves a simple answer.
    The ubiquity of guns, dangerous weapons in America, like 
AR-15s, has that made your job--that is to say the mission of 
the Secret Service--easier or more difficult?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the threat environment for protecting 
our Secret Service protectees is always difficult, and that is 
dynamic, and it is always evolving.
    Mr. Connolly. We stipulate it is always difficult. Again, 
this is a simple one.
    Does the ubiquity of guns make your job easier or more 
difficult today?
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand the Second Amendment rights of 
individuals.
    Mr. Connolly. I did not ask that question. I am not 
questioning the Second Amendment. I am asking a simple 
analysis, Director Cheatle.
    And I can tell you, you are not making my job easier in 
terms of assessing your qualification for continuing on as 
Director.
    Please answer the question. You are the head of the Secret 
Service. You are speaking on behalf of 8,000 members who put 
their lives on the line. We just had a failure by your own 
admission.
    Do guns make your job easier or harder?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the job of the Secret Service is 
difficult on every day, and we need to make sure that we are 
mitigating all threats, whether that be weapons----
    Mr. Connolly. That is not my question. That is not my 
question. And now I think you are evading the answer, which is 
not a hard one.
    Ms. Cheatle. I am sorry that you feel that way, sir.
    Mr. Connolly. How else could I feel, Director Cheatle, when 
you are clearly avoiding a direct answer to a very simple 
declarative question?
    We almost lost a Presidential candidate the other day. A 
20-year-old had access to his father's AR-15 and got on top of 
a roof within 500 yards or feet of the podium.
    And I am asking you, did the availability of that AR-15--
which is replicated all across America--make your job harder or 
easier, and you are not willing to answer that question? And 
you think--and you wonder why we might have a lack of 
confidence in your continued ability to direct this agency?
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand your question, and that is the 
environment----
    Mr. Connolly. Well, if you understand my question, why not 
answer it?
    Ms. Cheatle. Because it is the environment that the Secret 
Service works in every day.
    Mr. Connolly. That does not tell me anything. That is the 
environment we work in.
    I had an attack on my office a year ago. I know a little 
bit about violence, too. He came to kill me. When he could not, 
he beat one of my staffers eight times with a baseball bat on 
the head. We live with the threat of violence.
    But a simple answer from the Director of the Secret Service 
would be helpful, and I am sorry you have chosen to evade it.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Grothman from 
Wisconsin.
    Mr. Grothman. Thank you.
    When this guy took the shots, he climbed a ladder to get on 
the roof, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am unable to answer details of exactly how 
the individual accessed the roof at this time.
    Mr. Grothman. Do you know when the--if he did use the 
ladder, do you know when the ladder was placed there? Was the 
ladder there 2 days before? Just the night before? Do you have 
any information at all as to when the ladder got there?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would like to be able to answer those 
questions. The FBI is still conducting an investigation.
    Mr. Grothman. How did the rifle get to the roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, sir, at this time, I am unable to 
answer questions to provide clarity.
    Mr. Grothman. Have they cleaned the roof since the 
assassination attempt?
    Ms. Cheatle. Have they cleaned the roof?
    Mr. Grothman. Right. Has anything been done to the roof? Is 
it just like it was, you know, whatever, 10 days ago or not? 
Has anything been done to the roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have an answer for that.
    Mr. Grothman. OK.
    Were President Trump's normal agents, normally assigned to 
him, there that day?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Grothman. There was no--these were the same agents that 
were always there?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir. The people that are assigned to his 
detail were working on that day.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. There is stuff on the internet that says 
they were not there that day, but these are the same agents who 
are routinely there?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. Do we know which agents fired the shots 
that finally took down the potential assassin?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir, I do.
    Mr. Grothman. Could you give us those names or the 
background of those agents?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would not offer their name up in this 
setting, but it was one of our technical officers, our counter-
snipers.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. So, can we privately get those names to 
the Committee?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am certain that we can make names available 
privately.
    Mr. Grothman. OK.
    Do we know where all the shots landed?
    First of all, how many shots did the potential assassin--
how many shots came out of the rifle?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again, I would hesitate to offer that 
information as the FBI is conducting an investigation.
    Mr. Grothman. Have we got the bullets from all the shots?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, that would be the responsibility of the 
FBI to collect that evidence.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. Do we have any--do we have the 
correspondence from the shooter? Has that been recovered from 
his phone, whatever?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I would have to defer you to the FBI 
for details on that investigation.
    Mr. Grothman. OK.
    You have spent some time trying to change the makeup of the 
Secret Service, OK? You feel there are, whatever, too high a 
percentage are men.
    Does this affect at all who you are hiring for the Secret 
Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have spent my time as the Director trying to 
increase the number of people that we hire in the Secret 
Service so that we have the best and the brightest, and that 
has been my concentration as the Director.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. You ever hiring--hiring--not hiring men 
because of your desire to hit certain targets?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am hiring the best-qualified candidates that 
put in an application that want to work for our great 
organization.
    Mr. Grothman. OK.
    Next question. The shooter obtained a direct sight of 
President Trump from the position on the rooftop. I assume that 
is not something that should ever happen. It should never 
happen.
    Do you want to elaborate a little on how that happened or 
what you wish you had done differently or would do differently 
next time there is a Trump rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, sir, the facts of this particular event 
are still unfolding. Nine days, there have been a number of 
reports that have been out there. So, I do not want to provide 
information that perhaps would contradict something that has 
been erroneously reported or is not factual. But there clearly 
was a mistake, and we will take every effort to make sure that 
this never happens again.
    Mr. Grothman. Could you elaborate why you want one-third of 
the Secret Service to be women?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have never stated that I want one-third of 
the Secret Service to be women.
    Mr. Grothman. Thirty percent or something. You had some 
target, no? OK.
    Mr. Jordan. Will the gentleman yield?
    Mr. Grothman. Sure. I will yield.
    Mr. Jordan. What was, Director, what was erroneously 
reported? You said, to Mr. Grothman's question, you said 
something was erroneously reported. What are you referring to?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am referring to----
    Mr. Jordan. His question was in the context of the shooter 
using a ladder to get on the building. What was erroneously 
reported? Because you will not tell us anything, but you will 
tell us something that was not reported accurately?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am saying, sir, that there have been a 
number of reports that are out there that have been 
speculation, and until we have the actual facts, I do not want 
to report anything that would contradict speculation that has 
been out there.
    Mr. Jordan. I yield. Thank the gentleman for yielding.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Mr. Krishnamoorthi 
from Illinois.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Thank you, Mr. Chair, thank you, Mr. 
Ranking Member, for bringing us together this morning.
    One question I get asked a lot from my constituents is, 
what can Congress actually do to stop this from happening 
again?
    And I would like to share a graphic from a very recent 
study conducted by Professor Robert Pape, a world-renowned 
expert in combating political violence. The graphic shows that 
74 percent of Americans want this Congress to come together to 
denounce political violence of all stripes. I mean, you can 
tell it is across party lines.
    I commend the Chair and Ranking Member for putting out the 
statement the other day condemning political violence, and to 
further this effort, I would like to ask all my colleagues to 
join Dr. Brad Wenstrup and me in introducing a resolution that 
we think can secure unanimous House passage in deploring and 
condemning political violence. And we will be circulating that 
resolution shortly.
    Director Cheatle, as you know, the shooter began shooting 
at 6:11 p.m. eastern on July 13. NBC reported that at 5:51 
p.m., 20 minutes before the shooting began, the state police 
informed the Secret Service of their concern.
    Now, the rally was not paused at that point, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And according to NBC, just 2 minutes 
later, at 5:53 p.m., the Secret Service notified its snipers 
about the gunman.
    The rally was not paused at that point either, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Let me show you some video footage by 
rally goers.
    If you could play the video on the screen up here.
    This was taken 2 minutes before the shooting started.
    If you could turn up the volume.
    [Video shown.]
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Ma'am, that does not look like 
suspicious behavior. That looks like threatening behavior to 
me. And the rally was not paused at that point either, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. I can tell you, as I stated earlier, sir, that 
the moment that the shift surrounding the President were aware 
of an actual threat----
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. That is a threat right there. The guy 
is on the roof, and everybody is yelling at him----
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi [continuing]. And directing the 
officers' attention to him. The rally was not paused at that 
point, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are currently still combing through 
communications and when communications were passed.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Well, I can point you to this 
communication. It is 2 minutes before the shots started ringing 
out.
    Director Cheatle, yes or no, was there ever a moment where 
the Secret Service actually considered pausing the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. The Secret Service would have paused the rally 
had they known or been told----
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. So, the answer is no?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. That there was an actual threat.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. The answer is no, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. I can speak to you in generalities.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. No, no. I do not want generalities. I 
want specifics.
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not know all of the communications----
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. The answer is no, you did not consider 
pausing the rally, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. The people that are in charge of protecting 
the President on that day would never bring the former 
President out if there was a threat that had been identified to 
them.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Well, they did, because we have now 
identified three points in the 20 minutes before the shooting 
that the threat emerged.
    Let me point you to something else, which is the building 
that the shooter was perched on seen here. This building is 
called the AGR building. I am sure that you are familiar with 
it. It is no more than 150 yards from the stage where Donald 
Trump stood, yet the security perimeter was drawn such that the 
AGR building was placed outside of it.
    Director Cheatle, according to the Washington Post, the AR-
15-styled rifle used in the shooting had a range of 400 to 600 
yards, and therefore the AGR building is--was clearly within 
rifle range of the stage, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. NBC News has reported that, in the days 
before the rally, the Secret Service had identified the 
building as a vulnerability that required special attention, 
correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is reporting from NBC?
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Yes.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I am still looking into an active 
investigation.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. I know, but it has been 9 days. I mean, 
you should know that, right?
    And yet, despite the fact that the AGR building was in 
rifle range of the stage and it was flagged as a vulnerability, 
this building was put outside of the Secret Service's security 
perimeter.
    And I respectfully submit the Secret Service must expand 
its security perimeter to account for the kinds of weapons that 
can be used outside the perimeter to endanger the protectees 
inside the perimeter, ma'am.
    Let me turn your attention to some conspiracy theories that 
have been circulating and ask you to comment on them.
    First, you have not found evidence that the incident was a 
staged shooting, right?
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And you have not found evidence that 
this was a result of a conspiracy of high-ranking government 
officials, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And you have not found evidence that 
this incident was, in fact, directed or perpetrated by a 
foreign state or entity, right?
    Chairman Comer. And that is the last question, but I will 
let the Director answer that, please.
    Ms. Cheatle. Not at this time.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Cloud from Texas.
    Mr. Cloud. Thank you.
    I just wanted to confirm, there was only one counter-sniper 
who took one shot? Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. We had multiple counter-sniper teams available 
that day.
    Mr. Cloud. Yes, on the premises, but only one took one 
shot? Is that correct? Or only one----
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Mr. Cloud. OK.
    How many spent shell casings were found on the roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I would have to defer you to the FBI's 
criminal investigation.
    Mr. Cloud. OK. Word is, is that the car was rigged with 
explosives?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, sir, I would have to defer you to the 
FBI's investigation.
    Mr. Cloud. OK. You are not curious about--you do not 
communicate with them? No? OK.
    CNN reported that the Secret Service did not sweep the 
building the shooter was used to shoot President Trump and 
other attendees. Is that true or false?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, we are conducting a mission insurance 
investigation, and it will depend on the information that we 
obtain from our investigations.
    Mr. Cloud. OK. The Secret Service knew there was a 
suspicious person anywhere from 8 minutes before the President 
walked on stage to 30 to 60 minutes. We have different reports.
    Was President Trump or his team notified of the threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think there is a difference and a 
distinction between suspicious----
    Mr. Cloud. Suspicious person.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And threat.
    Mr. Cloud. Yes.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, we are going back and looking at 
communications to know when the information about a suspicious 
person was passed to Secret Service personnel.
    Mr. Cloud. OK. But was President Trump or his team 
notified?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, we are going back and looking to make 
sure that we have the exact information of when those 
notifications were made and who those notifications were made 
to.
    Mr. Cloud. OK.
    I think it is troubling for a lot of us that the No. 1 
question everyone in America is wondering is why was the roof 
left open, and after 9 days, we should at least maybe have a 
little bit of that information. And when you come to this 
Committee hearing and you do not have anything to say about 
that, it is very, very troubling.
    Did you review the security plan for this event?
    Ms. Cheatle. I personally do not review security plans for 
events that take place across the country.
    Mr. Cloud. Any of them?
    Ms. Cheatle. We have a number of events that take place----
    Mr. Cloud. Who is the top-level official who reviews the 
security plan?
    Ms. Cheatle. There is a number of people that review 
security plans as they unfold.
    Mr. Cloud. Who is ultimately responsible for signing off on 
a security plan?
    Ms. Cheatle. It is a conjunction of personnel. There are 
people on the ground. There are supervisors on the detail. 
There are people at headquarters.
    Mr. Cloud. So, there is not one person who says, ``OK, this 
is good, it is copacetic, we are going for it''?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think much in the way that we build our 
security plans where they are multilayered----
    Mr. Cloud. No doubt there are teams working different 
aspects of it, but ultimately, is there not an individual who 
signs off on the plan?
    Ms. Cheatle. Much like how we design our security plans, 
they are multilayered. There are multiple layers of people.
    Mr. Cloud. So, there is no accountability?
    Ms. Cheatle. There is accountability, sir.
    Mr. Cloud. This is, whether it is the FBI or Fauci or 
anything, it is time after time after time these multiple 
layers of accountability turn into layers of plausible 
deniability in agency after agency after agency.
    That has got to be fixed, because you keep coming here and 
expecting--yes, you are saying, ``I am responsible,'' but--and 
you are accountable for it--but then there is nothing. What do 
you mean by that? I mean, you are saying you are going to keep 
your job, right?
    Ms. Cheatle. I assure you, sir, that if we determine 
through the course of our investigation that someone or people 
need to be held accountable, we will do so.
    Mr. Cloud. What level of--if President Biden, God forbid, 
had been shot and killed, would you think that was worthy of 
resignation?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would do the same thing that I am doing here 
where I would want to make sure that we are conducting an 
investigation, that there is continuity in that investigation, 
and that we could find the answers for what happened.
    Mr. Cloud. You do not think the assassination of somebody 
under your detail is worthy of resignation?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that this event was tragic and 
deserves answers.
    Mr. Cloud. The thing that you have said so far is that you 
want to make sure that this never happens again. The thing is, 
everyone in America knows that is not the job description that 
you are tasked with. The job description you are tasked with is 
to make sure it never happens, period.
    One of your goals in the strategic plan is to champion 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. You have 
accomplished the accessibility part.
    What standards--do you keep the same standards for all 
applicants and all--does every Secret Service agent meet the 
same qualifications, or do you have different standards for 
different people?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir. Everyone who moves through the 
application process has to meet the same standards to become a 
special agent.
    Mr. Cloud. OK.
    The trouble I think we are having with right now--so far, 
you gave a lame excuse for sloped roof. You said that local law 
enforcement's job was to cover up the building before 
backtracking on that. We were told that President Trump's team 
did not ask for security before you backtracked on that. You 
have not provided the audio recording that this Committee--the 
Chairman requested that was due Thursday. You did not give us 
an advanced copy of your opening statement, but yet there was 
reporting on it somewhere else. There seems to be more 
information from YouTube videos than you are able to provide 
for us.
    And it begs the question to anyone, you are in charge of 
the investigation of your own failure, so how is anybody in 
America supposed to be able to trust the results of that 
investigation as being anything transparent and genuine?
    Chairman Comer. That is the last question, but please feel 
free to answer the question, Director.
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I have been a Secret Service agent for 
nearly 30 years. I have led with integrity, and I follow our 
core values of duty, justice, honor, loyalty, and courage, and 
I am doing that in this case. And I assure this Committee that 
I will provide answers when we have a full and complete report 
in addition to cooperating with all of the other investigations 
that are ongoing.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Khanna from 
California.
    Mr. Khanna. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I want to thank the Chair and the Ranking Member for 
convening this hearing on a bipartisan basis. I join them in 
condemning the horrific assassination attempt on the former 
President. I am relieved for the sake of the country that he 
was not seriously hurt and that he survived, and my thoughts 
are with him and his family during such a traumatic event.
    I also want to express condolences to Corey Comperatore's 
family and recognize his heroism in saving his daughters' lives 
and to the victims of that awful event.
    Now, Director Cheatle, would you agree that this is the 
most serious security lapse since President Reagan was shot in 
1981 of the Secret Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir, I would.
    Mr. Khanna. And, you know, do you know what Stuart Knight 
did when--he was in charge at the time of the Secret Service. 
Do you know what he did afterwards?
    Ms. Cheatle. He remained on duty.
    Mr. Khanna. He resigned. He resigned. And Stuart Knight was 
not a Democratic appointee or a Republican appointee.
    Look, I am not questioning your judgment. I just do not 
think this is partisan. If you have an assassination attempt on 
a President, a former President, or a candidate, you need to 
resign. That is what Stuart Knight did. He was a Republican 
appointee, and he took responsibility.
    And I think you need to reflect. This is not a question of 
you. It is a question of the American people. You cannot go 
leading a Secret Service agency when there is an assassination 
attempt on a Presidential candidate. I would say that about 
anyone who is running.
    And so, I guess my question to you is, what is the 
difference between your position and what Stuart Knight did?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I will tell you, sir, is that I am 
dedicated to finding the answers to what happens. And like 
every Secret Service agent, we do not shirk our 
responsibilities. I will remain on and be responsible to the 
agency, to this Committee, to the former President, and to the 
American public.
    Mr. Khanna. But is there a reason you would not just do 
what Stuart Knight did after the Reagan assassination attempt?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that I provided an answer.
    Mr. Khanna. There is nothing more that you have to say? I 
mean, do you really believe at this moment, given how divided 
the country is and the questions asked, that your service in 
this role is the best for the Nation? I mean, I am not saying 
you cannot do public service again, you cannot do something 
else again.
    Do you really genuinely in your heart believe that you 
being in this role is what is right for America at this moment? 
I mean, do you think there are people who are Trump supporters 
who have confidence in you?
    The one thing that the--we have got to have agencies in 
this country that transcend politics, that have the confidence 
of independents, Democrats, Republicans, progressives, 
conservatives.
    Do you really believe that the majority of this country has 
confidence in you right now?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that the country deserves answers, 
and I am committed to finding those answers and providing those 
answers.
    Mr. Khanna. Well, I believe, Director Cheatle, that you 
should resign. I think there are colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle who believe that. And I hope you will consider it.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Palmer from 
Alabama for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Director Cheatle, did local law enforcement ESU 
teams have compromise authority to engage a perceived threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Palmer. Why do you think they did not use it?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that they follow the same use of 
force that our agents----
    Mr. Palmer. You do not--when you have compromise authority, 
you do not have to get permission if you perceive a threat. And 
there were not just the ESU units, but there were local law 
enforcement that had line of sight on the shooter before the 
shots were taken.
    So, one of my questions is, there was supposed to be a 
briefing with the Secret Service sniper units, your 
counterassault team members, with the contract team, with the 
local ESU teams. That did not take place. Why was that?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I have been told that there has been a 
briefing. There was a briefing that took place.
    Mr. Palmer. I have been told that there was not one.
    Ms. Cheatle. And, again, we are still looking into the 
facts of the investigation, so----
    Mr. Palmer. Let me ask you this. When were you informed 
that there was a credible threat against President Trump--
former President Trump? When did you learn of that?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, the former President has a number of 
threats.
    Mr. Palmer. I did not ask you that. There was a credible 
threat from Iran. When were you informed of that? Answer the 
question.
    Ms. Cheatle. We have been monitoring the threats for the 
former President----
    Mr. Palmer. You knew before the rally. OK? All right?
    The site security plan is generally drafted by the site 
supervisor and the site agent, probably out of the Pittsburgh 
district office. Did they take into account the credible threat 
against President Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. Our personnel take into account the threats 
that are out there.
    Mr. Palmer. Then why would they leave a building--and I 
will correct the distance that has been quoted, it was about 
140 yards with clear line of sight to the President. Why was 
that building not occupied on the roof? I mean, you could have 
put Barney Fife on the roof and kept somebody from getting up 
there. So, why was that not done?
    Ms. Cheatle. The plan that was developed that day 
encompassed a number of security mitigations.
    Mr. Palmer. No, ma'am. The issue is the site supervisor, 
the site agent, and the special agent in charge--who I think 
signed off on the plan--did not include that in the inner 
perimeter, and they did not have a plan to secure the building.
    As I understand it, the Butler County ESU unit was situated 
on the second floor of a building next to that, but they did 
not have a clear line of sight of the roof. The angle was too 
severe.
    The photograph that was taken of the young man--of the 
shooter--when he had the range finder was taken at 5:15. It was 
not until 5:38 that that photograph was transmitted to the 
Secret Service sniper unit.
    I do not understand the lack of interoperability here in 
the communication process. I do not understand why people did 
not perceive that as a credible threat. The video that Mr. 
Krishnamoorthi had shown there was clearly a credible threat.
    So, how is it that all of these mistakes could be made?
    How many explosive devices were found on or near the site?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I would have to defer you to the FBI--
--
    Mr. Palmer. Madam, I believe they were in his car, and I 
think there might have been one near a main gas line.
    It was not just the fact that he had a rifle. It was the 
fact that he had the ability to inflict enormous harm, enormous 
numbers of casualties had those devices exploded.
    I want to know also, when your agents conduct a site 
review, are they fully informed of all of the threats that are 
being made against the principal that they are protecting?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that when our agents go 
out to conduct an advance their whole goal is to ensure the 
safety and security----
    Mr. Palmer. I understand what the goal is. The failure to 
secure that building not only put the former President's life 
in danger, it put the lives of individuals in the crowd in 
danger as well. I mean, the Reagan shooting, there were other 
people shot at that time as well, and the Secret Service 
members' lives were in danger.
    So, I do not understand how you can continue to stay in the 
position you are in when this was a failure of historic 
magnitude. Forty-three years without anything like this 
happening, and you failed, in this case, in a spectacular way.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair recognizes Mr. Mfume from Maryland.
    Mr. Mfume. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to commend you and 
the Ranking Member on your joint statement and for holding this 
hearing that we might all at least attempt to try to get some 
answers.
    Some of us, Ms. Cheatle, grew up in an era not too unlike 
what we see today in terms of political violence. And some of 
us remember the November 22, 1963, assassination of President 
Kennedy. Some of us, like myself, remember 2 days later when 
Jack Ruby, on live TV, shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald.
    We have seen over and over and over since that time these 
kind of attempts, whether it was the assassination of Martin 
Luther King or Bobby Kennedy, or the attempted attack on George 
Wallace in Laurel, Maryland, the shooting in 1981 of Ronald 
Reagan, our friend and colleague Steve Scalise shooting here in 
D.C., and the unfortunate attack on Paul Pelosi, and now this 
matter regarding former President Trump.
    Let me try, if I might, to take another walk at this.
    People just assume that whoever is in charge takes full 
responsibility when there has never been, at least on this 
magnitude and scale, this sort of failure. So, when Members ask 
you are you going to resign and you say you have no intention 
to, they are perplexed, like many people who watch what is 
going on.
    And there are some things I just do not understand.
    Why was the building, the ARG building, placed outside of 
the perimeter when, clearly, it was close enough for someone to 
launch an attack?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again, sir, we are looking into all of the 
details of how the advance was comprised, but I can tell you 
that there was overwatch on that building provided that day.
    Mr. Mfume. By a drone?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not going to get into the specifics of 
technology or assets that were used in this forum.
    Mr. Mfume. OK. OK. Well, I think it is fair to say the 
overwatch failed because the shooter got up on the roof and 
stayed there for a while, and people had pointed him out.
    So, do you think that your overwatch was a failure in that 
case?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that we need to know the full details 
to understand how this occurred.
    Mr. Mfume. And why was the rooftop left naked to begin 
with, can you tell us that, considering it was within the line 
of sight and so very close?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I cannot speak to the specifics of this 
particular event site. But what I can tell you is that, when 
the Secret Service develops an advance plan, they take into 
account a number of factors when they are building their 
advance. If there are buildings or areas of concern and 
overwatch is one of those mitigations that they want to put in 
place, then they will cover off areas of responsibility.
    Mr. Mfume. I understand that, but the shooter came to the 
attention of your agency 52 minutes before the former President 
got to the stage.
    Did anybody get assigned to watch or cover that individual 
who had already been seen with an advanced finder on him and 
other suspicious matters? Was anybody assigned to track him?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, what I would like to clarify is that a 
suspicious individual----
    Mr. Mfume. I got that part, is not a threat. I know. I 
know.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Was brought to the attention of 
our personnel. And, again, having a range finder at an outdoor 
event----
    Mr. Mfume. Well, let me ask you this. When the suspicious 
person was brought to the attention of the Secret Service, was 
anybody in the detail ordered to follow and stay with that 
suspicious person just because they might become a threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, we have a number of teams that are on the 
ground. And, again, we are trying to verify the timelines of 
when those notifications were made to our personnel so that 
they could assume the responsibility of trying to track that 
individual.
    Mr. Mfume. Ms. Cheatle, there has been a lot of 
discussion--some of which raised itself earlier in this 
hearing--about poor staff morale within your agency. And I have 
the July 17 report of Government Executive, which is a credible 
reporting service for the Federal Government for employees, and 
the 2023 ranking of places to work within the Federal 
Government showed--and this is through the Office of Personnel 
Management--that the Secret Service came in 413th out of 459 
subagencies and agencies.
    Can you explain that?
    Ms. Cheatle. Certainly. What I can tell you is the Secret 
Service is a difficult job. It challenges our employees daily. 
It is holidays. It is weekends. It is no-leave periods.
    Mr. Mfume. But, madam, people come to work knowing that. 
You do explain that when you hire somebody. They know that. It 
is the same with other agencies. They miss holidays. They come 
to work at odd hours.
    But to be worst, one of the worst places to work within the 
Federal Government, 413 out of 459, I just need an explanation. 
What do you think as the Director there?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think----
    Chairman Comer. And that is the last question, but please 
answer Mr. Mfume's question.
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that this is a challenging job. I 
think that it is a challenging environment to be in law 
enforcement. And we do have a no-fail mission, and our folks 
are tasked with that every day, 365 days of the year.
    But I can tell you I have also taken a number of measures 
since I have been the Director to recruit and retain and stem 
the tide of attrition in our agency, which will hopefully 
alleviate some of that.
    Mr. Mfume. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Sessions from 
Texas.
    Mr. Sessions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I join in 
the calls of all of our Members to say thank you for doing this 
hearing on a bipartisan basis.
    Director, I am not going to sit here and say you ought to 
resign, but I am going to say that you have not given us 
confidence that you have the ability to understand what 
happened, to take the responsibility in terms of understanding.
    You have spent a number of years--how many years do you say 
you have been with the agency?
    Ms. Cheatle. Twenty-nine.
    Mr. Sessions. Well, I spent 16 years with AT&T, moved seven 
times with them, and had a really good feel about their 
operations, how they worked, what was acceptable, who was 
responsible. And I have heard you say today numbers of times: 
Well, you have got to wait. Well, you have got to wait. Wait 
for the final report.
    When is the ``final'' final going to happen?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am----
    Mr. Sessions. I mean, how long do we have to wait before 
you can give us credible answers? You have been there 28 years. 
You have had a few days to be able to draw your own analysis of 
this. You should understand the entire process.
    You talked about being on the team perhaps in Georgia. You 
have talked about your experience in this. You have talked 
about the professional nature of the agency. That, I do not 
doubt.
    But the Director, just like it was when I ran my operations 
at AT&T, was responsible for making sure they worked. And in 
business, it either works or it does not work. There is no in 
between. It either works or it does not work.
    And your job as the, in essence, administrator, the 
Director, is to make sure it looks right and works. And I have 
not heard you say one thing about, ``my analysis is. I have 
asked these questions.'' It is always, ``I have got to sit back 
and wait for someone else to decide that.''
    So, I am going to ask you a question that maybe you can 
answer.
    Have any employees been disciplined for their role in the 
Butler, PA, incident?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, sir, not at this time. I am asking those 
questions.
    Mr. Sessions. So, no employee has been disciplined and no 
employee has been placed in any position that would place their 
job in jeopardy nor their standing in the agency?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are still in the process of interviewing 
people.
    Mr. Sessions. That is not what I asked. You are the person 
that runs the place. You are the person that knows right from 
wrong, good from bad. You have had a number of days. And now 
you come before this Committee, knowing you are going to be 
before us, and you have got to slough it off to someone else.
    Do you see where there was something that went wrong, as a 
professional at an agency for 28 years, or do you have to count 
on someone else to give you the final report?
    Ms. Cheatle. I see that something went wrong, and I have 
acknowledged that something went wrong.
    Mr. Sessions. Then what went wrong?
    Ms. Cheatle. I need to----
    Mr. Sessions. Was the special agent in charge not doing 
their job? Was the shooter not--was the shooter given extra 
time? Was the sniper doing their job?
    I mean, these are things that people who have been around 
for 28 years can analyze quickly.
    I watched it live on TV and then within minutes saw a 
number of facts and factors that would have and should have 
been known by people who were there. You have got 28 years. You 
are showing up here telling us and the American public, ``Well, 
I have got to wait for the final answer.''
    What is your evaluation?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am asking those same questions.
    Mr. Sessions. Well, no, you are before the Committee.
    Ms. Cheatle. And I----
    Mr. Sessions. Tell us what went wrong. A special agent in 
charge? The person who was there? Tell us and do not try and 
play a shell game with us.
    Do you have the ability to effectively, as the Director of 
this agency, to understand what went wrong and at least tell 
us, ``I do or do not know what I am doing''?
    And we come away with--and I am not asking for you to 
resign. I am asking for you, if you have got this experience, 
then you should be able to say to us, ``We know what we did 
wrong. It was a failure in our system. And we are immediately 
making these corrections.''
    That is why you are having a difficult time with this group 
of Members of Congress, because we saw it, too. We have seen 
the things.
    But you are the 28-year expert. You are the person that--
and only you--that can make the changes. And I hear you say, 
``Well, I have got to wait for a final report before I, at 28 
years experience.''
    That is why we think what you are doing, the answers you 
are giving us, are not correct and you are not using your 
professional expertise.
    Mr. Chairman, I will allow her to respond.
    Ms. Cheatle. I am asking those same questions, sir. And I 
assure you, when I have a full and complete report of exactly 
what happened, there will be accountability, and we will make 
changes.
    Chairman Comer. Before I recognize--just out of curiosity, 
Director, it has been 9 days. Every American wants these 
questions answered.
    Do you have a ballpark estimate of when what Mr. Sessions 
asked you would be able to answer----
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I can tell you----
    Chairman Comer [continuing]. Time-wise?
    Ms. Cheatle. I can tell you on our mission assurance 
internal investigation, we are targeting to have that completed 
within 60 days.
    There is also an external investigation that is going to be 
taking place. There are a number of Office of Inspector General 
investigations as well, and we are working in concert. And 
then, of course, there is the Department of Justice/FBI 
criminal investigation.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez from 
New York.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, respectfully, what you had just laid out 
about 60 days--we are currently in the midst of an especially 
concentrated Presidential campaign in the moment. That is also 
paired with, of course, elections happening across the country 
that are happening in about 100 days.
    So, the notion of a report coming out in 60 days when the 
threat environment is so high in the United States--
irrespective of party--is not acceptable, and I think it is 
very important to understand that.
    This is not theater. This is not about jockeying. This is 
about the safety of some of the most highly targeted and valued 
targets, internationally and domestically, in the United States 
of America.
    So, the idea that a report will be finalized in 60 days, 
let alone prior to any actionable decisions that would be made, 
is simply not acceptable. It has been 10 days since an 
assassination attempt on a former President of the United 
States. Regardless of party, there need to be answers.
    Again, this party--this Committee--this is not a moment of 
theater. We have to make policy decisions, and we have to make 
them now. We do.
    And that may be a--and that may require legislation. That 
may require policy that we must pass in the immediate term. And 
without that, we are flying blind.
    So, the lack of answers and the lack of a report is just 
simply not something that we can accept here.
    Director Cheatle, is there a standard perimeter that the 
Secret Service establishes around an event, or are those 
perimeters independently determined per event and scenario?
    Ms. Cheatle. There is no standard. Every event and every 
venue is different and treated as such.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. So, each event has a different perimeter 
that is established depending on the logistics of that event.
    Now, you established earlier that the building upon which 
the shooter operated from was outside of that established 
perimeter, correct, for the Butler, Pennsylvania, event?
    Ms. Cheatle. It was outside of our secure perimeter, yes.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Now, that building was, I believe, 500--
how far away was that building from the President?
    Ms. Cheatle. It was approximately 200 yards.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Two hundred yards.
    Now, the individual used an AR-15 in order to act out his 
assassination attempt. An AR-15 has a range of about 4-to 600 
yards.
    My question is, why does the Secret Service perimeter--why 
is the Secret Service protective perimeter shorter than one of 
the most popular semiautomatic weapons in the United States?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of weapons out there with a 
number of ranges. Again, an advance was completed. The 
determination of the perimeter--I am not going to speak to 
specifics--but there are a number of factors that are taken 
into account when we determine our perimeter. Some of it has to 
do with terrain. Some of it has to do with buildings. Some of 
it has to do with assets and resources that are available.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. And so, what I am hearing is that a 
perimeter was not established outdoors, in an outdoor venue, 
that would prevent an AR-15--which is one of the most common 
weapons used in mass shootings--from being able to be within 
the range of Secret Service protection?
    Ms. Cheatle. A perimeter was established, and even though 
there were buildings that were outside of that perimeter, it 
was not just that building, there were a number of buildings in 
the area, and there was overwatch that was created to help 
mitigate some of those buildings.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Respectfully, Dr. Cheatle, as well, as a 
person who has experienced an enormous amount of threat 
incidents, including incidents that have never been reported 
publicly, what--there is a common pattern that happens here, 
whether it is Secret Service, FBI, Capitol Police, local 
departments.
    After a critical security failure, we often hear there will 
be an independent investigation. That independent investigation 
gets set up. Usually, the expectation is between 2 to 3 months 
after the incident. And then nothing really occurs from there. 
The report is usually not satisfactory to the questions that 
are usually being raised here, and most importantly, corrective 
action is rarely taken.
    If I were to state anything that I think is profoundly 
important, it is that we need to have answers to the public. 
Ideally, I would encourage you and the agency to be more 
forthright with the Members that still have yet to have their 
questioning because the public deserves to have full 
confidence, and the stakes are too high.
    The violence that could break out in this political moment, 
regardless of party, in the event of someone getting hurt 
constitutes a national security threat to the entire country.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Ms. Cheatle. Can I go back to something you said?
    Chairman Comer. Yes, please. Feel free, Director.
    Ms. Cheatle. Ma'am, if I could just speak to something you 
said at the outset when you started your questioning.
    I want to assure you and everyone on this Committee that I 
am not waiting for a report to take action. We have been 
conducting analysis all along, and we have been adding 
additional features to our security details since this incident 
occurred.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. And I would hope you can highlight and 
illuminate what some of those are in the event of other 
Members' questioning as well.
    Chairman Comer. Very good.
    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Biggs.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I request unanimous consent for that photo to go into the 
official record.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you.
    Director, your agency has a no-fail mission, and on 
Saturday, July 13, your agency spectacularly failed. The 
failure resulted in the death of Corey Comperatore and serious 
injury to two other rally attendees, David Dutch and James 
Copenhaver, besides the injuries to President Trump.
    It is unfathomable that a 20-year-old on the radar of 
Secret Service and local law enforcement before President Trump 
went on stage was able to climb onto the roof of a building 
with a rifle and fire off multiple rounds before he was 
neutralized.
    Was Mr. Crooks acting alone?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I would have to refer you to the FBI's 
investigation.
    Mr. Biggs. Was he just a lone gunman?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would have to refer you to the FBI's 
investigation for motive.
    Mr. Biggs. What did the Technical Services Division 
determine was going to be the event perimeter?
    Ms. Cheatle. Those are questions that we are asking, and we 
are----
    Mr. Biggs. I mean, you are sitting here today. Come on, 
Director. Everybody said this. You knew you were going to be 
asked that question because it has been asked multiple times.
    So, this is an easy one. What did they determine was going 
to be the event perimeter? So, you should know that. I mean, 
this is not, ``Gee, I got to wait till someone else tells me.'' 
What was it?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I do not want to speak to specifics of 
the event that took place.
    Mr. Biggs. OK. This is a specific.
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand.
    Mr. Biggs. This is a specific that you ought to know. As 
someone who said, ``The buck stops with me, I am going to stay 
in my job, I am going to give the answers to the American 
people, and I know what happened''--except you are not going to 
tell us and you are not going to tell the American people.
    And you, yourself, said in an interview that that foments 
this notion of conspiracy theories. Guess what? When you sit 
here and repeatedly tell people, ``Hey, I have to wait,'' as it 
frustrated everybody on this Committee, guess what? It 
undermines your credibility and whether you are really going to 
get to it.
    So, I am going to ask you again. What did the Technical 
Service Division determine was going to be the event perimeter?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are still gathering reports. We are 
interviewing individuals.
    Mr. Biggs. You know what it is, though, now. You are just 
not going to tell us, right?
    Ms. Cheatle. When I have those details, I will most 
certainly share those.
    Mr. Biggs. Was the gun already on the roof, or did the 
shooter carry the gun up with him?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have that information at this time.
    Mr. Biggs. Well, when was the last sweep of that roof done 
prior to the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have that information at this time.
    Mr. Biggs. So, how many holds--I mean, so most of us here 
have been in events and Secret Service has been there, there 
has been security. And I cannot tell you how many times we have 
said there is going to be a security hold right here, so we are 
going to wait. And we wait to 1 or 2 or 3 minutes. And yet we 
are hearing from you, apparently, that there were no holds in 
place ever instituted here with President Trump's going on 
stage.
    And you said--and this is, I think, connected with this--
you said they had not adjudicated the shooter to be a threat. 
He was adjudicated to be a suspicious person, even though we 
got some dynamic video that Mr. Krishnamoorthi put on the video 
for us.
    So, I guess my question for you is--and I think you 
answered this, I just want to see if you are consistent with 
what you said about an hour and a half ago--what do you do if a 
suspicious person is identified by the agency?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, at a number of our events, it is not 
unusual for----
    Mr. Biggs. I know it is not unusual. What do you do?
    Ms. Cheatle. Those individuals that are identified as 
suspicious, we will send teams out to----
    Mr. Biggs. Was a team sent out here then?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were teams that were sent to identify 
and interview that individual.
    Mr. Biggs. They were sent to interview the individual who 
scampered up in camo on top of a roof within 130 yards of his 
target. And did they--did your team get there? When did your 
team get there to conduct that interview?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have the details on a timeline. It is 
my----
    Mr. Biggs. So, if you did send--if your team--if they did 
send a team and they are going to interview him, you said--you 
described that earlier as an investigation--why did they not 
put a security hold on President Trump going on stage at that 
rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. At a number of our protective sites there are 
suspicious individuals that are identified all the time. That 
does not necessarily mean that they constitute a threat.
    Mr. Biggs. Of course not. But here you have got a guy 
scampering up the side of a building on top of a roof, it is 
identified to you, and you said you sent a team there. And you 
cannot answer that.
    And this gets to my--one of my finer points, Mr. Chairman, 
if I can make it, and that is, we can have these kind of 
interview sessions. Five minutes, you know, everybody gets a 
kiss at the pig. Five minutes, and she gets to stonewall us, 
not deliver answers.
    So, we say, OK, we are going to put together a 
congressional committee, a blue-ribbon committee. Same crap 
will happen.
    I am calling--and I will support that--but I will tell you 
this. I am calling on the Speaker to give us and put together a 
truly independent commission of qualified former Secret Service 
agents, Presidential and VIP protective services people who can 
actually conduct this kind of investigation and give us real 
answers, because I do not think you are going to give us those 
answers. You should have come today ready to give us answers. I 
call upon you to resign today--today.
    And I also would say I have got a bunch of UC requests, if 
I can go ahead, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. Proceed with the requests.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. I apologize. It might take----
    Chairman Comer. That is all right. Go ahead.
    Mr. Biggs. It might take a moment.
    Chairman Comer. Very important.
    So, Anthony Guglielmi, the Secret Service spokesman, one

    Mr. Biggs. You do not want me to read--is it too tedious?
    Mr. Raskin. Well, we are not even really hearing them 
anyway, so if we could--it is up to you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Biggs. Would you like me to slow--I will slow down. I 
was probably going too fast.

    Chairman Comer. Mr. Biggs, we will stop right there. We can 
retake them on the next one. I know there are more.
    Mr. Biggs. OK.
    Chairman Comer. But, without objection, we will enter into 
the record all of those, and we will take up the others after 
the next speaker.
    The Chair now recognizes Ms. Brown from Ohio for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I first want to highlight certain comments from Ranking 
Member Raskin, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
President Biden, and Vice President Harris, and that is, 
political violence is completely unacceptable in this country, 
full stop. It is an assault on our democracy itself and I am 
devastated by this attack on a candidate for the President, for 
the office of the highest office in the land and continue to 
pray for the victims of this shooting and their families.
    As someone who has known gun violence firsthand, no one 
should have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to 
weapons of war.
    It is deeply unfortunate political violence has become far 
too common. Whether it is the deadly attack on the Capitol on 
January 6, the assault on Speaker Pelosi's husband, or the 
threats of violence against election workers, we all must work 
to condemn political violence and tone down the rhetoric.
    So, Director Cheatle, on behalf of the hardworking men and 
women of the Secret Service, can you give us some perspective 
into what goes into securing an event like the rally, like how 
much time do you have to prepare?
    Ms. Cheatle. Thank you for the question.
    Generally, when we receive notification that there is going 
to be an event taking place at a venue, the advance team 
assignments are made, and there is a 5-day process to conduct 
walkthroughs, coordinate with staff, local staff, whether it be 
campaign staff or the protectee's staff, and then with local 
law enforcement on where the perimeter is going to be, the size 
and the scope of the event, how many attendees there are going 
to be, if it is an indoor rally/outdoor rally, what sort of 
assets are available locally, what sort of assets the Secret 
Service can bring to bear, and what the scope of the event that 
the staff is trying to accomplish.
    Ms. Brown. So, to that point, how many agents were 
recommended or requested, as opposed to how many were assigned?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I am not going to get into specifics of 
how many were assigned, but those numbers that were requested 
were provided.
    Ms. Brown. And how many local agents were involved in the 
preparation, if you will, that you talked about, that 5-day 
preparation?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, there were a number of local agents from 
the local office, as well as agents from the former Trump 
detail, that were involved in that advance process.
    Ms. Brown. Do we have a number?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do have a number. I am not going to release 
that number in this setting.
    Ms. Brown. You are not making this easy for us.
    This is a shocking incident on the former President's life 
and an appalling instance of political violence and a threat to 
our democratic values.
    I am thankful that the former President is on the mend. 
And, again, I am grieving for the family and friends of Corey 
Comperatore who lost a loved one in this shooting and now know 
the unbearable pain of gun violence.
    I really hope this serves as a reminder about our 
responsibility to attack policies, not personalities; to be 
honest and truthful; and to treat one another with dignity, 
respect, and thoughtfulness.
    And, with that, I yield my remaining time to Ranking Member 
Raskin.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Ms. Brown, for those very powerful 
and moving remarks.
    Director Cheatle, we do not want to lose a Presidential 
candidate to an AR-15 attack. We cannot lose a Presidential 
candidate to an AR-15 attack. And we cannot lose any more 
citizens to AR-15 mass violence, mass shootings. And we 
certainly do not want an attempted AR-15 assassination or 
assassination attempt to set off political violence or riots in 
America. So, this is deadly serious business.
    The Vice Ranking Member pointed out that a report in 60 
days will not do it for us, because we have a responsibility, 
Members of Congress have a responsibility, to take action now 
if there is anything we can do to prevent this.
    So, my question for you is, what is informing your 
operational decisions right now that you have invoked? Without 
a report, can you tell us what are the preliminary judgments? 
Or--if you do not want to foreshadow the report, fine--what are 
your personal, professional judgments informing the operational 
decisions you are making right now?
    Ms. Cheatle. Certainly. And I appreciate that question.
    I do not want to make any preliminary judgments on what 
happened on this particular day, but I can tell you that we 
have looked at, as we did immediately in the aftermath, what 
the security plan for the Republican National Convention was 
going to be, and we made adjustments to the interior of the 
perimeter there.
    We looked at the protectees that we have here in the 
Washington, DC, area and our protective sites, and we did make 
some adjustments to their security posture.
    And as we continue to move through the next several weeks--
even yesterday, with the announcement of the President no 
longer running, we have made adjustments to the Vice 
President's detail. We are already prepared for an eventual VP 
nominee, and we continue to make those assessments.
    I think it just shows how dynamic the environment is that 
this agency works in every day.
    Mr. Raskin. So, you have made the same kinds of commonsense 
judgments and intuitive recommendations that members of the 
public and Members of Congress are asking about right----
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Raskin [continuing]. Now?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Raskin. OK.
    Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you to the gentlelady.
    Chairman Comer. And before I recognize Ms. Mace, I have to 
say, Director, we are pretty close to the halfway point during 
this. You answered more questions with an ABC reporter than you 
have with Members of Congress. We have a lot more questions. 
The American people are demanding that we get answers to those 
questions. And that is what the purpose of this hearing is 
today.
    So, I am sure a lot of the questions that have already been 
asked are going to be asked again, and hopefully we can get 
some answers to those questions. I strongly implore you to 
answer those questions. You are here with a subpoena, and we 
expect you to answer the questions.
    The Chair now recognizes Ms. Mace from South Carolina.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, the American people are watching, and 
they are wondering if there are any questions you can answer 
honestly today.
    So, Director Cheatle, I have a series of questions, very 
specific questions. I want very specific answers. Most of my 
questions are going to demand a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer. Do 
you understand?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do.
    Ms. Mace. OK.
    My first question: both sides of the aisle today have asked 
for your resignation. Would you like to use my 5 minutes to 
draft your resignation letter, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, thank you.
    Ms. Mace. Was this a colossal failure?
    Ms. Cheatle. It was a failure.
    Ms. Mace. Yes or no, was it a colossal failure, is the 
question. Yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have admitted this is a terrible tragedy----
    Ms. Mace. This is a ``yes'' or ``no'' series of questions. 
Was this a colossal failure, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. Was this tragedy preventable, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. Has the Secret Service been transparent with this 
Committee?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. Would you say the fact that we had to issue a 
subpoena to get you to show up today as being transparent, yes 
or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have always been----
    Ms. Mace. Yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Eager to come in----
    Ms. Mace. You did not want to answer the question.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And talk to the Committee.
    Ms. Mace. We had to issue a subpoena to get you to show up 
today. That is not transparent, by the way.
    You stated earlier, Secret Service is not political. Is 
that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. OK. Would you say leaking your opening statement 
to Punchbowl News, Politico's Playbook, and the Washington Post 
several hours before you sent it to this Committee as being 
political, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have no idea how my statement got out.
    Ms. Mace. Well, that is bullshit.
    So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous consent to 
enter into the record articles by Punchbowl News, Politico 
Playbook, Washington Post, all done at 5:24 a.m., 6:12 a.m., 
6:34 a.m., a solid 3 to 4 hours before this Committee got your 
statement.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Ms. Mace. OK.
    Is the Secret Service fully cooperating with our Committee?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. OK. You say you are fully cooperating with this 
Committee.
    On July 15, this Committee sent you a list of demands of 
information that we wanted. Has the Secret Service provided 
this Committee a complete list of all law enforcement personnel 
that were there that day? Have you done that? Have you provided 
a list to the Oversight Committee, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. I will have to get back to you on that.
    Ms. Mace. That is a ``no.''
    Have you provided all audio and video recordings in your 
possession to this Committee, as we asked on July 15, yes or 
no?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would have to get back to you on that.
    Ms. Mace. That is a ``no.''
    You are full of shit today. You are just being completely 
dishonest----
    Mr. Mfume. Mr. Chairman----
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Chairman----
    Mr. Mfume [continuing]. A point of privilege.
    Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Come on.
    Ms. Mace. Mr. Chairman, I am going to continue.
    Mr. Mfume. We have to maintain decorum in this Committee--
--
    Ms. Mace. Any----
    Mr. Mfume [continuing]. No matter how----
    Ms. Mace. Have you provided----
    Mr. Mfume [continuing]. Upset we get.
    Ms. Mace [continuing]. Any and all memos to this Committee 
that we have asked you on July 15? Have you provided all 
memorandums within the Secret Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would have to get back to you on that.
    Ms. Mace. That is a ``no.''
    You are being dishonest or lying. Like, I just--you are 
being dishonest here with this Committee. These are important 
questions that the American people want answers to. And you are 
just--you are just dodging and talking around it in 
generalities.
    And we had to subpoena you to be here, and you will not 
even answer the questions. We have asked you repeatedly to 
answer our questions. This is not hard. These are not hard 
questions.
    Have you provided us all communications from the Secret 
Service related to that day or that rally? Have you provided 
this Committee--we have asked for this information on July 15. 
Have you provided any of this information that this Committee 
has asked of the Secret Service, any of it?
    Ms. Cheatle. I will have to get back to you on that.
    Ms. Mace. Have you even read this letter that we sent you? 
Did you even read this?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Mace. OK. And you have said you do not know, you have 
no idea. Well, the answer is ``no.'' We have not gotten a 
single document or piece of information or data from you or 
your agency related to the rally that we have asked you for.
    So, is this--was this attempted assassination of Donald 
Trump a failure of training or execution or both?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that those are answers that we need to 
examine----
    Ms. Mace. Training, execution, or both? Which one?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think those are answers----
    Ms. Mace. All right. How many----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. We have to determine.
    Ms. Mace. How many Secret Service personnel have lost their 
jobs due to this colossal failure?
    Ms. Cheatle. At this time, none.
    Ms. Mace. How many Secret Service personnel have been 
required to take a refresher course on how not to let people 
shoot Donald Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. Our personnel are currently operational. We 
are examining the facts of this investigation, and we will make 
the changes necessary----
    Ms. Mace. What time did law enforcement become aware that 
there was an individual on the roof with a clear line of sight 
to President Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am still verifying timelines.
    Ms. Mace. Of course. Nine days in, you have no answers.
    How many minutes went by between the time law enforcement 
saw and took photos of Crooks and the shooting? How many 
minutes?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am still verifying----
    Ms. Mace. Fifty-----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Timelines.
    Ms. Mace [continuing]. Seven minutes.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentlelady yields back.
    Before I recognize Ms. Stansbury, I believe I want to 
recognize Mr. Mfume for a unanimous consent.
    Mr. Mfume. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I beg your 
indulgence. I meant to do this earlier.
    I would like to have unanimous consent that it be submitted 
for the record the ``2023 Ranking of Best and Worst Workplaces 
in the Federal Government'', compiled by the Office of 
Personnel Management, which shows the United States Secret 
Service coming in, again, as I said earlier, 413th out of 459 
sub-agencies. And this appears in the July 17 edition of 
Government Executive.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Stansbury from 
New Mexico.
    Ms. Stansbury. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    You know, I want to start by just saying that part of why 
you have bipartisan agreement here on the dais about the 
severity and importance of this hearing is because this is not 
just a single shooting, this is about national security and the 
security of our democracy. It is not just one operational 
failure; this is about, are our public officials safe, and what 
does that signal to our country and to the world about American 
security and the ability of our officials to do their job 
safely?
    So, I want to start by saying thank you to all of our brave 
men and women who are in the uniform, whether it is the Secret 
Service or local law enforcement, who put their lives on the 
line. I think, obviously, we honor their service, but this is 
really about operational failures and what it means for our 
country at large.
    And I also want to reaffirm that we must condemn 
unequivocally political violence of any kind--violence of any 
kind, not just political violence, and that it cannot be 
tolerated in this democracy, and also to offer my prayers for 
the slain fire chief, Corey Comperatore, and also prayers for 
those who have been injured.
    Now, I think, you know, the tone of this hearing is, how is 
it that a 20-year-old young man with a gun that was legally 
purchased by his father could, on the day of a rally, go to a 
gun shop, legally purchase ammunition, show up to a secured 
site, and then not only attempt an assassination of a political 
figure but kill and injure two others? How could this happen? I 
am not asking yet. I think we have had a lot of testimony here 
today.
    I want to talk a little bit about the timeline. Now, here 
is what we know.
    And I know, Director, you were also on the call that we had 
a few days ago with the FBI and other law enforcement. So, I 
respect that you are not able to share, based on your 
testimony, some of the details that are currently being 
investigated, but I know you were on the call, because I heard 
you on the call, and you heard them too.
    So, I am going to lay out the timeline a little bit.
    On July 3, the rally was announced, that it was going to be 
in Butler.
    On July 6, 3 days later, we know that the shooter searched 
for dates for Trump and DNC events.
    On July 7--so this is 4 days after the announcement--the 
shooter went to the site. He actually, physically went to the 
site.
    On July 12, the shooter went to a gun range where he and 
his dad regularly go and practiced shooting.
    And the next day, on July 13, he went to the site again 
before the rally began.
    We know that he then went and searched online for a gun 
store, where he went and he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, 
went home, got his father's AR, which was legally purchased, 
and returned to the venue.
    At 5 p.m. that evening--so this is more than an hour before 
Donald Trump actually took the stage that evening--local law 
enforcement made aware--were made aware that there was a 
suspicious man.
    In fact, at 5:20, local law enforcement flagged that he had 
a rangefinder. And they radioed their concerns and sent around 
pictures of the individual at 5:40, 20 minutes before local law 
enforcement actually identified the shooter.
    And, at 5:51, Secret Service notified--was notified of the 
suspicious person by the state police, and 1 minute later they 
distributed that information. That was before Donald Trump even 
took the stage. That was 11 minutes before he took the stage. 
So, the Secret Service was aware that there was a suspicious 
person.
    At 6:03, he took the stage.
    At 6:09, rally goers, as was shown in the video, identified 
this gentleman climbing on the roof.
    At 6:11, three shots were heard, three rounds of shots and, 
of course, the President and the other victims were shot.
    This shooter was a 20-year-old young man--no criminal 
record, legally purchased gun and ammunition--who for days in 
the lead-up to this shooting was searching mass shooters. He 
even had a picture of a mass shooter on his cell phone the day 
of the shooting. He searched for explosives; he searched high-
level officials.
    So, the American people want to know, how did a 20-year-old 
young man with access to a military-style weapon actually bring 
it onto an unsecured perimeter, who for days had been planning 
a mass-shooting event?
    And I think that, Madam Director, with all due respect, the 
answers that we have received here in this hearing today are 
completely unsatisfactory.
    How could this happen? We need answers.
    We need answers not just for the family members of the 
gentleman who was killed and those who were injured, but we 
need answers for our democracy. Because, as others have stated 
here today, we are in a highly politically charged environment 
right now. We are only weeks away from one of the most 
significant Presidential elections in American history, and it 
is clear that our public officials' safety has not been 
secured. And it is not just a matter of one shooting; it is a 
matter of national security.
    So, I hope that you will take our comments to heart. I hope 
that there will be accountability. And we need answers.
    Ms. Cheatle. Absolutely.
    Ms. Stansbury. And, with that, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. LaTurner from 
Kansas.
    Mr. LaTurner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, I have a question just right off the bat. 
Something that you have bragged about repeatedly is that you 
have increased protection for the 36 individuals that the 
Secret Service is also entrusted with. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think I stated that we currently have 36 
protectees and that we have--we continue to make evaluations on 
where those levels of protection are provided.
    Mr. LaTurner. You have mentioned specific increases in 
protection that you have provided for some of those 
individuals, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Mr. LaTurner. Based on what?
    Ms. Cheatle. Well, some of it has been as a result of the 
tragic incident that occurred on the 13th. We went back and 
reassessed where we were at in providing protection and wanted 
to make sure that we were not, you know, overlooking anything, 
considering this most recent incident.
    Mr. LaTurner. So, the Secret Service needed to learn that 
allowing a rooftop 150 yards away from a protectee--not putting 
that in a perimeter, not having someone guarding that roof--
that information is new to you, and it has caused you to 
increase protection to other folks that are under your care?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think it is prudent after any incident that 
occurs to go back and take a look at your current practices and 
see if there is anything that needs to be done differently.
    Mr. LaTurner. But it is inconsistent, because what you said 
earlier to Mr. Turner was that the protection that you were 
offering to President Trump was in line with the current 
threats--him being a former President, him being a nominee of a 
major political party, the threats from Iran--the protection 
that you are providing him was adequate.
    Do you stand by that statement?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. LaTurner. OK.
    Do you think it is a problem that the Americans' trust in 
the Federal Government is at an all-time low? Do you think that 
is a problem?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that it is unfortunate.
    Mr. LaTurner. I do not know why you are quibbling with my 
word. Is it a problem, or is it not?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the American public deserves to have 
trust in their Federal Government.
    Mr. LaTurner. OK. I do not know why you are being 
difficult. I am just--it is a simple question.
    Are you concerned about the increasing prevalence of 
conspiracy theories going on out there right now?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. LaTurner. I am too.
    You have been incredibly inconsistent with your answers 
before this Committee today and what you are willing to reveal.
    You have acknowledged that the shooter was identified with 
a rangefinder; that President Trump's detail was sufficient for 
the threats he faced from Iran; that certain details were 
erroneously reported, in your words. But you have not been 
willing to provide any information about the decision to place 
the building in question outside the perimeter; the explosives 
placed in the shooter's vehicle; the use of a drone by the 
shooter; or when exactly the Secret Service identified the 
shooter as a threat rather than merely suspicious.
    What is your standard today for what you are willing to 
answer and what you are not? Because you have been 
inconsistent.
    Ms. Cheatle. I am certain that you can understand that some 
of the information that has been provided to you thus far has 
come from the FBI's investigation and has come from information 
that we have released. I want to make sure that information 
that is being provided to this Committee is consistent and is 
factual.
    Mr. LaTurner. But the question about the drone that the 
Chairman asked at the beginning of the hearing, he said, do you 
know this information? And you acknowledged that, yes, you do 
know the information, you just do not want to tell us.
    I guess my question is that, if you wanted to wait until 
the end of the investigation to draw conclusions--which you 
have acknowledged you are not; you are drawing conclusions 
right now and making changes. But if that was your standard, 
that you want to wait until the end of the investigation to 
draw conclusions, OK, at least you would be consistent in that.
    But what we are wanting to know today and what would dispel 
some of the conspiracy theories out there, what would increase 
trust with the American people, is for you to let facts out, 
for you to tell us what you know.
    And I want to understand from you, why is that a problem? 
Why is it inconsistent with a quality investigation to release 
to the American people today at least the information that you 
know for sure? Because you certainly know for sure more 
information than you are willing to give us today.
    Ms. Cheatle. I have released that there was a failure and 
that there are gaps that we need to make sure that they do not 
happen again. I----
    Mr. LaTurner. That is not acceptable. That is not enough. 
That does not quell any conspiracy theories out there.
    In your 27 years of experience, would you have been 
concerned about an elevated location within 150 yards of a 
protectee that did not have a Secret Service presence? Just 
based on your experience.
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that every site and 
every venue----
    Mr. LaTurner. No, no, no, no, no.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Is advanced differently----
    Mr. LaTurner. I am asking for your experience. Looking at 
this situation, would that have been of concern to you? Or 
would you have agreed that it is fine, it does not need to be 
covered?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I have explained today----
    Mr. LaTurner. You are not going to answer.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Is that there was----
    Mr. LaTurner. Is it true that at 5:45 p.m., approximately 
18 minutes before President Trump took the stage, the Beaver 
County Emergency Services Unit noticed the shooter on the roof 
and photographed him? Is that a fact or not?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is the information that I have from the 
FBI's report, yes.
    Mr. LaTurner. You have not been willing to share whether or 
when this was communicated to the Secret Service, so I would 
like to get into the difference between suspicious activity and 
threatening activity.
    Is it suspicious or threatening if an individual is seen 
around the perimeter with a rangefinder? Is that just 
suspicious?
    Ms. Cheatle. That could be termed as suspicious.
    Mr. LaTurner. If that same individual with the rangefinder 
is found on a rooftop, is that still just suspicious, or is 
that considered threatening?
    Ms. Cheatle. That could be termed still as suspicious.
    Mr. LaTurner. All right. My time is over.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Frost from Florida.
    Mr. Frost. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
    I obviously want to start by stressing that political 
violence is always unacceptable and acknowledging that this is 
still an ongoing investigation. But oversight hearings like 
this are essential components of an investigation, and I want 
to thank the Chair for pulling this together.
    Madam Director, I appreciate you for being here.
    The events of July 13 raise serious questions about the 
efficacy and thoroughness of the security protocols in place.
    The gravity of the fact that an unsophisticated gunman was 
able to secure his perch and take a shot at a former President 
despite multiple layers of security and intelligence are not 
lost on me. Before I came to Congress, I used to work advance 
for a major political candidate and have interacted with many 
different law enforcement agencies on large political events 
like the one that just happened.
    How many times was the Secret Service alerted about a 
suspicious person at the July 13 campaign event prior to the 
first shot being shot?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have an exact number to share with 
you today, but from what I have been able to discern, somewhere 
between two and five times there was some sort of communication 
about a suspicious individual.
    Mr. Frost. To the Secret Service specifically?
    Ms. Cheatle. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Frost. According to reports, the shooter was 
photographed twice by security officers prior to the shooting. 
A police officer saw the shooter on the ground and reported 
him, with a photograph, as a suspicious person.
    Multiple local law enforcement officers identified the 
shooter, radioed that he was acting suspiciously near the 
event's magnetometers.
    A local law enforcement tactical team saw the shooter on a 
roof and notified other security services and also photographed 
him.
    One police officer who was photographed--who photographed 
the shooter saw him scoping out the roof and carrying a 
rangefinder.
    My question is--and you have answered this, but--why--or, 
you have not answered this--why was the event not paused right 
then?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I am not clear on the timeline of when 
the Secret Service shift and the counter-sniper were notified--
--
    Mr. Frost. But, earlier, Madam Director, earlier, you said 
that the Secret Service would have paused the rally if they 
identified a threat.
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Mr. Frost. So, why was it not paused?
    Ms. Cheatle. Because I have to assume that they did not 
know that there was a threat when they brought the President 
out on the stage.
    Mr. Frost. I feel like this is a breakdown in communication 
between local law enforcement, you all, and other actors at the 
rally. And, again, as someone who has worked on these, I 
understand that there is multiple people with multiple 
decision--with the ability to make different decisions on the 
ground.
    I have taken the--over the last week, I have spoken with a 
lot of folks in local law enforcement in my district and across 
the country that I have worked with before, and other people 
have brought up concerns around being able to communicate with 
law enfor---or, with Secret Service during these big events and 
having their flags taken seriously.
    I do believe that if Secret Service believed that there was 
a legitimate threat that they would have paused the rally. My 
concern is before that, that something was flagged and it was 
not taken as seriously as it should have been taken.
    So, I think this shows an issue with communication. And I 
want to know, Madam Director, what you intend to do to fix 
that, not in 60 days, but now.
    We are in the middle of a Presidential election. Obviously, 
a former President who had an attempt--assassination attempt; 
another rally goer who was killed due to this gun violence. We 
now have a presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party who is 
also historic--first Black woman to be running for President. 
And so, I am worried about everybody's life.
    What do you all intend to do to fix this communication 
breakdown and making sure that you actually take what local law 
enforcement or local folks are saying more seriously?
    Ms. Cheatle. We take what local law enforcement relays to 
us seriously. Let me just be clear on that.
    As far as the communication----
    Mr. Frost. But not this--not this time.
    Ms. Cheatle. We always trust our law enforcement partners 
and have a great relationship with them.
    We are looking at whether or not there was a communication 
breakdown. If that was the case, we will take steps to ensure 
that we correct that, because, to your point, we cannot have a 
communication breakdown.
    Mr. Frost. Madam Director, does the--you have mentioned 
that the perimeter of the event did not include the rooftop 
where the shooter was.
    Does your responsibility and the Secret Service's 
responsibility to protect a principal stop at the perimeter of 
an event?
    Ms. Cheatle. Our responsibility is to ensure the safety and 
security of the event itself and the protectee who is attending 
that event and the personnel who are protecting that event.
    Mr. Frost. So, you would say the fact that the rooftop was 
outside the perimeter is not an excuse for what happened, 
saying that it was outside the perimeter of the event?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not offering that as an excuse.
    Mr. Frost. OK. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Fallon from Texas.
    Mr. Fallon. How did a 20-year-old loner with a week's 
notice pick the absolute best location to assassinate President 
Trump when the entire Secret Service missed it?
    Director Cheatle, under your leadership, your agency got 
outsmarted and outmaneuvered by a 20-year-old. How can we have 
any confidence that you could stop trained professionals from a 
nefarious nation-state?
    Ms. Cheatle. Those are absolutely questions that we need 
to----
    Mr. Fallon. I know they are questions----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Have answers to.
    Mr. Fallon [continuing]. But, you know, the fact of the 
matter is, we cannot have that confidence.
    Director, do you have the ability, personally--do you have 
the authority to beef up security of any of your protectees?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I do.
    Mr. Fallon. OK.
    So, were you also aware there was a credible threat 
President Trump was facing--he was facing a heightened security 
threat due to a foreign adversary?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Fallon. OK.
    So, given that there was an increased threat to President 
Trump's life, was he provided a full security complement akin 
to what a sitting U.S. President would receive?
    Ms. Cheatle. He was provided a full complement of security 
based on the threat assessment that we had----
    Mr. Fallon. That is not my question.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And the venue.
    Mr. Fallon. My question is, if he had been the sitting 
President, would he have had the same security he had on July 
13, or would it have been beefed up?
    Ms. Cheatle. There is a difference between the sitting 
President----
    Mr. Fallon. So, he did not. So, your answer is he did not.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And continuity of government----
    Mr. Fallon. OK.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And the responsibility that we 
have.
    Mr. Fallon. So, he did not. OK. There was not a CAT team, a 
full CAT team onsite. There were not counter-surveillance teams 
onsite.
    But this is the thing: you just said you have the ability 
to beef up the security, you knew about the threat, and you did 
not. And that is as telling as it is chilling.
    We have satellite images from the Butler fairgrounds. Have 
you visited the site?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I have not.
    Mr. Fallon. Nine days and you have not visited the site. 
You should have been there that night.
    Did you talk to that--that evening, did you talk to the 
team, the heroes that surrounded the President? Did you call 
them that night?
    Ms. Cheatle. They were still operational, working the 
protection----
    Mr. Fallon. So, that is a--the answer is ``no.''
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Of the President.
    Mr. Fallon. Did you call them the next day?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I spoke with them.
    Mr. Fallon. You called them the very next day, not the day 
of? Or was it 72 hours after?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not know the timeline, but I spoke with 
them----
    Mr. Fallon. OK, because you are under oath.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Immediately following.
    Mr. Fallon. I think it was 72 hours after. You waited 3 
days.
    What is immediately clear is that there were a number of 
structures that needed to be secured. Of these, Director, other 
than the first, you know, immediate four, what is the most 
dangerous site that should have been secured? Because, you 
know, security 101, you have got to mitigate the high ground.
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Fallon. OK.
    Do you know what the next-most-dangerous site--what was the 
closest structure to the President other than the four 
immediate ones that you had your counter-sniper teams on?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of structures around that 
event site.
    Mr. Fallon. You know who--the shooter knew. The shooter has 
visited the site two more times than you have, and he had a 
drone, and he picked the AGR building.
    So, you said, do you remember, in an ABC interview you did, 
that you did not have people on the roof of the AGR building 
because you were worried about safety because of the slope?
    Ms. Cheatle. I recall that statement.
    Mr. Fallon. OK. Does the Secret Service have a written 
policy you could share with us about sloped roofs?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mr. Fallon. OK. So, why did you act like there was one? 
Because is it your practice to comment on enormous--events of 
enormous national implications when you are ignorant of the 
facts?
    That is rhetorical.
    So, here is this thing with the slopes. You can go all the 
way up to, like, 18/12. You can go to a 1/12, which is about as 
flat as you can get without it being completely flat. And you 
are saying that there was a danger--a safety concern there, but 
the problem is, Director, you put your counter-snipers on a 3/
12 roof, which is steeper than the 1/12. And, by the way, the 
1/12 is ADA-compliant. You can build a ramp for a wheelchair on 
a 1/12 roof.
    So, these are nothing but pathetic excuses, and they make 
no sense, and they are a bunch of cow dung.
    All the law enforcement I have spoken with over the last 9 
days are amazed that the AGR rooftop was not secure. And do you 
want to know why? Because it is dangerous.
    I have never had any long-gun training in my life. I own an 
AR-15, and last time I shot it--I shot it one time in my whole 
life--it was 6 years ago. That is until Saturday, where we 
recreated the events in Savoy, Texas; we recreated what 
happened in Butler.
    I was lying prone on a sloped roof at 130 yards at 6:30 at 
night. And I knew that he had a scope; I did not know what 
kind, red dot or magnified, so I shot 8 rounds from both.
    You know what the result was? Fifteen out of 16 kill shots. 
And the one I missed would have hit the President's ear. That 
is a 94-percent success rate. And that shooter was a better 
shot than me. It is a miracle President Trump was not killed.
    Corey Comperatore's life is over because that damn shooter 
made it on the roof. And it was not the roof that was 
dangerous; it was the nutjob on top of the roof.
    You know what else is dangerous? I believe your horrifying 
ineptitude and your lack of skilled leadership is a disgrace. 
Your obfuscating today is shameful. And you should be fired 
immediately and go back to guarding Doritos.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Ms. Lee from 
Pennsylvania.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I would like to thank the Chair and the Ranking Member for 
coming together and holding this hearing. But I have to say, I 
do not think any of our concerns have been addressed today, and 
what little we have learned has not inspired much confidence.
    I will just say that we obviously cannot allow the violence 
we are seeing in this country to become the norm or 
commonplace, but that seems to be where we are heading.
    On this occasion, it was, you know, very shockingly, a 
former President and current political candidate at a rally 
that we all assume is one of the most secured places we can be. 
But the violence we saw last Saturday is the same culture of 
violence that makes too many of our kids and our community 
members feel unsafe to play outside or to go to class or to 
simply live their lives each day.
    But, again, this was a political rally, and it is supposed 
to be one of the most secured places. So, we do have very 
specific questions about that.
    Director Cheatle, I would like to start by following up on 
some of my colleagues' questions. My colleagues Mr. 
Krishnamoorthi and Mr. Frost highlighted a number of points 
that showed the shooter presenting an active threat.
    So, I would like to ask you, Director Cheatle, to clarify 
the protocol--what the protocol is for postponing or canceling 
an event based on a threat and how the events on July 13 did 
not meet those standards.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, again, I think we are talking about the 
distinction between suspicious behavior and a threat. And at 
the time that this individual was identified, they were 
displaying suspicious behavior.
    I am still waiting for interviews from the FBI to determine 
what it was that identified that individual as suspicious and 
what those behaviors were.
    Ms. Lee. To that question, is suspicious behavior--does 
suspicious behavior vary between different events? For 
instance, if we have an event with a President, would there not 
be a heightened standard for suspicious behavior?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that there are a number of ways that 
someone could be identified as suspicious, and it does not 
matter whether it is at a rally or an indoor event or who the 
protectee is. I think it is up to law enforcement or citizens 
to identify someone as suspicious.
    Ms. Lee. OK. Thank you.
    According to the Associated Press, at least six different 
agencies, including two sheriff's offices, local police, state 
police, as well as fire and emergency rescue officials, were 
involved in securing the rally in Butler.
    When there are so many teams that are collaborating, who 
takes the lead, and how is that determined?
    Ms. Cheatle. The Secret Service is responsible for the 
security of the site and the----
    Ms. Lee. And----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Coordination.
    Ms. Lee. And that was the case on July 13?
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Ms. Lee. OK.
    Changing gears, in 2024's appropriations budget, the Secret 
Service was given a little over $3 billion, which was about $78 
million above what was requested. For 2025's budget, you have 
requested yet another increase.
    How much of these funds goes toward training and improving 
protection procedures?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would have to get back to you on the 
training aspect of it, but about 30 percent of our budget is 
for protection and facilities and training.
    Ms. Lee. But, clearly, the problem cannot be a lack of 
funding. So, what exactly do you see as the core problem that 
led to this failure, that led to your agency being outgunned by 
a 20-year-old using his father's gun and acting on his own 
without a particularly sophisticated plan or technology?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that we are waiting to determine 
exactly what those failures or failure was so that we can make 
sure that the Secret Service is stronger after this.
    Ms. Lee. So, we have heard a lot today that you cannot 
answer because it is an ongoing investigation, that you are 
still figuring out the details, and that you will not answer 
basic questions.
    You have said 60 days for the investigation, but I simply 
do not think that is acceptable. Do you really plan to keep 
avoiding questions and the American people's questions--ours 
and the American people's questions for the next 60 days?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not avoiding questions. I want to make 
sure that I am providing factual and accurate information.
    Ms. Lee. Certainly. But is there no in between, right, 
between what is obviously a fact and what you can surmise from 
the details that you already have?
    Ms. Cheatle. I assure you, when I have a full and complete 
report of what took place on that day, I will certainly come 
back and make that available.
    Ms. Lee. Certainly.
    Studies indicate that the United States is experiencing 
increasing levels of political violence and tension.
    Does the Secret Service see increasing political violence 
as a threat to its work? And, if so, how is the Secret Service 
adapting its strategies and protocols to account for increasing 
political violence?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are constantly evaluating the threats that 
we receive and monitoring that, and we make adjustments on a 
daily basis to our protectees based on what those threats are 
and what actions we need to take.
    Ms. Lee. Yes or no, do you believe that stricter controls 
on the availability of assault weapons would make it easier for 
the Secret Service to fulfill its mission of protecting public 
officials?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the Secret Service is tasked with 
providing a safe environment, which is why we put into place a 
number of mitigation factors.
    Ms. Lee. Certainly. But do assault weapons make it easier 
or harder for you to do your job?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that any weapon makes it difficult for 
us to do our job.
    Ms. Lee. OK.
    I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Donalds from 
Florida.
    Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Chairman.
    Director, real quick, at what time was Secret Service aware 
of the active threat against President Trump?
    Director, what time?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, the Secret Service was aware that there 
was an individual who had been identified as suspicious and 
that that individual was attempting to be tracked down----
    Mr. Donalds. At what time?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have a specific timeline other than 
to tell you----
    Mr. Donalds. Director, it has been 9 days.
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand.
    Mr. Donalds. At what time?
    Ms. Cheatle. I want to make sure that I give you factual 
information, sir.
    Mr. Donalds. Director, have you talked to the agents on the 
ground that day?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I have.
    Mr. Donalds. You have talked to all of them?
    Ms. Cheatle. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Donalds. Your senior team has talked to every agent 
that was on the ground that day?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, we have.
    Mr. Donalds. Have they all corroborated the same time they 
identified the shooter or they were made aware of the shooter 
either by attendees in the crowd or local police department?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of reports of when those 
times were made, those notifications.
    Mr. Donalds. Was it 5 minutes before the first shot rang 
out?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mr. Donalds. Generally speaking, was it 10 minutes before 
the first shot rang out?
    Ms. Cheatle. No. It was less----
    Mr. Donalds. Was it 15 minutes before the first shot rang 
out?
    Ms. Cheatle. It was less than that timeframe when it was 
identified as a threat.
    Mr. Donalds. How many days before the shooting took place 
did Secret Service actually do their advance work to secure the 
facility that the rally was going to be held at?
    Ms. Cheatle. Five days.
    Mr. Donalds. In the 5 days prior, when the security advance 
team did their work, did they identify the rooftop as a 
potential threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I am pulling those reports and that 
information to----
    Mr. Donalds. It has been 9 days, Madam Director.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Conduct those interviews.
    Mr. Donalds. Did they notice a rooftop 150 yards away that 
was a potential threat, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am certain that the rooftop was noticed. I 
am pulling the reports----
    Mr. Donalds. What was the security parameters around 
securing that rooftop?
    Ms. Cheatle. There was----
    Mr. Donalds. What did they do?
    Ms. Cheatle. There was overwatch provided for that rooftop.
    Mr. Donalds. Did overwatch fail?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am waiting to hear what the results of the 
investigation were so that I can identify where the failure 
was.
    Mr. Donalds. Who did you talk to that was on the ground 
that day that was responsible for overwatch? What are their 
names?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not going to provide their names in this 
setting.
    Mr. Donalds. Did you talk to the people that were providing 
overwatch that day?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have talked to the people that conducted the 
advance on that day and that were working the shift and were 
the counter-snipers on that day.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, you talked to the counter-sniper team, you 
talked to the people who were providing overwatch that day, and 
you talked to the advance team, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Donalds. What did they tell you?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are putting together a comprehensive report 
so that I can identify exactly where the gaps and the 
failures----
    Mr. Donalds. When the counter-sniper team was on the roof 
and they identified that there was suspicious activity on the 
roof in question, what was the chain of command's orders around 
the person on said roof?
    Because I am quite sure somebody saw--under your 
organization, the Secret Service, I am quite sure somebody saw 
the shooter on the roof. So, what was the communication through 
the chain of command to deal with said person?
    Ms. Cheatle. What I can tell you is that when the 
individual was identified by the counter-sniper, they took one 
shot and neutralized that individual.
    Mr. Donalds. But that was after the shooter already took a 
shot. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct.
    Mr. Donalds. So, what you are saying now is that the Secret 
Service did not see the shooter on the roof until after the 
shooter took a shot?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have all of those details at this 
time.
    Mr. Donalds. If you do not have those details after 9 days, 
Director, then what you are telling me is that you guys did not 
see it. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am telling you I do not have all the details 
of the sequence at this time.
    Mr. Donalds. Director, it has been 9 days. Either you have 
the information, or you do not. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are still in the process of conducting 
interviews and an investigation.
    Mr. Donalds. Some of my colleagues have texted me over the 
last couple days, bipartisan, about whether you should lose 
your job, and I have been quiet on that question because I 
wanted to see what you were going to do today.
    In my opinion, you do need to be fired, immediately. And it 
is because this is gross incompetence.
    And the fact that it has been 9 days, and these are simple 
questions to answer. I am quite sure if I asked any one of my 
kids, if they got in trouble and I told them to give me the 
details, I would get more answers from them than I am getting 
from you right now. And that is what is frustrating, on a 
bipartisan basis--on a nonpartisan basis.
    This is a joke. And, Director, you are in charge. And that 
is why you need to go.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Goldman from 
New York.
    Mr. Goldman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director, I want to followup and just understand a little 
bit why there is so much information about this out in the 
public, including some from you and your communications team, 
and yet you are here, pursuant to a subpoena, under oath in 
front of Congress and you are unable or unwilling to answer 
some of those same questions.
    Can you just explain why you are answering so many fewer 
questions here than you have to the media?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am answering the questions that I am able to 
answer based on the fact that there are multiple ongoing 
investigations.
    Mr. Goldman. But you have answered some of these questions 
previously, correct, to the public, to the media?
    Ms. Cheatle. Which questions?
    Mr. Goldman. Well, for--did you have an interview with ABC 
News?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I did.
    Mr. Goldman. OK. And did you explain the interaction 
between local law enforcement and the Secret Service and that 
local law enforcement was responsible for securing the 
perimeter of the building where the shooter was?
    Ms. Cheatle. I said that the Secret Service is responsible 
for designing and implementing and executing the security plan 
and that we rely on the assistance of our local law enforcement 
partners to assist us with that plan.
    Mr. Goldman. Let me ask you something. Were you given any 
instructions about what you can and cannot answer here today?
    Ms. Cheatle. My ability to answer questions is solely 
reflective of the fact that there are multiple ongoing 
investigations, and I want to make sure that I provide accurate 
information that does not conflict with any of those 
investigations that are going on.
    Mr. Goldman. So, is it your view that you cannot talk about 
anything that happened that day until those investigations are 
completed?
    Ms. Cheatle. My view is that I want to make sure that this 
Committee and the American public gets correct and actual 
information.
    Mr. Goldman. And so, is it your view that that has to--that 
can only happen after the completion of the investigation?
    Ms. Cheatle. It is my view that when the investigations are 
complete that we will be able to share that information.
    Mr. Goldman. And how about before that?
    Ms. Cheatle. If I have factual information that I can share 
before that, I absolutely will.
    Mr. Goldman. I am guessing you have factual information as 
to when the suspicious photograph--the photograph of the 
suspicious person was relayed to the Secret Service. There is a 
timestamp on that text message or whatever it was, correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. Sir, I am sure you can understand that, when 
you are dealing with text messages, emails, and other 
communications, the timelines do not always match up.
    Mr. Goldman. Not really, if they are timestamped.
    But let me move on. Because you have acknowledged that this 
was a major security failure. Is that right?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Goldman. Do you acknowledge that it was a major 
security failure not to secure the rooftop of the building that 
the shooter shot from?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe at this time that the rooftop was 
provided overwatch. I acknowledge that we are unaware at this 
time how the individual was able to access the roof.
    Mr. Goldman. Overwatch meaning from other counter-sniper or 
other higher points?
    Ms. Cheatle. Correct.
    Mr. Goldman. And so, was it a failure, then, that when that 
shooter was on the rooftop, that overwatch did not identify him 
before he fired his shots?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have the timeline of how the 
individual accessed the roof, where they accessed the roof, or 
how long they were on the roof.
    Mr. Goldman. Let me ask a couple things quickly.
    You have testified here about all the resources that the 
Secret Service needed to deploy to protect the NATO summit and 
all of the leaders here. Is that right?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Goldman. Does--did you have to rely more on local law 
enforcement because of the NATO summit for this event?
    Ms. Cheatle. The Secret Service routinely works with local 
law enforcement at every event. It does not matter whether it 
is a NATO summit, NSSE, the DN---I am sorry--the RNC in 
Milwaukee----
    Mr. Goldman. No, but that is not my question.
    Obviously, there is a natural give-and-take as to, I am 
sure, how many agents you deploy and how much you rely on local 
law enforcement.
    Did you have to rely more on local law enforcement because 
there were fewer Secret Service assets available because of the 
NATO summit?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mr. Goldman. OK.
    I hope we get answers before the completion. I do not like 
the fact that the media has received far more answers than 
Congress has. If this is a function of getting your ducks in a 
row, I assume you have access to a lot of these reports and a 
lot of this information and you should have come prepared here 
today.
    And I would just want to flag, Mr. Chairman, before I yield 
back, that--I want to just point out one thing that my 
colleague from Texas was talking about, when he said he 
recreated the shooting twice with an AR-15 and he had a 94-
percent success rate, 15 out of 16 shots.
    I do not know why that does not convince him that we should 
get rid of AR-15s. But, clearly, we need to do something about 
the prevalence of AR-15s and weapons of war on our streets.
    And I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Perry from 
Pennsylvania.
    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Chairman.
    Director, I guess 60 days is the time of the investigation. 
Is that the information that you have put out, or where did 
that come from, 60 days? Or is that just information that the 
Committee members are talking about?
    Ms. Cheatle. I stated that earlier today. I have asked my 
team----
    Mr. Perry. OK, 60 days.
    So, are you receiving regular updates--you are in charge of 
the Secret Service. This is about your organization, what 
happened 9 days ago. Are you receiving regular updates from the 
FBI on their investigation?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I am.
    Mr. Perry. So, you know some things are true, some things 
are probably not true. We want to talk to you about the things 
that we are hearing about and find out if they are true.
    Have you--you have been in contact with the FBI then. You 
are getting updates on a daily basis, right----
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Perry [continuing]. Based on what you said? OK.
    So--and are you confident that the person in question, Mr. 
Crooks, was the only person firing that day against the 
President or the crowd? Is he the only one? I am not asking you 
yet if he acted alone, but is he the only one? Can you say that 
with certainty to the American people?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is the information I have at this time, 
yes.
    Mr. Perry. OK. Did he--does it appear he acted alone?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is the information we have at this time.
    Mr. Perry. OK.
    Now, let us talk about the fact that he was noticed as a 
person of interest, of concern, suspicion, as you say.
    Your PI team, how do they stay--there is a sea of people. 
How does the PI team get to that individual that is in question 
in the sea of people? How is that individual tracked?
    Ms. Cheatle. Our protective intelligence teams that work at 
our sites are paired up with a local police counterpart, and so 
they work in conjunction together----
    Mr. Perry. So, do they just follow them around? Or----
    Let me ask you this. Looking at the site, you have multiple 
perimeters, right? You have the secure--the inside perimeter. 
You have multiple secure--or multiple perimeters. Was the AGR, 
so-called, building the highest location affecting the site of 
the rally? Was it the highest location?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe the highest location at the site was 
where our counter-snipers were----
    Mr. Perry. What about the water----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Positioned.
    Mr. Perry [continuing]. Tower adjacent? What about the--how 
high is the water tower?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have the height on the water tower.
    Mr. Perry. OK. Seems like water towers are pretty high. At 
least in the photo, it looks like it.
    But there might actually be a building right behind the AGR 
building that is even higher than the building that Crooks 
fired from.
    You are familiar with cover, concealment, and defilade, 
right? You are familiar with those terms?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Perry. So, how would your sniper team or your PI team 
track the individual and give vectors to Secret Service on the 
PI team to get to that individual to question him?
    And how would you cover the defilade, the cover and 
concealment of low areas that you cannot see from where your 
sniper team immediately adjacent to the President were--was 
sited? How would you do that if you are not up on the high 
ground?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, when our counter-sniper teams go out and 
conduct an advance, they have a methodology and provide a grid 
system that our response teams are able to vector in if they 
see something that is troubling.
    Mr. Perry. So, when Mr. Jordan asked about the assets that 
were requested--let me just ask you about assets requested.
    Were aerial assets requested for this event from either the 
Secret Service or state police or anybody else--a drone, 
manned, otherwise? Aerial assets, were they requested?
    Ms. Cheatle. I cannot speak to what the local police----
    Mr. Perry. I am just asking if they were requested.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. May have--conversations with the 
local police. But I can tell you that the assets that were 
requested from the Secret Service for the site that day were 
all granted.
    Mr. Perry. But were aerial assets--I am just--I did not ask 
if you used them or what you used. Were they requested?
    Ms. Cheatle. Overwatch was requested, and----
    Mr. Perry. Aerial.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. That was provided.
    Mr. Perry. Is that aerial? Because overwatch could mean on 
the water tower or not on the water tower. Can you be specific, 
ma'am? I am running out of daylight here.
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand. If you are asking me about 
specifics, whether or not there was----
    Mr. Perry. Is it not clear what I am asking you? Were 
aerial assets requested, by the President, by Secret Service, 
by anybody? Were they requested?
    Ms. Cheatle. The Secret Service, we felt that we had a good 
plan in place----
    Mr. Perry. OK. OK. Fair enough.
    How about K-9 assets with bomb-sniffing or explosive-
sniffing capabilities? Requested? I did not say they were 
present; were they requested?
    Ms. Cheatle. Those requests were fulfilled.
    Mr. Perry. They were requested and fulfilled.
    Ms. Cheatle. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Perry. So, was the Crooks vehicle inside any of your 
perimeters?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, it was not.
    Mr. Perry. It was not. How did you--so--OK. So, it was not 
within the--so what--was there a device located on Mr. Crooks' 
body to detonate the vehicle?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is the information that I have.
    Mr. Perry. So, what would be the point of detonating the 
vehicle if it was not inside the perimeter?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have no idea what Mr. Crooks' motivation 
was.
    Mr. Perry. Ma'am, the fact that you--and I will close with 
this, Mr. Chairman--have not even visited the site--I 
understand there are other things going on, but the culture of 
your organization, the culture, that does not--do you know how 
tall the President is? How tall is the President? President 
Trump, how tall is he?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not--he is over 6 feet tall. I do not 
have the exact----
    Mr. Perry. OK. So, do you assign agents based on their 
ability to cover physically and carry--and carry, if necessary, 
the President of the United States? When you assign them to 
this mission, is that a parameter that is considered?
    Ms. Cheatle. I assign agents to work our protectees that 
are capable and have been trained by Secret Service----
    Mr. Perry. I understand they are trained, but if you are 
not tall enough--this has nothing to do with--we are not mad at 
you, but if somebody is 7 feet tall and you are 5 feet tall, 
there is going to be a delta there that is problematic in 
protecting the protectee.
    And I am asking, is that a consideration when you--when 
these agents--not saying you--but when they are assigned to the 
protectee?
    Ms. Cheatle. The agents that are assigned to our protectees 
are perfectly capable----
    Mr. Perry. OK, ma'am.
    So, the culture----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Of providing protection.
    Mr. Perry [continuing]. Is what I am concerned about, 
because the primary objective here seems to be something other 
than securing the site, securing the principal, and securing 
the people at the site. And that is the concern, based on the 
answers that you have given today so far.
    With that, I yield, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Moskowitz from 
Florida.
    Mr. Moskowitz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for this 
hearing. I want to thank your--the subpoena that you sent.
    I want to thank Ranking Member Raskin and your work, the 
letter you sent to the Committee. And I also support the 
creation of a commission to get to the bottom of what happened.
    Director, I just want to give you an honest assessment of 
how this is going for you today.
    Did you happen to catch the hearing many months ago in 
Education where there were a bunch of university professors--of 
university presidents and Elise Stefanik asked a very easy 
question and could not get an answer? Did you see that hearing?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I do not think I did.
    Mr. Moskowitz. OK. Well, let me tell you, it did not go 
well. And the short end of that story was, those university 
professors all resigned. They are gone.
    That is how this is going for you. This is where this is 
headed. OK?
    This is--I do not know who prepared you for this. I do not 
know how many times you have testified in front of Congress. 
But a President was almost assassinated live on television not 
just for Americans but for the world to see. And this being 
your first opportunity--I understand there is an ongoing 
investigation, I understand there is things that you cannot 
talk about. But the idea that we are getting less than you did 
on television is something that Democrats, independents, and 
Republicans are going to find unacceptable.
    My high school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, was on the list 
of mass shootings that Representative Raskin held up. That very 
day, the school resource officer, a police officer, did not run 
into the building. He hid in the stairwell while the shooter 
was in the building. He stayed outside, never helped. OK?
    Mr. Moskowitz. He also directed other officers who showed 
up on the scene not to go into the building.
    When it was determined that the failures in response and 
training and that the sheriff fired nobody in his agency, 
Governor DeSantis then removed that sheriff. I supported the 
removal.
    So, here is my question. You said there is going to be 
accountability. I understand you do not want to give us names. 
When you say that, are you telling the Committee that once it 
is concluded you are prepared to fire the people on the ground 
who made poor decisions that day?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am prepared to take the actions necessary.
    Mr. Moskowitz. No, that is nonsense, OK?
    Accountability. The failure was human. That does not mean 
they are bad people. It means they failed that day and a 
President was almost--a former President was almost 
assassinated, OK?
    Are you prepared to fire the human failure on the ground, 
yes or no? When you have the names of where those failures 
were--they are people. It is not like a piece of technology 
failed. It was people who failed that day. Are you prepared to 
fire them?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have an answer as to whether people--
--
    Mr. Moskowitz. Well, then how can there be accountability 
if you are not prepared to fire someone?
    And the reason why your name is going to be the person who 
is held accountable, the reason why Members on this Committee 
are calling for resignation--and I join in that--or for the 
President to fire you, is because you are saying there is going 
to be accountability, but you cannot commit that people are 
going to get fired.
    Let me ask this question a different way.
    If Trump had been assassinated that day, if the gunman had 
succeeded, OK, would you have come and tendered your 
resignation?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would still be sitting here, because I would 
want to ensure the integrity of the investigation moving 
forward.
    Mr. Moskowitz. Totally understand. That is a fair answer, 
that you would have set up that process. But would you have had 
the honor to come in front of the Committee and say, ``A 
President was assassinated''--``A former President was 
assassinated on my watch, there should be new leadership''?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that I have admitted that there were 
grave failures----
    Mr. Moskowitz. No, that is not what I am asking. Would you 
have tendered your resignation if he had been killed?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. That occurred on my watch, and I 
am accountable for that.
    Mr. Moskowitz. OK. But would you have tendered your 
resignation if he had been killed?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that I have admitted that I have taken 
accountability and will take responsibility.
    Mr. Moskowitz. OK. Well, let me ask a--I want to followup 
on Representative Connolly's question in which he asked about 
guns, and you were not willing to commit that that makes your 
job harder.
    This is not about the Second Amendment. There are over 400 
million guns on the streets. If all of those guns were machine 
guns, would that make your job harder to protect people?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I think weapons that are out there----
    Mr. Moskowitz. If all of those guns were rocket-propelled 
grenades, would that make your job harder?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Moskowitz. Yes. OK. Thank you. Perfect. This is not a 
trick question. Thank you. OK. I will not ask the other 15 
things I was going to do. I was going to do drone strikes, but 
it is OK.
    So, that is all we were asking. It creates a challenging 
environment. It has nothing to do with the Second Amendment or 
people's rights. But it does make your job harder. So, credit 
to Representative Connolly for asking that question.
    One last thing, Mr. Chairman, and I will conclude.
    You know, there was a question asked, is an Iranian 
assassin more capable than a 20-year-old? And I have been tough 
on Iran. I probably have more resolutions on Iran than almost 
anyone in Congress.
    But I can tell you it is not Iranians walking into schools 
and grocery stores and movie theaters and churches. It is 20-
year-olds, right? And some of them are mentally unstable, and 
they have access to guns. And they are domestic terrorists. 
Someone talked about Christopher Wray. Christopher Wray has 
talked about domestic terrorism.
    And so, yes, we collectively come together on foreign 
threats. And I am not at all debasing the fact that there are 
foreign threats here and abroad.
    But there are domestic threats. And we have to get to the 
bottom of how we stop domestic terrorism, because it was a 20-
year-old who walked into my high school and killed 17 people. 
He was plenty capable and he was not Iranian.
    Thank you.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Timmons from 
South Carolina.
    Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, we have asked you a lot of questions and 
have not really got a lot of straight answers. I have 
intentionally created a line of questioning that I think that 
you can answer.
    So, the first question is, do you agree that the allocation 
of Secret Service resources should correspond with the risk 
profile of any given event? A higher degree of risk at one 
event should get more resources. Is that fair?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is fair.
    Mr. Timmons. OK. And when two events occur at the same time 
in the same geographic vicinity, that the risk profile of each 
event should be taken into account and whichever event is 
greater risk should receive greater resources?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct.
    Mr. Timmons. OK.
    So, I am going to go over the Trump event. So, this was 
publicly announced July 3, Butler, Pennsylvania. The venue is 
an outdoor fairground, open air, no existing security. The 
crowd size was expected to be tens of thousands. It ended up 
being over 20,000.
    There were general and specific threats from foreign 
adversaries. As the Chairman of Intelligence remarked, Iran has 
said they want revenge, as well as when President Trump was in 
office he made a lot of people mad, terrorists to be included, 
all over the world.
    And, you know, President Trump is the former President and 
the future President.
    So, I would say that that is a fairly high-risk event. 
Would you agree?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Timmons. OK.
    Let us conversely, the First Lady had an event at a casino 
in Pittsburgh just a few dozen miles away. It was a dinner for 
the Italian Sons and Daughters of America. It was publicly 
announced on July 10.
    What is interesting is that the casino is actually 
extremely secure. They already have magnetometers existing 
prior to this event even being announced. It was in a ballroom 
and the size of the crowd a mere 400. There were no specific 
threats. There may have been general threats. And the asset is 
the First Lady.
    Those seem like there is a huge disparity relative to risk. 
Would you agree?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Timmons. OK. Thank you.
    Multiple whistleblowers and various media outlets have 
reported that the Pittsburgh field office of the Secret Service 
allocated 12 additional post-standers to the First Lady's event 
and 3 additional post-standers to the Trump rally. Is that 
correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were no assets that were diverted from 
the First Lady's visit.
    Mr. Timmons. No, no, no. This is a very simple question. I 
am not asking if anyone was diverted.
    Did the First Lady's event, that was relatively secure, 
especially compared to Trump's rally, get 12 assets and the 
First--did the First Lady's event get 12 assets and Trump's get 
3 from the Pittsburgh field office? That is a yes or no.
    Ms. Cheatle. The number----
    Mr. Timmons. If you do not know, do not answer it. I mean, 
if you do not know, do not answer.
    Ms. Cheatle. The number of personnel that were allocated to 
both of those events were comparable to the risk at both of 
those events.
    Mr. Timmons. Wow. Really? So, you think that the Pittsburgh 
casino 400-person ballroom with ingress/egress through probably 
a very well-guarded parking garage was four times more 
dangerous than a 20,000-person rally in an open field with the 
former President and future President? You think that that is 
four times more dangerous the casino event?
    Ms. Cheatle. I did not say that at all.
    Mr. Timmons. Well, they got four times the resources from 
the Pittsburgh field office, who was likely in charge of the 
final walk-through for both events.
    I mean, we have continually highlighted the failures of the 
Secret Service at the Trump rally. And, you know, you have the 
former and future President getting shot. You have multiple 
injuries, one fatality.
    And I would have to think that if we had nine more post-
standers, nine more individuals that have the training and the 
integration into the Secret Service defense of Trump at that 
rally, that I have a feeling that Crooks would have had 
somebody come say hello to him before he fired a bunch of 
shots. Do you think that is possibly true?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were significantly more assets and 
resources available at the former President's event than there 
were at the First Lady's event.
    Mr. Timmons. Who made the decision to deploy 12 post-
standers to the casino where the First Lady was having a 400-
person dinner and only 3 people from the Pittsburgh field 
office to the 20,000-person-plus Trump rally? Who made that 
decision?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were additional Secret Service resources 
available at the former President Trump's event that day.
    Mr. Timmons. Who made the decision to deploy 12 to the 
First Lady's event and 3 to the Trump event?
    Ms. Cheatle. The allocation of resources is decided based 
on the availability of personnel and their location and where 
they are, but there were sufficient resources----
    Mr. Timmons. What did you just say?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. That were given to the former 
President's event that day.
    Mr. Timmons. Did you just say there were sufficient 
resources? President Trump got shot. Someone got killed. There 
were not sufficient resources, clearly.
    Ms. Cheatle. There was a gap.
    Mr. Timmons. It does not take 27 years of experience to 
know that. And whoever made that decision--it probably was not 
you--needs to be fired, and then you need to resign, because 
this is absolutely unacceptable. You have lost the trust of the 
American people.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Ms. Tlaib from Michigan.
    Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
    Thank you, Director, for being here.
    You know, when we hear the headline of 20-year-old young 
man with access to an assault weapon commits a mass, you know, 
act of mass violence, I mean, we have heard this before over 
and over again.
    But the unfortunate thing is that my residents do not get a 
Committee hearing. We have not had one Committee hearing about 
the over 260 mass shootings that we have had, killing hundreds 
of people, injuring hundreds, changing their lives forever.
    And do not get me wrong, too many of my colleagues, I mean, 
I watched. And even the pool of blood, the screams, it was 
horrific. But it made me think about the images I saw after 
mass shootings at schools, grocery stores.
    I mean, I think of Buffalo, New York, at a supermarket 
where a racist gunman killed ten shoppers with an AR. In El 
Paso, AK-47 style assault rifle killed 22. In Florida, in 
Parkland, Florida, 17 students and teachers murdered, again, 
with an AR. In Pittsburgh, at a place of faith, Tree of Life 
Synagogue, 11 murdered. And do not get me about Newtown, 
Connecticut, which still breaks my heart, 26 murdered, 
including 20 elementary school children.
    This year in Michigan we have had, Mr. Chair, two mass 
shootings, 21 shot in Detroit, one of the most horrific 
shootings we have seen, two killed at a splash pad in Rochester 
Hills, Michigan, eight shot there, again, an assault weapon 
used.
    But the difference here is the former President gets a 
hearing in his attempted assassination, but our residents do 
not get a hearing about mass shootings, about gun violence in 
our country.
    You know, Mr. Chair, I ask this wholeheartedly. You know, 
they do not have Secret Service to protect them. They do not. I 
do not have these mass agencies protecting our kids in the 
schools or the supermarket, movie theaters. They are going to a 
block party in Detroit. I do not have that. We do not have 
that.
    But I cannot believe we are just going to focus on that and 
not the fact that we are hearing yet again in the headlines a 
20-year-old young man having access to an assault weapon, a 
weapon of war many of my veterans say they have to be trained 
to use. But he can get it, was not safely stored by the parent, 
grabbing that gun, and innocent lives are lost.
    Director, I know you got asked about this and I think it is 
important, though, you know, for us to hear this. But how 
difficult is your job when there is such easy access to assault 
weapons in the streets?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the job of a Secret Service agent, an 
officer, is incredibly difficult. I think the environment we 
deal with every day and the dynamics of the threat environment 
is incredibly difficult.
    These are brave men and women who put their lives on the 
line. And a day like we had on July 13 is a day that no one in 
my agency ever wants to have as their responsibility. It is an 
incredibly difficult job.
    Ms. Tlaib. Yes, I immediately thought of the children in 
the audience. I mean, when you think about going to a rally 
with your family. Again, their lives are forever changed.
    The incident was not--are never isolated. I really believe 
these incidents are never isolated. And I know Detroit Free 
Press had reported that the 20-year-old Pennsylvania shooter 
looked up the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Michigan.
    Can you comment on what information the shooter was looking 
up regarding the tragedy of Oxford High School where it took 
four of our high school youth there?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am sorry, I am not able to. The FBI has 
those details.
    Ms. Tlaib. So, you cannot even tell us, I mean, was he 
looking at the type of weapon, how many----
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes. Unfortunately, I do not have those 
details.
    Ms. Tlaib. Do you have--I mean, did they share that with 
you, though?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have the full content of what his 
searches were. I think that they are still in the process of 
examining all of his devices.
    Ms. Tlaib. OK. Again--you know, again, the impact--I want 
to be really serious about this--the impact on our families is 
more than just this political rally, Mr. Chair.
    We have to talk about this. Even if we are in disagreement, 
let us talk about it. Because I have seen statistics that show 
that we could be saving lives now if we ban these weapons of 
war from our--from being able to buy it at the local store down 
the street. I mean, we just cannot continue to allow this to 
happen.
    And, unfortunately, my colleague--my residents are not 
former Presidents of the United States. They do not get a 
hearing, they do not get Secret Service protection, any of 
that. And even among those that are expressing that failed in 
the system, they just deserve better, they truly do.
    Thank you, and I yield.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burchett from 
Tennessee.
    Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Cheatle, the shooter was set up on the roof of the AGR 
International building, as we know. Was the roof identified as 
a potential vulnerability days before the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. To my knowledge, yes, it was.
    Mr. Burchett. Were agents or officers inside the building? 
If so, what floor were they on?
    Ms. Cheatle. We had local police officers inside the 
building.
    Mr. Burchett. The roof looks like it is a tin roof. How did 
no one inside that building hear someone moving on the top of a 
metal roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have the details of all of the 
interviews that have been conducted yet.
    Mr. Burchett. When will you have those?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have been asking, and I want to have that 
information as soon as you do as well.
    Mr. Burchett. OK.
    Why did Secret Service fail to block the line of sight from 
that roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that the Secret Service put together a 
plan where they were counting that roof in as part of their 
overwatch, and that was the plan that they had put in place 
that day.
    Mr. Burchett. If you were not going to put a security 
personnel on the roof, why not at least use drone technology or 
aerial surveillance to monitor the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of times that we do use 
drone technology. I am not speaking specifically to this event 
and what was utilized or not. There are times when drone 
technology is available and helpful at events, and there are 
times when it is not appropriate.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Do you all use Signal--do you use--
personally use Signal to communicate with any official from the 
White House? Signal on your phone?
    Ms. Cheatle. Oh. On occasion I am sure that there are 
people that use Signal, yes.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Do you use it to speak with the White 
House, use Signal?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I do not.
    Mr. Burchett. OK.
    When was Thomas Crooks first identified as a person of 
interest?
    Let me help you. At 5:10. He was spotted with a range 
finder at 5:51. And when did Secret Service notice him?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I do not have those specific timelines, 
but it was a relatively short period of time.
    Mr. Burchett. Let me help you. 5:52.
    Ms. Cheatle, why was President Trump allowed on stage 10 
minutes after the Secret Service spotted a suspicious 
individual?
    That seems to me to be the worst thing of all. Of all the 
breakdown in all this communication, all the BS you have been 
feeding us here today or not feeding us, that seems to be the 
question.
    Ms. Cheatle. So, as I have stated before, there are a 
number of events where suspicious people may be identified. 
That does not necessarily----
    Mr. Burchett. Ma'am, I submit to you, you got a guy who is 
going to be the next President of the United States. He is on 
the stage. I have been to these events. We have all been to 
these events. A car backfires and there is a 15-minute dadgum 
wait. That is not acceptable.
    Did the Secret Service tell President Trump they had 
spotted a suspicious individual before he was shot?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am unclear as to what the communication was 
with the former President at that time.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. I will take that as a no.
    Did you all deny President Trump's request for more 
security, yes or no? And when was the most recent request for 
additional security?
    Ms. Cheatle. The rally request for security, all of those 
requests were fulfilled.
    Mr. Burchett. And were there any personnel redirected to 
Jill Biden's rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mr. Burchett. Who made the decision on the direction of 
agents at either one of those rallies?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am unclear as to your question on the 
direction of the agents.
    Mr. Burchett. I said, who directed those agents to be at 
Ms. Biden's rally or President Trump's rally, those specific 
agents?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, there is a methodology in which agents are 
available for assignments, and they are assigned based on 
either geographic location or logistics or flight----
    Mr. Burchett. Ma'am, I appreciate all that, but that 
methodology about got President Trump killed.
    Was the security detail guarding President Trump a 
temporary detail?
    Ms. Cheatle. The personnel who are assigned to the former 
President's detail are assigned to him.
    Mr. Burchett. Why was there a different detail on the 
opening night of the convention than the detail that was 
guarding him in Pennsylvania?
    Ms. Cheatle. The President has a very large permanent 
protective detail assigned to him. They work shift work. And so 
it could be that the people you saw at the rally were not 
working the same shift the day that he was----
    Mr. Burchett. I can assure you, ma'am, somebody that is a 
lot shorter than the President was not at the convention, and 
the people that were cowering down behind the mass of agents 
that were on top of the President were not in the convention 
hall, at least I did not see them.
    You cannot answer--seem to answer--a single question about 
an ongoing investigation, ma'am, and you do not know when the 
information will be released publicly.
    Are you waiting for the Administration to sign off?
    Ms. Cheatle. No. I am waiting for the results of the 
investigation, at which time I will----
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Let me ask you one more question.
    You found explosives in the shooter's possession. Is that 
correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. The FBI found explosives.
    Mr. Burchett. Do we know how--who directed this young man 
how to make those explosives?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that the FBI is still looking into 
that on their investigation.
    Mr. Burchett. Ms. Cheatle, you said that ``The buck stops 
with me,'' and I agree. I do not think you should resign. I 
think you should have been fired. Ma'am, you are a DEI horror 
story.
    I have told my daughter multiple times, my wife and my 
daughter, we talk with her all the time about how she is going 
to succeed in life. She will succeed in life by achieving.
    Ma'am, you have not achieved today. You have let the 
American public down. If it was up to me, you would be gone.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Crockett from 
Texas.
    Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
    And let me just pick up where my colleague from Tennessee 
left off.
    Director Cheatle, was the incident on July 13 due to DEI or 
rather systemic failures in communication and potentially 
safety protocols?
    Ms. Cheatle. The incident on the 13th has nothing to do 
with DEI. The incident on the 13th has to do with a failure or 
a gap either in planning or communication.
    Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much.
    In fact, I have a few articles that I will enter into the 
record once I wrap up that actually acknowledge a number of 
women specifically for their valor and their service, whether 
it has been in various levels of law enforcement.
    But, you know, I want to stay here for just a second, 
because earlier you had a conversation in which there was a 
discussion about training.
    And I want to talk about training and I want to talk about 
the fact that there has been a little bit of dancing around as 
it relates to this being a suspicious person and this being a 
situation that was perceived to be a threat, and it seems as if 
there is a different analysis that takes place.
    One of my questions has to do with if you have any bias 
training that your officers undergo. And the reason I ask that, 
because, as a civil rights lawyer, I have learned so many times 
in having to deal with law enforcement that there usually is 
not a perception of a threat when it is a young White male, 
even if they are carrying a long gun. Yet, a lot of times, at 
least in this country, when it comes to law enforcement, there 
is a perceived threat just by somebody having a little bit more 
melanin in their skin.
    So, I am curious to know, because a lot of times one of the 
things that we have consistently pushed for on my side of 
things--and when I say my side is once we are looking at a 
tragedy in which law enforcement made an error--is the bias 
training and whether or not our officers are getting it.
    So, I am curious to know, in some of the training that you 
talk about that is part of your budget, has bias training been 
part of that?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, it is.
    Ms. Crockett. OK. Thank you.
    I know that today is a rough day and on that day in 
Pennsylvania it was a rough day. And the reality is that I 
understand it, and you may or may not know the answer to this 
question.
    In the space in which this event took place, it was an open 
carry space. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct.
    Ms. Crockett. OK.
    So, I hale from the state of Texas, and interestingly 
enough, I was serving in the state house right after there was 
a mass shooting in El Paso. We had an opportunity to do right 
by our citizens in Texas, but we did not. Instead, they passed 
permitless carry.
    And what my colleagues kept trying to get you to answer, 
because we want to come up with solutions, we do not want to 
keep pointing the finger, and right now you have got a bunch of 
fingers that are pointed at you. But our job is to solve 
problems for the American people.
    And to be perfectly honest, the numbers are clear. I had I 
think almost every major law enforcement agency come forward 
and say that they were against permitless carry, because they 
said that their jobs would be made more difficult.
    Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
in the state of Texas decided that they would ignore those 
warnings, and they passed the law instead.
    And right after they passed that law, we ended up with 
Uvalde. And we heard the stories of those officers that were 
scared to go in and save those babies because of the firearm in 
which that in that case 18-year-old had in his hands.
    They also were given an opportunity to say, ``Hey, raise 
the age and make it to where at least you have to be 21 before 
you can possess this type of weapon,'' and they chose not to.
    And we have the facts. It shows--and I will enter this into 
the record as well if there is no objection--``Deaths from 
Firearms Keep Climbing in Texas Decades After Lawmakers Began 
Weakening Gun Regulations.'' That is from the Texas Tribune.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much.
    The last thing that I am just going to make a point of 
saying is that we all care about this issue because we know 
that there has been a spike in violence, political violence, in 
this country.
    Are you aware of the fact that the numbers are higher right 
now?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Crockett. OK.
    In addition to that--and I am going to point a little blame 
at ourselves, because right now you got all the fingers pointed 
at you. But the reality is that we have a number of 
congressional Members that are consistently engaging in violent 
rhetoric, and it needs to be toned down.
    The reality is that people are listening and they are 
paying attention. But, unfortunately, another thing that is 
happening, because we are not getting answers from you today, 
is the conspiracy theories. They have already began.
    Have you heard of any of the conspiracies?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Ms. Crockett. OK.
    The problem with these conspiracies is that when people 
believe that, say, the President of the United States ordered a 
hit, or they believe it was an inside job, or whatever 
conspiracies they believe because they do not have any facts in 
front of them, that potentially incites the next level of 
violence at the next event in retaliation for this.
    So, we are only begging for your job as it relates to being 
the Director as well as the men and women that you are 
protecting as their Director that you keep them safe by making 
sure that the American people have the information that they 
need so that they can feel as if Secret Service is on the side 
of the American people.
    And, ma'am, I do not doubt that Secret Service is on the 
side of the American people. But right now, so long as these 
conspiracy theories continue to fester, it is going to make 
your job that much harder.
    Thank you so much. And I yield.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Marjorie 
Taylor Greene from Georgia.
    Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Cheatle, I would like to remind you that you are under 
oath.
    The site team has a senior supervisor, an advance team, a 
protective intelligence team, a counter-sniper element and 
detail.
    Who was the agent in charge? How long has she been the 
agent in charge? And what is her Secret Service background?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I am not going to provide a name of----
    Ms. Greene. Why not? You are here to answer our questions.
    Ms. Cheatle. In this forum, I am not going to provide names 
of----
    Ms. Greene. You stated in your testimony, you said, ``I am 
here today to answer your questions.''
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct.
    Ms. Greene. Answer the question.
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not going to provide names of our 
personnel to the Committee today.
    Ms. Greene. Why not? The American people are demanding 
these answers from you today, Ms. Cheatle.
    Ms. Cheatle. I will do the best to provide you accurate 
information based on the facts that I have at this time.
    Ms. Greene. You are not answering our questions.
    The advance element coordinates with other intel or law 
enforcement partners, identifies threats and weaknesses at the 
sites and movements.
    We would like a copy of the advance report. Have you 
brought it here with you today?
    Ms. Cheatle. We will comply with the request for the 
documentation that has been requested.
    Ms. Greene. When will that be, Ms. Cheatle, because you 
should have brought it today?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am certain that our personnel are working on 
obtaining all of that documentation.
    Ms. Greene. I do not believe you, and neither do the people 
watching this hearing. You are not doing well, as Mr. Moskowitz 
informed you. You have been sitting here for over 3 hours, and 
I will have you know the entire country is demanding you resign 
and demanding that you be fired if you do not resign. Things 
are not going well for you. You need to answer the questions.
    Was there a protective intelligence team and what technical 
resources were utilized for that event, specifically drone or 
helicopter assets?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were a number of technical assets that 
were deployed for that event, and there was a protective 
intelligence team that was assigned to that event.
    Ms. Greene. Why was Crooks able to fly a drone over the 
entire area the day of the rally and the day of his 
assassination attempt?
    Ms. Cheatle. To my knowledge, he did not fly the drone over 
the entire area.
    Ms. Greene. How did he fly a drone over the area, period, 
any part of the area?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I would have to go back and check the 
timeline of when that took place and when the event----
    Ms. Greene. Why did you not bring the timeline with you 
today to answer our questions?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have all of the answers on the 
timelines, based on the criminal investigation.
    Ms. Greene. Were you not prepared today to answer our 
questions?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am prepared to answer the questions, based 
on the information, and wanted to be able to provide----
    Ms. Greene. Do you have a timeline that you--do you have a 
timeline at all from any of the day?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have a timeline that does not have 
specifics.
    Ms. Greene. That is shocking. That is absolutely 
unacceptable. That means you are a failure at your job.
    Let us talk about things that are prohibited in Trump 
rallies. And I have been to a lot of Trump rallies. Backpacks 
and bags, bicycles, firearms, any type of weapon, or any other 
item determined to be a potential safety hazard, like a range 
finder would be one.
    At 5:10, Crooks is first observed by one of the snipers, 
AGR sniper 1, at the building. 5:10. 5:10. President shot, 
President Trump was shot in the face at 6:11 p.m.; 5:28, AGR 
Sniper 1 takes a picture of a bicycle and two bags. Those 
belonged to Crooks; 5:32, AGR Sniper 1 spots Crooks looking at 
his phone and using a range finder; 5:55, Butler ESU Command 
confirms receipt of photos and states they have been relayed 
on; 6:05 p.m., AGR Sniper 1 later communicates that Crooks is 
seen moving northeast in direction of Sheetz and that Crooks 
has a backpack.
    Two minutes before the shooting, while President Trump has 
been allowed to take the stage, people see Crooks laying on his 
stomach in a sniper position on the roof and they are yelling, 
``He has a gun,'' and they are trying to alert law enforcement 
and Secret Service.
    Why was Crooks not shot by the snipers? Why was he allowed 
to be there?
    Ms. Cheatle. As soon as the individual was identified as a 
threat, they were----
    Ms. Greene. No, no, no, no, no, no. What do you consider to 
be a threat? A man with a gun laying in a sniper position, a 
man that had a backpack, a man that had a bicycle, a man that 
had a range finder, at what point is he determined a threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. An individual with a backpack is not a threat. 
An individual with a range finder is not a threat.
    Ms. Greene. What about a man laying on a building that has 
direct line of sight of President Trump with a gun that people 
are screaming and pointing out, is that a threat, Ms. Cheatle?
    Ms. Cheatle. Once that individual was identified, they were 
neutralized.
    Ms. Greene. No. They were neutralized, Crooks was 
neutralized after he shot President Trump in the face, Ms. 
Cheatle. Is he only a threat once he fires the weapon?
    Ms. Cheatle. As soon as the counter-sniper identified that 
individual, they were able to neutralize them.
    Ms. Greene. How were people in the crowd--OK. Then let us 
just take it this way.
    People under your command did not consider him to be a 
threat, yet people in the crowd knew he had a gun and 
considered him to be a threat.
    That means that you are a complete failure as the Director 
of the Secret Service, that people under your command do not 
perceive a man laying on a roof with direct line to the 
President with a gun, they do not perceive that to be a threat, 
yet the people in the crowd do. How is that possible?
    Chairman Comer. That is the last question, but please 
answer the question, Director.
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not certain at this time how the 
information from the people in the crowd was relayed to any law 
enforcement personnel.
    Ms. Greene. No. You knew. Everyone knew. The people there 
knew that there was a danger. They knew there was a threat to 
President Trump and it was allowed to happen.
    Was there a stand-down order, Ms. Cheatle?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Ms. Greene. Was there a conspiracy to kill President Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. Absolutely not.
    Ms. Greene. Then how did this happen, and why are you still 
sitting here not turning in your letter of resignation?
    Chairman Comer. Last question, but please answer, and then 
I will recognize Ms. Pressley. Please answer the question, 
Director.
    Ms. Cheatle. That is what we are investigating to 
determine.
    Ms. Greene. We are waiting for your letter. We are waiting 
for your letter of resignation. And you really need to consider 
doing that before you leave today.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Pressley from 
Massachusetts.
    Ms. Pressley. Thank you.
    No one, absolutely no one should fear for their life at a 
political rally, in a classroom, in a faith house, or in their 
home. We must do something about political violence in all its 
forms and gun violence in all of its forms.
    Now, Director Cheatle, you have noted that numerous 
investigations are ongoing related to the Secret Service 
response and that we can expect a report in the next 60 days. 
With the election nearly 100 days away, that is an unacceptable 
timeline, and it makes people less safe.
    It also allows my colleagues across the aisle, Republicans, 
additional time to spread dangerous misinformation, which also 
puts people in harm's way.
    Some Republicans have exploited this moment to continue to 
attack progress toward racial justice and gender equity in 
America, disappointing but not surprising.
    I hesitate to repeat their racist and sexist tropes, but, 
in summary, Republicans have wrongfully and shamefully stated 
that hiring women and people of color hindered the response to 
the shooting.
    Now, this is part and parcel of the Republican strategy to 
constantly attack necessary diversity, equity, and inclusion 
efforts, to undermine the contributions that women, people of 
color, the disability community, and others make to this 
country each and every day, and it is disgraceful.
    In the wake of gun violence and tragic loss of life, 
Republicans are ignoring solutions like gun safety reform and 
instead trotting out sexist tropes. Cannot say I am surprised.
    I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record reporting 
from CNN titled ``Right-wing media figures blame women in 
Secret Service and DEI for security failure in Trump 
shooting.''
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Ms. Pressley. This article quotes Members of Congress and 
others that plainly accuse DEI and the hiring of women as a 
liability for the Secret Service.
    Women have been an integral part of the agency since 1971 
and are held to the same standards as their male counterparts. 
To use them as a scapegoat during a time of crisis is shameful, 
and it is dangerously divisive. In fact, based on recent 
publicly available demographic data of the agency, the largest 
demographic groups among special agents are White and male.
    But to right-wing extremists the truth does not matter. The 
lies they tell to advance their anti-diversity agenda, which is 
a key theme throughout Project 2025, will only make the 
American public less safe and more divided.
    And every day, Director Cheatle, that you fail to give us 
answers they are given more oxygen to make their baseless 
claims that women and people of color are responsible for 
tragic events, and that is dangerous too.
    Thank you. And I yield my remaining time to Ranking Member 
Raskin.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you to the distinguished gentlelady from 
Massachusetts and thank you for those trenchant insights.
    I wanted to make the point that you are making and several 
other Members were making to bring it into sharp relief here.
    The very same day that Donald Trump narrowly escaped an 
assassination attempt, but an honored firefighter was gunned 
down and killed and other people were injured, there was 
another mass shooting that day just several hours later in 
Birmingham, Alabama, four people killed and ten wounded in a 
nightclub shooting.
    And you might think, ``Oh, that is some kind of freakish 
coincidence.'' Not at all. We have more than one mass shooting 
a day in America. They are so commonplace now that they are 
barely reported in the national news. It is, of course, local 
news in Birmingham, Alabama, that four people were killed and 
ten other people were shot and seriously wounded, being treated 
at the hospital.
    These things are a nightmare for the families of the 
victims who have been killed, for the families who have to take 
care of people who have been seriously injured and wounded. 
They are a major financial drain publicly and privately. And 
yet we allow AR-15s to be purchased with abandon promiscuously 
all over the country. People can just go out and get an assault 
weapon.
    And the distinguished gentlelady from Michigan was right. 
We have a hearing when it affects the President of the United 
States, but on all the other days of the year we do not have a 
hearing about it.
    And I think it is because in an honest disagreement we have 
about the Second Amendment there are some people who think the 
Second Amendment means you have got the right to arm yourself 
with whatever weaponry you need to overthrow the Government of 
the United States, and we reject that as a false interpretation 
of the Second Amendment and a false interpretation of the 
Constitution.
    We can ban assault weapons. We did it back in 1994. It 
dramatically reduced these mass shootings. And when that ban 
was lifted, the mass shootings went up through the roof again, 
and we have shown it.
    And so just like we are demanding real answers and real 
action from the Secret Service, let us demand real action and 
real answers from ourselves about the nightmare of mass gun 
violence which puts America into a category all its own when 
you compare us to the countries in the European Union or Canada 
or other similarly situated countries. There is nothing like 
what we are going through.
    So, we have got to act on the Secret Service to protect 
ourselves against political violence, and we have got to act as 
a Congress to protect ourselves against AR-15 violence in 
America.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Mrs. McClain from 
Michigan.
    Mrs. McClain. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And first of all, I want to thank the Secret Service 
agents, those who work tirelessly to protect our Presidents, 
and specifically those agents who did not hesitate to jump in 
front of President Trump.
    And my heart goes out to the family, the Comperatore 
family, and the people at the rally who are still recovering.
    On the other hand, the Secret Service has a leadership 
problem, and it falls on you. And although I appreciate your 
hollow words that the buck stops here, I was actually hoping 
for some answers.
    Director Cheatle, you must answer to the American people if 
you want to stay in charge. It is really, really simple.
    You want to keep your job, right?
    Ms. Cheatle. Absolutely.
    Mrs. McClain. OK.
    The best way to keep your job is to answer the questions, 
not play this shell game, not sing the Slim Shady song ``It 
Wasn't Me.'' I mean, come on.
    How long did you prepare for this hearing?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have been preparing for this hearing over 
the weekend and into last week.
    Mrs. McClain. OK. Five days? Six days?
    Ms. Cheatle. As soon as I was notified----
    Mrs. McClain. And how long was that?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. About this hearing----
    Mrs. McClain. OK. Four days?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. I began preparing.
    Mrs. McClain. Four days? Three days?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not sure the date that I got the letter 
asking me to be here.
    Mrs. McClain. What are you sure of? Are you sure of the 
color of your hair? Are you sure of the color of your suit? 
Like, tell the American people, what are you sure of?
    You do not even know when you started preparing for the 
hearing? I mean, the biggest hearing of your life and you have 
no clue, you cannot remember when you started preparing for 
this hearing?
    Can you understand why those words seem hollow to the 
American people who are supposed to entrust their faith in you?
    Ms. Cheatle. I assure you, the moment I received 
notification of this hearing.
    Mrs. McClain. But you cannot remember it. You got a little 
Alzheimer's, dementia going? I mean, you cannot remember?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have several active investigations going on 
and an operational agency to run.
    Mrs. McClain. OK. All right. But you want to take 
accountability, right? The buck stops with you, right?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am taking accountability.
    Mrs. McClain. Super. Then let us start with trying to 
answer some questions.
    You keep referring to the FBI. When asked how many shell 
casings were on the roof, you referred to the FBI. When asked 
if there were explosives in the car, you referred to the FBI. 
When asked if Crooks was acting alone, you referred to the FBI. 
See a common theme here? I can go on and on.
    My question is, who at the FBI should I speak with? Wait 
for it. Wait for it.
    Ms. Cheatle. The FBI is responsible for the criminal 
investigation.
    Mrs. McClain. Is there a name?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not certain who at the FBI is running the 
investigation.
    Mrs. McClain. ``I am not certain.'' All right, here we go. 
``I am not certain. I do not know.''
    Let me ask a different question. Have you been in 
communication with the FBI?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I have.
    Mrs. McClain. With whom?
    Ms. Cheatle. I speak with the Director and the Deputy 
Director.
    Mrs. McClain. OK. And what have they shared with you about 
this investigation? So, I will give you an opportunity to 
answer again.
    Did they share with you how many shell casings were on the 
roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. They have shared with me the evidence that 
they have collected.
    Mrs. McClain. Did they share with you how many shell 
casings were on the roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mrs. McClain. OK. How many were there?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would refer to the FBI for their 
investigation----
    Mrs. McClain. How many were there?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. And their information that they 
need to share in their investigation.
    Mrs. McClain. So, they have shared the information with 
you. You just do not want to share the information with us, 
correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. We have concurrent investigations that are 
going on.
    Mrs. McClain. So, they have shared this information with 
you. You know the answer to the question. You just refer--
refuse to answer the question from the Member of Congress who 
has subpoenaed you to be here.
    Is there a different answer to that question?
    Ms. Cheatle. I was always willing to come here and testify 
before this oversight hearing. A subpoena was not necessary.
    Mrs. McClain. Beautiful. Then let us do that. Let us for 
once have your actions match your words.
    So, you have been in communication with the FBI. You know 
the answers and you refuse to tell us the answers.
    So, I will ask you again. You know how many shell casings 
were on that roof. What is the answer to that question?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think it is pertinent to talk----
    Mrs. McClain. What is the answer to that question?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think it is pertinent to talk to you about 
the information that the Secret Service has and that the Secret 
Service knows related to the events on that day.
    Mrs. McClain. I am asking you an answer to the question. If 
you are supposed to be in charge, if the buck stops with you, 
how come you cannot share the answers? What are you covering 
up? What are you hiding, my friend?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not covering anything up.
    Mrs. McClain. Then why can you not answer a simple 
question?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would leave it to the criminal investigation 
to answer questions related to that.
    Mrs. McClain. When you talk to the FBI and you ask them how 
many explosives--well, let me ask you. Did you ask them how 
many explosives were on the roof? Did they answer that 
question? Or in the car, excuse me. Did they answer that 
question for you?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mrs. McClain. Yes. So, you know the answer to that question 
that my colleagues have asked you, but, again, you refuse to 
give us the answers. You are playing, ``This was not me.''
    Well, I submit to you, if you cannot--and it is not a 
``cannot.'' It is a ``will not.'' It is not a ``cannot.'' It is 
not an ``I do not know.'' It is an ``I choose not to answer the 
question.''
    Well, let me tell you, Ms. Cheatle, if you are going to 
lead, you need to lead. If you want to be in charge, then 
answer the question or step aside and have someone with the 
courage and the guts to answer to the American people the 
questions that they deserve answers to.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Boebert from 
Colorado.
    Ms. Boebert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am going to continue down that vein.
    You have been here sitting today, Director Cheatle, 
definitively able to dismiss erroneous information and 
speculation. However, you are refusing to answer questions that 
we now know that you have the information for.
    You are saying that you are wanting to answer questions 
that the Secret Service has information to. Well, ma'am, you 
are the Secret Service. You are the Director. You have said 
that you are the best for the job.
    So, I am going to ask you some questions now, now knowing 
that you do have answers from the FBI whom you have been 
passing the buck to this entire day.
    And I will start with something that, you know, maybe the 
FBI does not know, because it has to deal with you personally.
    You said you spoke with President Trump after the 
assassination attempt, and I want to know, did you apologize to 
him directly for nearly having President Trump killed?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I did.
    Ms. Boebert. I appreciate that. I appreciate that you 
recognize that this was your failure.
    Now, since the assassination attempt--you are under oath, 
reminding you--have you communicated with anyone at the White 
House on an encrypted messaging app like Signal, yes or no?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I have not.
    Ms. Boebert. Are you willing to surrender your personal 
phone for analysis?
    Ms. Cheatle. If I am required to do so.
    Ms. Boebert. OK. I will look into making that request, 
because I would like to see your personal phone to see if you 
are communicating over encrypted messaging apps.
    Have you ever turned down enhanced security requests from 
Donald Trump's detail, his special agent in charge, Sean 
Curran? Have you ever turned that down?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I have not.
    Ms. Boebert. Have there been--has your team? Has the Secret 
Service? Maybe not you personally.
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe, as I mentioned earlier, there are 
times when requests are made for assets----
    Ms. Boebert. And you have denied them. They have been 
denied.
    Ms. Cheatle. And a denial does not necessarily mean----
    Ms. Boebert. Has the Trump campaign made requests for 
additional assets that have been denied?
    Ms. Cheatle. Denial does not mean vulnerability.
    Ms. Boebert. Have there been additional requests for 
enhanced security at Mar-a-Lago?
    Ms. Cheatle. We have made a number of enhancements to 
security.
    Ms. Boebert. You confirmed that there were bomb-sniffing 
dogs that were provided. You failed to confirm if there were 
aerial security surveillance assets that were provided. So, yes 
or no, was that provided?
    Ms. Cheatle. At the rally?
    Ms. Boebert. At the rally, yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Cheatle. We had overwatch provided at the rally.
    Ms. Boebert. You have confirmed that the assassin was 
identified as suspicious 57 minutes prior to the shooting. Was 
the suspicious individual ever approached by an agent? Was any 
contact ever made with him?
    Ms. Cheatle. Not to my knowledge.
    Ms. Boebert. Is that the standard protocol for someone who 
is identified as suspicious?
    Ms. Cheatle. The protocol would be to locate the individual 
and conduct an interview.
    Ms. Boebert. And you said that he was located two to five 
times, approximately?
    Ms. Cheatle. No. I said that the information was passed 
potentially somewhere between 2 to 5 minutes----
    Ms. Boebert. And he was never located by an agent?
    Ms. Cheatle. To my knowledge, that individual was not 
located by an agent.
    Ms. Boebert. We have dozens of rally goers who have 
identified him, and not one agent on the ground. There are 
many, many, many agents on the ground, local law enforcement, 
Secret Service. No one was able to identify him and have sight 
on--and see him.
    Ms. Cheatle. What I am saying is that the agents that were 
on the ground at the time, I have no knowledge that they were 
able to interview him or----
    Ms. Boebert. Was----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Locate him.
    Ms. Boebert. Thank you.
    Was there a local law enforcement officer who approached 
the roof and saw the shooter and saw that he was present on the 
roof?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is the information that has been shared 
with me.
    Ms. Boebert. Have you spoke to that local law enforcement 
officer?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I have not.
    Ms. Boebert. Are you going to?
    Ms. Cheatle. It is part of a criminal investigation that 
the FBI----
    Ms. Boebert. Are you going----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Is interviewing those 
individuals.
    Ms. Boebert. Were agents stationed on the water tower?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Ms. Boebert. Why?
    Ms. Cheatle. That would not be something that would be 
included in a security plan.
    Ms. Boebert. Has the man who is reported to have been 
present wearing a gray suit who allegedly requested a photo of 
the dead body of the assassin on top of the AGR roof been 
identified?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have that information.
    Ms. Boebert. Is that something that you have heard of?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Ms. Boebert. Were ATF agents present at the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. To attend or to work?
    Ms. Boebert. To work.
    Ms. Cheatle. Not to my knowledge.
    Ms. Boebert. How long did the counter-sniper have Crooks in 
his sights before the shooter opened fire on President Trump?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have that specific timeline.
    Ms. Boebert. Will you be able to tell us if he communicated 
with other agents on what he was seeing through his sights?
    Ms. Cheatle. Once I have that information, absolutely.
    Ms. Boebert. Because we need to know why he waited for 
multiple rounds to be fired at President Trump before the 
threat was neutralized. We need to know if he was given an 
order to hold fire.
    Now, it is--you have excused the roof of being unmanned 
because of the slope of the roof. Do you continue to assert the 
slope of the roof as a credible reason for leaving this 
position undefended?
    Ms. Cheatle. First, I will go back and correct that there 
was no order to hold fire. Our agents and officers have the 
ability to neutralize a threat at the time----
    Ms. Boebert. So, you do not know----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. They see it.
    Ms. Boebert. I am sorry. You do not know the communication 
that was taking place or how long he had him in his sights 
because you have not spoke to him, but you do know that there 
was no order to hold fire.
    Ms. Cheatle. I can tell you the way that our personnel are 
trained, they are trained on the use-of-force scale that when 
they see a threat they are authorized to neutralize that 
threat. There is no--they do not have to ask for permission.
    Ms. Boebert. You excused the roof being unmanned because of 
a slope. Do you stand by that assertion?
    Ms. Cheatle. The roof was not covered with an individual on 
it because there was overwatch provided.
    Ms. Boebert. Apparently not. No, there was no overwatch 
provided. This is very evident. President Trump was shot. A man 
died. There was no oversight provided.
    I find this rather maddening, especially now knowing that 
you do have answers from the FBI, who you have been passing the 
buck to this entire hearing, not answering a congressional 
hearing, Members of Congress, while you are under oath and 
under a subpoena.
    I find it maddening that the Director, that our country has 
come centimeters away from oblivion under your watch, you have 
answers, you are refusing to give those to us, directing us to 
the FBI. And this entire thing is a waste of time.
    You are responsible for the loss of a life and the shooting 
that took place on President Trump. You do need to resign. This 
is bipartisan. You need to be fired. You do not need to hold 
this position. You are not the best for this job.
    I am over my time. But I cannot tolerate your watch any 
longer and I am going to continue to call daily for you to be 
removed from your position, ma'am.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Mr. Fry from South 
Carolina.
    Mr. Fry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Cheatle, how long have you been with the Secret 
Service? Twenty-nine years, right?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct.
    Mr. Fry. And how long have you been Director of the Secret 
Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. Just under 2 years.
    Mr. Fry. During your tenure as Director under the Secret 
Service, I know we are here today to talk about the 
assassination attempt on President Trump, but how many other 
security lapses have occurred with protectees under your watch?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have a specific number, but there 
have been some lapses.
    Mr. Fry. There have been other lapses. Was one of them Jake 
Sullivan?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Fry. What happened there?
    Ms. Cheatle. There was an individual who was able to access 
Mr. Sullivan's residence.
    Mr. Fry. His residence? A protectee, somebody was able to 
break into his house. And what happened? Did anyone get fired 
because of that?
    Ms. Cheatle. There were individuals who have been 
reassigned.
    Mr. Fry. Reassigned.
    What other steps have taken--what I am seeing--what other--
excuse me.
    What other incidents have occurred other than Jake 
Sullivan? Was there an issue with a Secret Service agent and 
Vice President Harris?
    Ms. Cheatle. I would not call that a security incident.
    Mr. Fry. Well, it seems to me--I mean, you have security 
lapses with President Trump. You have security lapses with Jake 
Sullivan. You have issues with your personnel related to Vice 
President Kamala Harris.
    There seems to be a repeated theme here. Would you not 
agree with that?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think that we are talking about separate 
categories of incidents.
    Mr. Fry. Well, I would disagree with that. I mean, I think 
there is a repeated theme when you have got protectees and you 
are not upholding your core mission.
    Let me ask you something else. Does the Secret Service 
routinely record communications between and amongst detail?
    Ms. Cheatle. Radio communication?
    Mr. Fry. Any communication.
    Ms. Cheatle. Email communications are captured as well as 
text messages. And then, depending on the detail, radio 
communications are recorded.
    Mr. Fry. Does the Secret Service have recorded 
communications from the July 13 event?
    Ms. Cheatle. We do not have radio communications from that 
day.
    Mr. Fry. But you have text messages?
    Ms. Cheatle. We do have emails and text messages.
    Mr. Fry. Emails. OK, great.
    Does the head of the Trump detail or someone else embedded 
in this detail have command decisionmaking authority, or do 
they need to seek authorization from someone outside that 
detail?
    Ms. Cheatle. The head of the detail has the decisionmaking 
authority for things that are necessary for that detail.
    Mr. Fry. Is that standard for protection details?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, it is.
    Mr. Fry. OK.
    Let me ask you something. During campaign events, is it 
common for the Secret Service to utilize other agencies?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, it is.
    Mr. Fry. What other agencies would be providing assistance 
to the Secret Service?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of other agencies that 
provide assistance to the Secret Service during campaigns. We 
utilize personnel from the Department of Homeland Security, we 
utilize personnel from the Department of Defense, and we 
utilize local law enforcement partners.
    Mr. Fry. Are you on the same radios? Do you provide the 
radios to all the assets that are taking part in protection of 
an event?
    Ms. Cheatle. We provide radios to the personnel from the 
Department of Homeland Security that are assisting us.
    Mr. Fry. But not local law enforcement?
    Ms. Cheatle. Local law enforcement is working on their own 
radios.
    Mr. Fry. Are you on the same frequency?
    Ms. Cheatle. We ensure that we have counterparts in the 
security room. And so, the local law enforcement will place one 
of their personnel in the security room with our personnel so 
that we have interoperability communications.
    Mr. Fry. Let me ask you something just about the timeline, 
because I think this is really interesting that we cannot nail 
that down. I mean, I think there are laypeople out there with 
more knowledge about the timeline than you seem to come before 
a subpoena in front of Congress.
    Was Mr. Crooks observed at the AGR building prior to the 
shooting?
    Ms. Cheatle. He was observed on the grounds outside of our 
perimeter prior to the shooting.
    Mr. Fry. And approximately what time was that? You do not 
have to give me the specific minute, but at approximately what 
time was that?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe it was about 45 minutes or so prior 
to.
    Mr. Fry. Did the sniper--the sniper team--take a photo of 
Mr. Crooks?
    Ms. Cheatle. The local team did, yes.
    Mr. Fry. So, it was a local team and not a Secret Service 
sniper?
    Ms. Cheatle. That took the photo.
    Mr. Fry. OK. And did he relay that photo to Central 
Command?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, it is an active ongoing investigation, 
so we--I want to make sure that I am factual with the route 
that that photo took and who that was disseminated to and when.
    Mr. Fry. What time did the--did Mr.--when did Mr. Crooks' 
status go from a suspicion, a person that was under suspicion, 
to a threat? When did that happen?
    Ms. Cheatle. For----
    Mr. Fry. And maybe not even a specific time, Director 
Cheatle, maybe a certain event that happened that transformed 
him from a person of suspicion to a threat. When did that 
happen?
    Ms. Cheatle. To the best of my knowledge, based on what I 
have been told thus far, it is approximately 5 minutes to where 
individuals relayed that there was an incident being--or an 
issue, I am sorry--being worked at the 3 o'clock of the 
President--former President.
    Mr. Fry. So, that was--but it was before the shots were 
fired?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is correct. But, again, it was not 
phrased as a threat. It was just that something was being 
worked.
    Mr. Fry. Yes, but my question is, when did he become--when 
did he transform from suspicion to threat? Because they are 
treated very differently. People can be suspicious, but they 
are not a threat until a certain point in time. So, when did 
that happen?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that it was seconds before the 
gunfire started.
    Mr. Fry. Seconds. My gosh, we actually have a few questions 
that we got answered today.
    Listen, I am going to wrap up here, Mr. Chairman.
    But here is the frustration that people have. The buck 
stops with you. You have said that yourself. But the problem in 
Washington, DC, it is the only town in America that you can be 
so bad at your job that you actually get a promotion or do not 
get fired.
    You have not been able to answer the number of agents, 
whether or not requests were denied on additional security, 
whether or not law enforcements were able to engage before the 
shooting with the assassin, how he got on the roof, how the 
rifle got on the roof.
    You cannot tell us how many shots he fired, whether the 
casings were recovered. You cannot tell us anything about his 
cell phone. You cannot tell us whether the rally was supposed 
to be postponed, given the intelligence that you were 
receiving. You cannot tell us whether the car had a bomb. You 
cannot even tell us his motive.
    And the American people are incredibly distrustful, because 
it has taken 9 days to even get a scintilla of evidence out of 
you. Maybe if I was CNN or ABC or NBC, I would have gotten much 
more thorough and accurate information, but we have not 
received that in a subpoenaed hearing in front of this 
Congress.
    That is why the American people are frustrated. And I echo 
the bipartisan calls on this Committee and all across this 
country that you should resign, or maybe when the President 
wakes up from his nap he can fire you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mrs. Luna from 
Florida.
    Mrs. Luna. Director Cheatle, can you please give me the 
names of the individuals who were in charge of your CONOP for 
the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not going to release names----
    Mrs. Luna. Can you give me the titles----
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mrs. Luna [continuing]. And how many individuals?
    Ms. Cheatle. No.
    Mrs. Luna. Nothing?
    Ms. Cheatle. We had a full advance team that was 
responsible----
    Mrs. Luna. Who were the----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. For advancing the site.
    Mrs. Luna. How many people had the final approval 
authority?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are a number of people that are----
    Mrs. Luna. Can you give me a number?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Engaged in approving the plan.
    Mrs. Luna. Can you give me a number?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I do not----
    Mrs. Luna. OK.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Have a firm number.
    Mrs. Luna. Can you just confirm whether or not--I 
understand this is an open investigation, but in order to 
dispel conspiracy theorists, have you guys been able to 
subpoena the shooter's Discord records, or has the FBI, to your 
knowledge?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that the FBI is working on those.
    Mrs. Luna. OK.
    Is it factual to say that you have not ruled out that the 
shooter was working with other people or persons?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, the FBI is conducting the criminal 
investigation into the shooter.
    Mrs. Luna. Can you--at least in an effort to dispel 
conspiracy theories, can you confirm or deny that?
    Ms. Cheatle. At this time, we do not have that there were 
any other people engaged.
    Mrs. Luna. So, you believe he was acting alone?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do.
    Mrs. Luna. OK.
    Have you been made aware of multiple eyewitness reporting 
that there was a second shooter on a water tower?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have any information related to any 
second shooter.
    Mrs. Luna. OK. The reason I ask that is because, according 
to testimony from multiple witnesses, they did report that.
    And, again, to my understanding, there were over 40 sniper 
teams that were briefed by the Butler ESU. And I want to make 
sure that people are aware, if you are saying that there was 
not another shooter, that we are able to clear that 
information. Because, from this whole entire briefing, it does 
not seem like much information has been able to get out to the 
American people, so I am trying to dispel rumors, as I am sure 
you understand.
    Was it true that Secret Service was present at the Butler 
ESU briefing?
    Ms. Cheatle. There was a briefing between the counter-
sniper teams that were working on the ground.
    Mrs. Luna. Was Secret Service present?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, to my knowledge.
    Mrs. Luna. OK.
    I want to read you a report from people that seemed to be 
throwing you under the bus and stated that they were in 
attendance and that Secret Service was not in attendance at the 
security briefing, according to individuals with knowledge; to 
also include that the AGR building where the shooter, Thomas 
Matthew Crooks, was located was actually not a part of their 
security perimeter for that.
    So, there was not Secret Service present.
    It seems as though that when you were asked earlier from 
Rep. Krishnamoorthi about whether or not Secret Service was 
aware of a threat, you had said, no, they were unaware of a 
threat, and yet, according to communications, again, from law 
enforcement that were in some of these group chats, they 
actually had reported that Secret Service was made aware of a 
threat at around 5:59 p.m. as a part of the command, including 
Secret Service--aware of messages and requests about 
information about the suspect's location.
    Can you please tell me if you have knowledge of that at 
all?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I think we are conflating the 
difference between the term ``threat'' and ``suspicious.''
    Mrs. Luna. But you guys did have knowledge at 5:59 p.m., 
according to those group chats, did you not?
    Ms. Cheatle. Of a suspicious individual.
    Mrs. Luna. OK.
    Chairman--in my opinion, according to some of the testimony 
today, I feel that you have perjured yourself in some 
instances. And so, I am going to ask for a full review of the 
transcripts by staff, and if you find that to be the case, I do 
ask that you bring perjury charges against the Director.
    I will say this. It is very frustrating--and I have talked 
to my colleagues, and we have said it to your face--that you 
have been up here basically stonewalling our ability to get the 
answers to the American people.
    And what I will also say is that every single Member of 
Congress does not feel safe with you in charge. You have heard 
that. And I think that we are all sitting ducks, with you 
directing the Secret Service currently.
    But, more importantly, it sends a message to our 
adversaries that we are not protected. And we are one of the 
strongest countries in the world, so you have essentially made 
us a less safe country because of it.
    As a result of that, I am asking you to formally step down. 
I share my same opinions as my Democrat colleagues.
    And I also think that your efforts to bring forward a full 
investigation and report in 60 days is unacceptable. And, as a 
result of that, I am going to do everything in my legislative 
toolkit to ensure that that happens sooner rather than later.
    And I am sure that you know that we brought a vote on 
inherent contempt against Garland for essentially blocking a 
congressional investigation, and I do not think that you should 
be any different.
    So, I will say that I am just completely disgusted by your 
performance today. And I understand that you are probably in a 
position where you are being told not to testify, which is why 
we had to subpoena you. I think that goes back to Garland. But, 
again, that is part of the flushing that we need to get out of 
Washington, and I would be happy to assist in that process.
    Chairman, I yield the rest of my time.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Langworthy 
from New York.
    Mr. Langworthy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I 
appreciate you bringing this hearing forward with the subpoena.
    Director, yesterday, I made the decision to get in my car 
and drive to Butler, Pennsylvania, in preparation for this 
moment and asking you questions about the events of the 
assassination attempt on President Trump's life.
    I have done several Presidential advance events prior in my 
career, and I wanted to see this site with my own two eyes, 
because I do not believe the video footage tells the whole 
story or looking at things on a diagram.
    And I was absolutely appalled when I went to the site when 
I saw the fact that I could have stood on the roof of that 
building, the AGR building, and hit that podium with a 9 iron, 
and I am a lousy golfer. And the fact that that was not 
included in the perimeter is a complete dereliction of the duty 
of the U.S. Secret Service.
    I mean, there are very few rooftops that needed to be 
secured, and the fact that the Secret Service, as they were 
putting a site plan in place, did not think it was necessary to 
man those rooftops, you have completely walked away from your 
duties.
    You had one job, and that was to protect the future 
President of the United States or to protect all of the other 
protectees. And President Trump is only here today by God's 
grace, because he had just something in him that made him turn 
his head just slightly, or we would be in a national period of 
mourning right now.
    And you have done nothing here today--I have rewritten 
these questions, like, four times during your hearing, and you 
have not answered a damn one of them. You have not given any 
information. You have hidden behind this FBI investigation.
    And I think you should be ashamed of yourself, because you 
have brought more shame to your agency than I think the 
assassination attempt has at this point. This is literally the 
worst performance I have ever seen in front of a congressional 
hearing. You have offered no reason for this Committee, this 
body, or the American people to trust you or the Secret Service 
today. And you should resign.
    You have said that you have put new security measures in 
place after the assassination attempt. Can you tell us what 
those are?
    Because the American people want to know that you are 
taking real, corrective measures, but today you pointed to an 
investigation. An investigation or not, you still have a job to 
do with a zero-fail mission. But so far there has been 
absolutely no accountability, and you have admitted that here 
today. Not one person has been suspended. Not one person has 
been put on a desk.
    Meanwhile, we have got the most contentious of elections in 
our Nation's history, and protectees are in danger because of 
incompetent leadership--not the agents. The agents piled on 
President Trump to protect his life. Those are heroes. But the 
administrators running your agency, they are not right now. 
They are not doing their jobs, and you certainly are not doing.
    The most appalling part of Saturday's events is the 
countless opportunities that Secret Service had to stop Crooks 
before he even got on the roof. At 3 o'clock, Crooks raised 
suspicion by entering the rally with a rangefinder. At 5:45, a 
cop with a Beaver County Emergency Services Unit saw Crooks 
eyeballing the roof at the AGR International building. And then 
at 5:55, Secret Service was warned of a suspicious person and 
identifies Crooks as a threat. This was all before shots were 
fired 15 minutes later.
    Director, yes or no, did local law enforcement alert the 
Secret Service about Crooks' presence at the rally?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, they did.
    Mr. Langworthy. The shooter came to attention of law 
enforcement almost an hour before President Trump went on 
stage. Law enforcement alerted the Secret Service to the 
shooter.
    Over and over, you have said there is a difference between 
a suspicious individual and a threatening individual. Can you 
explain what the shooter needed to exemplify to be called a 
threat?
    Ms. Cheatle. So, I am not clear as to what identified him 
as suspicious to the individuals who originally clarified him 
that way.
    For the Secret Service, for an individual to be determined 
to be a threat, that individual would have to be seen with a 
weapon or capable of doing some sort of harm to our protectees.
    Mr. Langworthy. I mean, Director, an individual walking 
into a rally with a rangefinder, scoping out an unprotected 
rooftop--and he reportedly flew a drone over hours before--it 
sounds like a lot more than suspicious, especially at a 
Presidential rally.
    Your operational lapses, your resource management, and poor 
judgment nearly resulted in the assassination of President 
Trump. I mean, the dereliction of duty here is just appalling. 
The fact that you have not visited Butler is just maddening to 
me, that you are not taking this job seriously.
    You know, many people here have called for your 
resignation. I have introduced a resolution here into this body 
that hopefully will get a vote this week calling on the 
President to fire you, ma'am.
    You have not done your job, you have put a--two black eyes 
on your agency, and you need to go.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burlison from Missouri.
    Mr. Burlison. Director Cheatle, I just want to kind of get 
an idea of what you can answer. Because, outside of what the 
FBI is responsible for, you have full responsibility for the 
Department of Secret Service.
    So, the question is, what is the mission? What is your--and 
who defines the mission?
    Ms. Cheatle. Our mission of the Secret Service is to 
protect the President, the Vice President, their immediate 
families, Presidential candidates, the former Presidents, and 
those by executive order. And we also have an investigative 
mission.
    Mr. Burlison. And those are well-defined?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Burlison. Everyone within the agency understands the 
mission?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, they do.
    Mr. Burlison. What about protocols and standards? Who 
defines the protocols and standards?
    Ms. Cheatle. We have a number of protocols and policies in 
place for the various missions that we have.
    Mr. Burlison. So, would it be safe to say that you failed 
the mission, the ultimate mission?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have stated repeatedly here today that there 
was a failure.
    Mr. Burlison. What about specific failures within protocols 
and guidelines within the agency?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, I am certain that the investigation 
that is being conducted internally as well as the external 
investigation----
    Mr. Burlison. You said earlier in the hearing that there 
was either a communication--there was a--there was errors in 
communication or in operations. Could it be both, both errors 
in operational decisions and errors in communications?
    Ms. Cheatle. I think the investigation potentially could 
identify both.
    Mr. Burlison. So, I want to talk about communications. 
Representative Boebert asked earlier about using encrypted apps 
that you said you have not used, I guess Signal. Have you used 
any encrypted app to communicate from your personal device?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do, on occasion, use encrypted apps to 
communicate.
    Mr. Burlison. So, you use some form of an encrypted app to 
communicate with people--within the Federal Government? With 
local law enforcement? Whom are you communicating with using 
encrypted apps?
    Ms. Cheatle. Many times it is with colleagues and 
associates.
    Mr. Burlison. So, you are communicating with colleagues on 
a personal device?
    Ms. Cheatle. There are times that the Secret Service, when 
we work internationally with some of our partners, that they do 
not have the same texting capability.
    Mr. Burlison. And you are not able to do that with your 
government-issued device?
    Ms. Cheatle. Recently, we have been able to install some of 
those apps on government devices.
    Mr. Burlison. OK.
    Let us talk about some of the things that we can get access 
to.
    I am actually shocked that you are using your personal 
device and encrypted communication tools. I think that that 
might be the most shocking thing that I have heard today. I did 
not expect for you to say that.
    We have requested--this Committee has requested multiple 
documents. And this is not, you know, under the purview of the 
FBI; this is under your purview. We requested a complete list 
of all law enforcement personnel, including Secret Service, 
Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement with the 
roles in protecting the President, and we requested that to 
be--for us to receive that by July 18.
    Did you provide that?
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe that our agency is in the process of 
collecting all documents----
    Mr. Burlison. So, you did not--you have not provided it. 
How long does it take to determine who the personnel were that 
were onsite?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are collecting a comprehensive list of all 
the documents that have been requested.
    Mr. Burlison. We also requested all the audio and video 
recordings that your agency--not the FBI, but your agency--has 
in possession related to the event.
    Did we receive those? Have you provided those at all?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are in the process of collecting all 
documentation requested.
    Mr. Burlison. You are in the process, but you have not.
    Any memorandums or any internal communications related to 
the event? We requested that you provide that. Have you 
provided any of that?
    Ms. Cheatle. We are in the process of collecting the 
information that has been requested.
    Mr. Burlison. OK.
    So, when can we expect to receive these documents? How long 
does it take to determine who was onsite, who was being 
employed to be there to protect the former President? When can 
we expect that? How many days does it take to provide that 
information?
    Ms. Cheatle. We want to make sure that we have a 
comprehensive accounting of all of the documents that were 
engaged in that day, and we will make them available as soon as 
possible.
    Mr. Burlison. I think transparency is the key here. It is 
shocking to me that we are communicating in an encrypted app to 
colleagues. I am almost certain that violates some Federal 
laws.
    Ms. Cheatle. I would like to clarify. You did not ask me 
whether my communications were government/work-related or 
whether they were personally related. I do not----
    Mr. Burlison. You are communicating with colleagues.
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Communicate government business 
with colleagues on a personal device. I communicate on my work 
device.
    Mr. Burlison. Are you using an encrypted device on your 
work device?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not.
    Mr. Burlison. No encrypted apps?
    Ms. Cheatle. No, I do not.
    Mr. Burlison. OK.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Waltz from 
Florida.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Director, please, I would like to direct your 
attention to this video.
    Can you turn up the volume, staff?
    [Video played.]
    Mr. Waltz. Director Cheatle, did you speak with your boss, 
Secretary Mayorkas? You fall under DHS. Did you speak with him 
on the 14th, the day after?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes, I did.
    Mr. Waltz. So, you spoke with him before he made that 
statement?
    Ms. Cheatle. I spoke with him immediately following----
    Mr. Waltz. Did you----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. The incident.
    Mr. Waltz. Did you inform him that all requests for 
additional resources for President Trump had been fulfilled----
    Ms. Cheatle. I----
    Mr. Waltz [continuing]. Or--or that it was false to say 
they had been denied?
    Ms. Cheatle. I informed him that the request for that rally 
that day had been fulfilled.
    Mr. Waltz. OK. You continue to answer that very carefully. 
Because I made a broader statement, the agents that came to me 
made a broader statement, that his permanent protective detail 
for years now have been asking for more. Is that correct?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not have specific incidents of those 
requests.
    Mr. Waltz. Is it correct that they have been asking for 
more?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have heard the same reports that you have. 
Without having them in front of me, I am unable----
    Mr. Waltz. Those requests were made in writing. I mean, the 
agents were telling me they make them in writing. This is not a 
verbal agency; things are made in writing.
    Ms. Cheatle. I understand what you are saying. I do not 
have those requests in front of me here to----
    Mr. Waltz. I am not asking if you have them in front of 
you. Are you aware that they were made?
    Ms. Cheatle. As I said earlier, there are times when 
requests are made, and depending on the availability of assets 
or if there is a way that that----
    Mr. Waltz. So, there were times when they were denied?
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. If there is a way that that 
vulnerability can be mitigated in a different way, then that is 
why Secret Service----
    Mr. Waltz. So, there are times when they were denied----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Has----
    Mr. Waltz [continuing]. For a variety of reasons?
    Ms. Cheatle. That is why the Secret Service has a 
multilayered and multifaceted security plan, so that we can 
pivot if we need to.
    Mr. Waltz. So, in the wake--I mean, in the immediate 48 
hours of an assassination attempt on a former President, could 
be the next leader of the free world--almost had his head blown 
off--your boss says, that is irresponsible and false to say 
things or deny. And you had talked to him.
    So, did he just make that on his own--make that up on his 
own, or did you tell him that?
    Ms. Cheatle. We were speaking about the requests made at 
the rally.
    Mr. Waltz. Staff, can we show the next slide, please?
    Then we have your spokesman. Did you sign off on this 
statement, that there is an assertion that a member of the 
former President's team requested additional security resources 
and those were rebuffed? ``This is absolutely false. In fact, 
we added protective resources and technology and capability as 
part of the increased campaign travel tempo.''
    But--next slide, please. Next slide, please, staff--we have 
the Washington Post article that then says, we now have senior 
Secret Service officials saying there were in times--at times 
when it was denied.
    So, which is it?
    Ms. Cheatle. Again, there have been a number of 
conversations going on here----
    Mr. Waltz. Did you sign off on that spokesman's statement?
    Ms. Cheatle. The spokesman's statement, I believe, was 
related to requests that were made for the rally.
    Mr. Waltz. Did you sign off on it?
    Ms. Cheatle. For the requests that were made at the rally--
--
    Mr. Waltz. Did you----
    Ms. Cheatle [continuing]. Yes.
    Mr. Waltz [continuing]. Sign off on the statement before it 
went out? I sign off on my press spokesman's statements before 
they go out. I would hope you would in the wake of an 
assassination attempt.
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Waltz. You did?
    Ms. Cheatle. Uh-huh.
    Mr. Waltz. Categorically false that any requests were made. 
You signed off on it. Thank you for that--thank you for that 
clarity.
    Madam Director, how many press conferences have you held 
since the assassination attempt?
    Ms. Cheatle. We have put out press releases----
    Mr. Waltz. How many press conferences have you held? Gone 
to the mic, taken questions from the public, from the media. 
How many?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have not held any.
    Mr. Waltz. How many has your--how many has Secretary 
Mayorkas held?
    Ms. Cheatle. I do not----
    Mr. Waltz. Zero.
    How many has the FBI held? Zero.
    How many has the Department of Justice held? I know you 
know the answer.
    Ms. Cheatle. I believe there was a press conference in 
Butler after the incident occurred.
    Mr. Waltz. By local law enforcement, not by you and not by 
the Department of Homeland Security.
    So, this is how misinformation flies, I mean, in the 
darkness, in the absence of information. Now we have, 9 days 
later, before a congressional Committee--we all represent 
almost a million people, and you still do not have answers.
    Are you aware that national news anchors are saying this 
was a hoax? On national television, they are saying, no, the 
President was not shot, it was flying glass. Are you aware of 
that?
    Ms. Cheatle. I have not heard those reports.
    Mr. Waltz. Are you aware that, I mean, there are rumors 
rampant online that there were multiple shooters?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Waltz. Are you aware that because the shooter had 
overseas encrypted platforms in Belgium and New Zealand and 
Germany that a lot of people are speculating there could have 
been foreign involvement, logically? Are you aware of that?
    Ms. Cheatle. Yes.
    Mr. Waltz. And have you done anything to disabuse any of 
these notions today? No, you have not.
    Madam Director, I would fire you--regardless of the 
failure, I would fire you, just how you have handled it since.
    You should have been the first to the mics to say, 
``America, world, I want to assure you, we are going to get to 
the bottom of this. I want to assure you, full transparency. 
Our agency clearly had major gaps here, and I want to 
personally take responsibility and accountability.'' You should 
have been the first, standing alongside Secretary Mayorkas, and 
I would even go so far as to say, have daily press conferences 
updating everyone on what we know.
    But you have not had any of that. What are you hiding 
behind?
    Ms. Cheatle. I am not hiding----
    Mr. Waltz. Because you are making the situation worse. I 
think you have heard that on a bipartisan basis here. You are 
making this situation far worse in the absence of information.
    Let us move on. This is truly astounding.
    I want to be clear, because you keep dodging the issue. Has 
President Trump's permanent protective detail requested 
additional assets over the last few years?
    He is clearly not your average former President. He is not 
Jimmy Carter in an old folks' home. He is not President Bush 
painting out in his barn. He has multiple residences, a lot of 
rallies. He is very publicly engaged. And he has a foreign 
threat in addition to domestic threats.
    Have they requested additional resources?
    Chairman Comer. That is the last question, but please feel 
free to answer, Director.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you.
    Ms. Cheatle. Thank you.
    We have continued, as I stated earlier, to increase over 
the past year the assets that are at the former President's 
residence and supplied to his detail.
    Mr. Waltz. Mr. Chairman, if I could just ask for one more 
indulgence.
    It is clear you have not been to Butler, Pennsylvania. 
Leaders lead and should be on the ground. You have not been 
there.
    Instead, you went to the RNC. But you were not originally 
even going to go there. Where were you originally scheduled to 
go besides the RNC, a national special security event?
    Ms. Cheatle. I was always scheduled to go to the RNC----
    Mr. Waltz. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the 
record that the Director was scheduled to go to Aspen, 
hobnobbing around with--I do not know who--what liberal elites 
go to Aspen.
    That was where you were originally scheduled----
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Waltz [continuing]. To go to speak at a forum.
    Ms. Cheatle. I was scheduled to go to the RNC. I was going 
to leave the RNC for 24 hours and return back to the RNC.
    Mr. Waltz. I hope, as your predecessor Julia Pierson, with 
a security incident on the White House under the Obama 
Administration, and Reagan's Secret Service detail lead, I will 
hope you would have the dignity for the sake of the agents in 
the Service to resign.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you.
    Chairman Comer. I would like to enter a few things into the 
record.
    First of all, the remaining articles that Mr. Biggs was 
wanting to enter into the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Chairman Comer. Next, I have a written statement from 
Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. His district 
includes Butler. And he has a written statement that we would 
like to enter into the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Chairman Comer. A bipartisan 114th congressional report 
titled, ``United States Secret Service: An Agency in Crisis.'' 
This was prepared by former Oversight Committee Chairman Jason 
Chaffetz and former Ranking Member Elijah Cummings.
    Chairman Comer. And, last, the issued subpoena compelling 
Director Cheatle's appearance at today's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Chairman Comer. That concludes our question segment.
    I want to thank the Director for your testimony today.
    I now yield to the Ranking Member for closing remarks.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And, Director Cheatle, I also want to thank you for your 
patience over the course of what must have been a very long and 
trying hearing for you.
    It has been an unusually encouraging hearing and an 
unusually depressing hearing.
    And what is encouraging, Mr. Chairman, is that we came 
together to issue a strong statement deploring and 
categorically denouncing political violence in America. And I 
also did not see any daylight between the members of the two 
parties today at the hearing in terms of our bafflement and 
outrage about the shocking operational failures that led to 
disaster and near catastrophe on July 13, 2024.
    What is depressing is the extraordinary communications gap 
between the Director of the Secret Service and Congress.
    And I do not want to add to the Director's terrible, 
horrible, no good, very bad day, but I will be joining the 
Chairman in calling for the resignation of the Director just 
because I think that this relationship is irretrievable at this 
point, and I think that the Director has lost the confidence of 
Congress at a very urgent and tender moment in the history of 
the country, and we need to very quickly move beyond this.
    But what I will say, Mr. Chairman, is that I took this 
hearing to be about two major policy failures. And one policy 
failure is the one that got the vast majority of the attention, 
which was the failure of the Secret Service to effectively 
respond to a gunman on a roof within 150 yards of a 
Presidential visit and speech.
    But the other failure is on the part of Congress. Because 
the mass shooting that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania, is 
replicated all over the country every day. And, in fact, as I 
said, Mr. Chairman, it happened that evening in Alabama, in 
Birmingham, Alabama, where there was a mass shooting where more 
people even were killed and wounded than were killed and 
wounded in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    So, it is true, the President, the former President, and a 
handful of people who get the Secret Service protection are the 
only people in America we thought were safe from an AR-15 
attack. It is clear that they are not safe either, and we have 
got to get to the bottom of that.
    But we also have to get to the bottom of the larger 
problem, which is that the whole country is living like this, 
in fear and in terror of assault-weapon attacks in movie 
theaters, churches, synagogues, mosques, supermarkets, 
Walmarts, you know, anyplace where an audience or a public 
gathers. And the worst was in Las Vegas, where a gunman got up 
on a roof and then just mowed down 60 people below him and 
wounded hundreds and hundreds of other people.
    So, we have got to deal with that problem. Yes, we have got 
to move as swiftly as we can to deal with the problems at the 
Secret Service, but the broader problem is still there.
    And I just wish to the heavens that our colleagues that 
could get together on the question of Presidential security 
against an AR-15 attack could get together on the question of 
public security against an AR-15 attack. Because all of us are 
vulnerable. All of our families are in danger by this.
    And the rest of the world does not live this way. And we 
have to look to see how uniquely strange it is that we allow 
20-year-olds to access AR-15s, weapons of mass destruction, and 
show up in public places to endanger other people.
    And I hope, Mr. Chairman, we can work together on that with 
the same spirit of bipartisan commitment to the public safety 
that was exemplified here today.
    And I yield back to you.
    Chairman Comer. The Ranking Member yields back.
    I will deliver my closing remarks.
    Director Cheatle, I subpoenaed you to appear today to get 
answers for the American people about the failures that led to 
the assassination attempt to President Donald J. Trump. 
Unfortunately, you refused to answer today.
    And this Committee is not known for its bipartisan--its 
model of bipartisanship, but I think today we came together 
unanimously in our disappointment for your lack of answers.
    You have stated that the FBI will investigate and give a 
report in, you estimate, 60 days. We have been waiting for 
months and months for lots of different bits of information 
from the FBI. We have no confidence in the FBI. The majority of 
this Committee has no confidence in the FBI.
    I sincerely hoped that the hearing today would give not 
just Congress confidence in the Secret Service, but the 
American people would have confidence in the Secret Service. We 
do not have confidence, not just in Congress, but I do not 
believe the American people tonight when they go to bed are 
going to have confidence that the Secret Service is the best it 
can be at protecting President Biden, at protecting the First 
Lady, at protecting President Trump, at protecting their 
families. That is what the primary role for the Secret Service 
should be.
    And some people have said and speculated, well, there needs 
to be more money and more employees. As I stated early on, a 
$3.1 billion--I believe next year it is going to be a $3.2 
billion budget; over 8,000 employees.
    If the Secret Service is spread too thin in doing things 
like inspecting counterfeit--which is what the Secret Service 
was created to do, was to inspect counterfeit money and things 
like that with the Treasury. If it is spread too thin, then we 
need to come together in Congress--and I think we can do that 
in a bipartisan way--to narrow the focus of the Secret Service 
to protect the leaders of our country, to protect our elections 
by protecting our candidates. And I do not believe we have any 
confidence that you can do that, as the leader of the FBI 
[sic].
    I sincerely hoped that we would adjourn this Committee 
hearing and have confidence not just in the Secret Service but 
in you as Director of the Secret Service. But we do not.
    Taking responsibility requires a lot of things. It means 
providing transparency. It means answering simple questions. It 
means providing a specific timeline of July 13 to this 
Committee and the American people.
    I mean, it has been 9 days. There were people that were 
demanding that we have a hearing the next day or 2 days 
following the shooting, and I said, no, we need to give the 
Secret Service ample time to be able to answer those questions. 
Nine days. Nine days. And I do not think we answered very many 
questions that the American people have.
    I do not think there was a--I have never said this before, 
and I have presided over a lot of hearings. I do not think 
there was one question asked by anyone that the average 
American has not already asked at a diner or at church or at a 
ball game.
    The American people have questions. They deserve answers. 
Congress deserves answers. You were subpoenaed today to provide 
answers, and, ma'am, you did not do that.
    So, as Ranking Member Raskin stated, he and I will be 
sending a letter requesting that you submit your resignation as 
a step toward accountability in what happened.
    And one of the biggest frustrations that many of us have, 
especially on this side of the aisle, is that there is never 
accountability in this Administration. And when you look at the 
debacles prior to July 13, I mean, it would be hard to beat the 
withdrawal in Afghanistan, the debacle there. And no one was 
held accountable. To this day, no one has been held accountable 
for that.
    But here we have, clearly, video showing people notifying 
the police. And the police are blaming the Secret Service. The 
Secret Service are blaming the police. Homeland Security is 
blaming everybody.
    But at the end of the day, after this hearing, and after 
our requests for information, we do not have any answers for 
the American people, and we do not have that confidence that 
you can lead the Secret Service to restore the confidence. And, 
again, I commend the ranking member for joining with me in the 
letter asking your resignation. And we certainly hope that you 
will take that to heart.
    With that and without objection, all members have 5 
legislative days within which to submit materials and 
additional written questions for the witness, which will be 
forwarded to the witness.
    Chairman Comer. If there is no further business, without 
objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 2:38 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

                                 [all]
