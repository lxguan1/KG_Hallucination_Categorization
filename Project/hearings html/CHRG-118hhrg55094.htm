    SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

    TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment
    FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment
    RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Proposals for a Water 
Resources Development Act of 2024: Members' Day Hearing''
_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment of the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on 
Thursday, January 11, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 Rayburn 
House Office Building to receive Member testimony at a hearing 
entitled, ``Proposals for a Water Resources Development Act of 
2024: Members' Day Hearing.'' The purpose of this hearing is to 
provide Members of the House of Representatives with an 
opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee on their 
priorities related to the United States Army Corps of Engineers 
(Corps). Testimony will help to inform the drafting of a Water 
Resources Development Act (WRDA) for 2024, which the Committee 
expects to approve this year.

                             II. BACKGROUND

    The Corps is the Federal Government's largest water 
resources development and management agency.\1\ The Corps' 
primary civil works missions are riverine and coastal 
navigation, the reduction of flood damage risks along inland 
and coastal waters, and projects to restore and protect the 
aquatic ecosystems.\2\ Additionally, the Corps provides outdoor 
recreation opportunities, offers water supply storage to state 
and local partners, assists in emergency response, participates 
in the construction of environmental infrastructure projects, 
and is a leading producer of hydropower in the United 
States.\3\ To achieve its mission, the Corps plans, designs, 
and constructs water resources development projects, which are 
authorized through WRDAs, enacted biennially by Congress since 
2014.\4\

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER OF NORTH CAROLINA, 
   CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

    Mr. Rouzer. Today's hearing marks the third in a series 
this subcommittee is holding in preparation for the Water 
Resources Development Act, or WRDA, as we call it, of 2024. In 
December, we heard from representatives of the Army Corps of 
Engineers and national stakeholders in our first two WRDA 
hearings.
    As one of our witnesses stated in our last hearing, WRDA is 
the most important piece of legislation, they said, that most 
Americans have never heard of. And how true that probably is.
    On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we are 
proud to work hard and draft a WRDA regularly. In fact, since 
2014, Congress has passed a WRDA bill every 2 years in 
bipartisan fashion.
    In addition to being on a dependable and predictable 
schedule, these bills have been bipartisan and consensus-based, 
ensuring consistency and certainty, which provides greater 
benefit for stakeholders and communities across the country. I 
look forward to continuing this tradition and working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass another WRDA bill 
this year.
    WRDA is a critical legislative vehicle, ensuring 
communities' water resources needs are met nationwide. 
Navigation, flood control, beach nourishment, ecosystem 
restoration, hydropower, water supply, and recreation at Corps 
facilities are all important issues we will address in this 
year's WRDA. In other words, our Nation needs WRDAs to keep our 
communities safe and functional.
    Today, I look forward to hearing directly from my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the priorities 
important to them and their constituents and how they will 
benefit communities across our country. I thank each and every 
one of them for taking time out of their busy schedule to be 
with us today.
    [Mr. Rouzer's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. David Rouzer, a Representative in Congress 
 from the State of North Carolina, and Chairman, Subcommittee on Water 
                       Resources and Environment
    Today's hearing marks the third in a series this subcommittee is 
holding in preparation for the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 
of 2024. Last month, we heard from representatives of the Army Corps of 
Engineers and national stakeholders in our first two WRDA hearings.
    As one of our witnesses wisely said in our last hearing, WRDA is 
the most important piece of legislation that most Americans have never 
heard of. On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we are 
proud to work hard and draft a WRDA regularly. In fact, since 2014, 
Congress has passed a WRDA bill every two years.
    In addition to being on a dependable and predictable schedule, 
these bills have been bipartisan and consensus-based, making life a 
little easier for stakeholders and communities across the country. I 
look forward to continuing this tradition and working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass another WRDA bill this 
year.
    WRDA is a critical legislative vehicle, ensuring communities' water

will benefit communities across our country. I thank each and every one 
of them for taking time out of their busy schedule to be with us today.

    Mr. Rouzer. And with that, I now recognize Ranking Member 
Napolitano for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA, 
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

    Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this 
third hearing in a series of our informed development of a new 
WRDA for 2024.
    The Army Corps of Engineers are our largest water managers 
in the Nation and our resident experts on everything from flood 
prevention to water supply to aquatic ecosystem restoration. We 
have so far heard excellent testimony from Assistant Secretary 
of Army for Civil Works Michael Connor, as well as Lieutenant 
General Scott Spellmon, Chief of Engineers at the Corps.
    We also have heard from highly engaged stakeholders who 
shared helpful insight into the impacts and policies of the 
Corps' work. Truly, every different perspective is helpful to 
our work here.
    Today, we welcome our Members of Congress to present their 
priorities for consideration in WRDA 2024. The Corps operates 
nationwide with impacts on just about every single district in 
the country.
    With a reach so far and wide, we need to make sure we 
recognize the specific issues facing our communities. These 
will be totally different on the east coast versus the west, 
and even different within a particular State.
    The testimony we receive today will help to inform us on 
what matters most to our colleagues as we move forward with 
drafting legislation. This local perspective is key to helping 
our communities achieve their desired outcomes and ensuring the 
Corps' expertise is accessible to all those who seek it.
    As we start developing our sixth consecutive, bipartisan 
WRDA bill, we are seeing that the legislation has become a 
product of its own success. Our constituency demands and now 
expects that we move forward in developing this legislation 
every Congress. This consistency and predictability is 
essential to the Corps itself and stakeholders across the 
country.
    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a continued partnership 
with you in addressing the unique needs of Members on both 
sides of the aisle. The success of this committee on WRDAs has 
come from recognizing that collaboration and compromise are the 
tools to success in hyper-partisan times. That was true under 
the leadership of former Chairman Shuster and Chair DeFazio, 
and I look forward to a similar path under your leadership and 
the leadership of Chairman Graves.
    Thank you to all Members who have made time to come before 
the committee today. I look forward to your testimony and 
working with you to write another successful WRDA and continue 
the important work of the Corps for water resources projects 
nationwide.

  Prepared Statement of Hon. Grace F. Napolitano, a Representative in 
Congress from the State of California, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee 
                   on Water Resources and Environment
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this third hearing in a series 
to inform our development of a new Water Resources Development Act for 
2024. The Army Corps of Engineers are our largest water managers in the 
nation, and our resident experts on everything from flood prevention, 
to water supply, to aquatic ecosystem restoration.
    We have so far heard excellent testimony from Assistant Secretary 
of the Army for Civil Works, Michael Connor, as well as Lieutenant 
General Scott Spellmon, Chief of Engineers at the Corps.
    We've also heard from highly engaged stakeholders, who shared 
helpful insight into the impacts and policies of the Corps' work. 
Truly, every different perspective is helpful to our work here.
    Today, we welcome Members of the House to present their priorities 
for consideration in WRDA 2024. The Corps operates nationwide, with 
impacts on just about every single district in the country.
    With a reach so far and wide, we need to make sure we recognize the 
district-specific issues facing our communities. These will be totally 
different on the east coast versus the west, and even different within 
a particular state.
    The testimony we receive today will help to inform us on what 
matters most to our colleagues as we move forward with drafting 
legislation. This local perspective is key to helping our communities 
achieve their desired outcomes and ensuring the Corps' expertise is 
accessible to all those who seek it.
    As we start developing our sixth consecutive, bipartisan, WRDA 
bill, we are seeing that this legislation has become a product of its 
own success.
    Our constituents demand and now expect that we move forward in 
developing this legislation every Congress. This consistency and 
predictability is essential to the Corps itself, and stakeholders 
across the country.
    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a continued partnership with you in 
addressing the unique needs of members on both sides of the aisle. The 
success of this Committee on WRDAs has come from recognizing that 
collaboration and compromise are the tools to success in these hyper-
partisan times. That was true under the leadership of former Chair 
Shuster and Chair DeFazio, and I look forward to a similar path under 
your leadership and the leadership of Chair Graves.
    Thank you to all Members who have made time to come before the 
Committee today.
    I look forward to your testimony and working with you to write 
another successful WRDA bill and continue the important work of the 
Corps for water resources projects nationwide.

    Mrs. Napolitano. I yield back.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the 
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Larsen, for up to 5 
minutes for an opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING 
     MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I want 
to welcome everyone to our Member Day hearing, which is an 
opportunity for our House colleagues to share with this 
committee their needs and priorities that are most pressing for 
their constituents.
    Close to 40 Members have signed up to testify today, and 
this committee is now working together on solving local water 
resources challenges and creating economic opportunity for the 
people we represent. That history of success is evidenced by 
the five bipartisan and bicameral WRDAs enacted since 2014, a 
tradition we expect to carry forward with passage of this sixth 
WRDA in a row.
    The enthusiasm of Members seeking to testify today is not 
surprising. This hearing is happening at a very important time. 
After years of neglect, we are now seeing real and sustained 
investments in our Nation's water-related infrastructure, 
including ports and harbors, flood risk reduction for 
communities, and restoration of the natural environment.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL, is delivering 
tangible results for communities all across the country. The 
BIL provided a massive downpayment, a total of about $17 
billion, for studying and implementing critical WRDA projects. 
Ensuring that we continue to build on that success is 
essential, and the testimony that our colleagues deliver today 
will aid us in that effort.
    WRDA 2024 is also an opportunity to continue to advance the 
policy achievements of the last few WRDAs, including supporting 
America's competitive edge by investing in harbor and inland 
waterway navigation; making investments that create jobs and 
opportunities for everyone; building climate-resilient 
communities; increasing equity across Corps projects, 
especially to advance the needs of economically disadvantaged 
and Tribal communities; and addressing local water and 
wastewater infrastructure needs.
    So, thank you, Mr. Chair, for your commitment and working 
in a bipartisan manner to see this legislation over the finish 
line. Including a diverse range of perspectives is essential to 
ensuring the work of this committee meets the needs of people 
from across the country. Making sure our Members can directly 
advocate for their districts is an essential part of this 
process.
    So, I want to thank all the Members who have made time to 
come to the committee today. I am eager to hear your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. CAROL D. MILLER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

    Mrs. Miller of West Virginia. Good morning, Chairman Rouzer 
and Ranking Member Larsen. Thank you for allowing me to be here 
today to testify on behalf of my Water Resources Development 
Act request. I really appreciate----
    Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. Bring that microphone a little 
closer to you.
    Mrs. Miller of West Virginia. I appreciate your time and 
your attention. I have requested a feasibility study at the 
R.D. Bailey watershed in Mingo and Wyoming Counties of West 
Virginia.
    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers started an environmental 
impact and feasibility study within the watershed at the cost 
of a private company in 2020. In 2022, without providing an 
explanation, the Corps terminated the study prematurely after 
already spending part of the private funding. In other words, 
they stopped midstream. Not only was this a waste of money, it 
was a huge waste of time, and it didn't end in any information 
being released about the watershed.
    Therefore, I would like to request that the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers be mandated to complete a feasibility study at the 
R.D. Bailey watershed so that we can better complete and 
understand the area and how certain activities might impact the 
R.D. Bailey Dam.
    Thank you very much for having me before your committee and 
considering my request.

TESTIMONY OF HON. GRACE MENG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                     THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Ms. Meng. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, 
Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished members of the House 
Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water 
Resources and Environment, thank you for allowing me to testify 
today. I am honored to share with you all my priorities as the 
committee considers reauthorization of WRDA of 2024 that will 
support the safety and well-being of my constituents in Queens, 
New York.
    Two years ago, I testified in front of this committee about 
the horrifying impacts that Hurricane Ida had on New York City. 
The storm, sadly, took the lives of 13 New Yorkers, many of 
whom were my constituents. I told the committee about how New 
York's 100-plus-year-old stormwater system is unable to keep up 
with increasingly powerful and frequent storms that cause 
deadly flooding and economic damage to Queens. And now I sit 
before you in 2024, which will mark the 3-year anniversary of 
Ida, to inform you that Queens is still at risk from these 
storms.
    In Queens, we view terms like ``100-'' or ``500-year 
floods'' with skepticism, because we know from experience that 
these storms are occurring with greater frequency. A year after 
Ida, many of my constituents who were still recovering from 
storm damage were again hit by horrific flooding. During that 
storm, the city of New York sent out an emergency alert 
advising people who live in basement apartments, for example, 
to move to higher floors. And even in the 2 weeks before Ida, 
Tropical Storm Henri broke the existing record for rainfall in 
the city.
    I can go on, but the evidence is clear: these storms are 
occurring with greater frequency, and New York City is not 
prepared.
    In the Water Resources Development Act of 2022, I was proud 
to secure a $119 million authorization for Queens, and now I am 
asking for that authorization to please be increased to $250 
million in the 2024 reauthorization. This would authorize the 
Army Corps of Engineers to spend up to $250 million to work 
with the city of New York in upgrading environmental 
infrastructure in Queens. This could fund projects that 
directly address the devastating flooding that my constituents 
face, and to help save lives.
    Thank you again for your time and consideration of this 
matter. I ask that the chairman and ranking member consider my 
request for inclusion in this year's WRDA reauthorization to 
protect the people of Queens. Thank you.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

    Mr. Steil. Thank you very much, Chairman Rouzer, and thank 
you to the members of the committee for joining us today.
    Mr. Rouzer. Bring that microphone closer to you.
    Mr. Steil. Let me see if I can get it--is that better for 
you? Thank you very much.
    In January 2020, storms dramatically impacted many 
communities on the Great Lakes. We have had high water levels, 
we have had challenges to breakwaters. Under current law, what 
we see is a real difficulty of smaller communities accessing 
Federal funds, and the answer here is to make sure that we are 
revising WRDA in a manner that actually allows smaller 
communities, and particularly those along the Great Lakes, to 
be able to access Federal funds that already exist to make 
important repairs in both harbors and breakwaters.
    If the repairs aren't made to some of the aging and damaged 
breakwaters, flooding and storms can threaten many of our 
communities, communities like Racine or Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 
my district, but communities all across the Great Lakes. And 
so, for that reason, I am here today to advocate for my 
proposal to add to the 2024 Water Resources Development Act.
    My proposed language would provide another avenue for 
publicly owned, underserved community harbors, particularly 
ones in the Great Lakes, to obtain Federal funding for certain 
water infrastructure projects. Should the language be included 
in the finalized 2024 WRDA bill, more communities struggling to 
generate the necessary capital to complete critical water 
infrastructure and harbor maintenance projects would qualify 
for that assistance.
    It would also remove one of the barriers to expeditiously 
complete dredging projects, which is really essential for many 
of our Great Lakes harbors.
    I appreciate the subcommittee's engagement with my staff on 
this issue, and I look forward to our offices' continued 
collaboration.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Bryan Steil, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Wisconsin
    Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee, for hosting this 
hearing.
    In January 2020, winter storms and high water levels caused 
significant damage to many Great Lakes communities' water 
infrastructure, such as the Racine harbor breakwater in my district.
    If repairs are not made to the aging and damaged breakwater, 
flooding and storms will threaten Racine's historic downtown and urban 
Root River revitalization plans.
    For that reason, I am here today to advocate for my proposed 
addition to the 2024 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA).
    My proposed language would provide an additional avenue for 
publicly owned, underserved community harbors, particularly ones in the 
Great Lakes, to receive federal assistance for certain water 
infrastructure projects.
    Should this language be included in a finalized 2024 WRDA bill, 
more communities struggling to generate the necessary capital to 
complete important water infrastructure projects and harbor maintenance 
would qualify for funding.
    It would also remove one of the barriers in the way of the 
expeditious completion of dredging projects.
    I appreciate the subcommittee's engagement with my staff on this 
issue and look forward to our office's continued collaboration, Mr. 
Chair.

    Mr. Steil. I yield back.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman.
    Mr. Case, you are recognized.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. ED CASE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                      THE STATE OF HAWAII

    Mr. Case. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, members of 
the committee, and thank you very much for allowing me to 
testify today on our 2024 Water Resources Development Act. A 
special mahalo to Mr. Larsen for visiting Honolulu to look at 
some of our critical projects last week. I certainly invite the 
committee members to do the same.
    I have policy requests, related requests for your 
consideration, but today I want to highlight two critical U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers projects that must be addressed in WRDA 
this year. These projects are located in my district of 
Honolulu proper, but both of them are also critical to the 
basic functioning of Hawaii statewide.
    The first is the Ala Wai Flood Risk Management Project, 
which was first conceived back in 1999 and was authorized and 
funded by Congress for design and construction in our 2018 
WRDA. This project will address severe flood risk across the 
Ala Wai watershed, which is in Honolulu proper, running from 
the top of the mountains down to the ocean in central Honolulu. 
This endangers the life, property, and livelihood of about 
200,000 residents of this watershed.
    But equally important, Waikiki, which is the engine of our 
tourist economy, our number-one economy in Hawaii, lies at the 
ocean edge of this particular watershed, and a flood of any 
magnitude would cause untold damage to our overall economy.
    The Corps worked over the last couple of years since 2018 
to revise its original plan authorized in the prior WRDA in an 
effort to meet community concerns, and ultimately paused the 
project in June of 2021 while those concerns were addressed. 
The Corps has recently come back with a proposed revised plan 
at a cost of $1 billion-plus, and that plan is currently out 
for comment on a draft EIS with an expected finalization in 
mid-year. The continuation of this critical project will 
require further WRDA authorization.
    Also in central Honolulu, Honolulu Harbor, the State of 
Hawaii's primary harbor is way overdue for extensive 
modifications to assure our current and next generation 
maritime needs. Honolulu Harbor, which in its modern 
configuration was completed in 1952, is the linchpin to life in 
Hawaii. As an isolated island State, about 80 percent of our 
goods and materials are imported, and 95 percent of these 
imported goods and materials comes through Honolulu Harbor. So, 
the harbor is not only the harbor that serves the island of 
Oahu, which we have our principal population center on, but is 
also the transshipment point for virtually all shipping out to 
the other islands of Hawaii. And by the way, it is also the 
shipping point focus for the exports from Oahu and the rest of 
the State.
    As I said, the harbor is way overdue for just basic 
navigational and operational upgrades, which are required for 
continued functioning for both civilian use and elements of our 
military communities. And Congress recognized as much by 
authorizing and funding a full Army Corps study of 
modifications through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That 
investigation is already well underway, but the Corps believes 
that the study authorization must be updated to reflect the 
expanded complexity, scope, and funding needs.
    Additionally, in the course of this initial investigation, 
our local partner, the Hawaii State Department of 
Transportation, has strongly expressed the necessity of 
expanding the study scope to include elements of coastal storm 
risk management and resiliency. Providing this additional 
refined and expanded authorization will ensure that our 
critical harbor is designed for resilience, and that this 
literal lifeline for Hawaii remains operational in the face of 
natural disaster and weather modification contingencies.
    Thank you again so much for allowing me to testify in 
support of these critical projects, and I look forward to 
working with the committee to advance these authorizations in 
our current WRDA cycle.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ed Case, a Representative in Congress From 
                          the State of Hawaii
    Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and Members of the Committee:
    Mahalo for allowing me to testify today on critical priorities for 
Hawai`i ahead of the Committee's consideration of the 2024 Water 
Resources Development Act (WRDA). Mahalo again to you, Ranking Member 
Larsen, for visiting Honolulu last week to examine our WRDA needs and 
other infrastructure priorities in person.
    While I will also be submitting policy-related requests for your 
consideration, I want to highlight two critical current U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers projects that must be addressed in WRDA this year. Without 
further action by Congress, both the ongoing Honolulu Harbor 
Modifications and Ala Wai Flood Risk Management projects could face 
long-term delays with significant consequences. While located in my 
district of Honolulu proper and of direct relevance to hundreds of 
thousands of my constituents, both projects are also crucial to the 
basic functioning of Hawai`i statewide.
    The Ala Wai Flood Risk Management Project began in 1999 and was 
authorized and funded by Congress for design and construction in the 
2018 WRDA. The project will address severe flood risks across the Ala 
Wai watershed, running from the top of the Ko'olau mountains through 
much of central Honolulu to the ocean. that endanger the property, 
livelihoods and lives of some 200,000 residents in Honolulu. Waikiki, 
the engine of our top economy, also lies exclusively within this 
watershed, and an unmitigated flood of any magnitude would cause untold 
damage to our overall economy. The Corps estimates that a major flood 
in the watershed would cause more than $1.1 billion to structures 
alone; that is likely conservative and does not include overall 
economic damage.
    The Corps has worked to revise its original plan, authorized in the 
prior WRDA, in an effort to meet community concerns, and ultimately 
paused the project in June 2021 while those concerns were addressed. 
The Corps has recently released a proposed revised plan at a cost of $1 
billion-plus; that plan is currently out for comment with an expected 
finalization in April-June of this year. The continuation of this 
critical project will require further WRDA authorization.
    Also in central Honolulu, Honolulu Harbor, the State of Hawaii's 
primary harbor is overdue for extensive modifications to assure our 
current and next-generation maritime needs. The Harbor, which in its 
modern configuration was completed in 1952, is the lynchpin to life in 
Hawai`i. As an isolated island state, about 80 percent of Hawaii's 
goods and materials are imported, 95 percent of which arrive by ship 
through Honolulu Harbor. The Harbor serves not only the Island of 
O'ahu, but also is the transshipment point for virtually all shipping 
imports to the other islands of Hawai'i. It is further the shipping 
point for exports from O'ahu and the rest of the state.
    The Harbor is way overdue for basic navigational and operational 
upgrades which are required for continued functioning for both civilian 
use and elements of our military communities. Congress recognized as 
much by authorizing and funding a full Army Corps study of 
modifications through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. While that 
investigation is already well underway, the Corps believes that the 
study authorization must be updated to reflect expanded complexity, 
scope and funding needs.
    Additionally, in the course of the initial investigation, the local 
partner, the Hawai`i State Department of Transportation, has strongly 
expressed the necessity of expanding the study scope to include 
elements of coastal storm risk management. Providing this additional 
refined and expanded authorization will ensure our critical harbor is 
designed for resilience and that this literal lifeline for Hawai`i 
remains operational in the face of natural disaster and weather 
modification contingencies.
    Mahalo again for allowing me to testify in support of these two 
critical projects. I look forward to working with the Committee to 
advance these updated authorizations in the current WRDA cycle.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Higgins, you are now 
recognized.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. CLAY HIGGINS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA

    Mr. Higgins of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, Madam Ranking 
Member, members of the committee, thank you for allowing me to 
address you today.
    Louisiana is home to many of the Nation's largest ports and 
most trafficked waterways, some of the largest flood mitigation 
and coastal restoration projects. Each of these assets relies 
on WRDA's policy guidance and funding support through the 
workplan for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
    I would like to particularly stress the importance of 
dredging the Calcasieu Ship Channel. This is a 64-mile channel 
originally intended to be 400 feet wide and 40 feet deep. It 
extends into the Gulf of Mexico, and it provides access to the 
epicenter of LNG export for the entire country. We are seeking 
authorization to deepen the channel by up to 5 feet. This is 
very important. Doing so would provide under keel clearance for 
larger vessels, increasing the safety of oceangoing vessels 
transiting the channel and generating new economic 
opportunities for the region and the country.
    The ships are getting bigger. This is the single most 
important ship channel, arguably, in the country as it relates 
to our delivery of clean, affordable energy across the world. 
The Calcasieu Ship Channel delivers over 60 percent of the LNG 
sent to our allies overseas, so, the performance of the 
Calcasieu Ship Channel impacts the world.
    Further, rock jetties that were congressionally authorized 
for the Calcasieu River and Pass Project to protect the 400-
foot-wide inside channel require extension in the Gulf of 
Mexico, about 1\1/2\ miles. Rock jetties are a simple formula 
that work very well, but we require the appropriate funding and 
authorization to extend those jetties. This is supported by the 
Army Corps of Engineers, as well.
    Regarding money, the Calcasieu River and Pass Project and 
the Port of Lake Charles generate $39.1 billion in economic 
activity and $2.6 billion in Federal revenue annually. It 
supports 108,700 direct and indirect jobs in Louisiana, and 
about 160,000 jobs nationwide. It is estimated that once these 
new investments are realized, an additional $74.5 billion will 
be contributed to the national economy and an additional $5.24 
billion annually in Federal tax revenue.
    Additionally, my office has submitted several requests 
aimed at advancing coastal restoration projects along the gulf 
coast and improving flood mitigation in water management 
strategies. These efforts are critical for coastal and inland 
communities across south Louisiana and protecting the LNG 
industrial sector.
    I appreciate the time we were granted today to address the 
committee, and I look forward to answering your questions.
    [Mr. Higgins of Louisiana's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Clay Higgins, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Louisiana
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, subcommittee Chairman 
Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, thank you for the opportunity to 
discuss the importance of this year's Water Resources Development Act 
(WRDA). Over the past iterations of WRDA, Louisiana has been able to 
obtain critical wins that protect the environment, bolster more 
resilient communities, and support long-term maintenance activities.
    Successful WRDA implementation is important to the country, and it 
is a vital and critical piece of legislation for South Louisiana. My 
state is home to many of the nation's largest ports, most trafficked 
waterways, and major hurricane protection and coastal restoration 
projects. Each of these assets relies on WRDA's policy guidance and 
funding support through the work plan for the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (Corps).
    I wish to inform the committee of a few critical projects and 
opportunities for this year's WRDA.
    First, I would like to discuss the importance of continued funding 
for dredging the Calcasieu Ship Channel. We have made major strides in 
securing funds to maintain the channel, and we are now seeking new 
authorizations to deepen the channel by up to 5 feet. Doing so would 
provide safe under-keel clearance for larger vessels, increasing the 
safety of ocean-going vessels transiting the channel and generating new 
economic opportunities for the region.
    Further, rock jetties that were congressionally authorized on the 
Calcasieu River and Pass Project to protect the 400-foot-wide 
``inside'' channel require extension in the Gulf of Mexico. Extending 
the jetty by 1.5 miles is necessary to increase navigational safety, 
protect the lives of vessels' crews, and ultimately protect the 
environment.
    The Calcasieu River and Pass Project and the Port of Lake Charles 
generates $39.1 billion in economic activity and $2.6 billion in 
federal revenue annually. It supports 108,773 direct and indirect jobs 
in Louisiana, as well as 158,485 jobs nationwide. It is estimated that 
once these new investments are realized, an additional $74.6 billion 
will be contributed to the national economy and an additional $5.24 
billion annually in federal tax revenue.
    The original investment has turned the Port of Lake Charles into 
the 13th busiest port in the nation and serves not only as a major 
economic driver for Louisiana, but for the United States as a whole.
    Additionally, my office has submitted several requests aimed at 
advancing coastal restoration projects along the Gulf Coast and 
improving flood mitigation and water management strategies. These 
efforts are critical for coastal and inland communities across South 
Louisiana. We must continue to prioritize pre-disaster mitigation and 
make smart investments in projects that strengthen the resiliency of 
our communities.
    As the committee reviews requests for WRDA, I implore you to 
consider critical projects for Southwest Louisiana. I appreciate the 
time given to Members to speak before the committee to discuss the 
importance of the Corps and water resource projects today.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Ms. Kaptur, you are now 
recognized.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. MARCY KAPTUR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                     FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member 
Napolitano, ranking member of the full committee Mr. Larsen, 
and Congressman Garamendi. Thank you for you and your staff for 
doing all the work to put this hearing together and to develop 
the Water Resources Development Act of 2024. And I must call 
out the special qualities of Ranking Member Napolitano. I know 
this is her last year of service in the Congress.
    But I wish to say that, Congresswoman, your dignity, your 
acumen, and your perseverance elevate the reputation of this 
House. Thank you so much for your service.
    I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the important water 
resource development needs of the communities in Ohio's Ninth 
Congressional District across northern Ohio, the Lake Erie 
Islands, as well as the Great Lakes region as a whole. I hold 
the privilege of representing the largest watershed in the 
entire Great Lakes region. It drains increasing rainfall and 
water flows across segments of three States through our 
district into Lake Erie, the southernmost of the Great Lakes.
    Our bountiful region agriculturally also is the most tiled 
region in our Nation, having been installed to drain what is 
known as the Great Black Swamp. We live in a mud puddle. With 
increasing rainfall, challenges to subwatershed functional 
equilibrium are increasing. The Corps could aid our efforts to 
manage these changing circumstances by producing a detailed 
subwatershed topographical and directional flow map that can 
serve to detail subwatersheds and their interrelationship, so 
our region can better handle the rising amounts of rainfall for 
proper land and freshwater stewardship, storage, reservoirs, 
filtration, necessary tree and vegetation plantings, and 
windbreaks.
    Another significant challenge is the need to advance the 
Corps' critical work maintaining and improving the harbors and 
waterways on Great Lakes in a manner that improves water 
quality in the largest fresh surface water system on Earth. In 
Lake Erie, which borders my district, meeting that goal will 
require the Corps and its non-Federal partners to maximize the 
beneficial use of dredged material from federally authorized 
harbors, even partnering--imagine that--with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture on regenerative soil complements as 
our Nation prepares the new farm bill.
    Thanks to your committee's inclusion of section 8130(b) in 
the WRDA 2022, the Corps is now making progress on dredged 
material management plans for the Lake Erie harbors that will 
not involve open lake disposal. However, Corps financial 
assistance for the design and implementation of dredged 
material placement facilities in the State of Ohio continues to 
fall short of what is authorized by law.
    The State of Ohio and the individual Lake Erie port 
authorities have made tremendous investments in beneficial use 
placement sites and confined disposal facilities over many 
years. It is time for the Corps to step up and cost share these 
improvements in accordance with standing authorities. I urge 
the committee to direct the Corps to expedite the completion of 
cost sharing agreements for the beneficial use placement sites 
and confined disposal facilities on Lake Erie that are 
currently being planned and designed by non-Federal partners at 
their own expense.
    Protecting our freshwater kingdom of the Great Lakes also 
requires completion of the interbasin invasive species barrier 
at Brandon Road Lock and Dam. Located on the Des Plaines River 
near Joliet, Illinois, Brandon Road is the central connection 
point through which invasive carp species can move between the 
Illinois Waterway system into Lake Michigan and the four other 
Great Lakes, severely harming native fish species. Two-hundred 
twenty-six million dollars from the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act will fund the construction and deployment of 
state-of-the-art technologies and innovative programs that 
interrupt movement, but local cooperation requirements remain a 
challenge to implementation.
    Thanks to your committee's work on the WRDA 2022, 
construction of the interbasin invasive species barrier now 
requires a 90-percent Federal contribution, and the committee 
can further ensure implementation by modifying the cost sharing 
for operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and 
rehabilitation of the measures.
    I want to thank the committee for its continued focus on 
another ecological problem we face in the Great Lakes, harmful 
algal blooms, and I urge the committee to continue supporting 
the ongoing work of the Corps for HAB detection, control, and 
prevention. I want to urge the committee to expand the scope of 
the HAB demonstration program authorized in WRDA 2020 to 
address not only HABs associated with water resource projects, 
but also HABs that adversely impact large bodies of water of 
regional, national, or international significance. That will 
ensure that demonstration projects designed to address HABs in 
western Lake Erie, some of the most frequent and severe in the 
Nation, will be eligible for funding under the Corps' program.
    My time is expired, but I strongly urge the committee to 
emphasize the importance of demonstration projects designed to 
develop and deploy advanced monitoring tools and networks to 
address the nutrient loading that is the root cause of HAB at 
the source of the problem.
    Thank you so very much, and I hope the Corps can help us in 
the coming year to find a second water intake location to serve 
the large Toledo, Ohio, regional area so our water is never 
shut off again for 3 days because of invasive HABs in our water 
system. Thank you all so very much.
    [Ms. Kaptur's prepared statement follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Marcy Kaptur, a Representative in Congress 
                         From the State of Ohio
    Thank you Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and your 
respective staff for the hard work you have put in to developing the 
Water Resources Development Act of 2024 (WRDA). On a bipartisan basis, 
your Committee has now completed work on five consecutive WRDAs since 
2014--advancing significant progress to meet our nation's needs.
    The Committee's authorization of new U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
projects, studies, and policies supports local, regional, and national 
priorities that have a lasting impact. As Ranking Member of the 
Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the Corps' budget, it is an 
honor to partner with you in this mission.
    I appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you here today the 
important water resources development needs of the communities in my 
district and the Great Lakes Region as a whole. Chief among them is the 
need to advance the Corps' critical work maintaining and improving the 
harbors and waterways on Great Lakes in a manner that improves water 
quality in the largest fresh surface water system on earth. In Lake 
Erie, which borders my district, meeting that goal will require the 
Corps and its non-federal partners to maximize the beneficial use of 
dredged material from federally authorized harbors.

I urge the Committee to direct the Corps to expedite the completion of 
cost-sharing agreements for the beneficial use placement sites and 
confined disposal facilities on Lake Erie that are currently being 
planned and designed by non-federal partners at their own expense.
    Protecting our freshwater kingdom of the Great Lakes also requires 
completion of the interbasin invasive species barrier at Brandon Road 
Lock and Dam. Located on the Des Plaines River near Joliet, Illinois, 
Brandon Road is a central connection point through which invasive Carp 
species frequently move between the Illinois Waterway system into Lake 
Michigan and the four other Great Lakes, severely harming native fish 
species. $225.8 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
will fund the construction and deployment of state-of-the-art 
technologies and innovative programs that interrupt the movement, but 
local cooperation requirements remain a challenge to implementation. 
Thanks to your Committee's work on the WRDA 2022, construction of the 
interbasin invasive species barrier now requires a 90 percent Federal 
contribution. The Committee can further ensure implementation by 
modifying the cost sharing for operation, maintenance, repair, 
replacement, and rehabilitation of the measures.
    I would also like to thank the Committee for its continued focus on 
another ecological problem that we face in the Great Lakes region: 
harmful algal blooms (HABs). The expertise of Corps scientists and 
engineers is invaluable in the fight against the devastation wrought by 
HABs. The Corps provides resource management, water flow design, and 
engineering solutions for HAB prevention, mitigation, and control. I 
urge the Committee to continue supporting the ongoing work of the Corps 
for testing HAB controls and encouraging continued interagency 
cooperation.
    In particular, I urge the Committee to expand the scope of the 
Harmful Algal Bloom Demonstration program authorized in the WRDA 2020 
to address not only HAB associated with water resources development 
projects but also HAB that adversely impact large bodies of water of 
regional, national, or international significance. This will ensure 
that demonstration projects designed to address HAB in Western Lake 
Erie, some of the most frequent and severe in the nation, will be 
eligible for funding under the Corps' program. Additionally, I urge the 
Committee to emphasize the importance of demonstration projects 
designed to develop and deploy advanced monitoring tools and networks 
and to address the nutrient loading that is the root cause of HAB at 
the source of the problem.
    Finally, I ask the Committee to consider authorizing a new 
Environmental Infrastructure program for the City of Toledo. In 2014, 
the City's drinking water service was interrupted due to contamination 
from a HAB. While the City has invested vast amounts of funding since 
then to mitigate the risk of contamination in the future, a secondary 
water source will ultimately be required to ensure that the 2014 crisis 
is not repeated.
    Thank you again for your dedication to pursuing another WRDA on a 
bipartisan basis.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady for her testimony.
    Are there any questions for any of the panelists up to now?
    Looking and seeing none, you all are free to leave. And 
those who have come in, just make your way to your seat.
    [Pause.]
    Voice. One down, six to go.
    [Pause.]
    Mr. Rouzer. So, we will start with Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez.
    When you are ready, you will have up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Ms. Perez. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, and thank you, 
Ranking Member Larsen.
    I have here a typewritten letter from 40 years ago 
requesting conveyance of a parcel of land held by the Army 
Corps of Engineers in my home county of Skamania County. My 
county is over 1 million acres of land. Less than one-half of 1 
percent of that is commercially developable. So, this 1.6-acre 
lot may seem very small to the committee and small potatoes, 
but where I live, this is the kind of thing that can make an 
incredible difference in empowering my community to have real 
economic opportunity to develop and support themselves. It is a 
result of Federal, State, and land trust ownership that we are 
so reduced, and so, I ask this body to be different than the 40 
years preceding it.
    This letter was written before I was born, 2\1/2\ years 
before I was born, so, this has been a long time in the making, 
and I ask for your urgency in considering this. The Port of 
Skamania requested this, and it has been--we have been in 
agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers, and so, I 
appreciate any urgency we can bring to this.
    Secondly, I would like to bring up Wahkiakum County, also 
an economically disadvantaged area in my district located on 
the Columbia River. It is requesting support from the Army 
Corps for a study to address flooding problems in Rosburg and 
Grays River. The area regularly experiences flooding. As a 
result, fine sediment accumulates at the confluence of the 
rivers of Grays and Columbia, and over the past 30 years, the 
floods have only gotten worse.
    When flooding occurs in the Grays River, it cuts off access 
to approximately 500 people living in these rural communities, 
often for more than 2 days at a time. Within a matter of hours, 
the flooding limits vital emergency services, business 
operations, and school transportation, and leaves behind 
sediment that can be dangerous and time consuming to remove. 
That is why I supported the county's request for the Army Corps 
to assess the causes of the fine sediment accumulation and help 
determine solutions to mitigate risks for addressing this.
    These are two important projects in my district, but they 
are just a snapshot of the provisions I look forward to 
supporting in this year's WRDA. My district is home to 15 ports 
that are critical economic drivers that are very dependent on 
the Army Corps and the work authorized in this legislation. I 
have been told that I have more ports than any Member of 
Congress west of the Mississippi.
    These are priorities that are supported by a broad range of 
stakeholders in my district, and I look forward to working with 
this committee to get them over the finish line. Thank you.
    [Ms. Perez's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
Prepared Statement of Hon. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of Washington
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for the 
opportunity to testify today.
    I'd like to highlight several WRDA priorities for my district in 
Southwest Washington, including one that has been in the works since 
1986.
                      Grays River Dredging Project
    Up first: Wahkiakum County, an economically disadvantaged area in 
my district, located on the Columbia River, is requesting assistance 
from the Army Corps for a study to address the flooding problems in 
Rosburg and Grays River.
    This area regularly experiences flooding, and as a result, fine 
sediment accumulation at the confluence of the Grays and Columbia 
Rivers. Over the past 30 years, the floods have only gotten worse. When 
flooding occurs on the Grays River, it cuts off access to approximately 
500 people living in these rural communities, often for two days or 
more at a time. Within a matter of hours, this flooding limits vital 
emergency services, business operations, and school transportation, and 
leaves behind sediment that can be dangerous and time consuming to 
remove.
    That's why I support the County's request for the Army Corps to 
assess the causes of the fine sediment accumulation and help determine 
solutions to mitigate risks for the area moving forward.
                      North Bonneville Conveyance
    Secondly, I'd like to highlight an important conveyance request 
that has been nearly 40 years in the making in my home county of 
Skamania.
    As a result of federal, state, and trust land ownership, and the 
added development restrictions from the Columbia River Gorge National 
Scenic Area, very little land in Skamania County is developable for 
commercial or industrial purposes.
    In 1986, the Port of Skamania initiated a request to the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers to acquire industrial property and a building in 
North Bonneville for the purposes of economic development.
    Now, almost 40 years later, the Port is still working to acquire 
the 1.6 acre parcel of land and building for economic development. I 
support the inclusion of this conveyance in the bill.
    These are two projects important to my district, but they are just 
a snapshot of the provisions I look forward to supporting in this 
year's WRDA.
    My district is home to 15 ports that are critical economic drivers 
that are very dependent on the Army Corps and the work authorized in 
this legislation.
    These priorities are supported by a broad set of stakeholders in my 
district and I look forward to working with this committee to get them 
over the finish line.

    Ms. Perez. And I also request to submit this historic piece 
of evidence [indicating typewritten letter], the longevity of 
this request, to the committee.
    Mr. Rouzer. Without objection, so ordered.

    Mr. Fry.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. RUSSELL FRY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Mr. Fry. I am here today to join my colleagues in 
underscoring the critical role of the Water Resources 
Development Act of 2024 for not only my State, but my district, 
and convey these specific priorities. I applaud the leadership 
of this committee--Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, 
subcommittee Chairman Rouzer, and Ranking Member Napolitano--
for this opportunity.
    I am proud to represent the Seventh Congressional District 
of the State of South Carolina, which is about half of the 
coastline, the northern half of the coastline, and extends 
westward into the interior, into an area known as the Pee Dee. 
I have submitted several priorities to this committee on behalf 
of my constituents, and I want to highlight some of those for 
you today.
    In the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, in the city of 
Florence, they are taking some necessary steps to address 
growth and increasing needs of the citizens and community by 
providing significant water, wastewater, stormwater, and 
environmental restoration. With new industry in the city, a 
$1\1/2\ billion economic project that was announced just this 
year, plus growth, approximately 4,300 residential units will 
increase the capacity needed for water distribution.
    Additionally, this will require expansion of wastewater 
management and a more efficient sanitary sewer collection 
system. I have requested authorization through the Army Corps' 
Environmental Infrastructure Program for the city of Florence 
to help in this effort.
    Unfortunately, the city residents of Florence face water 
challenges daily. For example, their drinking water is often 
red. If you look at their toilets, there are red rings around 
them. If they wash their clothes, they are brown or stained 
yellow. I am grateful for the opportunity to hopefully find 
solutions to this problem that my constituents face regularly.
    North of Florence, Mr. Chairman, lies a town on the border 
of North Carolina called Cheraw, South Carolina, which also 
faces significant water, wastewater, stormwater, and 
environmental restoration needs. I have requested authorization 
through the Army Corps' Environmental Infrastructure Program to 
enable access to funding for these issues.
    The town is taking an aggressive approach in updating its 
water infrastructure to improve that quality, upgrade its 
critical facilities, and expand capacity to accommodate future 
growth. In fact, Mr. Chairman, they cannot grow any more 
without this expansion. They are at their limit. Cheraw needs 
to construct a new water treatment plant and a wastewater 
treatment expansion and implement a stormwater master plan over 
the next decade. Without construction of a new water treatment 
plant, they are at risk of losing safe access to reliable 
drinking water.
    This request also aids in the efforts to reduce the impact 
of increased localized flooding, while increasing the capacity 
in existing stormwater and drainage systems.
    Similarly, in the town next to Cheraw, in Chesterfield, 
South Carolina, in 2018, Hurricane Florence destroyed a sewer 
line crossing the Thompson Creek near the Buchanan Bridge, 
allowing raw sewage to spill into the Thompson Creek. The town 
of Chesterfield has rented a pump. They have rented a pump 
through 2023 to pump around the destroyed sewer line, but the 
town has been trying to get the necessary funding, Mr. 
Chairman, for a permanent solution since 2018 to replace the 
temporary sewer line, install the pump station, and attach the 
sewer line to the bridge. Utilizing the Army Corps' 
Environmental Infrastructure Authority, the town of 
Chesterfield could experience significant relief and aid in its 
ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence, which 
occurred over 5 years ago.
    And lastly for the committee, I have submitted requests on 
behalf of our State's ports. The health and prosperity of South 
Carolina's economy and our people are intricately linked to our 
State's ports and waterways.
    In our State, major infrastructure and investment 
initiatives are managed or spearheaded by the South Carolina 
Ports Authority, which owns and operates public marine 
terminals in the Port of Charleston and two separate inland 
ports in Greer, South Carolina, and in my district, Dillon. 
Over 70 percent of all cargo exported through the South 
Carolina ports originates from companies within the State. In a 
region projected to experience significant population growth, 
South Carolina is vitally important to the broader economy of 
the Nation.
    These projects rely on the investments and resources made 
possible through the Water Resources Development Act. 
Specifically, in this year's bill, I am advocating for three 
priorities.
    First, to adjust the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund donor port designation requirements to 
more effectively capture and recognize the scale of the port's 
impact within the State and region, such as that of the South 
Carolina Ports Authority and, more specifically, the Port of 
Charleston.
    Second, to align the cost share for maintenance of harbors 
with modernized harbor depths by increasing eligible depths up 
to 55 feet, as Charleston and other major east coast ports have 
invested heavily in deepening their harbors beyond 50 feet to 
meet both commercial demand and the increasing size of vessels 
calling on the U.S. ports.
    Third and lastly, Mr. Chairman, to authorize a feasibility 
study for the Army Corps of Engineers Charleston District to 
equalize the Federal navigation channel segment of the North 
Charleston Terminal to 52 feet.
    I am proud to submit these priorities to the committee, and 
I thank you for your time. And with that, I yield back.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Russell Fry, a Representative in Congress 
                    From the State of South Carolina
    I am here today to join my colleagues in underscoring the critical 
role of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024 for my state 
and district and to convey my specific priorities on behalf of my 
district and the state of South Carolina.
    I applaud the leadership of the House Transportation & 
Infrastructure Committee and wish to thank Chairman Graves, Ranking 
Member Larsen, Subcommittee Chairman Rouzer, and Ranking Member 
Napolitano for this opportunity.
    I am proud to represent the Seventh Congressional District of South 
Carolina, which ranges from the upper half of the South Carolina coast, 
known as the Grand Stand, and the inland rural community of the 
northwest corridor of the state, known as the Pee Dee.
    I have submitted several priorities to the Committee on behalf of 
my constituents. Today, I want to highlight some water infrastructure 
investment projects in South Carolina's Seventh Congressional District.
    In the Pee Dee region, the City of Florence is taking the necessary 
steps to address the growth and increasing needs of the citizens and 
community by providing significant water, wastewater, stormwater, and 
environmental restoration.
    The ability to provide safe, reliable drinking water and necessary 
water and sewer infrastructure upgrades is only attainable through 
expansion and upgrades to their water system.
    With new industry in the city, approximately 4,300 residential 
units will increase the capacity needed for water distribution. 
Additionally, this will require expansion of wastewater management and 
a more efficient sanitary sewer collection system.
    I have requested authorization through the Army Corps' 
Environmental Infrastructure program for the City of Florence to help 
in this effort.
    These projects would authorize a sanitary sewer collection system 
expansion, a wastewater management facility expansion, and a water 
distribution expansion and upgrades needed for increased water quality.
    Unfortunately, residents in the Florence area face water challenges 
daily. For example, their drinking water will turn red and leave a 
dusty ring around their toilets, and sometimes laundry turns brown or 
yellow due to the discolored water.
    I am grateful for this opportunity to hopefully find solutions to 
this problem that my constituents across the Pee Dee face regularly.
    North of Florence lies the Town of Cheraw, which faces significant 
water, wastewater, stormwater, and environmental restoration needs.
    I have requested authorization through the Army Corps' 
Environmental Infrastructure program to enable access to funding for 
water, wastewater, and other environmental infrastructure through this 
program.
    The Town is taking an aggressive approach to updating its water 
infrastructure to improve water quality, upgrade critical facilities, 
and expand capacity to accommodate future growth.
    Cheraw needs to construct a new water treatment plant and a 
wastewater treatment expansion and implement a stormwater master plan 
over the next decade.
    Without the construction of a new water treatment plant, the 
residents of Cheraw are at risk of losing access to safe and reliable 
drinking water supplies.
    This request also aids in the effort to reduce the impact of 
increased localized flooding while increasing capacity in existing 
stormwater and drainage systems.
    This authorization is crucial for the Town of Cheraw to grow and 
provide a place for South Carolinians to live and work.
    Similarly, I have requested authorization under the Army Corps' 
Environmental Infrastructure program for the Town of Chesterfield, 
located in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina.
    In September 2018, Hurricane Florence destroyed a sewer line 
crossing Thompson Creek near Buchanan Bridge, allowing raw sewage to 
spill into Thompson Creek.
    The Town of Chesterfield rented a pump until 2023 to pump around 
the destroyed sewer line.
    Due to the increasing cost of renting a pump and insufficient grant 
funds to complete the project, the Town purchased a pump and hoses as a 
temporary solution.
    The Town has been trying to get the necessary funding for a 
permanent solution since 2018 to replace the temporary sewer line and 
pump, install a pump station, and attach the sewer line to the bridge.
    Utilizing the Army Corps' Environmental Infrastructure Authority, 
the Town of Chesterfield could experience significant relief and aid in 
its ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence, which occurred 
over five years ago.
    Lastly, I have submitted requests in support of our state's ports.
    The health and prosperity of South Carolina's economy--and our 
people--are intricately linked to our state's ports and waterways.
    In our state, major infrastructure and investment initiatives are 
managed or spearheaded by the South Carolina Ports Authority, which 
owns and operates public marine terminals at the Port of Charleston and 
two separate Inland Ports in Greer and in my district, Dillon.
    The South Carolina Ports Authority is an economic driver, not only 
for our state but for the Southeastern region and the U.S. as a whole.
    A recent study conducted by the University of South Carolina Moore 
School of Business found that the total economic impact of our state's 
ports system is over $86 billion annually.
    This translates to supporting over 260,000 jobs related to the 
maritime industry alone--and one in nine jobs in the state--and an 
annual statewide economic impact of $87 billion. That is nearly $18 
billion in annual labor income.
    The commerce afforded by our ports system directly supports state 
companies and businesses as our state continues to grow as a major 
global competitor for advanced manufacturing and other leading export-
oriented industries.
    Over 70 percent of all cargo exported through S.C. Ports originates 
from companies located in the state. In a region projected to 
experience significant population growth, South Carolina is vitally 
important to the broader economy.
    This growth directly results from state, federal, and private 
partnership investments in our port infrastructure, including the 
deepened Charleston harbor and increased cargo capacities.
    These projects rely on the investments and resources made possible 
through the Water Resources Development Act.
    Specifically, I am advocating for three priorities in this year's 
bill.
    First, to adjust the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund Donor Port designation requirements to more 
effectively capture and recognize the scale of a port's impact within a 
state and region--such as that of South Carolina Ports Authority and 
the Port of Charleston.
    Second, to align cost-share for maintenance of harbors with 
modernized harbor depths by increasing eligible depths to 55 feet, as 
Charleston and other major East Coast ports have invested in deepening 
their harbors beyond 50 feet to meet both commercial demand and the 
increasing size of vessels calling on the U.S. ports.
    Third, and lastly, to authorize a Feasibility Study for the Army 
Corps' Charleston District to equalize the federal navigation channel 
segment of the North Charleston Terminal to 52 feet.
    I am proud to submit my priorities for South Carolina to the 
Committee for consideration as you craft a responsible and effective 
Water Resources Development Act for 2024.
    Thank you again for your consideration, and I look forward to 
working with you on behalf of my state and district.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman.
    Mr. Kilmer.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. DEREK KILMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member 
Napolitano and ranking member of the full committee, Mr. 
Larsen. Thanks for holding this Member Day hearing and for 
providing an opportunity to share two of my priorities for the 
upcoming Water Resources Development Act.
    First, I want to draw your attention to the Ediz Hook Beach 
Erosion Control Project near Port Angeles, Washington, where I 
grew up. Originally authorized in WRDA 1974, this project 
supports our national security goals by helping to maintain 
access to the U.S. Coast Guard Station at Port Angeles, while 
also protecting Port Angeles Harbor from erosion.
    I was pleased that last year the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law actually provided funding for Ediz Hook. Through $1.5 
million provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 
revetment repair, this funding ensures that facilities at Ediz 
Hook, including the U.S. Coast Guard Base, can benefit.
    So, while this funding was good news, we have learned that 
this project is the only navigation project overseen by the 
Seattle District without a 100-percent Federal cost share for 
these purposes. Given the relative economic distress of that 
community, given the significant national security importance 
of this project and the needed support it would bring to the 
city of Port Angeles, my priority request would bring the 
Federal cost share for Ediz Hook into line with other O&M 
navigation projects.
    I also want to highlight the Duckabush Estuary Restoration 
Project. This project was identified as part of the Puget Sound 
Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project, which was authorized 
in WRDA 2016. I am proud that the first project to be put into 
action from that initiative is in my district.
    The Duckabush Estuary Restoration Project will remove a 
large amount of fill that was placed in the river flood plain 
to support U.S. Highway 101 and replace it with an estuary-
spanning 1,400-foot-long bridge reconnecting the Duckabush 
River to the neighboring wetlands and distributary channels. 
Not only will this project improve the habitat of fish and 
wildlife including, Endangered Species Act-listed Hood Canal 
summer chum, but it will also enhance the lives of constituents 
through reduced seasonal flood risk, safer roads, and job 
creation. That is a WRDA success story.
    However, restoring the Duckabush Estuary will change how 
local Tribes and the public can access tidelands and the 
shellfish resources that they support. One positive but 
unintended consequence of the original highway at Duckabush was 
that it created direct foot access to shellfish tidelands and 
stable conditions favorable for shellfish growth. The Duckabush 
tidelands are important to several local Tribes and to the 
public, and when the restoration project is completed and the 
river flows freely, access to the tidelands will be more 
limited.
    The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and their 
partners are committed to ensuring tideland access 
opportunities for Tribes and for the public, making sure that 
they remain available on Hood Canal. They are considering other 
locations nearby that can provide a similar experience for 
local Tribes and other users, and I am requesting Federal 
language to provide the flexibility needed to allow for 
creative solutions as part of the partnership with the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers on aquatic ecosystem restoration.
    Again, I appreciate your leadership and your consideration 
of these requests, and I am happy to provide any additional 
information as you review them. Thank you again for the 
opportunity to testify before the committee today.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. RASHIDA TLAIB, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

    Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much, Chairman, Ranking Member. I 
sincerely appreciate the opportunity to help bring the voices 
of my constituents and my residents and neighbors regarding 
water and the various issues that they are faced with every 
single year.
    I am here once again, obviously, to talk about how we can 
protect our neighbors from flooding and contamination in the 
water. Not just lead, beyond even lead. Our communities, as you 
all know, are on the front lines of the climate crisis, and 
these floods are only continuing to get worse and worse every 
single year. At the same time, we have aging infrastructure 
that subjects them to various health dangers. Mostly, again, 
for my communities, it is exposure to contaminated drinking 
water.
    And you hear from many of our colleagues, we need to move 
with urgency. I know our neighborhoods in the 12th 
Congressional District have experienced 1,000-year rainfalls, 
and some homes have flooded repeatedly. In one neighborhood in 
my district, three times in one spring and summer, and these 
are working class, many retirees, autoworkers who cannot 
afford, again, the damage that continues to happen to their 
homes.
    In some of our communities, raw sewage flows through the 
streets. Some of our residents still have water standing in 
their basements. I still remember knocking on the door of one 
of my senior residents in her mid-seventies with FEMA as we 
went door to door to confirm some of the damage, and she had 
the sewage water in her basement literally freeze over. She 
didn't have the resources nor know-all of how, again, to 
address it.
    We know that, meanwhile, millions of people across 
southeastern Michigan right now, Chairman, and the country, are 
still getting their water from lead pipes. And we haven't 
dedicated close enough money or mobilized resources to address 
this threat as quickly as we need to. Our local communities 
can't do it on their own. They continue to tell me that over 
and over again. They are required in Michigan to continue to 
test, and they confirm again contamination. But the State and 
the Federal Government hasn't been able to do enough to fund 
the remediation that is needed.
    I note our flood maps and projections our communities rely 
on still don't account for our rapidly warming planet and are 
simply out of date. And the water infrastructure in these 
communities is unacceptably outdated, inadequate for extreme 
weather events we now face. As the weather events again get 
worse and worse, our communities need the tools. And this is 
where you all can come in. This year's WRDA presents an 
opportunity to equip our communities with improved planning and 
modern, resilient infrastructure in WRDA.
    First, I encourage the committee to offer support to 
Detroit's division of the Army Corps of Engineers for a flood 
study of Rouge River. Rouge River, Mr. Chairman, is a watershed 
in my district, and it impacts a number of communities within 
the largest populated county in Michigan. And the Rouge touches 
communities throughout 12th district, but also the 11th and 
others, as you will hear, as well as the 6th district and the 
13th. So, we need to better understand how to mitigate the 
flooding issues that come from the Rouge River.
    Second, I urge the committee to adopt language that 
streamlines the real estate requirements for replacing lead 
service lines on private property. This is critical. We learned 
a lot from Flint, and that was one of the issues that continued 
to come up so we can finish the job and replace lead service 
lines all the way up to the resident's home.
    Third, I am submitting a number of requests in support of 
the Great Lakes Water Authority's efforts to prevent and 
mitigate flooding in both specific neighborhoods in my district 
experiencing repeated flooding events, but also across 
southeastern Michigan. And these requests are critical to the 
resiliency of our region. As you know, it is very critical to 
our country, and investments cannot come soon enough.
    Fourth, I am also submitting requests in support of the 
Army Corps' priorities for improving the navigation across the 
Great Lakes, Mr. Chair, which supports billions--billions--of 
dollars in economic activity and recreation for our communities 
across the country, really.
    And I appreciate the opportunity, again, for all the 
Members that are here, to share the priorities of my 
constituents and residents, and respectfully request their 
inclusion in the 2024 Water Resources Development Act. Thank 
you.

                       From the State of Michigan
    Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today and share 
WRDA priorities that are critical for the communities I represent.
    I am here once again to talk about what we need to do to protect my 
residents from flooding and lead in their water.
    Our communities are on the front lines of the climate crisis, and 
these floods are only going to continue to get worse and more frequent. 
At the same time, our aging infrastructure subjects them to health 
dangers like lead.
    We have to move with urgency.
    Our neighborhoods have experienced 1,000-year rainfalls, and some 
homes have flood repeatedly. In some of these communities, raw sewage 
flowed through the streets. Some of our residents still have water 
standing in their basements from floods that took place months and even 
years ago.
    Meanwhile, millions of people across Southeast Michigan--and the 
country--are still getting their water from lead pipes, and we haven't 
dedicated close to enough money or mobilized resources to address this 
threat as quickly as we need.
    Our residents deserve better. They deserve action. They need these 
investments we're here to talk about today.
    The flood maps and projections our communities rely on still don't 
account for our rapidly warming planet and are simply out of date. And 
the water infrastructure in these communities is unacceptably outdated 
and inadequate for the extreme weather events we now face.
    I refuse to accept this as our new normal.
    As these catastrophic weather events get stronger and more 
frequent, our communities need the tools to be prepared. This year's 
WRDA presents an opportunity to equip our communities with improved 
planning and modern, resilient infrastructure.
    First, I encourage the Committee to offer support to the Detroit 
Division of the Army Corps of Engineers for a flood study of the Rouge 
River watershed in my district. The Rouge touches so many of our 
communities in the 12th District, and we need to better understand how 
to mitigate its flooding issues.
    Second, I urge the Committee to adopt language that streamlines the 
real estate requirements for replacing lead service lines on private

    Fourth, I am also submitting requests in support of the Army Corps' 
priorities for improving navigation across our Great Lakes, which 
support billions of dollars in economic activity and recreation.
    I appreciate the opportunity to share my priorities before this 
Committee, and respectfully request their inclusion in the 2024 Water 
Resources Development Act. Thank you.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. ERIN HOUCHIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA

    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and to Ranking 
Member Larsen. Thank you for hosting Member Day and allowing me 
to address this committee. I am here today to discuss an issue 
that has impacted my constituents since long before I came to 
Congress: the erosion of the Clarksville shoreline.
    Since 1963, when the Army Corps of Engineers finished the 
lock and dam system in the Ohio River, it started redirecting 
water toward the Indiana shoreline at Clarksville. The 
resulting erosion has caused the shoreline to recede 100 yards 
to date. Indiana is quite literally losing pieces of our State 
and our heritage to the river every single day due to the man-
made causes brought on by this Army Corps project.
    The erosion threatens local businesses, roads, parks, and 
historical sites, including the George Rogers Clark Homesite, 
which marks the spot where Lewis and Clark first met and formed 
the group that would begin their westward expedition.
    While this problem has been brought to the attention of the 
Army Corps of Engineers, and the Corps agrees and recognizes it 
is a problem, it hasn't given it the attention that it 
desperately needs. That is why, for this year's Water Resources 
Development Act, I am requesting that the Army Corps of 
Engineers prioritize completing the Clarksville Shoreline 
Stabilization Project. Any further delay to this project risks 
greater losses to our State, the local community, our 
infrastructure, and our heritage.
    Thank you again for allowing me the opportunity to speak on 
this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with you and 
your staff on stabilizing this shoreline and protecting this 
important and historic area to the State of Indiana.

    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for hosting this 
Member Day, and thank you for allowing me time to address you and the 
Committee.
    I'm here today to discuss an issue that has impacted my 
constituents since long before I came to Congress--the erosion of the 
Clarksville shoreline.
    Since 1963--when current water flow practices started--the 
redirection of the river has caused the shoreline to recede about 100 
yards.
    This erosion threatens local businesses, roads, projects, and 
historical sites, including the George Rogers Clark Homesite, which 
marks the spot where Lewis and Clark first met and formed the group 
that would begin their westward expedition.
    While this problem has been brought to the attention of the Army 
Corps of Engineers, it hasn't received the attention it desperately 
needs.
    That is why for this year's Water Resources Development Act, I am 
requesting that the Army Corps of Engineers focus on prioritizing and 
completing the Clarksville shoreline stabilization project.
    Any further delay to this project risks greater losses not only to 
our state, the local community, and infrastructure--but also to our 
heritage.
    Thank you, again, for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this 
issue today. I look forward to continuing to work with you and your 
staff on stabilizing this shoreline and protecting this important 
historical area.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. DAN NEWHOUSE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mr. Newhouse. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Members Napolitano 
and Larsen, thank you for providing me the opportunity to 
participate in today's hearing. I am here today to discuss 
critical water resource issues impacting central Washington 
which I believe should be addressed in the Water Resources 
Development Act of 2024.
    The policies, studies, and projects authorized by WRDA and 
executed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers affect the daily 
life of my neighbors and constituents in central Washington. 
This includes locks and dams that enable navigation and boost 
recreation; hydropower facilities that generate clean, 
reliable, and efficient power; and levees that reduce the 
impact of storms on our communities. Today I am going to 
discuss urban canals of concern, the Othello Water Supply 
Project, and the Lower Snake River Dams.
    Back in November, I introduced the Urban Canal 
Modernization Act. If enacted, this legislation would allow the 
Bureau of Reclamation to authorize a 35-percent nonreimbursable 
cost share to aid in repairing and rehabilitating urban canals 
of concern, which are canals that run through urban areas that 
could, upon failure, cause significant property damage or loss 
of life. The arduous task of maintaining and modernizing our 
outdated urban canal systems is necessary for the safety of our 
local communities. I urge the committee to include the language 
from this bill within WRDA.
    Turning to the Othello Water Supply Project, in central 
Washington, there is an increasing demand for water with a 
corresponding limited supply. To address this issue, we must 
diversify our water supply to alleviate environmental 
challenges and stabilize water supplies that are vulnerable to 
drought. The Othello Water Supply Project will do this by 
creating an aquifer storage and recovery water treatment plant 
aimed at conveying water underground, storing it, and then 
recovering it for conventional use. I respectfully request the 
committee support the authorization of new resources necessary 
for the development of this project to ensure central 
Washington has a reliable, long-term, clean water supply.
    And lastly, most importantly, I want to turn to the 
Columbia River System Operations, or the CRSO, and the Lower 
Snake River Dams. Over the last several years, the Biden 
administration, alongside dam-breaching advocates and several 
indigenous sovereign nations, have engaged in litigation and 
mediation over the CRSO. In December of 2023, this culminated 
in a final package of actions and commitments from the 
administration which, if implemented, will, in my opinion, 
operationally and functionally breach the Lower Snake River 
Dams, spur exorbitant ratepayer increases, and cause harm to 
the salmon population.
    The overall CRSO and especially the Lower Snake River Dams 
provide immeasurable benefits to millions of Americans across 
the Pacific Northwest, providing flood control and irrigation, 
transportation of agricultural goods to our ports, baseload 
renewable power, and much more. Recreationists, farmers, river-
dependent ports and communities, transportation stakeholders, 
and electricity customers would be irreparably damaged if the 
Lower Snake River Dams are breached. As such, I staunchly 
oppose the inclusion of any language in WRDA which would 
operationally or physically breach the Lower Snake River Dams, 
as well as any aid for Federal agencies in implementing the 
Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative.
    In the coming days, I will be submitting my formal request 
to the committee, and as you craft the base text for this 
legislation in the months ahead, I encourage you to take these 
vital interests into consideration.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [Mr. Newhouse's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Dan Newhouse, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of Washington
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for providing 
me the opportunity to participate in today's hearing.
    I am here today to discuss critically important water resource 
issues impacting Central Washington which I hope will be addressed in 
the Water Resources Development Act of 2024.
    The policies, studies, and projects authorized by WRDA and carried 
out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers affect the daily life of my 
neighbors and constituents in Central Washington. This includes locks 
and dams that enable navigation and boost recreation, hydropower 
facilities that generate clean, reliable, and efficient power, and 
levees that reduce the impact of storms on our communities.
    Today, I am going to discuss ``urban canals of concern'', the 
Othello Water Supply Project, and the Lower Snake River Dams.
    Back in November, I introduced the Urban Canal Modernization Act. 
If enacted, this legislation would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to 
authorize a 35 percent non-reimbursable cost-share to aid in repairing 
and rehabilitating ``urban canals of concern'' which are canals through 
urban areas that could cause significant property damage or loss of 
life.
    The arduous task of maintaining and modernizing our outdated urban 
canal systems is necessary for the safety of our local communities. I 
urge the Committee to include the language from this bill within WRDA.
    Now, I would like to turn to the Othello Water Supply Project. In 
Central Washington, there is an increasing demand for water with a 
corresponding limited supply. To address this issue, we must diversify 
our water supply to alleviate environmental challenges and stabilize 
water supplies vulnerable to drought.
    The Othello Water Supply Project will do this by creating an 
aquifer storage and recovery water treatment plant aimed at conveying 
water underground, storing it, and then recovering it for beneficial 
use.
    I respectfully request the Committee support the authorization of 
new resources necessary to enable the development of the Othello Water 
Treatment Plant to ensure Central Washington has a reliable, long-term, 
clean water supply.
    Lastly, and most importantly, I want to turn to the Columbia River 
System Operations, or CRSO, and the Lower Snake River Dams.
    Over the last several years, the Biden Administration alongside dam 
breaching advocates and several indigenous sovereign states have 
engaged in litigation and mediation over the CRSO.
    In December 2023, this culminated in a final package of actions and 
commitments from the Biden Administration which, if implemented will, 
in my opinion, operationally breach the Lower Snake River Dams, spur 
exorbitant ratepayer increases, and cause harm to the salmon 
population.
    The overall CRSO, especially the Lower Snake River Dams, provide 
immeasurable benefits to millions of Americans across the Pacific 
Northwest. From flood control and irrigation to the transportation of 
agricultural goods to our ports, and more.
    Recreationists, farmers, river-dependent ports and communities, 
transportation stakeholders, and electricity customers would be 
irreparably damaged if the Lower Snake River Dams are breached.
    As such, I staunchly oppose the inclusion of any language in WRDA 
which would operationally or physically breach the Lower Snake River 
Dams as well as aid any federal agency in implementing the Columbia 
Basin Restoration Initiative.
    In the coming days I will be submitting my formal requests to the 
committee. And, as you craft the base text for this legislation in the 
months ahead, I encourage you to take these vital interests into 
consideration.
    I yield back.

    Mr. Newhouse. And I yield back.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions 
so far for the panelists we have heard from?
    Seeing none, you are free to leave. We will certainly keep 
all your testimony in mind.
    Mr. Sorensen, you have up to 5 minutes when you are ready.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. ERIC SORENSEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Mr. Sorensen. Thank you. I want to begin by thanking 
Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano for convening 
this hearing and welcoming Member testimony today as you craft 
the important legislation, the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2024.
    For every American, WRDA represents one of the best Federal 
opportunities to respond to disasters, to protect our 
waterways, and support clean water and healthy ecosystems.
    I am proud to represent the 17th Congressional District of 
Illinois. My district sits along the great Mississippi River, 
and is home to dozens of agricultural communities that depend 
on the Mississippi to move their goods to market. The Army 
Corps of Engineers and local communities along the river work 
hand in hand to maintain and upgrade river water 
infrastructure.
    Last year, I joined Chairman Graves in submitting a funding 
request for the Navigational Ecosystem Sustainability Program, 
or NESP, to the Appropriations Committee. I was proud to see 
this program funded at $75 million in the House-drafted energy 
and water appropriations bill. I thank Chairman Graves for 
working with me on that request, and look forward to the 
program receiving this round of funding, which would go toward 
construction of lock and dam No. 25 on the upper Mississippi.
    Part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was intended to 
fund the construction of lock and dam 25 and 6 other projects 
to completion. However, this funding is not sufficient to cover 
the full cost. Without additional clarification from Congress, 
completion of these products will be delayed as local funding 
sources cannot cover the gap. I urge the committee to include 
language in WRDA 2024 to clarify that all seven of these 
projects be fully federally funded, as intended under the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
    Many members of the committees we represent might not know 
that WRDA offers more local support than funding for 
infrastructure along the Mississippi River. Now, my district is 
home to dozens of drinking water and wastewater agencies that 
serve the people of central and northwestern Illinois. These 
agencies are in need of funding to support necessary upgrades 
and repairs to their systems to protect the communities and the 
people that we serve. For this reason, I am pleased that the 
committee will accept environmental infrastructure requests for 
WRDA 2024.
    The need for these authorizations is clear. For example, a 
very small town, German Valley, Illinois, in my district, pays 
$2,000 a month for chemical treatments to address contamination 
in their wastewater lagoon because they can't afford a larger 
infrastructure investment needed to address the problem head 
on.
    Now, the town of Savanna, Illinois, a community that is 
underneath the bluffs of the Mississippi River, has an aging 
drinking water pipe that is running underneath a very heavy and 
old retaining wall. Now, should the wall crumble, or if the 
pipe were to fail, half of the community of Savanna, Illinois, 
would be without drinking water.
    So, I look forward to submitting these and other worthy 
projects for your consideration. So, thank you again to the 
committee for the important opportunity to testify on these 
important issues.
    [Mr. Sorensen's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
Prepared Statement of Hon. Eric Sorensen, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Illinois
    I want to begin by thanking Chairman Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen for convening this hearing and for welcoming member testimony as 
you craft this important legislation, the Water Resources Development 
Act of 2024.
    I am proud to represent the 17th district of Illinois. My district 
sits along the upper Mississippi River and is home to dozens of 
agricultural communities that depend on the Mississippi to move their 
goods to market. The Army Corps of Engineers and local communities 
along the Mississippi River work hand in hand to maintain and upgrade 
river water infrastructure.
    As part of this work, the Army Corps requires that the non-federal 
sponsor, usually the state or local government, sign a project 
partnership agreement, many of which include provisions requiring the 
non-federal sponsor to take full responsibility for the operation, 
maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R) for the 
infrastructure asset the Corps are constructing on the behalf of the 
non-federal sponsor. I support a change to this standard practice 
change that would allow the Corps and non-federal sponsor to enter into 
agreements where the obligation of OMRR&R expires at a set date.
    Staying with PPAs, the standard PPA the Corps stipulates that the 
non-federal sponsor indemnify the federal government of any costs 
associated with a catastrophe involving the infrastructure asset 
constructed by the Corps. I support a modification to the current 
blanket indemnification in favor of a shared approach to liability 
costs.
    As you all know, the authorization for the National Levee Safety 
Program has expired. I support language to reauthorize this program in 
WRDA 24.
    I am supportive of the funding appropriated for the Inland 
Waterways Construction Projects in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
which will fund the construction of seven water infrastructure assets 
throughout the country. One of these projects is Lock and Dam 25 on the 
Mississippi River.
    The intent of the BIL funding was to fund these seven projects to 
completion all using federal funds. Unfortunately, the costs for the 
projects have increased and the appropriated funding is no longer 
sufficient. I support the inclusion of language in WRDA to stipulate 
that all seven projects have a 100% federal cost share.
    Additionally, like many other members, my district is home to 
dozens of drinking water and wastewater agencies that support the 
people of Illinois' 17th Congressional district. One way WRDA supports 
local communities is through Environmental Infrastructure 
authorizations. I am pleased that the Committee will accept EI requests 
for WRDA 24 and look forward to advocating for projects to support 
infrastructure projects in the communities I represent.
    I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify on these 
important issues.

    Mr. Sorensen. And I yield back the balance of my time.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions 
for Mr. Sorensen?
    Seeing none, I appreciate your testimony. You are free to 
leave.
    Mr. Sorensen. Thank you, Chairman.
    Mr. Rouzer. Mrs. Fletcher, you are recognized for up to 5 
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. LIZZIE FLETCHER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                    FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As a former member of this committee, I am proud of and 
excited about the work that we have done together and the 
things that we have accomplished in the previous Water 
Resources Development Acts, and I appreciate the opportunity to 
come before you today and testify about my community's 
priorities for water infrastructure investment in Houston, 
Harris County, and Fort Bend County in the Water Resources 
Development Act of 2024.
    I have submitted to the committee several priorities, 
including project-specific policy changes and authorizations, 
and those with broader implications for how the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers operates. There are two main drivers of our 
priorities, and I know they are priorities of this committee 
and of this Congress: one, to make our communities safer and 
more resilient through infrastructure investment; and two, to 
support economic growth through infrastructure investment.
    In that first category, I have asked for language to ensure 
the Corps' continued focus on completing the Buffalo Bayou and 
Tributaries Resiliency Study. Congress authorized this study 
after Hurricane Harvey hit the gulf coast in 2017, killing at 
least 68 people and causing more than $125 billion in damages. 
The study focuses on the viability of different flood control 
projects along Buffalo Bayou in my district, and the 
surrounding Addicks and Barker Reservoirs.
    Last Congress, I advocated for an extension of the study so 
that the Corps would have time to be able to consider all 
possible solutions fully. With financial support from Harris 
County and the Corps, and with an extension granted, the study 
continued. Now, as we face the need for an additional 
extension, I urge the Corps to continue its focus and complete 
this study so it can move forward with a project that aligns 
with community objectives, minimizes adverse environmental and 
community impacts, and prioritizes resilience.
    Hurricane Harvey made landfall nearly 7 years ago. It is 
crucial that we utilize the full expertise and resources of the 
Corps to complete this study before our next Water Resources 
Development Act in 2026.
    The Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries Resiliency Study has been 
possible because of the ongoing collaboration between the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, Harris County Flood Control District, 
and local and Federal leaders, as well as the public. I look 
forward to continuing this collaboration and finding resilient 
water conveyance solutions for Houston, Harris County, Fort 
Bend County, and all of our region.
    In the second category of priorities, I have asked for 
study authorization for the Houston Ship Channel's Project 12 
and policy modifications so that ports and waterways can 
maintain necessary depths and remain competitive in a global 
marketplace.
    As many on the committee may remember, I advocated for the 
authorization of the Houston Ship Channel's Project 11 in the 
Water Resources Development Act of 2020. This project widens 
and deepens the Houston Ship Channel, promoting global trade at 
the busiest port in the country by total tonnage. This project 
is expected to be completed ahead of schedule next year.
    While this is a cause for celebration, we must begin to 
look ahead and look to the future and other deepening projects 
to meet the growing size and depth of vessels using the port. 
In order to begin the process, I have asked the committee to 
authorize a study on project 12. Starting this process now will 
ensure that our Federal investments are proactive and timely. 
This critical project will impact not just the Houston region, 
but the entire country.
    I have submitted several other requests to the committee, 
and I appreciate your consideration of these important 
requests. I look forward to working with the committee on these 
projects and much more, and to answering any questions that you 
may have.

TESTIMONY OF HON. EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member, for this opportunity to address this committee. 
I appreciate it very much. This is extremely important. Thank 
you, and thank you for considering my testimony as the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure continues its 
work this Congress, especially with WRDA.
    As the Representative of the entire coast of Georgia, over 
100 miles of pristine coastline, WRDA is an extremely important 
piece of legislation for my constituents. The U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers projects throughout our district have allowed us 
to grow and prosper over the years.
    The most significant project, of course, has been the 
Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, SHEP, which has been an 
extraordinary success story for our State and region. Completed 
in March of 2022, SHEP deepened the Savannah Harbor to 47 feet 
to allow larger ships from all around the globe to access the 
Port of Savannah. This has allowed the Port of Savannah to be 
the single largest and fastest growing container terminal in 
America, in addition to being the second largest port on the 
east coast by volume. In fiscal year 2022, it moved 5.8 million 
20-foot-equivalent container units in throughput, an increase 
of 8.1 percent when compared to the previous year.
    None of this would have been possible without the work done 
here on the T&I Committee and the authorizations for SHEP 
through WRDA. I thank the committee for its continued support 
for a project that is bringing true benefits to our country. 
According to a Corps of Engineers study, the project is 
expected to net more than $291 million in annual benefits to 
the Nation, or approximately $7.70 for every dollar invested in 
the project.
    Georgia's deepwater ports and inland barge terminals 
support nearly 561,000 jobs throughout the State annually and 
contribute $33 billion in income, $140 billion in sales, and 
$3.8 billion in State and local taxes to Georgia's economy.
    However, for all the benefits this project has already 
brought, the world is changing rapidly and ships continue to 
only get bigger and bigger. That is why I am asking for the 
committee to include authorization for a new feasibility study 
or modification to an existing study authorization to examine 
the benefit of both widening and deepening the harbor of the 
Port of Savannah to better accommodate today's commercial 
demands and to prepare for meeting tomorrow's trade needs.
    The recently completed dredging under SHEP was designed for 
vessels with an 8,200 TEU capacity, and the Port of Savannah is 
currently accommodating ships holding more than 16,000 TEUs on 
a tightly restricted basis. With the Georgia Department of 
Transportation raising the height of the Talmadge Bridge, the 
Port of Savannah's air draft capacity increases significantly, 
opening the door to serve even larger vessels and increase its 
significant positive impact on America's economy.
    My next request for the committee is for Tybee Island, 
which sits down the river from the Port of Savannah and is an 
important barrier island for our coast. While the growth of the 
Port of Savannah has been welcome, the Federal channel has 
directly contributed to the erosion on the island and is in 
persistent need of renourishment. That is why I am requesting 
authorization for a new feasibility study incorporating the 
results of the channel impact study that would lead to the 
development of a project to adequately solve or mitigate the 
erosion of Tybee Island's beaches.
    Next, I would like to request that the committee consider 
the authorization of a GAO study on the benefits of digital 
project delivery for the U.S. Army Corps. With the savings that 
digital infrastructure tools provide and the hundreds of 
different projects that the Corps engages in each year around 
the country, digital infrastructure technologies are cloud-
based, open-data computer platforms that integrate digital 
technology throughout the life cycle of an infrastructure 
asset.
    These technologies are proven and utilized around the world 
for infrastructure projects to reduce project costs, accelerate 
project delivery, and build more innovative, resilient, and 
sustainable assets, including water infrastructure projects. 
Such a study should hopefully demonstrate the savings that 
digital infrastructure tools can provide to the hundreds of 
different studies and projects that the Corps engages in each 
year around the country.
    Lastly, I ask the committee to provide Environmental 
Infrastructure Assistance Authority for the coastal Georgia 
counties of Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, and 
McIntosh. Under WRDA, the U.S. Army Corps is authorized to 
provide assistance with design and construction of 
infrastructure in specific municipalities, counties, and 
States. This assistance supports publicly owned and operated 
facilities such as water distribution works, stormwater 
collection, and environmental restoration, among others. Adding 
authority for these counties would provide an opportunity to 
help these communities with some of their drinking, stormwater, 
wastewater, and other flooding problems.
    Thank you again for your time and your consideration of 
these important issues for my district, the State, and the 
country. I look forward to continuing to work with the 
committee to ensure the inclusion of these requests that will 
bring significant benefits to our communities and to our 
country.

for a new feasibility study or modification to an existing study 
authorization to authorization to examine the benefit of both widening 
and deepening the harbor at the Port of Savannah to better accommodate 
today's commercial demands and to prepare for meetings tomorrow's trade

    The recently completed dredging under SHEP was designed for vessels 
with an 8,200-TEU capacity and the Port of Savannah is currently 
accommodating ships holding more than 16,000 TEUs on a tidally-
restricted basis.
    With the Georgia DOT raising the height of the Talmadge Bridge, the 
Port of Savannah's air draft capacity increases significantly--opening 
the door to serve even larger vessels and increase its significant 
positive impact on America's economy.
    My next request for the Committee is for Tybee Island, which sits 
down river from the Port of Savannah and is an important barrier island 
for our coast. While the growth of the Port of Savannah has been 
welcome, the federal channel has directly contributed to erosion on the 
island and are in persistent need of renourishment.
    That is why I am requesting authorization for a new feasibility 
study, incorporating the results of the Channel Impact Study, that 
would lead to the development of a project to adequately solve or

    Next, I would like to request that the Committee consider the 
authorization of a GAO on the benefits of digital project delivery for 
the US Army Corps. With the savings that digital infrastructure tools 
provide and the hundreds of different studies and projects that the 
Corps engages in each year around the country.
    Digital infrastructure technologies are cloud based, open data,

    These technologies are proven and utilized around the world for 
infrastructure projects to reduce project costs, accelerate project 
delivery, and build more innovative, resilient, and sustainable assets, 
including water infrastructure projects.
    Today, digital infrastructure technologies are used by all 50 state 
Departments of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, 
the Federal Highway Administration, and owner-operators of critical 
infrastructure throughout the country.
    Such a study should hopefully demonstrate the savings that digital 
infrastructure tools can provide to the hundreds of different studies 
and projects that the Corps engages in each year around the country.
    Lastly, I ask that the Committee to provide Environmental 
Infrastructure Assistance authority for the coastal Georgia counties of 
Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, and McIntosh.
    Under WRDA, the US Army Corps is authorized to provide assistance 
with design and construction of infrastructure in specified 
municipalities, counties, and states. This assistance supports publicly 
owned and operated facilities, such as water distribution works, 
stormwater collection, surface water protection projects, and 
environmental restoration, among others.
    This environmental infrastructure is becoming increasingly 
important in our district as we experience significant growth from the 
activity at the Ports that I've already mentioned and new manufacturing 
coming to the area.
    Adding authority for Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, and 
McIntosh would provide an opportunity to help these communities with 
some of their drinking, stormwater, wastewater, and other flooding 
problems.
    Thank you for your time and consideration of these important issues 
for my district, state, and the country.
    I look forward to continuing to work with the Committee to ensure 
the inclusion of these requests that will bring significant benefits to 
our communities and country.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. Are 
there any questions?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Mr. Donalds, great to see you here. I look forward to your 
testimony. You have up to 5 minutes when you are ready.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. BYRON DONALDS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Vice Chair 
Napolitano. Thank you for being here. Thank you for allowing me 
to be here. I want to discuss three topics with you today: 
number one, water quality; number two, transportation; and 
number three, nuclear energy.
    I represent Florida's 19th Congressional District, which 
covers Lee County and Collier County of southwest Florida. My 
district is full of environmental treasures such as white sandy 
beaches, lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, not to mention a wide 
variety of unique aquatic specimens that call these water 
bodies home. The quality of the water impacts my constituents 
and the local economy on a daily basis, hence why water is my 
office's number-one priority.
    I want to make the committee aware of a few bills that I am 
leading to improve water quality in my district and across the 
United States of America.
    First, I introduced the Water Quality and Environmental 
Innovation Act on a bipartisan basis with Representative 
Gottheimer of New Jersey. This bill takes unused funding that 
lacks a designated purpose from the EPA's Motor Vehicle and 
Engine Compliance Program for the purpose of issuing grants and 
contracts to fund projects that seek to use emerging 
technologies to combat water quality and other related 
challenges. Innovative technologies may include artificial 
intelligence, robotics, distributed ledger technology, eDNA, 
quantum, et cetera.
    This bill takes an outside-the-box approach to remedy 
potential water quality concerns such as harmful algal blooms, 
sea level rise, acidification, accumulation of trash and 
plastics, et cetera.
    Next, I previously introduced another bipartisan bill 
called the Combat Harmful Algal Blooms Act. This bill is 
simple. It adds harmful algal blooms to be eligible for major 
disaster funding under the Stafford Act. To illustrate the 
importance of this to Lee County's economy, Lee County's 
fishing industry has a value of $618 million. An economic loss 
from harmful algal blooms can equate to $195 million. Lee 
County's coastal economic output is $11.1 billion. Harmful 
algal blooms can cost my area $3 billion. Lee County's property 
values near the coast is roughly $19.1 billion. Economic losses 
from harmful algal blooms can equate to $3.8 billion.
    I would also note that I am introducing a bill in the near 
future called the Convert Harmful Algal Blooms to Fuels Act, 
which is another bill that takes a unique approach to combating 
Florida's water quality challenges. Briefly, this bill builds 
upon the Army Corps HABITATS Program to take aquatic algal 
biomass and convert such algae into alternative fuels or 
biofuels. As a Floridian, I welcome an opportunity to turn 
oranges into orange juice, and this bipartisan bill actually 
would incorporate a similar train of thought.
    Next, I would urge the committee to consider another 
bipartisan bill I introduced called the Short Line Railroad 
Relief Act. There are approximately 600 short line freight 
railroads in the United States, most being owned and operated 
by small businesses. The Seminole Gulf Railway is the one that 
is in southwest Florida, in Congressional District 19. This was 
actually subject to damage from Hurricane Ian, so, time is of 
the essence to try to repair that railway line so that our 
local economy can get back on track as quickly as possible.
    Finally, I have introduced several bills related to nuclear 
energy in this Congress. A few of them have been referred to 
your committee chairman. Nuclear is the cleanest option in 
America's energy arsenal. Nuclear is a bipartisan issue. I know 
a lot of our colleagues up here on Capitol Hill have a desire 
to release or eliminate carbon emissions; nuclear power is the 
engine to make that a reality and take it from the talking 
points to something that is tangible for all Americans.
    Specifically, I introduced a bill that will require the 
development of a national strategy to deploy nuclear 
microreactors after natural disasters hit.
    Finally, I would like to leave the committee with this 
innovative thought. Across the street from this hearing room is 
the U.S. Capitol Power Plant. The facility provides chilled 
water and high-temperature steam to the Capitol complex. Today, 
we are seeing many of these coal facilities being retired, and 
unfortunately, there is currently a huge opportunity to 
revitalize retired coal facilities with advanced nuclear 
technology due to the compatibility of such energy 
infrastructure.
    Now imagine the statement Congress could make to the 
nuclear industry, American communities, and the world if we 
look at utilizing advanced nuclear power reactors to power the 
United States Capitol. I think it would send an amazing message 
of what Congress is prepared to do, and how we can lead the 
United States and the world.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. KEVIN MULLIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Mullin. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Members, for the 
opportunity.
    On New Year's Eve of 2022, my home State of California saw 
firsthand the dangers of climate change. Unprecedented flooding 
from several atmospheric rivers wreaked havoc, causing damage 
to private property, public infrastructure, and disrupting the 
lives of many of my constituents, including on their private 
property. District residents in the city of San Mateo, who 
really have never experienced storms quite like this, are now 
facing catastrophic losses. To quote one constituent regarding 
their experience, ``I've lived in San Mateo for 33 years, and 
where we lived has never, ever flooded . . . about 4 hours 
[after it started], I was, in vain, attempting to bail out my 
house.''
    The data shows we need to address flooding in my district 
to address the frequency of these so-called 100-year flood 
events. That is why I have respectfully submitted to the 
committee a request for a feasibility study of flood control 
and stormwater runoff reduction measures to be taken in San 
Mateo. These efforts will protect this city from future extreme 
weather events.
    Frankly, we know this is a problem nationwide. Communities 
everywhere are finding it challenging to work within the 
authorized dollar amounts for continuing authority programs. A 
commonsense policy change that I am submitting to the committee 
is to modestly adjust these amounts for inflation and regional 
cost differences. This adjustment would better support projects 
across the country, including in my own district, where there 
is also an ongoing effort to protect the bayfront city of East 
Palo Alto and the San Francisquito Creek, which runs right 
through that community. This project, if funded properly, would 
significantly reduce the risk of flooding for over 4,000 
households.
    Please consider the impact these requests will have on the 
way communities across the country respond to extreme weather. 
Thank you for your time and for your work on this year's act.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Kevin Mullin, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for inviting 
me here today, I'm grateful for your audience.
    On New Year's Eve of 2022, my home state of California saw 
firsthand the real danger of climate change. Unprecedented flooding 
from several atmospheric rivers wreaked havoc throughout my district, 
causing damage to private property, public infrastructure, and 
disrupting the lives of many of my constituents.
    For example, in the City of San Mateo, residents who have never 
experienced storms like this in the past are now facing catastrophic 
losses. To quote one constituent regarding their experience after one 
of the latest storms began: ``I've lived in San Mateo for 33 years, and 
where we lived has never, ever flooded . . . about four hours [after it 
started], I was, in vain, attempting to bail out my house.''
    We know from the data that we need to address flooding in our 
community now. That is why I have respectfully submitted to the 
Committee a request for a feasibility study of flood control and 
stormwater runoff reduction measures that might be taken in San Mateo. 
These efforts will protect this city from the increased threat of 
extreme weather events.
    But zooming out, we know this is a problem across the country. 
Moreover, communities are finding it challenging to work within the 
authorized dollar amounts for continuing authority programs. A common 
sense policy change that I am submitting to the Committee is to 
modestly adjust these dollar amounts for inflation and for regional 
cost differences.
    This adjustment would better support projects across the country, 
including in my own district where there is an ongoing effort to 
protect the bayfront city of East Palo Alto and the San Francisquito 
Creek which runs through it.
    I ask that you consider the impact these requests will have on the 
way communities across the nation respond to extreme weather. Thank you 
for your time and for all your work on this year's Act.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions 
for the gentleman?
    Seeing none, thank you again for your testimony.
    Ms. Luna, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. ANNA PAULINA LUNA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Mrs. Luna. Thank you. My district is home to many pristine 
beaches along the Gulf of Mexico. It is my utmost priority to 
ensure beach renourishment continues in my community, and that 
is exactly why I am here before you today.
    For the entirety of last year, my office has begun fighting 
with the Army Corps of Engineers over their decision to not 
move forward with the renourishment of the Sand Key Beach 
Project in Pinellas County. The initial construction effort for 
Sand Key was completed in 1993. Successive renourishment took 
place in 1999, 2006, 2012, and 2018, and they have 
significantly repaired the beach and also built up the 
shoreline to up to 200 feet from the seawall.
    Renourishment needs to take place every 6 years in order 
for this area to be maintained. However, the Army Corps has 
informed Pinellas County that local officials must obtain over 
100 percent of property owner rights in order for a beach 
access to take place. This is obviously not fair, being that we 
can't even at this current time attain over 40 percent.
    Despite perpetual easements not being required by law, the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers insists that it must acquire all 
access in order to move forward, and this is also impacting the 
areas of Treasure Island and Long Key.
    For previous renourishments, Pinellas County property 
owners were allowed to sign temporary construction easements to 
allow the Army Corps to do its work. Army Corps also stated 
that the agency intends to start enforcing its new policy--
purportedly from 1996, but not enforced over the last two 
decades.
    Section 103(d) of the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, 
WRDA, requires the local sponsors to pay for sand placed on 
private property. The Army Corps of Engineers' new 
interpretation of this 40-year-old law is that they will not 
replace the public side of the sand, which is seaward of the 
erosion control line, unless perpetual public access is 
acquired from property owner rights on the landward side of the 
erosion control line in order for local sponsors to pay 100 
percent of the cost.
    Basically, this policy is out of date. What is happening is 
our communities impacted by it, they are citing a policy that 
hasn't been enforced for over 20 years, and now they are saying 
that if we don't basically hand over our private property 
rights, what is going to happen is we are not going to get 
help. It is going to impact our tourism. It is going to 
basically ensure that these property owners are going to have 
their property completely destroyed, not to mention we have 
natural habitat for some endangered species that is also going 
to be impacted by it.
    The Army Corps has been playing games. We have been trying 
to reach out to them. They haven't responded to any of our 
phone calls. I know that I am not the only Member that is 
facing this problem. They are doing this to other Members, as 
well. And I find it ironic that it is also in red States. So, I 
am asking for your help to change this policy so that they can 
no longer do this to our community.
    [Mrs. Luna's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Anna Paulina Luna, a Representative in 
                   Congress From the State of Florida
    Hello Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished 
Members of the Committee.
    My district is home to many pristine beaches along the Gulf of 
Mexico. It is my utmost priority to ensure beach renourishment 
continues in my community. That is why I am before you today.
    For the entirety of last year, my office has been fighting the Army 
Corps of Engineers over their decision not to move forward with the 
renourishment of the Sand Key Beach Project in Pinellas County. The 
initial construction effort for Sand Key was completed in 1993. 
Successive nourishments in 1999, 2006, 2012, and 2018 have 
significantly repaired and built up the beach, with the shoreline now 
about 200 feet from the seawall. Renourishment needs to be placed every 
six years. The next renourishment cycle would need to begin in 2024 to 
stay on schedule and not risk beach erosion that would degrade the 
progress made over the last three decades.
    However, the Army Corps has informed Pinellas County that local 
officials must obtain perpetual public access easements along the 
length of the project from 100 percent of property owners, regardless 
of whether sand is being placed on their private property, in order to 
proceed with the next renourishment cycle. This attempted power grab 
seeks to strip property rights from homeowners where easements are not 
needed to complete the next renourishment cycle.
    Despite perpetual easements not being required by law, the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers insists they must be acquired to move forward 
with ANY beach renourishment project. This now affects not only Sand 
Key but also Treasure Island and Long Key projects, which were 
previously given the green light in Pinellas County. It does not end 
there; the Corps' policy will halt beach renourishment projects in over 
nine counties throughout Florida.
    For previous nourishments, Pinellas County property owners were 
allowed to sign temporary construction easements to allow the Army 
Corps to do its work. Army Corps stated that the agency intends to 
start enforcing this new policy, purportedly from 1996 but not enforced 
for the past two decades. It is a flawed requirement to require 
perpetual public access easements on private properties, especially 
those that will not have sand placed. For obvious reasons about half of 
private property owners have declined to give such an easement.
    Section 103(d) of the 1986 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 
requires the local sponsor to pay for sand placed on private property. 
The Army Corps of Engineers new interpretation of this 40-year-old law 
is that they will not place sand on the public side of the beach, which 
is seaward of the erosion control line, unless a perpetual public 
access easement is acquired from the private property owners on the 
landward side of the erosion control line unless the local sponsor pays 
100% of the cost. The Army Corps ridiculously maintains this position 
even when sand is not being placed in front of the private property.
    The Corps cites section 103d of 1986 WRDA, which prohibits federal 
funding of benefits to privately owned shores where use is limited to 
private interest, as the reason for their unattainable perpetual 
easement policy. The Corps does not take into account that beaches in 
Florida are already public beaches, established by the erosion control 
line, and that beach renourishment projects with temporary construction 
easements do not violate 1986 WRDA.
    The Corps is interpreting the law incorrectly to fit their policy 
wants, not, as they claim, to comply with the law. Therefore, we need 
to clarify in existing law that the Corps cannot abuse its power with 
this interpretation and stretch its interpretation of the law with no 
legal or statutory authority to do so.
    We must rein in the Army Corps of Engineers and modify the 
requirements in WRDA relating to easements for beach renourishment 
projects and measures in the State of Florida. This policy 
clarification would state that a public access or use easement or 
perpetual property right shall not be required to be provided for any 
privately owned land that is located landward of the erosion control 
line (as determined by the State of Florida) and that the Corps may 
only require a temporary easement or other property right to be 
provided for the purpose of performing pre-construction, construction, 
or post construction activities for the project of measure (including 
maintenance and monitoring activities).
    The Corps' one size fits all approach regarding their easement 
policy does not take into account the vast differences in state laws 
when it comes to public versus private property. For instance, Florida 
law has an erosion control line that delineates public beach versus 
private land. For the purposes of federal cost sharing, Florida's 
beaches are already considered publicly accessible shores which satisfy 
the WRDA 1986 requirement.
    Without renourishment, Pinellas County will be more prone to future 
hurricanes and flood damage, which will negatively impact the entire 
county's economy. Without this scheduled 2024 nourishment, the beach 
will dissipate and erode, demolishing many habitats to endangered 
species and threatened wildlife. Specifically, Loggerhead Sea Turtles, 
Piping Plover Shorebird, West Indian Manatee, Eastern Black Rail, Red 
Knot, Wood Stork, American Crocodile, Eastern Indigo Snake, Green Sea 
Turtle, Hawksbill Sea Turtle, and the Leatherback Sea Turtle are 
federally classified as endangered or threatened species and reside in 
and/or around the Sand Key region. Without renourishment to preserve 
the habitats of our endangered species, they will be placed at greater 
risk. The Army Corps is under an obligation to exercise its authority 
to further the conservation of endangered and threatened species. In 
this case, Army Corps action that reimagines the 1986 WRDA statute will 
devastate such species.
    It is my top priority for WRDA 2024 to ensure that Army Corps 
proceeds as planned with already authorized beach renourishment 
projects in Florida. While this new Army Corps policy is very personal 
to me and my constituents in Pinellas County, I'm sure you will hear 
from my colleagues that this new policy is threatening many other 
projects throughout Florida. I respectfully request your assistance in 
correcting the wayward Army Corps of Engineers and ensure that Florida 
beach renourishment projects move forward on schedule.
    Thank you. I yield back.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady.
    Mrs. Luna. Thank you.
    Mr. Rouzer. Duly noted.
    Are there any questions?
    Seeing none, thank you again.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. NICK LaLOTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. LaLota. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member 
Napolitano, for hosting this important hearing today and for 
allowing me to testify in front of the committee. I would like 
to take some time today to address two issues.
    First, an issue critical to my district back home on Long 
Island: reauthorizing the Long Island Sound Program. In 1985, 
Congress created the Long Island Sound Study, also commonly 
referred to as the Long Island Sound Program, to identify and 
address the major environmental and ecological problems 
affecting the Long Island Sound. The Long Island Sound Program 
was authorized at $40 million annually through the Long Island 
Sound Restoration Act, and through this legislation, a bi-state 
comprehensive management plan has been developed and continues 
to be implemented.
    In 2006, Congress also passed the Long Island Sound 
Stewardship Act, which provided Federal dollars to projects to 
restore the coastal habitat to help revitalize the wildlife 
population, coastal wetlands, and plant life.
    In 2018, the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship 
Act, which combined and reauthorized the two complementary 
water quality and habitat restoration programs, was enacted as 
part of the America's Water Infrastructure Act.
    As of 2022, Federal funding for the Long Island Sound has 
enabled programs to significantly reduce the amount of nitrogen 
entering the Long Island Sound from sewage treatment plants by 
70.3 percent compared to the 1990s, reduce hypoxic conditions 
by 58 percent compared to the 1990s, restore at least 2,239 
acres of coastal habitat, and fund 570 conservation projects.
    In fiscal year 2023, the Long Island Sound received $40 
million, the largest funding level in the history of the 
program. The House and Senate have both included $40 million 
for the Long Island Sound in their fiscal year 2024 
appropriations bills, and we are extremely grateful for that.
    But none of this matters unless the program is 
reauthorized.
    And while my good friend from the other side of the aisle 
and the other side of the Long Island Sound, Connecticut 
Congressman Courtney, and I have introduced legislation, H.R. 
5441, the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship 
Reauthorization Act of 2023, to reauthorize the program, we 
believe this legislation can and should be included in a WRDA 
package. I look forward to continuing to work with this 
committee to get this important program reauthorized, and thank 
you for the support that you have already shown.
    The second issue I wanted to address quite quickly is an 
issue of local concern that has been going on in my district 
for quite some time: a crumbling seawall in the village of 
Asharoken. The village of Asharoken connects the community of 
Eaton's Neck to the rest of the town of Huntington through a 
narrow road. Due to weather conditions and the elevation of the 
road, there are several times when the road has completely 
flooded, leaving stranded entire communities.
    A brief survey of the seawall recently demonstrated a 
devastating scouring of the beach, and with every storm, the 
situation has become more and more dire for the local residents 
there. This has resulted in toe stones dropping, exposure of 
more sheet steel, and exposing the wall to total failure. This 
could result in total loss of the road, as well. Currently, 
there is redtape that is preventing the residents of Asharoken 
and Eaton's Neck from getting the help they need to fortify the 
seawall and ensure the community is not stranded when even a 
minor weather event occurs.
    I look forward, Chairman, Ranking Member, to working with 
this committee and the Army Corps of Engineers to find a 
solution to this issue, and I hope you would agree that my 
constituents deserve nothing less. Thank you so much for your 
indulgence.

                       From the State of New York
    Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano for 
hosting this important hearing today, and for allowing me to testify in 
front of this Committee.
    I would like to take this time today to discuss an issue that is 
critical to my district--reauthorizing the Long Island Sound Program.
    In 1985, Congress created the Long Island Sound Study (LISS), also 
commonly referred to as the Long Island Sound Program, to identify and 
address the major environmental problems affecting the Long Island 
Sound. The Long Island Sound Program was authorized at $40 million 
annually through the LIS Restoration Act. Through this legislation, a 
bi-state Comprehensive Management Plan has been developed and is being 
implemented. In 2006 Congress also passed the Long Island Sound 
Stewardship Act, which provided federal dollars for projects to restore 
the coastal habitat to help revitalize the wildlife population, coastal 
wetlands, and plant life.
    In 2018, the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Act, 
which combined and reauthorized the two complementary water quality and 
habitat restoration programs, was enacted as a part of the America's 
Water Infrastructure Act.
    As of 2022, federal funding for the Long Island Sound has enabled 
programs to significantly reduce the amount of nitrogen entering the 
Long Island Sound from sewage treatment plants by 70.3% compared to the 
1990s, reduce hypoxic conditions by 58% compared to the 1990s, restore 
at least 2,239 acres of coastal habitat, and fund 570 conservation 
projects. In FY23, the Long Island Sound received $40 million, the 
largest funding level in the history of the program. The House and 
Senate have both included $40 million for Long Island Sound in their FY 
2024 appropriations bills, and we are extremely grateful for that.
    But none of this matters if the program is not reauthorized.
    While my good friend and colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Courtney 
and I have introduced legislation, H.R. 5441, the Long Island Sound 
Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act of 2023 to reauthorize 
the program, we believe this legislation can and should be included in 
a WRDA (pronounced: WERDA) package. I look forward to continuing to 
work with this Committee to get this important program reauthorized and 
I thank you for the support you have already shown.
    I also wanted to take just a few moments to highlight a critical 
local issue that has been going on in my district for quite some time--
a crumbling seawall in the village of Asharoken.
    The village of Asharoken connects the community of Eaton's Neck and 
the rest of the town of Huntington through a narrow road. Due to 
weather conditions and the elevation of the road, there are several 
times when the road has completely flooded--leaving stranded an entire 
community.
    A brief survey of the seawall recently demonstrated devastating 
scouring of the beach. With every storm, the situation has become more 
and more dire. This has resulted in the toe stones dropping, exposure 
of more sheet steel and exposing the wall to total failure. This could 
result in the loss of the road as well.
    Currently, there is red tape that is preventing the residents of 
Asharoken and Eaton's Neck from getting the help they need to fortify 
the seawall and ensure that the community is not stranded when a minor 
weather event occurs.
    I look forward to working with this Committee and the Army Corps of 
Engineers to find a solution to this issue. My constituents deserve 
nothing less.
    Thank you again to Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano 
for hosting this hearing today and I yield back.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Mr. LaLota. Thank you.
    Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Schrier, you are up for up to 5 minutes.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. KIM SCHRIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Dr. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ranking 
Member.
    I first want to thank the committee for their work on WRDA 
in 2022. During the last WRDA Member Day, I spoke to this 
committee about the importance of continued funding of the 
Howard Hanson Dam, a project that the entire Washington 
delegation supports that will provide downstream fish passage, 
safe drinking water, and critical habitat restoration for 
endangered salmon species. We were able to include 
authorization of the necessary funds for project completion in 
the 2022 WRDA, so, thank you for that work.
    Today, I would like to speak with you first about my 
bipartisan bill, the WIFIA Amendments of 2023. As you know, the 
Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, or 
WIFIA, is a Federal credit program managed by Federal agencies 
for eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects. 
Under this program, borrowers, including State, Tribal, and 
Federal Governments, can apply for low-interest, flexible loans 
to fund these water infrastructure projects. These loans are 
invaluable resources that allow local governments to meet the 
infrastructure needs of their respective communities at an 
affordable rate.
    WIFIA allotments have had a significant impact throughout 
the country, and to date, the program has announced $19 billion 
to finance 109 projects across the country, creating 60,000 
jobs. In Washington State, King County, the city of Tacoma, and 
Seattle public utilities have all received WIFIA loans. King 
County was invited to apply for a $287 million WIFIA master 
agreement, which helped fund several projects, including the 
Northwest Lake Sammamish Interceptor Upgrade and the Sammamish 
Plateau Diversion Project.
    Now, despite its importance and its significant impact on 
water infrastructure, the program has not been modified since 
its inception in 2014. In addition to reauthorizing the program 
through 2027, my bipartisan bill would update and improve WIFIA 
by removing barriers of entry for rural community water 
projects. This is an exciting and important opportunity to help 
rural communities access critical loans and long-term, stable 
funding for water infrastructure. This keeps our water clean, 
ensures a supply of safe drinking water, keeps costs low for 
ratepayers, and is particularly important for the smallest 
communities. So, I request that this bill be considered by this 
committee in the 2024 WRDA, or at least in future committee 
activity.
    With my remaining time, I would like to speak in support of 
one particular project that I will be submitting for the city 
of Chelan in my district. To paint a picture of the city of 
Chelan, it is mountains with one of the deepest lakes in the 
entire world right in the middle. The problem is that in 2015, 
Washington experienced the worst wildfire season in the State's 
recorded history, and this included the Chelan Complex fires. 
It is smack in the middle of what we consider one of the 
highest risk firesheds in the country. This destroyed 75 homes 
and businesses nearby, and the risk of similar fires is only 
increasing.
    So, seeing a serious gap in wildfire preparedness, the city 
of Chelan has proposed constructing a water reservoir at a 
higher elevation for both wildfire resilience and for water 
supply. The current system relies on booster pump stations to 
distribute water over increasing elevation and distance from 
the lake. The system contains some serious risks. Failure of 
these pump stations, which can happen in a wildfire, could 
disrupt water distribution to the eastern side of the city and 
could impact firefighting abilities.
    To counter this vulnerability, the city seeks to build a 
new 1-million-gallon water reservoir in East Chelan. The 
reservoir will assist in mitigating future wildfire risks 
associated with their unique geographic and infrastructure 
challenges, and I will be submitting an authorization request 
for $9 million for the construction phase of this project.
    I want to thank you for your consideration, and I am happy 
to answer any questions.

could disrupt water distribution to the eastern side of the city for 
both emergency firefighting and daily life. To counter this 
vulnerability, the city seeks to build a new 1 million gallon water 
reservoir in east Chelan. This reservoir will assist in mitigating 
future wildfire risks associated with the unique geographic and

    Thank you for your consideration.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady for her testimony. Any

    Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Budzinski, you are recognized.

TESTIMONY OF HON. NIKKI BUDZINSKI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Ms. Budzinski. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, and thank you, 
Ranking Member Napolitano, for holding this hearing today, to 
hear from Members on our priorities for the upcoming 
reauthorization of WRDA.
    As a Representative for central and southern Illinois, I 
have the honor of serving communities outside of St. Louis in 
the Metro East region, communities that have struggled with the 
consequences of inadequate infrastructure for far too long. In 
Cahokia Heights, local residents have been dealing with a 
flooding, sewage, and drinking water crisis for decades, 
eroding home values and putting folks' health and safety at 
risk.
    I was proud to secure an EPA coordinator to help us resolve 
this issue, and the Army Corps of Engineers has worked 
collaboratively with the State of Illinois to address this in 
the past. But our work is not done, and that is why I am 
requesting additional support in our next Water Resources 
Development Act.
    In WRDA 2024, I am requesting a feasibility study of the 
Spring Lake Project recommended in the East St. Louis and 
Vicinity Ecosystem Restoration and Flood Damage Reduction 
Project report to advance this structural project to a 
preconstruction engineering design phase. This will help 
communities in my district with flood resilience and reduction, 
and ensure their homes are protected.
    In addition to completing this study, the flooding issue 
can be mitigated by modifying the scope and authorization 
ceiling for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers response. By 
adding stormwater management to the existing scope of water and 
wastewater infrastructure assistance, the Army Corps of 
Engineers will have increased ability to remedy flooding issues 
as they arise, as well as mitigate future issues. Raising the 
ceiling from $100 to $200 million will also allow the Army 
Corps enhanced capability to respond to these issues.
    The Mississippi River also serves as a vital waterway to 
growers and producers in my congressional district, allowing 
them to get their goods to market. The Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law funded seven inland waterway construction 
projects. Even so, Infrastructure Law funds alone will be 
insufficient to complete any of these critical projects that 
Congress intended the IIJA fund to complete. Unless modified in 
WRDA 2024, the disparity between projected costs reflected in 
BIL funding levels and subsequent real-world project costs 
threaten to jeopardize and delay critical ongoing and planned 
capital improvements that are desperately and urgently needed 
to modernize our Nation's antiquated inland waterways 
transportation system, further delaying economic and 
environmental benefits.
    Consistent with IIJA congressional intent, I request that 
we adjust funding levels to ensure that the Federal Government 
continues to cover 100 percent of the cost of the seven inland 
waterways construction and major rehabilitation projects. The 
requests I highlighted today alongside the others I intend to 
submit to the committee will help ensure that the constituents 
in my district are protected from floods; that the Army Corps 
of Engineers is well equipped to address flooding issues; and 
that our waterways construction and rehabilitation 
infrastructure is fully funded.
    Thank you very much, Chairman and Ranking Member, for the 
opportunity to testify here today, and I thank you in advance 
for consideration of my request. Thank you.
    [Ms. Budzinski's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
    Prepared Statement of Hon. Nikki Budzinski, a Representative in 
                  Congress From the State of Illinois
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony before the 
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee as part of the Water 
Resources Development Act (WRDA) Member Day. Below are the top three 
requests I plan to submit for your consideration as you continue your 
work on this important reauthorization.
    The State of Illinois and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 
St. Louis District has a history of working collaboratively on flood 
mitigation efforts in the East St. Louis Metropolitan Area. Studies 
sponsored by both the State of Illinois and USACE in 1957, 1965, 1976 
and 1985 have yielded mixed results, with some projects suggested by 
the studies being implemented, while other projects were deemed 
uneconomical based on conditions at that time.
    The WRDA 2000 authorized the USACE to perform a General 
Reevaluation Report of the 1965 Flood Control Act to include ecosystem 
restoration as a project purpose. The 2000 WRDA authorization resulted 
in the East St. Louis, and Vicinity, Illinois Ecosystem Restoration and 
Flood Damage Reduction Project report which was published in 2003. The 
State of Illinois supports a re-evaluation of the 2003 report to update 
this study with economic, rainfall and engineering data.
    Additionally, there are projects suggested by the 2003 East St. 
Louis and Vicinity Report, including the Spring Lake Project, that may 
economically and substantially reduce flood risk in the region. I, 
alongside Senators Durbin and Duckworth, request that Congress directs 
the USACE to complete a Reevaluation Report for the East St. Louis, and 
Vicinity, Illinois Ecosystem Restoration and Flood Damage Reduction 
Project, and complete a Feasibility Study of the Spring Lake Project 
recommended in the East St. Louis and Vicinity Ecosystem Restoration 
and Flood Damage Reduction Project report to advance this structural 
project to a Pre-construction Engineering Design (PED) phase.
    I also request, alongside our Illinois senators, modification to 
the scope and authorization ceiling for Madison and St. Clair Counties, 
Illinois--Section 219(f)(55) of the Water Resources Development Act of 
1992. Scope modification is to include Stormwater Management to the 
existing scope of water and wastewater infrastructure assistance, and 
the requested ceiling amount would be increased from $100 million to 
$200 million. This modification will enable USACE to provide 
engineering design and/or construction assistance to places like 
Cahokia Heights, East St. Louis, Washington Park and Granite City who 
are dealing with significant stormwater management and flooding 
challenges.
    The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funded 
seven inland waterways construction projects. However, IIJA funds will 
be insufficient to complete any of these critical projects that 
Congress intended the IIJA fund to completion. Unless modified in WRDA 
2024, the disparity between projected costs reflect in IIJA funding 
levels and subsequent real world project costs threatens to jeopardize 
and delay critical ongoing and planned capital improvements that are 
desperately and urgently needed to modernize our nation's antiquated 
inland waterways transportation system, further delaying economic and 
environmental benefits. It will also result in the IIJA failing to 
achieve an accelerated return on investment, which was the intent of 
Congress in authorizing 100 percent federal funding for these seven 
projects, which are especially needed given the uncertainty in global 
agriculture and energy markets.
    To that end, consistent with IIJA congressional intent, I request 
that the Committee adjust funding levels to ensure that the federal 
government continues to cover 100 percent of the cost of the seven 
inland waterways construction and major rehabilitation projects.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to provide testimony today. I 
look forward to working with you on these important issues. Please do 
not hesitate to reach out to me or my staff with any questions or 
concerns.

    Ms. Budzinski. I yield back.
    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you very much for your testimony.
    Any questions?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Mr. Davis, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DONALD G. DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. A huge thanks goes out to our 
distinguished chair from the great State of North Carolina, Mr. 
Rouzer.
    Mr. Rouzer. I have heard of that State.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Davis of North Carolina. And to our Ranking Member 
Napolitano, thank you and all the members of this distinguished 
committee for allowing me to speak on issues within the Water 
Resources Development Act that matter to residents of North 
Carolina's First Congressional District.
    Since assuming office last January, one of the top issues 
voiced by constituents has been the significant impact of 
flooding throughout eastern North Carolina. This issue 
underscores the need to develop effective flood risk management 
and mitigation tools. Addressing these challenges is essential 
in safeguarding our communities and enhancing the resilience of 
eastern North Carolina against the detrimental effects of 
flooding.
    Flooding is a reoccurring issue in eastern North Carolina 
due to frequent hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy 
rainfall. Our region consistently ranks in the top 10 for 
yearly rainfall, making flood management a pressing concern. 
Flooding across eastern North Carolina often ruins crop fields, 
destroys homes, and tears apart roads. Families have had to 
rebuild their lives time and time again.
    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been and remains an 
invaluable ally in combating the water overflows affecting our 
communities. I express my support for two projects under their 
administration and oversight in North Carolina's First 
Congressional District: first, the Tar-Pamlico River Basin 
Project; and the second, the Princeville, North Carolina, 
Project. These initiatives play a crucial role in enhancing our 
resilience and strengthening our region against the challenges 
posed by water-related issues.
    The Tar-Pamlico River Basin Project centers around a 
specific study area encompassing river reaches along the Tar 
River and its major tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers recommends efforts to elevate or dry flood-proof 160 
structures within the 4 major population centers of Greenville, 
Tarboro, Rocky Mount, and Nashville. This initiative aims to 
reduce the impact on structures and infrastructure while 
mitigating the associated life safety risks.
    The ongoing Princeville project seeks to mitigate flood 
risk in Princeville, North Carolina. The U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers prioritizes minimizing damage to structures and 
infrastructure and reducing the risks to life safety associated 
with flooding.
    Princeville faced frequent and severe flooding until it 
initiated a levee project in 1967 under the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers Section 205 Continuing Authorities Program. The 
project is rooted in the ``design event,'' referencing back to 
the historic flood in 1919. Unfortunately, Hurricanes Floyd in 
1999 and Matthew in 2016 surpassed this threshold, resulting in 
catastrophic flooding for the town and the substantial loss of 
residences and other structures.
    Princeville is essential to the historical roots of eastern 
North Carolina. It was the first town in the United States 
founded by formerly enslaved people and was the first 
independently governed African-American community chartered in 
the United States. For these reasons, we need to protect 
Princeville and its residents.
    While the Water Resources Development Act of 2024 does not 
require reauthorizing these projects, it is essential to 
emphasize their importance in protecting communities across 
eastern North Carolina.
    I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to testify before 
the committee today on the critical issues impacting my 
constituents. I look forward to continued partnership with the 
members of this committee. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JIM COSTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                    THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman Rouzer and 
Ranking Member Napolitano. It is always good to be here in the 
committee with an opportunity to share my thoughts on projects 
that I think are important to the people of the 21st 
Congressional District and the San Joaquin Valley.
    Holding this hearing obviously gives Members an opportunity 
to discuss their priorities for the 2024 Water Resources 
Development Act. As a Member that has been around for a while, 
I do appreciate the committee sticking to the traditional 
bipartisan WRDA process and committing to work in a bipartisan 
manner. The three of us know that that's how you really get 
things done, and I appreciate that very much.
    I want to talk about, obviously, as my fellow colleagues 
have already spoken on behalf of their districts, the people 
that I represent in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. We 
like to say that we grow food that feeds the world, and that we 
have a saying that where water flows, food grows. Therefore, 
water supply and reliability, the sustainability, especially in 
light of climate change, is critical, a critical factor to our 
region's health and economic well-being, but also to put food 
on America's dinner table every night. We grow half the 
Nation's fruits and vegetables, 90 percent of the processed 
tomatoes, 75 percent of the world's almonds, 20 percent of the 
milk produced in the Nation. The list goes on and on and on.
    But projects that were developed in the 20th century, both 
at the Federal level and State projects combined with local 
projects, have allowed us to create this incredible cornucopia 
of food that we rely on. And food, we don't think about it 
oftentimes, but food is a national security issue. It really 
is. And to think about this great country, the greatest country 
in the world, and less than 4 percent of our Nation's 
population--less than 4 percent--is directly involved in the 
production of food and fiber. It is an amazing story.
    So, these water projects are a key essential foundation to 
ensuring that water supply. Pine Flat Dam, built in the early 
1950s by the Army Corps of Engineers, is one of those examples. 
This proposal before the committee is to raise Pine Flat Dam. 
It currently holds, at full capacity, 1 million acre-feet of 
water. By simply modifying the flood gates--not raising the 
dam, but modifying the flood gates--we could increase the 
capacity over 120,000 acre-feet of additional storage, 
improving storage management in the face of climate extremes 
like intense floods and droughts.
    It seems to be in California, but other parts of the 
country, where we have incredible water, rain, snow, more than 
we can handle, and then extreme periods of drought. We just 
came, in California and the west coast, with 3 consecutive 
years of extreme drought. And we prayed and we prayed and we 
prayed for rain and snow in the mountains. And we must have 
prayed really good, because last year, we had record amounts of 
rain and snowfall to the point where we had floods, and that 
was a challenge.
    But on the Colorado River that provides water for a lot of 
the Western States, the Lake Mead Hoover Dam that we are all 
familiar with has not been filled since 2000. So, the world has 
changed. What we thought was 17 million acre-feet of yield on 
the Colorado River on an average 10-year basis, we are now 
determining is more like 10 to 12 million acre-feet on a 10-
year average, and that has dramatic impact for the upper basin 
States and lower basin States.
    So, additional benefits to increase opportunities when we 
do have flood levels and above-average rainfall, it allows us 
to plan to recharge our groundwater, to restore our overdraft 
aquifers. Representative Napolitano has been very active in 
southern California and elsewhere, where they have successfully 
recharged aquifers that have been depleted, and that provides 
the water for municipal supply as well as for agricultural 
supply, and we are really beginning to do a much better job, I 
think, in recharging our groundwater in rural areas than we 
have in the past.
    The feasibility study for raising Pine Flat Dam, to get 
back to the point, was included in the Corps 2023 Section 7001 
Report, and I look forward to continuing to advance this 
important project through the WRDA process and any other 
avenues that are available.
    As I spoke a moment ago about how climate change is 
impacted with weather patterns, with extreme droughts or 
extreme floods, I want to let the committee know that your 
support in recent years for the forecast-informed reservoir 
operations effort, otherwise known as FIRO, has been very 
helpful. Scripps Institute, a noted research and development in 
the country, has done some tremendous research in forecasting 
where we get these atmospheric storms to a degree to figure out 
how to plan for them.
    Last year in January, and then subsequently again in March, 
we had an incredible amount of these atmospheric storms that 
Scripps has monitored, and others. This has allowed them to use 
enhanced monitoring and improved weather forecasting to more 
responsibly operate reservoirs in changing conditions. And 
that--what we--have to be noted, projects using FIRO and 
additional flexibility have seen a notable increase in water 
supply and storage benefits during times of drought. And given 
these promising results, I think we should expand FIRO for more 
reservoirs, including Bureau of Reclamation projects around the 
country.
    I mean, I will give you an example. Again in California--my 
time is expired?
    Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman's time is over by almost 2 
minutes.
    Mr. Costa. OK, let me just close quickly.
    There are a lot of opportunities here, and the 
environmental infrastructure authorization also I want to note 
to the committee for Fresno and Tulare Counties to authorize 
both counties in my district to be included in new geographical 
areas for eligible environmental infrastructure assistance.
    With that, I thank the committee for your patience and for 
extending me a couple more minutes. God bless you. Happy New 
Year.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Jim Costa, a Representative in Congress From 
                        the State of California
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for holding this 
hearing and giving members an opportunity to discuss their priorities 
for the 2024 Water Resources Development Act.
    I appreciate this Committee for sticking to the traditional 
biennial WRDA process and committing to work in a bipartisan manner.
    In California's San Joaquin Valley, we grow the food that feeds the 
world. We have a saying, ``where water flows, food grows.'' Water 
supply reliability is a critical factor in our region's health and 
economic well-being.
    The projects managed by the Army Corps, along with the federal 
Bureau of Reclamation and the State Water Project play an essential 
role.
                             Pine Flat Dam
    One of my top priorities with an Army Corps nexus is the proposal 
to raise Pine Flat Dam. Pine Flat Reservoir's current capacity is one 
million acre-feet of water. Simply raising Pine Flat Dam by twelve feet 
would provide over 120,000 acre-feet of additional storage, improving 
storage management in the face of climate extremes like intense drought 
and floods.
    Additional benefits include increased flood protection, additional 
groundwater recharge opportunities to restore our over-drafted 
aquifers, and additional agricultural and municipal water supply for 
disadvantaged communities.
    A feasibility study for raising Pine Flat Dam was included in the 
Corps 2023 Section 7001 report, and I look forward to continuing to 
advance this important project through WRDA and other avenues.
                        Eastman Lake Enlargement
    Similar to Pine Flat, I support efforts to enlarge Eastman Lake, 
which is located in Madera County. A feasibility study modification was 
also included for Eastman Lake in the 2023 Section 7001. The proposal 
would increase the Lake's capacity from 150,000 to 200,000 acre-feet.
    This project would provide additional flood control benefits, 
reduce demand for groundwater, and help meet water demands in the 
region.
   Environmental Infrastructure Authorizations for Fresno and Tulare 
                                Counties
    I am seeking to authorize both countries in my district, Fresno and 
Tulare, as new geographic areas eligible for Environmental 
Infrastructure assistance.
    Environmental Infrastructure assistance is another tool in our 
water toolbox that our region should be able to access.
    As an arid region that experiences wide swings in precipitation and 
water availability, ranging from extreme droughts to intense storms and 
flooding, the region needs eligibility to use these authorities to 
upgrade and modernize our water infrastructure.
    This includes efforts to develop projects such as construction of 
water distribution works, stormwater management, surface water 
protection, and environmental restoration, that may be necessary for a 
sustainable water future in the region.
    As the Committee continues to draft the 2024 Water Resources 
Development Act, I look forward to working with you to advance these 
priorities and achieve our shared goals of maximizing the beneficial, 
efficient, and sustainable management of our nation's water resources.

    Mr. Rouzer. You are a good man, Jim Costa.
    Any questions for Mr. Costa?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Mr. Costa. Thank you.
    Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Moylan.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JAMES C. MOYLAN, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                     THE TERRITORY OF GUAM

    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and 
members of the committee and staff for putting together this 
Water Resources Development Act, WRDA.
    My office has submitted several study proposals across a 
wide range of issues, and I am truly very excited about the 
chance to come before you today because I have been told that 
the Army Corps of Engineers has never completed a WRDA project 
on Guam. Never. First time.
    So, while Guam already has funding authorized, there is 
money there for potential future projects, there is no relevant 
study that has been introduced or completed to help clarify 
where this funding is best directed. So, we have the solution, 
and wish to let you know our highest priority of the project is 
to increase the raw water storage capabilities at what is known 
as the Ugum Surface Water Treatment Plant on Guam. And this is 
under the Guam Waterworks Authority, who I have been working 
closely with, and my staff, to identify our number-one project.
    The Ugum Surface Water Treatment Plant, in its current 
state, the plant's capabilities are insufficient during times 
of drought or in heavy rainfall. Whether dry season or rainy 
season, it is not working. So, these shortcomings are a result 
of outdated machinery and a security system that is desperately 
in need of modernization.
    Guam is a long way away from CONUS, and it is far, it is 
about 3,000 miles away from Hawaii. We are closer to Taiwan 
than we are to Hawaii. So, building a critical infrastructure 
on Guam is significantly more expensive and difficult than it 
is here in the lower 48, due to the tyranny of distance and 
also the Buy America laws that vastly inflate the already high 
cost of goods on Guam. So, this means opportunities like WRDA 
projects are crucial--crucial--for improving critical 
infrastructure for our island.
    We know that Guam's role is a vital part of the United 
States national security matrix. But what that also means is 
that the People's Republic of China's sanctioned hackers are 
looking for every opportunity to infiltrate our critical 
infrastructure. Water infrastructure is high on the target 
list. So, in addition to providing basic water needs, this 
project proposes, if enacted, to increase our water security on 
the island from natural disasters and malign foreign actors.
    So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to speak 
today, and I look forward to working really closely for the 
delivery of the first WRDA project for Guam, the Ugum Surface 
Water Treatment plant, as our top priority. I thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    [Mr. Moylan's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
Prepared Statement of Hon. James C. Moylan, a Delegate in Congress From 
                         the Territory of Guam
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing and all the work 
you, members of this committee, and your staff are putting in for this 
term's Water Resources Development Act.
    Guam needs help from the US Army Corps of Engineers, my office has 
submitted several study proposals for a wide range of issues. 
Increasing the raw water storage capabilities at the Ugum Surface Water 
Treatment plant, under the Guam Waterworks Authority. In its current 
state, the plant's capabilities are insufficient during times of 
drought or heavy rainfall. These shortcomings are caused by many 
things, but most pressing is the outdated machinery and a security 
system that is in desperate need of improvements.
    This is a hearing to discuss future needs, and I see Guam as a 
perfect future partner for USACE. US Army Corps staff have informed me 
that a WRDA project has never been conducted in my district, and while 
Guam already has funding for a potential future project, no relevant 
studies have been introduced or completed to help clarify where this 
funding is best directed.
    Being 3,000 miles from Hawaii, building critical infrastructure on 
Guam is significantly more difficult and expensive than it is here in 
the lower 48 due to the tyranny of distance and Buy American laws that 
vastly inflate the already high cost of goods. This means that 
opportunities like WRDA projects are important for improving critical 
infrastructure on island.
    Guam's role as a vital part of the U.S. national security matrix 
means that Chinese hackers are looking for every opportunity to 
infiltrate our critical infrastructure, water infrastructure is on that 
target list. In addition to providing for basic water needs, these 
project proposals will seek to increase our water security from natural 
disasters and malign foreign actors.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Any questions for the 
gentleman?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Ms. Garcia, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Ms. Garcia of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member, for having me today again at Member Day. I know I did 
this last year, and I always look forward to it.
    My home city----
    Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. If you don't mind, bring that 
microphone a little closer to you.
    Ms. Garcia of Texas. My home city of Houston sits at the 
epicenter of global trade. In 2023, it was named the top U.S. 
city for international business by the Financial Times. That 
reputation is due in no small part to the continued success of 
Port Houston, the Nation's busiest deepwater port. Every year, 
Port Houston has as many ship calls as the next three largest 
U.S. ports combined, and it accounts for over $900 billion in 
national economic value.
    In the years since the pandemic, the port has rebounded 
with explosive growth in trade, both in imports and exports. 
But the port can't rest on its laurels. To keep the United 
States competitive in the global supply chain, the port must 
accept larger and larger vessels, and for that, they are 
literally going to have to dig deep. Literally.
    That is why I am here today, Mr. Chairman. I come to you to 
request that the committee take up an item with clear 
bipartisan support across the Houston region: for the Army 
Corps to assume maintenance of Project 12.
    Project 12 would widen, deepen, and dredge the port so that 
it may continue to safely accept vessels as they transit along 
the Buffalo Bayou. Doing so would continue a legacy of cost 
sharing that has defined the port from the very start. Fun 
fact, Mr. Chairman: Port Houston was the first port in the 
Nation to be federally cost-shared with local buy-in, and in 
the decade since, the port has grown to be a shining example of 
the benefits such an arrangement can have.
    Additionally, to ensure safe transit in this new age of 
shipping, the port must also look beyond the bayou into the 
channels of the Galveston Bay, which I hope will be the focus 
of a new feasibility study to secure an additional 12 feet of 
draft for larger barges.
    These project priorities garner enormous benefits not only 
for my district, but for the entire Nation. The port is a 
keystone of American critical infrastructure, and it is quite 
literally fueling America.
    Additionally, we must keep pushing for support of the gulf 
coast seawall barrier, which folks back home call the Ike dike. 
Barriers like the Ike dike are lifesaving engineering projects. 
They protect against the loss of life from a deadly storm surge 
and the loss of livelihoods from a flood, something that 
communities in the Houston region know all too well. Hurricane 
Harvey caused nearly $125 billion in damages, and before that, 
Hurricane Ike caused $38 billion in damages across several 
States, including Texas.
    Studies show similar barrier systems to have a near 
immediate return on investment. Those are words that are hard 
to come by in Government. I have seen them firsthand, from New 
Orleans to the Netherlands.
    We must ensure our area has the resources it needs to 
protect the manufacturing, retail, farming, business, and 
military supply chains in the Houston and Galveston region. 
Doing so is important. It is critical not just for our local 
community, but also for those important sectors in Texas and 
throughout the country. I urge my colleagues to include these 
priorities in the passage of the Water Resources Development 
Act of 2024.
    I thank this subcommittee and the full committee for their 
work on these critical issues. And as usual, my office stands 
ready, together with Port Houston, to answer any questions that 
you may have. I know the staff will be working with us on a 
number of them, but, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your time.

    I thank this subcommittee and the full committee for their work on 
these critical issues and I would be glad to take any questions.

    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you very much.
    Any questions for the gentlelady from Texas?
    Seeing none, thank you again.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. BILL PASCRELL, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pascrell. I want to thank you, Chairman and Ranking 
Member, for the opportunity to testify in support of my Water 
Resources Development Act priorities. When I came to the 
Congress 25 years ago, this was my first committee. It seems 
like yesterday.
    I submitted detailed written testimony for the record which 
I will outline today.
    I would like to first recognize my New Jersey delegation 
colleagues, Representative Payne and Representative Menendez, 
who are fierce advocates for our great State on the full 
committee.
    Flooding is a recurring problem in my State, with severe 
consequences for communities in the Passaic River Basin. My 
hometown of Paterson recently declared another state of 
emergency, and residents were evacuated from heavy rainfall 
causing the river to overflow the Passaic River. The river is 
again in flood stage, and it is expected to crest later this 
afternoon.
    I am requesting the committee support a comprehensive study 
by the Army Corps of Engineers to examine measures to improve 
flood mitigation, river navigation, and environmental 
sustainability on the Passaic River.
    I can't say enough--and in 25 years that I have been in 
this Congress--of an agency that has been more responsive than 
the Army Corps of Engineers. And we have had good fights with 
each other, but let me tell you, they have done their job, and 
they have listened within the resources that we provide for 
them.
    Within Paterson Great Falls Park, there is the historic 
water raceway system. I hope the committee will honor my 
request for an Army Corps study on how they can help make the 
raceway system operable. The city of Garfield, across the river 
from Passaic, has several issues related to the Fleischer's 
Brook, including flooding, flash flooding, and collapsed water 
mains. Very dangerous situations. An Army Corps study is needed 
to assess these flooding risks at Fleischer's Brook.
    In the borough of Hasbrouck Heights, the Berry's Creek 
tributary has been plagued by chronic flooding. I hope that the 
committee will support my request for a study of Berry's Creek 
to devise solutions to these issues. During the great storm of 
12 years ago, it was a disaster, that whole area.
    Additionally, numerous municipalities in northern New 
Jersey are adversely impacted by flooding in the Lower Saddle 
Brook Basin area, where there are a number of known 
contaminated sites. You have all the detailed information I 
provided for the committee to be a lot more specific. The Lower 
Saddle River Basin area--and there is a number of known 
contaminated sites. Saddle River is in its worst flood stage in 
many years right now. My staff was with the Governor to witness 
the destruction in Lodi yesterday, and we need to redouble our 
efforts here.
    The Army Corps has the capacity to provide remediation 
services to address this contamination. I encourage the 
committee to work with my office to explore ways the Army Corps 
could perform cleanup, while the non-Federal sponsor remains 
financially responsible.
    Finally, I urge the committee to support the Army Corps and 
the non-Federal sponsor of the Lower Saddle River Flood 
Protection Project in identifying component parts of the 
project that may have longstanding benefits.
    I want to thank you for your time--I know it has been a 
long day, it will be a longer day, I've got to run back to my 
committee--and consideration of my request. I look forward to 
working with the committee to ensure that the priorities of New 
Jersey's Ninth Congressional District are sufficiently 
addressed.
    [Mr. Pascrell's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill Pascrell, Jr., a Representative in 
                 Congress From the State of New Jersey
    Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify in support of my Water Resource Development Act 
priorities. I would also like to recognize my New Jersey delegation 
colleagues Representatives Payne and Menendez who are fierce advocates 
for our great state on the full committee.
    As a former member of this subcommittee, I have been a strong 
proponent of the Army Corps of Engineers. They are critical in ensuring 
that America's infrastructure has the capacity to meet the challenges 
of the twenty-first century and beyond.
    Flooding is a recurring problem in my state with severe 
consequences for communities in the Passaic River Basin. Just last 
month, my hometown Paterson declared a state of emergency and residents 
were evacuated from their homes after heavy rainfall caused the river 
to overflow. I am requesting the Committee support a comprehensive 
study by the Army Corps of Engineers to examine potential measures to 
improve flood mitigation, river navigation, and environmental 
sustainability. This study would explore flood mitigation strategies 
through vegetation control, dredging and sediment analysis, the 
potential acquisition of flood-prone properties, and an assessment of 
the river's carrying capacity.
    The Paterson Great Falls was the catalyst of America's Industrial 
Revolution. Within Paterson Great Falls Park there is the historic 
water raceway system. The raceways once diverted water from the Passaic 
River into a series of channels that ran throughout the city, bringing 
waterpower to the mills. I hope the Committee will honor my request for 
a needed Army Corps study on how to make the raceway system operable. 
This would include the impact of removing sedimentation in front of the 
raceway dam and the upstream flooding conditions to the hydroelectric 
plant.
    The City of Garfield has several issues related to Fleischer's 
Brook, including flooding, flash flooding, and collapsed water mains. 
Fleischer's Brook runs through Garfield, and there are several culverts 
in disrepair that are damaging stormwater and sewer lines. These 
problems become more acute during rainstorms. An Army Corps study is 
needed to assess these flooding risks at Fleischer's Brook.
    In the Borough of Hasbrouck Heights, the Berry's Creek tributary 
has been plagued by chronic flooding. Berry's Creek flows through an 
area close to the city's Department of Public Works facilities, where 
flooding of the creek has forced the relocation of garbage trucks and 
other equipment. I hope that the Committee will support my request for 
a study of Berry's Creek to devise solutions to these issues.
    Additionally, numerous municipalities in Northern New Jersey are 
adversely impacted by flooding that occurs in the lower Saddle River 
basin area along the Saddle River and Sprout Brook, including the City 
of Garfield and the Borough of Lodi. The Lower Saddle River Flood 
Protection Project was authorized in 1986 to study these issues. There 
are a number of Known Contaminated Sites within the Lower Saddle River 
project area. Contamination within the project area must be addressed 
by the non-federal sponsor, the New Jersey Department of Environmental 
Protection, before any construction can take place. The Army Corps has 
the capacity to provide remediation services to address the 
contamination. I encourage the Committee to work with my office and 
relevant stakeholders to explore ways in which the non-federal sponsor 
could request that the Army Corps perform the cleanup while the non-
federal sponsor remains financially responsible. This would support the 
efficiency and advancement of the project.
    Finally, I encourage the committee to support the Army Corps and 
the non-federal sponsor of the Lower Saddle River Flood Protection 
Project in identifying separable component parts of the project that 
may have stand-alone benefits. Recent flooding along the Lower Saddle 
River has again demonstrated the need to advance this project and 
provide flooding relief to my constituents who live in the affected 
areas.
    Thank you for your time and consideration of my requests. I look 
forward to working with the Committee to ensure that the priorities of 
New Jersey's Ninth District are sufficiently addressed.
    I yield back.

    Mr. Pascrell. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman. If you have 
any questions, I will gladly answer them.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman, and the chairman will 
note here that you and I have a lot of similar issues, so, I 
look forward to working with you to address those.
    Any questions for the gentleman?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Mr. Pascrell. Thank you.
    Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Garbarino, you are recognized for up to 5 
minutes.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Garbarino. Good afternoon, good morning, whatever it 
is, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano. I am here 
today to respectfully request the inclusion of critical 
authorization language for my district in the 2024 Water 
Resources Development Act.
    In September of 2023, heavy rainfall brought on by a 
nor'easter washed away significant sections of the Fire Island 
shoreline. The result was homes were left extremely close to 
the water, boardwalks were hanging freely in the air, and 
emergency vehicles were unable to drive on eroded beaches.
    Coastal erosion on Fire Island has been a problem for 
decades and threatens critical infrastructure as well as 
private property. Just a few months ago, a power station on 
Fire Island was so close to the eroded coastline that emergency 
protective work had to be completed to prevent it from being 
compromised and falling into the sea. In Seaview, their local 
utilities are also susceptible to flooding due to beach 
erosion, which is now threatening water wells.
    In addition to serving as home for many of my constituents, 
Fire Island fulfills an important purpose as a barrier island 
which protects Long Island from erosion and storms.
    The Army Corps of Engineers has determined that the weather 
event that caused this damage does not meet the requirements 
under Public Law 84-99 for emergency renourishment. Therefore, 
instead of engaging in emergency renourishment work, the Army 
Corps will continue in accordance with the Fire Island Inlet to 
Montauk Point, or FIMP, project schedule. Under this project 
schedule, renourishment won't take place for a few years. Until 
then, we are left in limbo with respect to when emergency 
Federal assistance can be provided between scheduled 
renourishment periods.
    Each passing storm increases the damage to our shoreline. 
Just this Tuesday, the town of Babylon notified my office that 
heavy rainfall had eroded their local beaches so badly that a 
playground and a pavilion structure were close to being 
compromised. The day after, I was notified the playground is 
now unusable and in the sea, and the water has made its way to 
the pavilion structure. Timely renourishment is necessary to 
prevent further deterioration.
    Our communities in Massapequa are similarly threatened by 
erosion. In the last 2 years, the town of Oyster Bay has spent 
over $3 million to purchase sand and rebuild Tobay Beach. 
Without this investment, Tobay would have been compromised, as 
well.
    The longer we leave these problems unchecked, the greater 
the probability that Long Island will require increased support 
for infrastructure resiliency projects. If we can address this 
problem quickly, we can avoid having to address even greater 
damage in the future.
    To address this issue, I will be submitting proposed 
authorization language that will allow renourishment to occur 
following nor'easters affecting the Fire Island National 
Seashore and neighboring hamlets in between scheduled periods. 
My submission is based off a similar authorization that was 
included in the 2022 Water Resources Development Act for the 
State of Delaware.
    The current situation on Fire Island has highlighted the 
need to create a mechanism for permitting supplemental work 
outside the typical FIMP renourishment windows, should similar 
damage occur in the future. It is my hope that this year's WRDA 
can provide Long Island and Fire Island residents with the 
assistance they so desperately require. Thank you for the 
opportunity to highlight this incredibly important issue.

  Prepared Statement of Hon. Andrew R. Garbarino, a Representative in 
                  Congress From the State of New York
    Good afternoon Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano,
    I am here today to respectfully request the inclusion of critical 
authorization language for my district in the 2024 Water Resources 
Development Act.
    In September of 2023, heavy rainfall brought on by a nor'easter 
washed away significant sections of the Fire Island shoreline. The 
result was homes left precariously close to the water, boardwalks 
hanging freely in the air, and emergency vehicles being unable to 
traverse the eroded beaches. Coastal erosion on Fire Island has been a 
problem for decades and threatens critical infrastructure as well as 
private property. Just a few months ago, a power station on Fire Island 
was so close to the eroded coastline that emergency protective work had 
to be completed to prevent it from being compromised. In Seaview, their 
local utilities are also susceptible to flooding due to beach erosion, 
which is now threatening water wells.
    In addition to serving as home for many of my constituents, Fire 
Island fulfills an important purpose as a barrier island which protects 
Long Island from erosion and storms.
    The Army Corps of Engineers has determined that the weather event 
that caused this damage does not meet the requirements under Pub. L. 
84-99 for emergency renourishment. Therefore, instead of engaging in 
emergency renourishment work, Army Corps will continue in accordance 
with the Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point (FIMP) project schedule. 
With project renourishment set to take place every few years, we are 
left in limbo with respect to when that federal assistance can be 
provided between scheduled renourishment periods.
    Each passing storm increases the damage to our shoreline. Just this 
Tuesday, the Town of Babylon notified my office that heavy rainfall had 
eroded their local beaches so badly that a playground and pavilion 
structure were close to being compromised. The day after, I was 
notified the playground is now unusable and the water has made its way 
to the pavilion structure. Timely renourishment is necessary to prevent 
further deterioration. Our communities in Massapequa are similarly 
threatened by erosion. In the last two years, the Town of Oyster Bay 
has spent over $3 million to purchase sand and rebuild Tobay Beach. 
Without this investment, Tobay would have been compromised as well.
    The longer we leave these problems unchecked, the greater the 
probability that Long Island will require increased support for 
infrastructure resiliency projects. If we can address this problem 
quickly, we can avoid having to address even greater damage in the 
future.
    To address this issue, I will be submitting proposed authorization 
language that would allow renourishment to occur following nor'easters 
affecting the Fire Island National Seashore and neighboring hamlets in 
between scheduled periods. My submission is based off a similar

    It is my hope that this year's WRDA can provide Long Island 
residents with the assistance they so desperately require. Thank you 
for the opportunity to highlight this incredibly important issue.

    Mr. Garbarino. I yield back.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. Any 
questions for the gentleman?
    Seeing none, thank you again.
    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you.
    Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Lee, you are recognized for up to 5 
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SUSIE LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                      THE STATE OF NEVADA

    Ms. Lee of Nevada. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Napolitano, for holding today's hearing and for 
this opportunity to highlight three top priorities for Nevada's 
Third Congressional District as you continue to craft the Water 
Resources Development Act of 2024.
    No one knows better than a Nevadan just how precious our 
Nation's water resources truly are, especially in southern 
Nevada, where we get about 90 percent of our water from the 
Colorado River. For the community of Laughlin specifically, 
located in the rural, most southern part of my district, that 
number jumps to 100 percent.
    Laughlin's water treatment and delivery system is the only 
such system managed by the Las Vegas Valley Water District that 
both lacks a secondary water source and lags in water storage 
capacity. This would already be concerning enough, if not 
compounded by the fact that Laughlin, like many communities in 
the Southwest, continues to have to contend with the effects of 
the worst drought in at least 1,200 years.
    My first request is for authorizing urgent environmental 
infrastructure assistance for Laughlin's water system in the 
WRDA 2024 to facilitate the construction of additional storage 
tanks to ensure adequate reserves, fire flow, and system 
redundancy, as well as the construction of a new groundwater 
well to provide a secondary source for the Laughlin community 
to be able to meet emergency water needs.
    I am also asking that this year's WRDA bill include my 
legislation to raise the funding cap on the Las Vegas Wash 
system. The Las Vegas Wash is the primary drainage channel for 
the Las Vegas Valley watershed, carrying about 200 million 
gallons of water to Lake Mead every single day, a key resource 
that makes it possible for southern Nevada to recycle nearly 
every drop of water that goes down our drains.
    The federally backed Las Vegas Wash Program has been 
essential to protecting and enhancing the wash by supporting 
erosion control efforts, as well as biological and other 
restoration activities. Originally authorized more than two 
decades ago in WRDA 2000, raising the program's funding cap in 
WRDA 2024 will ensure that vital Federal assistance for the 
wash can continue.
    And finally, I am pleased to join Ranking Member Napolitano 
in seeking to elevate water supply and water conservation to 
primary mission areas in the U.S. Corps of Engineers. For too 
long, these priorities, which only grow more pressing for 
southern Nevada with each passing day, have been regarded as 
ancillary or secondary to other responsibilities of the Corps 
such as navigation and flood control.
    Requiring the Corps to give water supply and conservation 
equal priority moving forward will strengthen numerous 
initiatives that stand to benefit Nevada, the West, and the 
country as a whole, including measures to promote the use of 
innovative technologies and practices such as forecast-informed 
reservoir operations and managed aquifer recovery to maximize 
the availability of water supply opportunities and the 
development of drought contingency plans for communities served 
by the Corps water supply projects.
    Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Napolitano, 
for the opportunity to appear today on this critical 
legislation.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Susie Lee, a Representative in Congress From

    Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, for

yield back the balance of my time.

    Ms. Lee of Nevada. And with that, I yield the balance of my 
time.
    Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady. Are there any questions 
or comments?
    Mrs. Napolitano. No questions, but just a comment, Mr. 
Chair.
    Thank you, Mrs. Lee, for supporting that mission that we 
have asked the Corps to take on, and we hope more Members come 
aboard because it is something that is really necessary for the 
whole country. Thank you.
    Ms. Lee of Nevada. I will be carrying the torch in your 
absence. Thank you.
    Mr. Rouzer. We thank the gentlelady.
    Ms. Schultz, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and 
Ranking Member Napolitano. I appreciate the opportunity to have 
this chance to share how vital the Water Resources Development 
Act is to America's communities, and especially for Floridians.
    The Army Corps of Engineers has major ongoing projects 
throughout south Florida, from restoring the Everglades and 
investing in our ports, to fighting rising seas by nourishing 
beaches and managing flood risk. Obviously, the Corps' work is 
vital to Florida on many urgent fronts.
    The first item I want to bring to the committee's attention 
is the Western Everglades Restoration Project. Within the 
boundaries of the Western Everglades is reservation land that 
is home to the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribe of Florida. You 
will also find Big Cypress National Preserve and a portion of 
Everglades National Park there. With this watershed providing 
40 percent of the water flowing into Everglades National Park 
and Florida Bay, it is crucial to authorize the construction of 
this project in WRDA.
    To meet the Biden administration's ambitious goals for 
reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, it is imperative that 
we adopt a comprehensive approach. One effective lever within 
reach is the optimization of fuel efficiency in the Corps' 
existing vehicle fleet. And we don't need to invest billions in 
new boats and vessels to achieve this.
    By incorporating real-time emissions measurements and 
recommending operational and technical efficiency improvements, 
we can achieve substantial cost savings for American taxpayers 
while also contributing to environmental conservation. I 
propose that we include language in this WRDA encouraging the 
Corps to consider investing in this new technology and to brief 
Congress on potential opportunities to leverage this technology 
in the future.
    Next, I want to highlight that the Corps recently 
implemented new shore protection policy guidelines. The beach 
renourishment work the Corps performs along our Nation's 
coastlines is invaluable to our local communities, especially 
in south Florida. A wide, nourished beach system absorbs wave 
energy, protects upland areas from flooding, and mitigates 
erosion.
    Before the Corps performs work, they need easements from 
adjacent landowners. That makes sense; we don't want to strip 
landowners of their property rights. But the Corps changed 
their policy and now requires non-Federal sponsors to acquire 
perpetual construction easements from 100 percent--100 
percent--of the upland owners within a project footprint. This 
is a different interpretation than was used in the past 20 to 
30 years, and it has placed a number of projects in Broward 
County and around the country at risk because getting these 
easements can be difficult.
    I ask the committee to work with the Corps on finding a 
solution moving forward that works for everyone, because we 
cannot let these important projects stall and fail. The Corps' 
current interpretation of congressional intent is not accurate 
and was not the interpretation they used for decades. We cannot 
bring vital beach renourishment to a screeching halt.
    The last issue I want to bring to the committee's attention 
is Everglades restoration work performed by the Corps. I ask 
the committee to include language authorizing the Corps to 
continue to use and implement the incremental funding clause 
for large CERP projects like the EAA Reservoir. Using 
incremental funding demonstrably reduces project delivery 
timelines and costs, saving American taxpayer dollars while 
also preserving America's Everglades.
    Additionally, I ask the committee to direct the Corps to 
provide a report to Congress on the modifications that were 
made to the design of the EAA Reservoir, including the depth 
and size of the reservoir and why such modifications were 
necessary.
    I appreciate the work you put into this legislation, and 
that you give Members an opportunity to provide input and 
feedback in advance of the development of the WRDA bill, and I 
look forward to helping you pass this bill yet again this year. 
Thank you both so much.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARY E. MILLER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Chairman Graves and Ranking Member 
Larsen, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of 
Illinois' 15th Congressional District. I am here today to speak 
in support of my bill, H.R. 5722, the Upper Mississippi River 
Levee Safety Act, which I strongly urge the committee to 
consider in the Water Resources Development Act of 2024.
    Levees along the upper Mississippi River protect countless 
homes and thousands of acres of farmland from flooding. They 
are essential to residents, farmers, and business owners who 
live and work along the upper Mississippi. This legislation 
would give local levee districts along the upper Mississippi 
River more flexibility to maintain their systems and allow them 
to better prepare for future flooding by addressing the Federal 
regulatory challenges that make levee maintenance and 
improvements difficult.
    This bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers to issue more 
frequent design standard updates, which will help levee 
districts better respond to changing rain and flood patterns. 
This complements the investments already made by Congress and 
affirms congressional intent in how the Army Corps regulates 
levee operators along the upper Mississippi River.
    I am pleased to be joined on this bill on a bipartisan 
basis by several of my colleagues in the Illinois delegation 
and on this committee. This legislation has the support of 
regional stakeholders, including the Upper Mississippi, 
Illinois, and Missouri Rivers Association; the Illinois Farm 
Bureau; and Corn Belt Ports; as well as local leaders in my 
district.
    Again, I thank you for your consideration and the chance to 
speak here today. I urge the committee to give this measure 
strong consideration as it works to draft WRDA 2024, and I look 
forward to working with my colleagues to address these issues, 
which are critically important to Illinois and every State in 
the upper Mississippi region. Thank you.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. RICK W. ALLEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chairman James and Ranking Member 
Larsen, for the opportunity to provide this testimony and 
highlight priorities for the Water Resources Development Act 
that are critical to the 12th Congressional District of 
Georgia--namely, the consistent issues we have experienced with 
the Corps of Engineers regarding the New Savannah Bluff Lock 
and Dam, or, in short, lock and dam.
    Many of you probably recall that I have testified before 
this committee in years past multiple times, which should also 
underscore the importance of the lock and dam to the residents 
of my district and the city of Augusta.
    I want to thank Congressman Mike Collins for raising this 
issue in the T&I hearing in June with the Corps of Engineers. I 
would also like to thank Congressman Hank Johnson for being a 
willing partner on this issue in the past, as well.
    Due to environmental mitigation from the Savannah Harbor 
Expansion Project, or SHEP, the Corps is responsible for 
constructing a mitigation feature that would allow sturgeon and 
other endangered fish to access new spawning grounds. Dating 
back to the 1930s, the Savannah Lock and Dam was originally 
authorized for navigation purposes. But after it was no longer 
used for commercial navigation, many of the Central Savannah 
River Area's largest job creators and municipalities continue 
to draw from the pool that the lock and dam was designed to 
maintain.
    In the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the 
Nation, or WIIN Act, the language required the fish passage 
structure to maintain the pool for navigation, water supply, 
and recreational activities, as in existence on the date of 
enactment of this act. The Corps selected a rock weir as an 
alternative to replace the lock and dam, which I strongly 
opposed, as it would drop the pool level far below the needs of 
the community. Lowering the pool does not meet the requirements 
in the WIIN Act and is unacceptable, in addition to possible 
flooding--definitely flooding--downstream.
    In a disastrous simulation carried out by the Corps, we saw 
firsthand the dreadful impacts of the lower water level that 
would result from the installation of a rock weir. We saw 
marooned boats and docks on the ground, to excess debris, 
mudflats, the riverbanks caving in, and these businesses not 
able to draw the water they need, and the cities not able to 
draw the water they need to manufacture their products and to 
provide for their citizens.
    To my relief, the United States District Court of South 
Carolina ruled against the Corps' proposed plan to remove the 
lock and dam in favor of the rock weir. However, the appeals 
court remanded the case back to the district court for further 
action, placing us back in legal limbo. So, we have to do this 
legislatively.
    Throughout this tenuous process, Congressman Joe Wilson and 
I have worked closely with local community leaders and 
stakeholders who have all agreed that maintaining the water 
level of the pool above the lock and dam is critical, so our 
water users are not affected. The cities of Augusta and North 
Augusta, as well as Richmond and Aiken Counties, have come 
together supporting resolutions to protect the lock and dam and 
maintain the pool at the level of 114.5 feet.
    If the committee takes anything away from my testimony 
today, it should be this: the Corps is not in compliance with 
the WIIN Act law by choosing an alternative that does not 
maintain the pool at the 114.5 foot level, as it was in 
December of 2016 when the law was enacted, despite repeated 
bicameral reiterations of congressional intent. I urge the 
committee to work with me to include language that will repair 
and maintain the lock and dam and keep the pool level that our 
community desperately needs, while still accommodating a fish 
passage required by SHEP.
    I would also like to flag for the committee another WRDA 
priority of mine. I am seeking a new feasibility study 
authorization or a modification to an existing study 
authorization to examine the benefit of further widening and 
deepening the harbor of the Port of Savannah to better 
accommodate today's commercial demands and to prepare for 
meeting tomorrow's trade needs.
    Thank you again to the committee for holding this Member 
Day, and I look forward to continuing to work with you on this 
issue.

New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam, or in short, the Lock and Dam. I'd 
also like to thank my colleague from Georgia, Representative Collins, 
for raising this issue with the Committee.
    Many of you may recall that I have testified before this committee 
in years past on this very issue, which should only underscore the 
importance of the Lock and Dam to the residents of my district.
    I want to thank Congressman Mike Collins for raising this issue in 
a T&I hearing in June, with the Corps of Engineers, and would also like 
to thank Congressman Hank Johnson for being a willing partner on this 
issue in the past, too.
    Due to environmental mitigation from the Savannah Harbor Expansion 
Project, or SHEP, the Corps is responsible for constructing a 
mitigation feature that would allow sturgeon and other endangered fish 
to access their historic spawning grounds above the Lock and Dam near 
Augusta, Georgia.
    Dating back to the 1930s, the dam was originally authorized for 
navigation purposes, but after it was no longer used for commercial 
navigation, many of the Central Savannah River Area's largest job 
creators and municipalities draw from the pool that the Lock and Dam 
has created.
    In the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation, or 
WIIN, Act, the language required the fish passage structure to 
``maintain the pool for navigation, water supply, and recreational 
activities, as in existence on the date of enactment of this Act'' for 
either a ``repair of the lock wall of the New Savannah Bluff Lock and 
Dam and modification of the structure'' or ``removal of the New 
Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam on completion of construction of the [fish 
passage] structure.''
    The Corps selected a rock weir as an alternative to replace the 
Lock and Dam, which I strongly opposed as it would drop the pool level 
far below the needs of the community. Lowering the pool does not meet 
the requirements outlined in the WIIN Act and is unacceptable.
    Additionally, in a disastrous simulation carried out by the Corps, 
we saw firsthand the dreadful impacts of the lower water level that 
would result from the installation of a rock weir. From marooned boats 
and docks to excess debris and mudflats exposed throughout the river, 
the Corps was forced to abandon the simulation due to instability on 
the riverbank.
    To my relief, the United States District Court of South Carolina 
later ruled against the Corps' proposed plan to remove the Lock and Dam 
in favor of the rock weir. However, the appeals court remanded the case 
back to the district court for further action, placing us back in legal 
limbo.
    Throughout this tenuous process, Congressman Joe Wilson and I have 
worked closely with local community leaders and stakeholders who have 
all agreed that maintaining the water level of the pool above the Lock 
and Dam is critical, so our water users are not affected. The Cities of 
Augusta and North Augusta, as well as Richmond and Aiken Counties, have 
come together supporting resolutions to protect the Lock and Dam and 
maintain the pool at the level of 114.5 feet.
    If the committee takes anything away from my testimony today it 
should be this: the Corps is not in compliance with the WIIN Act law by 
choosing an alternative that does not maintain the pool at the 114.5 
level as it was in December of 2016 when the law was enacted, despite 
repeated bicameral reiterations of Congressional intent.
    I urge the committee to work with me to include language that will 
repair and maintain the Lock and Dam and keep the pool level that our 
community needs, while still accommodating the modest fish passage 
required by SHEP.
    I would also like to flag for the committee a WRDA priority of 
mine. I am seeking a new feasibility study authorization or 
modification to an existing study authorization to examine the benefit 
of both widening and deepening the harbor at the Port of Savannah to 
better accommodate today's commercial demands and to prepare for 
meeting tomorrow's trade needs.
    Thank you again to the committee for holding this member day and I 
look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.

    Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Allen.
    Do any members of our committee have any questions for our 
witness?
    Hearing none, thank you, sir. You are dismissed. The Chair 
now recognizes Mr. Soto.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. DARREN SOTO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Mr. Soto. Thank you, Chairman James and Ranking Member 
Napolitano, for the opportunity to talk about our WRDA projects 
this year. I bring you greetings from central Florida, the home 
of the northern Everglades.
    As many people may know, the Everglades starts all the way 
in Orange County and flows through the Shingle Creek, through 
the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes, down through Kissimmee River to 
Lake Okeechobee, and then forms the national park that we all 
know, love, and endear. And this is a critical area for water 
quality, for agriculture, wildlife corridors, recreation, and 
navigation.
    The first project I would like to brief you on is the 
Northern Lake Tohopekaliga Restoration and Water Quality 
Improvement Project. This is part of the Kissimmee Chain of 
Lakes, and it is there to improve flood storage, and reduce 
nutrient and sediment flow into the upper Kissimmee Basin and 
the Lake Okeechobee watershed.
    And I would be remiss if I did not mention in Hurricane 
Irma and in Hurricane Ian, we saw these water systems tested to 
the limit and then some, with flooding affecting many 
neighborhoods throughout central Florida. And as we see 
hurricanes getting more intense, it's very important that we 
continue to keep these water systems up to the capacity that 
they need to protect so many central Florida residents.
    The area is also home to the Kissimmee River, which was the 
largest river restoration in the history of the world, a 
bipartisan $1 billion project to restore the Kissimmee River to 
make sure water is clean going into the southern Everglades 
region.
    The second project is the Sediment and Debris Management 
Program and Feasibility Study for East Lake Tohopekaliga, Boggy 
Creek, and its tributaries to improve water flows and reduce 
flooding, and help with sediment and debris management also in 
the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes part of this area.
    The third is a request through the Central Florida Water 
Initiative, which is a bipartisan initiative for water supply 
in central Florida to create alternative water supply projects. 
This one includes the St. Johns River/Taylor Creek Reservoir 
Alternative Water Supply Project to increase local water supply 
beyond what is currently available through permitted 
groundwater. Right now we get most of our water through the 
aquifer, but we need to establish more reservoirs. The beauty 
is, this reservoir was already made eligible for water storage 
in past WRDA bills, and now this would be about expanding this 
reservoir to help out, particularly, agriculture and central 
Florida homes.
    The reservoir is the foundation for developing subsequent 
phases of the project such as the treatment plant. It also 
would serve central Florida residents in Brevard, Orange, and 
Osceola Counties, where I and Representative Bill Posey 
represent. And it is part of the regional partnership to supply 
up to 54 million gallons per day in annual average daily flow 
of treated surface water for public supply.
    The next project is Lake Conway, which is north of East 
Lake Toho and connects through Boggy Creek, and is just north 
of the Orlando International Airport, one of the biggest 
airports in the Nation. This would be for debris removal and 
environmental restoration including water quality improvement. 
We saw during Hurricane Ian that Lake Conway flooded and East 
Lake Toho flooded, and we literally had to hold water in Lake 
Conway for days to make sure we didn't have even worse 
flooding. And so, all these systems, as you see throughout many 
of these water systems in the Nation, are all interconnected.
    And lastly, to expand the Regional Sediment Management 
Program. We can navigate all the way to the ocean and beyond 
through the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes, through the Kissimmee 
River and out Lake Okeechobee. And so, making sure that we 
could help both the waterways, as well as use this sand that 
they pull out for navigation for beach renourishment in Florida 
and other areas, we can make this work in multiple ways.
    So, thank you, Chairman James. Thank you, Ranking Member 
Napolitano, for your time today. I really appreciate it.
    [Mr. Soto's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Darren Soto, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Florida
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for allowing me 
to testify before the Committee about my priorities for the Water 
Resources Development Act of 2024.
    Among the requests I am making is to expand and build upon the Army 
Corp of Engineers' existing authority to create a Florida-specific 
program that removes sedimentary shoals in Florida waterways and 
relocates the pristine sand from the shoals to renourish sandy beaches 
along the Florida coast. Additionally, I request making Osceola 
County's chain of lakes, rivers, and tributaries be a priority for this 
program.
    In terms of projects, I request the authorization of a feasibility 
study for East Lake Tohopekaliga, Boggy Creek, and their connected 
tributaries for sediment and debris management. My environmental 
infrastructure requests include:
    <bullet>  The Northern Lake Tohopekaliga Restoration and Water 
Quality Improvement Project, which would allow for flood storage and 
reduction of nutrient and sediment flow to the Upper Kissimmee Basin of 
the Lake Okeechobee Watershed.

    <bullet>  The Historic Whitted Neighborhood Sewer Connection, which 
would connect to the City of St. Cloud's sewer system and provide safe 
and reliable wastewater disposal to approximately 52 residents within 
the historic African American Whitted Neighborhood located in the 
Narcoossee area of Osceola County, FL.

    <bullet>  Creation of a Sediment and Debris Management program for 
East Lake Tohopekaliga, Boggy Creek, and Tributaries to improve flood 
conveyance. Natural sediment flows through East Lake Tohopekaliga are 
restricted by controlled water flows resulting in navigational 
impairments, reduction of surface area in the lake for recreation and 
crucial littoral habitat, increased flood stages upstream, and 
increased nuisance vegetation.

    <bullet>  The St. Johns River/Taylor Creek Reservoir (TCR) 
Alternative Water Supply Project, which aims to meet future water 
supply demands beyond permitted groundwater supplies, serving Central 
Florida residents in portions of Brevard County, Orange County, and 
Osceola County. This reservoir/levee construction is the foundation for 
developing subsequent phases of the project, including transmission 
mains, pumping, and a treatment plant.

    <bullet>  Alternative water supply projects in the Central Florida 
Water Initiative area that provide regional benefits to Toho Water 
Authority and its member governments and Orange County Utilities. The 
project is in eastern Orange and Osceola Counties and is being 
implemented as a regional partnership between Orange County, Orlando 
Utilities Commission, City of Cocoa, East Central Florida Services, and 
Toho Water Authority to supply up to 54 million gallons per day (MGD) 
annual average daily flow of treated surface water for public supply.

    <bullet>  Lake Conway environmental restoration, flood control, and 
debris removal, including water quality improvement, to mitigate future 
flooding and clear the lake of existing invasive species such as 
hydrilla.

    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Larsen, I look forward to working with 
you to advance my priorities in this bill and I welcome any questions 
you may have. Thank you and I yield back.

    Mr. James. Thank you, Representative Soto.
    Do any members of our committee have any questions for our 
witness?
    Thank you. Hearing none, sir, you are dismissed.
    Representative Bobby Scott, your time is 5 minutes, sir.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE 
         IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA

    Mr. Scott of Virginia. Thank you, Chairman James, Ranking 
Member Napolitano, and members of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
discuss the priorities of Virginia's Third Congressional 
District in the upcoming Water Resources Development Act.
    I represent Virginia's Third Congressional District, where 
the Chesapeake Bay meets the James and Elizabeth Rivers, and 
where water represents both challenges and opportunities. The 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works to keep America's waterways 
and ports open to trade while working with communities across 
Hampton Roads to ensure that we can continue to live with the 
water surrounding us and shaping many aspects of our lives.
    In my home district is the Port of Virginia, which is one 
of the largest and busiest ports on the eastern seaboard. With 
95 percent of our Nation's trade moving by water, it is 
essential that the port, which is the third largest container 
port in the country and supports nearly 1.3 million jobs 
nationally, is able to maintain operations.
    The Third Congressional District is also home to multiple 
shipyards and the Norfolk Naval Station, the largest naval base 
in the world. These waterways are essential to our communities' 
continued prosperity as well as our national security.
    It is also critical to our financial well-being that we 
ensure that the Port of Virginia is able to handle an increased 
number and size of container vehicles. The port and the Army 
Corps of Engineers have undertaken the dredging, widening, and 
deepening of the Norfolk Harbor and channels to ensure safe and 
efficient two-way passage for the new, larger containerships.
    And I would like to take a moment to thank the members of 
the committee for their work with the Port of Virginia which 
allowed it to continue operations, especially at a time when 
shipping delays plagued many other ports across the country.
    As the committee begins its drafting of the 2024 Water 
Resources Development Act, I respectfully request that the 
committee include a modification of the Norfolk Harbor and 
Channels Navigation Project to include the deepening of 
Anchorage F. This modification is consistent with the 
recommendations of the Army Corps of Engineers and will ensure 
that the port's reliability and efficacy is not interrupted.
    My district is also the home of the city of Norfolk, which 
has been a leader in ensuring that the city can manage the 
surrounding rising water and is already serving as an example 
to other municipalities working to adapt to climate change. 
Unfortunately, due to climate-driven sea level rise compounded 
by historic land subsidence in the region, inundation from 
these waterways poses a serious risk. High tides, nor'easters, 
and hurricanes exacerbate the risk of flooding in the city of 
Norfolk and around the region. As the home of the Norfolk Naval 
Station and numerous other Federal and military facilities, 
this recurrent flooding poses a national security risk.
    And I would like to again thank the committee for moving 
the Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management Project forward, as 
well as the Virginia Peninsula Flood Study.
    State and local officials in Virginia already appreciate 
the significant threat of sea level rise. Unfortunately, the 
cost of proactively and aggressively addressing this problem 
head-on is far too great for the city to bear by itself, and we 
need continued support from the Federal Government. To that 
end, I am requesting that the committee add the city of Norfolk 
to the Temporary Relocation Assistance Pilot Program due to the 
ongoing Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management Project. This 
would allow Norfolk to join other communities in extending 
temporary relocation assistance to those who are impacted by 
the nonstructural program of the Norfolk project. These 
nonstructural adaptations are to individual buildings in 
communities that are vulnerable to flood risk.
    And finally, I request that the committee include language 
authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to include Federal 
lands in their coastal resiliency studies. As I have mentioned 
earlier, Hampton Roads is surrounded by water and home to 
numerous Federal facilities and military infrastructure, and 
these areas would be included in these studies. Our area, our 
region is a perfect example of why comprehensively studying 
flooding is essential, and how we can only resolve the coastal 
resilience puzzle when we are able to consider all of the 
pieces. We have to include all of them, including the Federal 
agencies.
    So, Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you for the 
opportunity to share my priorities for the forthcoming Water 
Resources Development Act of 2024, and I look forward to 
working with you as we continue this critical work. Thank you.
    [Mr. Scott of Virginia's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott, a Representative 
             in Congress From the Commonwealth of Virginia
    Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano and members of the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to discuss the priorities of Virginia's third district in 
the upcoming Water Resources Development (WRDA) Act.
    I represent the 3rd congressional district of Virginia where the 
Chesapeake Bay meets the James and Elizabeth Rivers, and where water 
presents both challenges and opportunities. The U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers work to keep America's waterways and ports open to trade, 
while working with communities across Hampton Roads to ensure that we

national security risk. I would like to again thank the Committee for 
moving the Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management project forward as 
well as the Virginia Peninsula Flood Study.
    State and local elected officials in Virginia already appreciate 
the significant threat sea level rise poses to Hampton Roads. 
Unfortunately, the cost to proactively and aggressively address this 
problem head-on is far too great for any city to bear by itself. While 
Norfolk has already spent considerable sums of money to study its 
recurrent flooding issues and implement resilient infrastructure where 
feasible, the cost of the entire project is in the billions of dollars. 
Both the Commonwealth and the Federal government have been supportive 
of the need and I look forward to continued support and partnership.
    To that end, I am requesting that the Committee add the City of 
Norfolk to the Temporary Relocation Assistance Pilot Program, due to 
the ongoing Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) project. This 
would allow Norfolk to join other communities in extending temporary 
relocation assistance to those that are impacted by the nonstructural 
program of the Norfolk CSRM project. These nonstructural adaptations 
are to individual buildings in communities that are vulnerable to flood 
risk.
    Finally, I request that the Committee include language authorizing

comprehensively addressing flooding is essential to coastal resilience. 
We can only solve the coastal resilience puzzle when we are able to 
consider all the pieces. Including all implicated land in a study is 
the only way to ensure the study is comprehensive, cost effective and 
accurate.
    Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you again for the opportunity to 
share my priorities for the forthcoming Water Resources Development Act 
of 2024. I look forward to working with you to ensure that these 
priorities are included to allow for the critical work in Hampton Roads 
to continue.

    Mr. James. Thank you, sir.
    Do any members of our committee have any questions for our 
witness?
    Thank you, brother Scott, you are dismissed.
    Mr. Scott of Virginia. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. TERRI A. SEWELL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA

    Ms. Sewell. I want to thank the distinguished members of 
the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for the 
opportunity to submit testimony before you today.
    As you draft the Water Resources Development Act, otherwise 
known as WRDA, of 2024, I would like to request an adjustment 
to the non-Federal cost share for the construction of the Selma 
Flood Risk Management and Bank Stabilization Project that was 
authorized in the 2022 WRDA bill.
    Flooding caused by various storms and hurricanes in recent 
years has caused severe river erosion in the historic downtown 
of Selma, Alabama. Not only is it in my district, it is also my 
beloved hometown.
    As a result of the storms, many buildings along the 
riverbank have become structurally compromised, and some 
buildings have already collapsed into the Alabama River. Army 
Corps of Engineers officials from the Mobile office warned that 
the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge could be threatened if the 
river erosion is not addressed immediately.
    As the site of the historic Bloody Sunday and the Selma to 
Montgomery March of 1965, the preservation of the historic 
Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Selma riverfront is not only 
important to the city of Selma, but also this Nation. Every 
year, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress make the 
pilgrimage to Selma, Alabama, to retrace the steps of our 
beloved John Lewis across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to reflect 
on the role that the people of Selma played in the advancement 
of our great democracy. This history must be preserved.
    As authorized in the WRDA 2022 bill, the Selma Flood Risk 
Management and Bank Stabilization Project will reduce the risk 
of the failure of 10 historic structures along the riverbank, 
protect the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and provide a response for 
imminent flooding events in the future.
    The problem is that the non-Federal sponsor, the city of 
Selma, simply cannot afford the $9.26 million cost share that 
is currently required for this construction project. The median 
income in Selma is only $31,000 a year, and 30 percent of Selma 
residents live in poverty. The city clearly meets the 
definition of an economically disadvantaged community according 
to the implementation guidelines and guidance of the WRDA 2020 
bill.
    Moreover, tomorrow marks the 1-year anniversary of the 
severe thunderstorms and tornadoes that caused destruction 
across my district, including the city of Selma. This disaster 
placed an unprecedented financial burden on the city of Selma 
to begin recovery and rebuilding efforts from this tornado 
storm.
    Simply put, if the current cost structure is not addressed, 
this desperately needed Army Corps of Engineers project will be 
significantly delayed, and the severe erosion along the Alabama 
River will continue. More historic buildings will collapse into 
the Alabama River, and the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge 
structural integrity will remain under threat. Not only do the 
residents of Selma deserve to be protected from flooding, but 
the Nation deserves to have this historic, significant site 
protected.
    I thank the committee for your consideration of my request, 
and I look forward to working with all of you to resolve this 
issue as we face the 2024 WRDA bill.

continue, more historic buildings will collapse into the river, and the 
historic Edmund Pettus Bridge's structural integrity will remain under 
threat.
    Not only do the residents of Selma deserve to be protected from 
flooding, but the nation deserves to have this historically significant 
site protected. I thank the committee for your consideration of my 
request, and I look forward to working with all of you to resolve this 
issue in the 2024 Water Resources Development Act.

    Mr. James. Thank you, Madam.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. KATIE PORTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms. Porter. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member 
Napolitano, for holding this hearing so that Members can share 
our water infrastructure priorities for this year's Water 
Resources Development Act.
    The WRDA process provides a unique opportunity for Members 
to deliver Federal priorities and projects that guarantee 
consistent and ample clean drinking water, and even help 
constituents avoid devastating flooding. That is exactly what 
my requests do, and I strongly urge this committee--and I know 
that they will--give them full and fair consideration.
    The Westminster-East Garden Grove Flood Risk Management, or 
WEGG, Project was authorized in 2020 to reduce the risk to 
life, safety, and property from flooding in Orange County due 
to current deficiencies of flood control channels. The WEGG 
Project is anticipated to protect 1 million residents, 24,000 
at-risk structures, U.S. military operations, and critical 
transportation infrastructure from $5.45 billion in damage. The 
project will also save Orange County residents from 
collectively paying approximately $3.7 million annually in 
flood insurance premiums.
    However, the WEGG Project cannot access Federal funding, 
and its supposed Federal cost share is not enough to help the 
county prepare 74 square miles for storm readiness. That is why 
I am requesting that this committee authorize the Orange County 
Flood Control District and the county of Orange to enter into a 
project partnership agreement so that the WEGG Project can 
access available Federal funds.
    I also request that this committee increase the county's 
cost share ratio to 50 percent for the project's implementation 
to improve the flood control and the protection of this highly 
urbanized, at-risk area.
    The next project is one that many southern Californians 
know, the Santa Ana River Mainstem/Prado Dam Project, or SARP. 
SARP is designed to provide flood protection to more than 3.35 
million people in Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino 
Counties. Most of the construction work is finished, but it 
still needs funding to acquire additional lands for the 
expansion of the Prado Reservoir, installation of protective 
dikes, and raising the spillway.
    If these upgrades aren't made, then the surrounding area 
could see more than $40 billion in economic losses. That is why 
I am requesting that this committee authorize the Army Corps of 
Engineers to approve new project appraisals that cost more than 
$1.5 million and to reimburse the county for amended project 
agreements when new easements are acquired. These requests are 
necessary for the project's completion and to safeguard 
millions of residents from flooding.
    Finally, I want to highlight my support for a critical 
drought resilience program in southern California. The 
forecast-informed reservoir operations, or F-I-R-O, FIRO, 
program has supported watershed monitoring and modern weather 
forecasting to capture stormwater at Prado Dam efficiently. It 
is really a success story of how to balance flood risk 
management, water supply, and water resiliency. And I know that 
Ranking Member Napolitano has done so much to champion this 
project.
    It should not be surprising to hear that California still 
struggles with drought. Our snowfall and rainfall this year is 
already very low, and because of climate change, the Sierra 
Nevada snowpack right now, today, is at its lowest level in 20 
years. So, we are now at a point where we need to be looking at 
solutions amid a major water crisis in the West. And programs 
like FIRO are a significant step in the right direction, and 
they have been proven already to be successful.
    Lake Mendocino, for example, in northern California, saw an 
increase to its reservoir storage by 20 percent through FIRO, 
and now Prado Dam, especially with atmospheric river events, 
has been able to significantly reduce flood risk for Orange 
County while also creating significant levels of water 
conservation.
    So, I respectfully request that this committee include the 
projects I have spoken for in support of today in its 
reauthorization. I know that you share my desire to make sure 
that every American is safe from ecological and economic 
disasters, and that all of our constituents are protected from 
the harmful effects of lasting drought.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Katie Porter, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, for 
holding this hearing so that members can share our water infrastructure 
priorities for this year's Water Resources Development Act.
    The WRDA process provides a unique opportunity for members to 
deliver federal projects that guarantee consistent and ample clean 
drinking water and even help constituents avoid devastating flooding.
    That's exactly what my requests do, and I strongly urge this 
committee to give them full and fair consideration.
    The Westminster-East Garden Grove Flood Risk Management (WEGG) 
project was authorized in 2020 to reduce the risks of life, safety, and 
property from flooding in Orange County due to current deficiencies of 
flood control channels. The WEGG project is anticipated to protect one 
million residents, 24,000 at-risk structures, U.S. military operations 
and critical transportation infrastructure from $5.45 billion in 
damage. The project will also save Orange County residents from 
collectively paying approximately $3.7 million annually in flood 
insurance premiums.
    However, the project cannot access federal funding and its supposed 
federal cost-share is not enough to help the County prepare 74 square 
miles for storm readiness.
    That is why I am requesting that this committee authorize the 
Orange County Flood Control District and the County of Orange to enter 
into a Project Partnership Agreement so that the WEGG project can 
access available federal funds. I also request that this committee 
increase the County's cost-share ratio to 50 percent for the project's 
implementation to improve the flood control and protection of highly 
urbanized, at-risk areas.
    The next project is one that many Southern Californians know--the 
Santa Ana River Mainstem, Prado Dam Project, or SARP. SARP is designed 
to provide flood protection to more than 3.35 million people in Orange, 
Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.
    Most of the construction work is finished, but it still needs 
funding to acquire additional lands for the expansion of the Prado 
reservoir, installation of protective dikes, and raising the spillway. 
If these upgrades aren't made, then the surrounding area could see more 
than $40 billion in economic losses.
    That is why I am requesting that this committee authorizes the Army 
Corps of Engineers to approve new project appraisals that cost higher 
than $1.5 million and reimburse the county for amended project 
agreements when new easements are acquired. These requests are 
necessary for the project's completion and to safeguard millions of 
residents from flooding.
    Finally, I want to highlight my support for a critical, drought 
resilience program in Southern California. The Forecast-Informed 
Reservoir Operations (FIRO) Program has been supporting watershed 
monitoring and modern weather forecasting to efficiently capture 
stormwater at Prado Dam. It has also a success story of how to balance 
flood-risk management, water supply, and water resiliency.
    It should not be surprising to hear that California still struggles 
with drought. Because of climate change, the Sierra Nevada snowpack--a 
critical piece of Californian water delivery--is at its lowest levels 
in 20 years.
    We are now at a point where we need to be looking at solutions amid 
a major water crisis in the west. Programs like FIRO are a significant 
step in the right direction and have proven success.
    Lake Mendocino in northern California saw an increase to its 
reservoir storage by 20 percent through FIRO and now Prado Dam, 
especially with atmospheric river events, has been able to reduce flood 
risk for Orange County while also balancing significant levels of water 
conservation.
    I respectfully request that this committee include the projects 
I've spoken in support of today in its reauthorization. Let's make sure 
that every American is safe from ecological and economic disasters and 
protect our constituents from lasting drought.
    I yield back.

    Ms. Porter. I yield back.
    Mr. James. Thank you, ma'am.
    Do any Members have any questions for Ms. Porter?
    [Pause.]
    Mr. James. Thank you for your time.
    The committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 1:31 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]


 
                       Submissions for the Record

                              ----------                              


Prepared Statement of Hon. Gabe Amo, a Representative in Congress From 
                       the State of Rhode Island
    Chairs Sam Graves and David Rouzer and Ranking Members Rick Larsen 
and Grace Napolitano, I thank the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of 
the below priorities of Rhode Island's First Congressional District for 
the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.
    Each WRDA is important to ensuring the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(Corps) fulfills its mission. If drafted with the below priorities, 
this upcoming WRDA would help strengthen water resource infrastructure 
in Rhode Island and across our nation by energizing our economy, 
supporting resiliency projects and initiatives, creating good-paying 
jobs, protecting our environment and modernizing our water 
infrastructure.
    Given the increased threat that the climate crisis poses, the 
mission of the Corps is more important than ever to protect our coastal 
communities. There remains an increased risk of extreme weather events 
such as floods, hurricanes, and storms that continue to threaten our 
economy and the lives of Rhode Islanders.
    According to the latest data from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced direct 
losses from 18 separate billion-dollar disasters total[ing] over $170 
billion in 2022.\1\ This worrying trend grew in 2023 to 25 confirmed 
weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each 
to affect the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Coastal communities like those in Rhode Island are facing 
unprecedented risk from these threats, which is why the Corps work to 
reduce flood and storm damage, restore vital aquatic ecosystems, and 
improve our resilience is vital.
    I look forward to working with the Committee on the WRDA of 2024. 
Below are specific requests that I submitted to the Committee for 
consideration.
Authorization of ``Rhode Island Coastline, Coastal Storm Risk 
        Management'' Project
    According to the Corps: The Rhode Island CSRM study was conducted 
due to frequent flooding from high tides, spring tides, and coastal 
storms in the study area. The study's purpose is to identify a plan to 
reduce the risk of coastal storm damage along a large portion of the 
Rhode Island coastline while contributing to the resilience of 
communities, important infrastructure, and the natural environment. The 
study area includes significant critical infrastructure at risk of 
damage from future flooding and coastal storms including police, fire, 
and emergency support service facilities; schools; energy production 
facilities; water and wastewater facilities; nursing homes and assisted 
living facilities in addition to communities and businesses. These 
areas that experience frequent flooding are considered at high risk of 
coastal storm flooding with an associated threat to life safety; and 
are susceptible to relative sea level change.
Reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program
    Dams play a vital role in Rhode Island's infrastructure and 
contribute to the economic development of our nation. This vital 
program is an essential partnership between states, federal agencies 
and other stakeholders to encourage and promote the establishment and 
maintenance of effective federal and state dam safety programs that 
reduce risk to human life, property, and the environment from dam 
related hazards. Unfortunately, formal authorization for the National 
Dam Safety Program lapsed on September 30, 2023. I hope this program 
will be reauthorized to ensure states like Rhode Island have the 
resources and support needed to monitor dams in our communities and 
reduce the risks associated with dam failure.
Technical assistance to States for identifying ownership of unsafe dams
    A major barrier to identifying and repairing dams in our state and 
across the nation is insufficient legal expertise to efficiently 
identify owners of derelict dams. I urge the committee to consider 
including language that will provide states and the Corps with 
sufficient legal technical assistance to expedite title research, 
especially in coastal states with high numbers of unidentified dam 
owners.
Modify the formula for the High Hazard Potential Dam (HHPD) 
        Rehabilitation Grant Program
    As you know, HHPD provides grants for technical, planning, design 
and construction assistance for rehabilitation of dams that fail to 
meet minimum safety standards and pose unacceptable risk to life and 
property. The current grant formula favors states with a proportionally 
high number of HHPDs by providing the majority of funds to these 
states, regardless of necessity or requested funding amount. To better 
ensure federal funds are more evenly distributed, I urge the Committee 
to change the formula. A proposal worthy of consideration is: one half 
equal distribution between all states that apply, and one half 
distributed based on a proportion of eligible HHPDs of the given state 
in relation to eligible HHPDs of all states that apply.
Increase Federal Limit and authorizations for Continuing Authorities 
        Programs (CAP)
    The last time Congress increased the per-project federal 
expenditure limit for the CAP was 2014. Construction costs have 
drastically increased in the last decade. Increasing the federal limit 
and authorization for the CAP to account for the per-project 
adjustments would better allow the Corps to meet its mission.
Use of Innovative Materials and Associated Techniques
    I applaud President Joe Biden's administration for mandating the 
Corps aim to design infrastructure projects with 100-year life spans. 
This long-term horizon is important to building resilient 
infrastructure that can withstand the threat climate change poses to 
our communities. The Corps has completed several pilot projects using 
innovative materials, which can be more durable and lightweight than 
traditional building materials and are less likely to corrode or 
degrade. I urge the Committee to allow the Corps to improve research, 
review standards, and deploy innovative materials and associated 
techniques for composite material because it could reduce costs, 
improve climate resiliency, and reduce carbon emissions. I hope these 
materials will be produced domestically to help good paying jobs across 
the United States and Rhode Island, especially because our state has a 
burgeoning composites industry whose growth would be accelerated by 
further federal investments.
Improved Connectivity Between Federal and State Initiatives and 
        Planning
    Rhode Island has been a leader in developing a state-approved 
coastal management plan. By improving the connection between federal 
and state partners for state-approved projects, strategies, and plans, 
the Corps could expedite the uptake of projects. Requiring GAO to 
detail how the Corps currently operates in conjunction with state-
approved management plans would better inform how to improve this 
process.

    In addition to the above priorities, I would also like to echo my 
support for the importance of better understanding the funding 
disparity we have seen between coastal and inland projects. I look 
forward to an expeditious completion of the Government Accountability 
Office results on this matter.
    Thank you for your time and consideration of these requests that 
will benefit Rhode Islanders. Please do not hesitate to contact our 
office with any questions.
    I yield back.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Representative in 
                  Congress From the State of Delaware
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the 
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, thank you for the 
opportunity to advocate for stronger water infrastructure on behalf of 
the state of Delaware, especially for my constituents in vulnerable 
coastal and riverbank communities.
    Congress has one of the best bipartisan track records in crafting 
the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA)--in fact, Congress has 
passed a bipartisan reauthorization of WRDA every two years since 2014.
    As the state with the lowest mean elevation in the country, WRDA is 
especially important to Delawareans, who feel the impacts of rising sea 
levels with every passing day. By 2050, the Delaware Geological Survey 
predicts that our sea level will rise by 1.3 feet.\1\ And by the late 
century, climate change will cost Delaware well over $1 billion 
annually, with cumulative costs of high tide flooding across the 
century sitting at $17 billion alone.\2\ These astronomical 
projections, the loss of habitation, water contamination, surges, and 
severe flooding are why I address the Committee with such urgency 
today.

    In fact, the reality of this proved true just this week, as Winter 
Storm Finn tore across the United States and Delaware's coasts and 
cities. This powerful storm's high winds, heavy rain, and widespread 
flooding threatened to upend the lives of so many Delawareans. I urge 
the Committee to pass a strong WRDA that meets this moment head-on. 
WRDA is crucial to protecting communities across the country, 
especially in Delaware.
    In previous WRDAs, the Delaware delegation worked to strengthen our 
shorelines and make our communities less susceptible to flooding and 
erosion. I'm particularly proud of what we accomplished together in 
WRDA 2022 through the inclusion of major provisions of the Shoreline 
Health Oversight, Restoration, Resilience, and Enhancement (SHORRE) 
Act,\3\ a bill I coauthored with Chairman Graves and Senators Carper 
and Cassidy to protect coastal communities from the devastating impacts 
of climate change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since then, Members from both sides of the aisle have continued to 
recognize the importance of increasing the coastal resiliency of the 
First State to protect against the numerous environmental threats to 
our livelihoods and natural heritage. We've ensured the operation of 
Delaware's ports and waterways, reinforced our Bay Beaches, and 
implemented environmental infrastructure authorities across the state. 
And for that, I am deeply grateful.
    Securing the safety, economic security, and long-term viability of 
Delaware's coastal and riverbank communities means building on our 
progress and fulfilling our commitment to once again passing a strong 
WRDA without delay. Because the reality is that extreme storms and 
flooding are increasing in frequency, and when disaster strikes, it 
costs taxpayers even more.
    Delaware's partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a 
strong one, but we need to do more to meet the challenges of today and 
the individualized needs of our most at-risk communities.
    That is why I am advocating for new authorities for the City of 
Wilmington and the City of Rehoboth under the Environmental 
Infrastructure Program so these hard-hit localities can pursue critical 
wastewater and stormwater system improvements and infrastructure.
    I am also requesting flood resilience feasibility studies for the 
Town of Milton and the City of Wilmington. Although they have already 
worked tirelessly to address persistent flooding, more must be done. 
They require comprehensive solutions so that when it rains or storms, 
livelihoods aren't on the line.
    As this Committee knows, coastline degradation of Delaware's famed 
beaches poses a threat to residents and tourists alike. That is why I 
am requesting the addition of Broadkill Beach to the existing Delaware 
Beneficial Use of Dredged Material for the Delaware River project 
authorization for beachfill and restoration purposes.
    Finally, I ask the Committee to authorize a watershed-wide 
ecosystem restoration study for the Delaware Inland Bays. This will 
create a path forward for critical salt marsh restoration, shoreline 
stabilization, and stormwater management.
    I want to thank the Committee for their incredible work on this 
legislation and their partnership over the years. On behalf of the 
First State, thank you for your consideration and I look forward to 
working with you.

Prepared Statement of Hon. J. Luis Correa, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Thank you, Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for hosting 
Members' Day for members to share their requests for the Water 
Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.
    Today, I'd like to highlight two projects that in the heart of my 
district.
    In the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, the Santa Ana River 
Mainstem Project (SARMP) was fully authorized as a flood-risk 
management project. The SARMP, which includes the Santiago Creek 
(Creek) component, also received funding under the Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2018 (BBA18) so that all components could be completed as 
designed and approved. The Creek work represents the last component of 
the SARMP.
    My request for WRDA 2024, which was developed after consultation 
with the Corps, would amend the current authorizing language to better 
address the flood control needs and concerns of the community located 
on a specific stretch of the Creek component entirely in my District.
    Since the US Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) released the 
proposal for the Creek, there has been a bifurcated response: strong 
support for work upstream of the I-5 Freeway (I-5) and uniform, 
emphatic, and consistent opposition to the proposed work between the I-
5 and the confluence of the Creek with the Santa Ana River (the River).
    Primarily, the affected community supports flood control measures 
but ardently objects to the wholesale removal of trees in and along the 
Creek channel section in their neighborhoods that support a wide 
variety of wildlife, including Bald Eagles.
    This language would address the concerns raised by my constituents 
directly impacted by the proposed plan by enabling the Corps to 
redesign the plan.
    Specifically, the language would separate the Creek component into 
two distinct sections, one upstream of I-5 and a second downstream of 
I-5. This would permit and require the Corps to continue work on all 
other portions of the SARMP, including the work upstream of I-5, by 
leaving the rest of SARMP unaffected. Through this language, the Corps 
would not initiate construction in the stretch between the I-5 and the 
confluence of the River unless and until the Corps redesigns the 
project to minimize the impacts to existing trees located in or 
adjacent to this portion of the project. This new plan would be subject 
to public and environmental review. Moreover, since the entire SARMP is 
funded by BBA18, all costs associated with minimizing impacts to 
existing trees shall be met using available BBA18 funds.
    I thank the Committee again for this opportunity to discuss making 
this important flood control project work for the conscientious Santa 
Ana residents who are eager to retain the wildlife corridor along the 
Creek in their neighborhood.
    My second request is to support the OC River Walk project, located 
in Anaheim, California. OC River Walk is a dynamic and multi-
functioning project with water resource, recreational, and economic 
benefits. The project aligns with the Corps' Environmental Operating 
Principles, and the project is structured to avoid detrimental impacts 
to the important flood resiliency functions of the Santa Ana River and 
enhance its benefits.
    My request is for an expedited review of the Section 404 and 408 
permit process from the Corps for the planned OC River Walk. The City 
of Anaheim has initiated the Section 404 and Section 408 permitting 
process with the USACE Los Angeles District (South Pacific Division).
    Expedited review of the Section 404 and 408 permits and associated 
studies will allow the City of Anaheim to move more quickly toward 
construction and allow the region to benefit more quickly from the 
anticipated project outcomes.
    The project has achieved support and engagement from the critical 
stakeholders, including Orange County Water District, the City of 
Orange, Orange County Public Works/Flood, and Orange County Parks. OC 
River Walk will ensure that the Santa Ana River continues to serve as 
the County's primary flood control infrastructure and increases the 
replenishment capacity of the Orange County Groundwater Aquifer, while 
improving connectivity, recreation, aesthetics, and ecology of the 
River and adjacent land. The City of Anaheim is eager to begin 
construction as soon as possible to ensure the project is complete in 
time for the 2028 Summer Olympics in the region.
    Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter and I look 
forward to continuing to work with you on these and other issues.

   Prepared Statement of Hon. Jasmine Crockett, a Representative in 
                    Congress From the State of Texas
    Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the 
Chairman and Ranking Member for their willingness to have Members 
testify on the water resource development needs impacting the entire 
country, including my district.
    This is the core of what it means to represent your constituents--
to hear what is happening on the ground in your community, and come to 
Congress to fix those issues.
    The most pressing issue facing Dallas County in my District is its 
need to raise the current county-wide authorization cap.
    Dallas County is home to over 2.5 million Americans and supports 
the flow of over $500 billion in commerce, particularly in the trade 
and transportation sector impacting the entire United States. Yet our 
cap is far below where it needs to be.
    When my office spoke with the Fort Worth District of the Army Corps 
of Engineers, the Corps stated that the current authorization cap is 
not nearly enough to complete the projects currently underway.
    Specifically, to complete the dredging of White Rock Lake, the 
Corps stated that we need an additional $20 million dollars. But if 
that is the only increase, Dallas County will be unable to make any 
other enhancements to water resources in the county.
    That is why, in order to complete the current projects and have 
headroom for projects in the pipeline, the Corps recommends, and as 
such I urge the Committee to authorize, an additional $40 million 
dollars for Dallas County, Texas.
    If we do not receive an increase in authorization, we will have 
begun spending money on a project we do not complete. Even if we choose 
to resume the project later with subsequently increased authorization, 
the cost of materials and labor will have risen.
    No matter how you look at it, if Dallas County does not receive an 
increase in authorization, this Congress would be responsible for an 
unacceptable waste of taxpayer dollars.
    There are several other worthy projects that the community 
desperate needs in Dallas County that you will surely hear about from 
other Members of the Dallas County delegation today.
    But if we don't receive the requested new authorization level of 
$80 million dollars, none of those projects will be able to move 
forward.
    I am not here requesting funding for a particular pet project, but 
instead am working to ensure the projects important to my colleagues 
across North Texas are able to move forward.
    Given the current authorization level was set all the way back in 
2007, I hope you all will agree with me that Dallas County is long-
overdue for an increase in authorization.
    I hope this Committee will take direction from the Army Corps of 
Engineers, who requested this increase in authorization. And I will 
close with my hope that we are able to move a strong, bipartisan bill 
forward at the end of this process. We all lose, and importantly each 
and every one of our constituents lose, if we aren't able to pass this 
bill.
    Accordingly, I urge the Committee to increase the Dallas County, 
Texas authorization to $80 million dollars, thank the Committee for its 
time, and yield back.

                                 <F-dash>
Prepared Statement of Hon. Danny K. Davis, a Representative in Congress 
                       From the State of Illinois
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of the 
Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to discuss my requested 
project priority for inclusion in the Water Resources Development Act 
(WRDA) of 2024. As the Committee bipartisanly advances a bill that will 
help strengthen the nation's global competitiveness, grow our economy, 
and enhance the quality of life for communities throughout the country, 
I respectfully request your consideration of water resource development 
and management related activities of great significance to the 
constituents of the 7th Congressional District of Illinois.
    Specifically, I want to highlight the Section 219 water-related 
environmental infrastructure and development project I submitted on 
behalf of the Village of Forest Park in Cook County, Illinois. Located 
in the western suburbs of Chicago and bordered by the Des Plaines River 
to its west, the Village of Forest Park has long experienced stormwater 
flooding and overflows of its combined sewer system. In fact, the 1992 
WRDA law, authorized $10 million for the Village of Forest Park to 
partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for wastewater 
infrastructure and stormwater management projects throughout the 
Village's 2.4 square miles.
    Unfortunately, the Village of Forest Park continues to struggle 
with stormwater-related issues, such as surcharging sewers and 
residential/commercial property basement backups due to its undersized, 
combined sewer system. To remedy these issues, the Village of Forest 
Park seeks a modification to its existing authorization under Section 
219(f)(330) of the WRDA 1992 law, as amended, for an increase of $40 
million for wastewater infrastructure and stormwater management. In 
particular, the Village plans for the full separation of the storm 
sewer from the combination sewer so that all stormwater would outfall 
into the Des Plaines River. Additionally, the Village of Forest Park, 
as the non-federal project sponsor, requests authorization to work with 
the USACE to enhance its potable water supply and storage management 
capacity by relocating and replacing its aged water reservoir and 
installing a new and modernized pumping station.
    In closing, I respectfully request that the Committee include this 
priority Environmental Infrastructure and Water Management Project for 
the Village of Forest Park, Illinois, in the Water Resources 
Development Act of 2024. This modification simply builds upon USACE's 
existing authority by increasing the project's authorization funding 
level to meet the municipality's current stormwater and water storage 
needs. If approved, this project is anticipated to have multiple 
benefits for the Village of Forest Park, including improved stormwater 
management resulting from the complete separation of sewers in the 
Village as well as increased potable water storage capacity.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward 
to working with you as the WRDA reauthorization bill advances.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Lloyd Doggett, a Representative in Congress 
                        From the State of Texas
    Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
    The Waterloo Greenway project in Austin is restoring Waller Creek, 
a water way through downtown Austin, which connects Ladybird Lake with 
the beautiful Waterloo Park. It has been a great addition to the 
quality of life in my hometown, while also offering great potential for 
economic benefits. Federal funding through Section 5138. TEXAS 
(authorized in Pub. L. 110-114; Water Resources Development Act of 
2007) has encouraged additional private and local governmental funding.
    Our success with Waterloo Greenway has inspired interest in similar 
environmental infrastructure improvements from other communities. We 
hope to have additional funding for Waterloo Greenway, and want to see 
other communities achieve similar benefits. Increasing the 
authorization for Section 5138 from $80 million to $150 million will 
enable the Army Corps to reach their goals, not only in Austin but also 
for other worthy projects.

    Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of 
the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the 
opportunity to provide Member testimony regarding the Water Resources 
Development Act of 2024.
    As the Committee undertakes its important work on the Water 
Resources Development Act, I respectfully request consideration be 
provided to the City of Cincinnati's request for an increase of its 
authorization to $30 million for much-needed Capitol Improvement 
Program projects being carried out by the Metropolitan Sewer District 
of Greater Cincinnati (MSD).
    MSD--located in and serving Ohio's First Congressional District as 
well as the wider Southwest Ohio region--is a ratepayer-funded 
wastewater utility that provides service to approximately 240,000 
households and businesses in the Greater Cincinnati Area, including 
portions of Hamilton County, Butler County, Clermont County, and Warren 
County.
    MSD operates a service area that encompasses 290+ square miles and 
consists of more than 3,000 miles of public sewers, approximately 100 
pump stations, nine wet weather facilities, and nine wastewater 
treatment plants. MSD is subject to a federal consent decree with the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ohio Environmental Protection 
Agency, and the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission--which 
mandates extensive improvements to the MSD system primarily focused on 
reducing sewer overflows. Since 2009, MSD has invested over $1.1 
billion in mandated system improvements and subsequent phases are 
expected to exceed another $1 billion.
    MSD's approved 2023-2027 Capital Improvement Program totals more 
than $1.4 billion, which includes costs associated with consent decree 
Phase 2A projects as well as anticipated Phase 2B projects. In addition 
to these obligations, inflation, increasing regulatory requirements, 
and aging infrastructure are drastically increasing utility cost of 
service. MSD is already seeing many ratepayers with paying utility 
bills in the post-pandemic economy, creating a significant concern as 
to the negative impacts of rate increases to fund these obligations and 
continuing operations--and an increase of the existing authorization to 
$30 million will significantly benefit the households and businesses 
throughout the Greater Cincinnati Area.
    Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Committee 
Members for the opportunity to provide testify. I appreciate the 
important work each of you is undertaking for the people we all serve.

Prepared Statement of Hon. John B. Larson, a Representative in Congress 
                     From the State of Connecticut
    Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    I write today in support of the termination of USACE Contract DA-
19-016-CIVENG-56-203, regarding the Colebrook River Reservoir, 
Connecticut. This contract is between the US Army Corps of Engineers 
(USACE) and the Metropolitan District (MDC), the non-profit municipal 
corporation which provides clean water to the Greater Hartford, CT 
region.
    More than fifty years ago, the USACE and the MDC entered into a 
contract to construct the Colebrook Dam. While primarily constructed 
for flood control, the dam also created a reservoir. In return for 10 
billion gallons of emergency drinking water storage, the MDC agreed to 
pay a portion of the capital cost of the dam and a portion of 
maintenance and operations costs over a fifty-year period. In 2019, the 
MDC completed their capital expense obligation.
    Unfortunately, the reservoir has proven to be unsuitable for 
emergency water storage. Through the history of the project, the water 
has never been utilized. The Connecticut Department of Public Health 
has found that under severe drought conditions, most, if not all, of 
the 10 billion gallons would be unavailable. They additionally found 
that the requirements needed to connect this water source with existing 
water supply infrastructure make the water unsuitable for use even 
under non-drought circumstances.
    In light of this, the MDC attempted to end their work with the 
USACE upon completion of their obligations in 2019, believing the 
project completed. Unfortunately, the USACE considers the MDC liable in 
perpetuity for operations and maintenance expenses, barring termination 
by legislation. As a result, unless this committee takes action, the 
MDC, and by extension, its ratepayers, are contractually bound to fund 
the operations in which they receive no benefit. At a time when utility 
costs have risen, removing this cost is a common sense way to benefit 
thousands of households, many of them low income.
    I urge the committee to recognize that the agreement between USACE 
and the MDC has run its course and to end this contract.

  Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Levin, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for the 
opportunity to submit testimony on behalf of my constituents in 
California's 49th district and share their priorities on water 
infrastructure issues.
    My district has more than 50 miles of California coastline and I am 
honored to represent such a beautiful community. However, due to rising 
sea levels caused by climate change, coastal storms and flooding, and 
even development by the federal government, our beaches and coastal 
bluffs are eroding away. This erosion threatens vital infrastructure 
that my constituents rely on such as the LOSSAN Rail Corridor 
connecting San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Luis Obispo, and disrupts 
the habitats of sea birds and aquatic wildlife. In addition, coastal 
erosion jeopardizes public safety and recreational benefits for my 
constituents and the millions of tourists to the region.
    Since coming to Congress, I have fought for sand replenishment 
projects up and down the coastline in the 49th district. After years of 
advocacy and collaboration, I'm particularly proud to have secured more 
than $41 million in federal funding to pump over one million cubic 
yards of sand onto beaches in San Clemente, Solana Beach, and 
Encinitas, which will widen our beaches, reduce storm damage, and 
improve recreational opportunities. I'm grateful for the Corps' work on 
these projects, and I will continue to promote additional shoreline 
restoration efforts, including better integrated regional planning to 
ensure the resilience of our coast for generations to come.
    I would like to draw the Committee's attention to one long-delayed 
shoreline project in particular: the Oceanside Special Shoreline Study. 
Oceanside has experienced beach erosion for decades since the 
construction of Camp Pendleton Harbor in 1942. The federal government 
has acknowledged that construction of the harbor jetties was a direct 
contributing cause of the erosion of beaches in the area.
    This erosion presents a safety hazard and has damaged 
infrastructure, impacted recreational resources, and threatened 
property. Only one third of Oceanside's beaches sustain any dry sand. 
This means the remaining two thirds of the coast, or roughly 2.5 miles 
out of Oceanside's 3.8-mile coastline, have only low tide, wet sand 
beaches. Two of the beaches most impacted by erosion are also the ones 
that offer free public parking or are easily accessible by public 
transit; as these beaches erode, public accessibility to the ocean will 
erode as well. Further, lifeguards in the area must regularly rescue 
individuals who have difficulty getting back onto dry land using the 
uneven rock riprap along the coast; additional beach sand is necessary 
in order to provide a safe ingress into and egress out of the ocean.
    The federal government has a responsibility to my constituents to 
right these wrongs and mitigate the environmental harms in Oceanside 
that have been decades in the making. In order to alleviate this 
erosion, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 directed 
the Corps to complete a study to mitigate the erosion and other impacts 
from the construction of Camp Pendleton Harbor and to restore beach 
conditions along the affected shores. However, when I came to Congress 
nearly 20 years later, this study had not yet been completed, despite 
the statutory deadline of 32 months that Congress set for the Corps.
    In WRDA 2020, I appreciate that you included language directing the 
Corps to expedite the completion of a feasibility study for Oceanside 
shoreline protection, and that the Corps ultimately allocated $1.82 
million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to complete 
this study. However, over three years later, I am concerned that the 
Corps may once again put this study on a shelf, an outcome that would 
be entirely unacceptable after the communities I represent have waited 
more than two decades for its completion.
    It is of the utmost importance to my constituents and me that the 
Corps work in an expedited manner to complete and submit to Congress 
their feasibility study in Oceanside, which must include the necessary 
environmental documents and a full engineering and cost analysis of 
their recommended plan. I look forward to working with the Committee 
and the Army Corps to get this study done, so we can finally progress 
to a project that mitigates the harms done by the federal government 
and restores our beaches for the safety and enjoyment of our community.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Zoe Lofgren, a Representative in Congress 
                      From the State of California
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the full 
Committee,
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony today and for 
your work as the Committee prepares the Water Resources Development Act 
(WRDA) of 2024. As you consider WRDA proposals, I strongly urge the 
Committee to support the following requests on behalf of the 
communities I represent.
    First, I am requesting an U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility 
study regarding expanding the capacity of Soap Lake in San Benito 
County to prevent and mitigate flooding in the region. Soap Lake 
currently acts as a holding basin during the rainy season and helps 
regulate water flow to the Pajaro River and surrounding tributaries. 
For decades, there have been several major floods along the Pajaro 
River that have destroyed homes and displaced residents. Most recently, 
in March 2023, the Pajaro River levees were breached, causing hundreds 
of millions of dollars in damage. The County of San Benito, which would 
be the non-federal partner on the study, is interested in expanding 
Soap Lake to reduce downstream flood risks along the Pajaro River 
during high rain events.
    I am also requesting authorization of two important Environmental 
Infrastructure projects in my Congressional District. The first is for 
the City of San Juan Bautista to upgrade its drinking and wastewater 
system by connecting to regional water and wastewater systems. Due to 
excessive groundwater salt content, the City is not able to provide 
adequate drinking and wastewater treatment services to its residents. 
The City has identified the project as its highest priority public 
infrastructure project. Without access to adequate drinking and 
wastewater systems, it is extremely challenging for the City to attract 
new residents or businesses. Additionally, with a population of 
approximately 2,000 people, it is extremely challenging for the City to 
meet its water infrastructure needs without additional sources of 
assistance. This project is a sound investment and will ensure that San 
Juan Bautista residents have access to safe water resources.
    The second Environmental Infrastructure project I am requesting 
would replace cast iron water lines in the historic downtown of the 
City of Hollister. The City experiences frequent earthquakes from the 
nearby Calaveras fault line, and the City's aging water lines have 
experienced multiple significant water line breaks over the years, 
disrupting residents, businesses, and local traffic. Many of the old 
water lines also do not provide enough flow to meet fire code standards 
for fire hydrants, which the project would also address. This project 
would help secure reliable water supply in the City and reduce public 
safety risks in the event of an earthquake or fire.
    Thank you for your consideration of these requests that are so 
crucial to the safety of residents in Hollister, San Juan Bautista, and 
along the Pajaro River.

                                 <F-dash>
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Stephen F. Lynch, a Representative in 
            Congress From the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
    Dear Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Subcommittee Chairman 
Rouzer, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Napolitano,
    As the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee welcomes input 
on this Member's Day on a variety of topics of the upcoming year, I 
respectfully submit comment on the Water Resources Development Act. For 
years, this bipartisan bill supported vital projects throughout my 
district from sweeping port infrastructure to river and dam 
renovations. I will be submitting my requests through the portal but 
would like to highlight a few of the issues today.

    1.  Ensuring payment and performance protections for water 
infrastructure projects, H.R. 1740

      <bullet>  I, along with Mr. Bost, propose to amend the Water 
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) (33 USC Ch.52) to 
apply a policy solution that would ensure all water infrastructure 
projects using financing authorized under WIFIA, including the Corps 
Water Infrastructure Financing Program (CWIFP), have adequate 
protections for workers, subcontractors, suppliers, and taxpayers.

      <bullet>  The proposed policy solution would have the Secretary 
of the Army or the EPA Administrator, as appropriate, ensure WIFIA-
financed water infrastructure projects have payment and performance 
security protections by requiring surety bonds if the project is not 
subject to State or local payment and performance security 
requirements. If a State has requirements for security protections of 
at least 50% of the construction cost, the Secretary or the 
Administrator must accept the State requirements. Otherwise, the 
project would be required to follow protections in the Federal Miller 
Act, which has been applied to all public works contracts greater than 
a given dollar threshold (currently, $100,000) for nearly a century. 
This would ensure common protections are applied for the Federal 
interest with respect to Federal funds and other project risks related 
to design and construction.

      <bullet>  This policy solution is currently applied to 
transportation projects that use the Transportation Infrastructure 
Finance Innovation Act (TIFIA) program based on legislation I led. 
Congress overwhelmingly supported the adoption of the policy for TIFIA 
as shown by way of a unanimous floor vote, 97-0, to include the 
provision in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). 
Similarly, the language was included in the House-passed transportation 
bill after the policy was adopted in a bipartisan en bloc amendment 
that passed by voice vote. The WIFIA policy solution mirrors the TIFIA 
solution, thereby maintaining parity between the two programs.

      <bullet>  For nearly a hundred years, the federal government has 
recognized the importance of requiring performance and payment bonds to 
protect its public works projects. Bonds play a vital role in ensuring 
that project completion will not be threatened by financially-
distressed contractors; subcontractors and suppliers receive prompt 
payment for their labor and materials; projects are delivered within 
budget and on time; and, as shown by an Ernst and Young (E&Y) study, 
overall project cost savings. Over 95% of all public projects require 
bonding under either the Federal Miller Act or state-law equivalents 
(collectively the Miller Acts). However, the applicability of the 
Miller Acts' bonding requirements is not always clear on newer forms of 
project procurement, specifically including public-private partnerships 
(P3s). Therefore, the increasing trend of using P3s to procure and 
deliver water infrastructure could lead to a substantial amount of 
federally-financed projects that do not maintain the same level of 
protections that have been required on public infrastructure projects 
over the past century.

      <bullet>  This loophole/gap for newer forms of project 
procurement, which have the same risk as traditional projects, if not 
greater, leaves workers and taxpayers exposed to unnecessary risks. 
Without these protections, in the event of a contractor default, the 
project may come to a screeching halt for an indefinite period, leaving 
subcontractors and workers without pay and forcing states, and 
importantly, taxpayers, to absorb the additional costs of rebidding, 
restarting, and finishing the project.

      <bullet>  I propose to amend WIFIA to adopt a policy solution 
that would ensure all forms of project procurement for water 
infrastructure using WIFIA-authorized financing, including P3s, utilize 
the traditionally required protections for workers, subcontractors, 
suppliers, and taxpayers, ensuring parity for all infrastructure 
projects.

      <bullet>  Finally, aside from performance and payment security, 
surety bonding provides a number of additional benefits to public 
infrastructure projects. Ernst and Young performed a study, ``The 
Economic Value of Surety Bonds,'' that highlighted a number of these 
additional benefits, which include, but are not limited to:

        i.  Bonded projects are more likely to be completed on time or 
ahead of schedule than unbonded projects. What's more, unbonded 
projects are 10 times more likely to default than bonded projects.

        ii.  Bonded projects cost less than unbonded projects. 75% of 
project owners report that surety bonding reduces contractor pricing by 
an average of 3.2%

        iii.  If a contractor defaults on a bonded project, surety 
companies intervene, lowering the cost of project completion by 85% and 
reducing the time to complete by two times.

    2.  Better Use of Dredge Materials

      <bullet>  Dredge Materials (primarily sand) should be used to 
better our shorelines rather than being thrown out and not being used. 
Dredge materials are often disposed of which are not environmentally 
friendly or eliminated in a way that is not the most effective for the 
Corps.

      <bullet>  I ask the committee to value the environmental impact 
of moving dredge materials from location to location without meaning. I 
am told that such excess movement is ``least cost alternative'', but it 
would be better for the environment and serve a better future if it was 
used for shore maintenance or other recovery efforts.

      <bullet>  Congress must value environmental impacts that may not 
show on the balance sheet. Such a policy must list environmental 
impacts and then refer to them as an additional cost saving technique 
rather than ignoring the future of climate.

      <bullet>  I understand that there is rulemaking on how to broaden 
how Corps considers costs, benefits, impacts, and alternatives, but how 
can Congress ensure that dredge materials are included in this concept?

    3.  Continuing Authorities Program Funding Limit Raised

      <bullet>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Continuing 
Authorities Program (CAP) is a group of nine legislative authorities 
under which USACE can plan, design, and implement certain types of 
water resources projects without additional project specific 
congressional authorization. The purpose of the CAP is to plan and 
implement projects of limited size, cost, scope, and complexity.

      <bullet>  There is a limit on spending that is currently at $10 
million but should be raised to $12.5 million or at least the cap 
should be adjusted with inflation.

      <bullet>  The Corps needs flexibility to spend the money 
necessary to address the issues under CAP and the current limit is 
harmful to the success of the Corps.

    4.  Harbor Maintenance Trust Funds

      <bullet>  I ask for visibility on the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund.

      <bullet>  There is a percentage set aside for Small Harbors but 
Congress doesn't know how much is going to which Small Harbors. I am 
concerned that not enough is going to the Small Harbors in New England. 
Congress wants to know which harbors are the small harbors that are 
benefiting from this.

      <bullet>  This was created as a set-aside in WRDA '20 but the 
limits/rules haven't been followed for any of the percent targets that 
was put in law.

      <bullet>  Congress must ensure that the rules are followed and 
not seen as optional.

    In addition to policy changes, I am looking for help on moving a 
few projects forward.

    1.  New Charles River Dam

      <bullet>  The New Charles River Dam is located on the Charles 
River, between the Charlestown and North End sections of Boston. The 
Charles River Dam Project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 
August 13, 1968 (PL 90-483). Project purposes included flood control, 
navigation, fish passage, and recreation. The project was completed by 
USACE in May 1978 at a cost of $61.3 million. The Massachusetts 
Department of Conservation & Recreation (DCR) has been operating and 
maintaining the project successfully over the past 40 years. The 
project provides critical flood risk management to about 2,440 acres of 
urban property along the banks of the Charles River. Much of this 
property is in Boston, Brookline and Cambridge.

      <bullet>  The dam forms a tidal barrier between Boston Inner 
Harbor and the Charles River. The impoundment upstream of the dam is 
known as the Charles River ``Basin''. The Basin extends 8.6 miles 
upstream to the Watertown Dam. Water level of the Basin is maintained 
within targeted elevations through dam operation. Water levels in the 
harbor vary with the tides. When the water level is lower in the harbor 
than in the Basin, the two submerged flood control sluiceways are used 
to drain Basin waters (gravity drainage). When the water level is 
higher in the harbor than in the Basin, one or more flood control pumps 
may be used to drain Basin waters.

      <bullet>  The purpose of this study is to provide technical 
assistance to the non-federal sponsor DCR in the assessment of the 
adequacy of the New Charles River Dam to meet changing climate 
conditions. This technical assistance is in support of the 
Commonwealth's water resources management planning associated with 
changing hydrologic conditions, climate change, long-term 
sustainability, and resilience. The first phase, a scoping study 
includes gathering background information on the Charles River Dam and 
identifying and selecting tasks, methodologies and models to be used 
for the adequacy assessment. The Phase 1 scoping study was completed in 
summer 2021. Phase 2 includes consideration of sea level rise and 
coastal storms, current and future rainfall and runoff conditions in 
the watershed, and evaluation of dam/reservoir operations under these 
changing conditions. Phase 2 started in September 2022.

      <bullet>  In WRDA 2022 there was a feasibility study added and I 
am supportive, and this year want to make sure the study had all the 
resources it needs to be successful.

    2.  Smelt Brook

      <bullet>  The towns of Weymouth and Braintree requested District 
assistance with restoring fish passage in Smelt Brook tributary to the 
Weymouth-Fore River under Section 1135--Project Modifications to 
Improve the Environment Program. USACE has evaluated an array of 
potential solutions and plans to release a draft Detailed Project 
Report to reconnect rainbow Smelt with their historic spawning habitat 
in Smelt Brook in the Fall of 2022 for public comment.

      <bullet>  In WRDA 2022 this study was included in the report and 
noted that there was a lack of sufficient funds.

      <bullet>  I am waiting for the Detailed Project Report after the 
Fall of 2022 public comment period.

    3.  Hayward Creek

      <bullet>  The Town of Braintree requested District assistance 
with restoring fish passage in the Hayward Creek and Eaton Pond 
watershed under Section 1135--Project Modifications to Improve the 
Environment Program.

      <bullet>  A federal interest determination is underway, but I 
know if that can be expedited.

    Thank you for your hard work and dedication for the future of water 
resources and the USACE. If you have any questions, please contact my 
staff, William Seabrook.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Harold Rogers, a Representative in Congress 
                   From the Commonwealth of Kentucky
    Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and other distinguished 
Members of the subcommittee, I would like to thank you for your 
consideration of my priorities for the 2024 Water Resources Development 
Act (WRDA). I know your Committee works diligently to ensure that all 
Americans can benefit from our nation's incredible water resources and 
infrastructure--whether through the transportation of goods on our 
waterways, locks, and dams, flood control projects that protect our 
communities from disaster, and also incredible recreational 
opportunities. Previous WRDA bills have done a great deal to help the 
people of my district in southern and eastern Kentucky across each of 
the aforementioned areas. Whether it is the importance of locks and 
dams on the Kentucky and Ohio Rivers to the Kentucky economy, Wolf 
Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland, the incredible flood control projects in 
many of my towns and communities, and our Corps lakes' many 
recreational uses, we benefit greatly from these resources. As you 
begin the 2024 WRDA process, I would like to raise four specific 
priorities that will benefit those in my district in Kentucky.
1. Modify the Service Area for the Section 202 Flood Control Program
    First, I request the expansion of Section 202 of the Energy and 
Water Development Act of 1981 to include the North, Middle, and South 
Forks of the Kentucky River, which suffered catastrophic flooding in 
the winter of 2021 and summer of 2022. The mountainous terrain in 
southern and eastern Kentucky has long caused the region to suffer from 
frequent floods. Since inception, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
Section 202 program has made a transformative impact along the 
Cumberland and Big Sandy Rivers--saving countless lives from severe 
flooding--but does not cover the Kentucky River and its forks.
    The devastating damage of the 2021 and 2022 floods left thousands 
without homes, destroyed communities, and cost the lives of 44 
Kentuckians. Over $600 million has already been spent in response to 
the 2022 floods, and there is plenty more to come. We must begin to 
implement measures to mitigate flood damage in this region, protecting 
my constituents. Expanding Section 202 to cover the Kentucky River and 
its forks would enable the Army Corps of Engineers to immediately begin 
construction on flood control measures, both structural and non-
structural, upon completion of the necessary studies. It is clear the 
region is in need of assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers to 
help prevent future flooding of this magnitude, and we fear we cannot 
wait until it's too late.
2.  Authorization of Construction for a Flood Warning Emergency 
        Evacuation Plan (FWEEP) in the Kentucky River Basin
    In response to the severe flooding of 2021 and 2022, I have secured 
community project funding for several studies across the region. In 
meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, it 
became clear to me that a more comprehensive Flood Warning Emergency 
Evacuation Plan (FWEEP) is also needed. A FWEEP across the region would 
ensure that these disadvantaged communities have a fighting chance of 
getting to safety should severe flash flooding occur like it did in the 
past. It is a cost effective, lifesaving tool that we should waste no 
time in implementing.
3. Wolf Creek Dam Water Reallocation Study Prohibition
    Third, I request that language be included in this year's WRDA to 
prohibit a water reallocation study to be conducted at Wolf Creek Dam. 
This request would maintain historic WRDA and Energy and Water 
Appropriations language prohibiting a water reallocation study at Wolf 
Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland. The region surrounding the dam is one of 
the poorest in the nation, and a reallocation study might lead to 
increased rates, which would place financial hardship on my 
constituents.
4. Inclusion of the MARINA Act
    Finally, I am seeking the inclusion of the MARINA Act, which would 
modernize the relationship between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and 
marina owners. This legislation, introduced in both the 117th and 118th 
Congress, would encourage economic growth and improve access to outdoor 
recreation. This language would allow for marina owners to successfully 
implement necessary facility improvement projects without burdensome 
administrative fees from the Army Corps of Engineers.
    The MARINA Act would: (1) cap gross revenue fees on the sales of 
food, beverages, fuel, boats, motors, and boat lifts at one percent for 
calculating rental payments, (2) standardize the schedule for 
administrative fees, and (3) extend initial lease terms to 50 years and 
renewals to 25 years. The added stability in the length of lease 
contracts and renewals would also provide aid in expanding access to 
credit for marina owners.

    Thank you again for your consideration of my 2024 WRDA requests. I 
look forward to working with you as this process unfolds, so we can 
continue to maximize both Kentucky and our nation's water resources. If 
you or your staff have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact 
me or my staff.

   Prepared Statement of Hon. Robert J. Wittman, a Representative in 
               Congress From the Commonwealth of Virginia
                             Introduction:
    Chairwoman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
    Thank you for allowing me to testify before you today. I am honored 
to highlight some of the needs facing Virginia as you consider 
oversight on the implementation of the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2022.
    The Water Resources Development Act is necessary legislation that 
provides for improvements to the Nation's ports, inland waterways, 
flood protection, ecosystem restoration, and other water resources 
infrastructure and policy. Water infrastructure is vital to moving 
goods throughout the country, from products we all use in our everyday 
lives, to crops and goods we produce domestically and send abroad. I 
hope this committee and the House upholds its duty to authorize 
nationally important water infrastructure improvements that are more 
locally driven.
    Furthermore, I would like to thank the Army Corps of Engineers as 
they work hard to manage more than 1,500 water resource projects with 
many of them in Virginia. The Army Corps of Engineers is critical to 
our commonwealth, from the Norfolk Harbor Channel Widening and 
Deepening Project to the public waterways restorations projects across 
Virginia.
                           Port of Virginia:
    As a proud representative of the Commonwealth of Virginia, home of 
the Port of Virginia--one of the largest and busiest ports on the 
eastern seaboard--advancing the work being done by the Port of Virginia 
to improve and expand its operations is critical. The Port manages 
cargo that is shipped to all 48 contiguous states.
    The Port of Virginia is a national gateway for commerce, supporting 
businesses across the country. Moreover, in Virginia's 1st District 234 
businesses utilize the services of the Port of Virginia.
    As a catalyst for commerce, the Port is attracting growth, 
fostering development, and creating jobs. On the state level, cargo 
moving through the Port supports more than 436,667 jobs statewide and 
generates in excess of $100.1 billion in annual economic impact for 
Virginia.
                       WRDA Proposals Submitted:
    I would like to take this time to highlight some WRDA priorities 
the subcommittee should look at while conducting oversight of its 
implementation.
1. Norfolk Harbor and Channels: Anchorage F Expansion
    Anchorage F is currently designed as a 3,000-foot diameter circle 
for free-swinging bow anchoring. The anchorage in its current design is 
used primarily as an emergency anchorage in inclement wave weather in 
the harbor or in situations of unexpected delays. For vessels to 
effectively utilize the anchorage, it is imperative--and common-sense--
for the anchorage and approach depths to match that of the Federal 
Channel.
    A deeper and wider anchorage will allow further use of the 
anchorage beyond the primary function and permit use by larger vessels 
calling on our port. Additionally, an improved anchorage and anchorage 
approach could provide passing vessels safe harbor during storm 
conditions.
    The modification includes widening the Anchorage F beyond its 
currently authorized diameter of 3,620-feet to a diameter of 3,840-feet 
and deepening the anchorage to 55-feet consistent with the 1986 
authorization and the project depth of the Federal Channel.
2. Virginia Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study
    I request oversight to ensure the USACE includes Federal properties 
in their feasibility studies for the Norfolk-Hampton Roads, Virginia.
    By allowing the USACE to include Federal properties for an upcoming 
Costal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) study of the Peninsula and greater 
Hampton Roads area, it would solve the restriction problem in 
incorporating these installations and facilities into the Civil Works 
planning and construction processes. I believe this is a commonsense 
issue that will ultimately produce a better report of action by a range 
of actors in the region.
                              Conclusion:
    I want to thank the Chairwoman, Ranking Member, and the Members of 
the Committee for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to 
working with the Committee and the Corps to ensure WRDA 2024 is 
implemented as intended.

                                 [all]
