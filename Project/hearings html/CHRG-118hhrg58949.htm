                             II. BACKGROUND

FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISASTERS

    FEMA is the Federal Government's lead agency for preparing 
for, mitigating against, responding to, and recovering from 
disasters and emergencies related to all hazards--whether 
natural or man-made.\1\ FEMA's primary authority in carrying 
out these functions stems from the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) (P.L. 100-
707, as amended).\2\ The Stafford Act authorizes three types of 
declarations: (1) major disaster declarations; (2) emergency 
declarations; and (3) fire management grant (FMAG) 
declarations.\3\ The Stafford Act authorizes the President to 
approve states' requests for a Federal disaster declaration 
when ``the situation is of such severity and magnitude that 
effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and 
affected local governments.'' \4\

PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED MAJOR DISASTER

    When state and local resources are overwhelmed and the 
``disaster is of such severity and magnitude that effective 
response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the 
affected local governments,'' \5\ the Governor of the affected 
state may request the President declare a major disaster.\6\ 
FEMA's primary Stafford Act programs for disaster recovery in 
the aftermath of a major disaster are in the Public Assistance 
Program and the Individual Assistance Program.\7\ Following a 
major disaster declaration, FEMA also provides Hazard 
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funds.\8\

    The Public Assistance Program, authorized primarily by 
Sections 406 and 428 of the Stafford Act, reimburses state, 
tribal, and territorial governments as well as certain private 
non-profits for rebuilding damaged buildings and 
infrastructure.\9\ The Federal cost-share for Public Assistance 
is 75 percent but may be increased by the President.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Individual Assistance Program is authorized primarily 
by Section 408 of the Stafford Act. The Individual Assistance 
program includes the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), 
Mass Care and Emergency Assistance, the Crisis Counseling 
Assistance and Training Program, Disaster Unemployment 
Assistance, Disaster Legal Services, and Disaster Case 
Management. IHP is the primary FEMA program used to assist 
disaster survivors; it includes housing assistance and other 
needs assistance. Housing assistance includes money for repair, 
rental assistance, or ``direct assistance,'' such as the 
provision of temporary housing.\11\ The current limits for IHP 
assistance is $37,900 for housing assistance and $37,900 for 
other needs assistance.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Section 404 of the Stafford Act authorizes HMGP, which is 
based on a percentage of Public Assistance funding, to provide 
grants to state, tribal, and territorial governments for 
mitigation projects that: (1) are cost effective and (2) reduce 
the risk of future damage, hardship, and loss from natural 
hazards.\13\ The purpose of this grant program is to fund 
practical mitigation measures that effectively reduce the risk 
of loss of life and property from future disasters. State, 
tribal, and territorial governments may use their HMGP funds to 
assist families in reducing the risk to their homes from 
natural disasters. The Federal cost share for HMGP is 75 
percent and the remaining 25 percent can come from a variety of 
sources (i.e. a cash payment from the state or local 
government).\14\

                III. STATUS OF THE DISASTER RELIEF FUND

IMMEDIATE NEEDS FUNDING GUIDANCE

    The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a no-year appropriation 
against which FEMA can direct, coordinate, manage, and fund 
eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic 
major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm state resources 
pursuant to the Stafford Act.\15\ Through the DRF, FEMA can 
fund authorized Federal disaster support activities as well as 
eligible state, territorial, tribal, and local actions such as 
providing emergency protection and debris removal.\16\ The DRF 
also funds the repair and restoration of qualifying disaster-
damaged public infrastructure, hazard mitigation initiatives, 
financial assistance to eligible disaster survivors, and FMAGs 
for qualifying large forest or grassland wildfires.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    From January to June 2024, FEMA's monthly obligations from 
the DRF averaged high levels, with significant monthly 
expenditures due to both new major disaster and open disaster 
declarations.\18\ Due to projected shortfalls in the DRF and 
concern that the agency may be unable to meet its Stafford Act 
obligations, FEMA enacted Immediate Needs Funding (INF) on 
August 29, 2024. Under INF, FEMA restricts the use of funds to 
prioritize life-saving operations over longer-term recovery 
projects until additional funds are allocated by Congress.\19\ 
2024 was the tenth time FEMA has implemented INF guidance since 
2001.\20\

    In September, a Continuing Resolution (CR) passed by 
Congress provided an additional $20.261 billion in budget 
authority to FEMA. FEMA lifted INF restrictions on October 2, 
2024.\21\ That same day, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters at a press 
conference that ``FEMA does not have the funds to make it 
through the [hurricane] season.'' \22\ By October 9, 2024, FEMA 
had spent approximately $9 billion, or 45 percent, of its 
disaster allocation on projects delayed during the INF 
period.\23\ FEMA is monitoring the balance of the DRF and will 
reimplement INF to preserve the availability of funds for 
immediate disaster response efforts if needed.\24\

COVID-19 REIMBURSEMENTS

    During the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting Nationwide 
emergency, the President authorized the provision of assistance 
to states and territories through the DRF. While supplemental 
appropriations were allocated to help cover the costs of the 
Federal pandemic response, funding levels have not kept pace 
with FEMA's actual obligations. In 2020, FEMA estimated 
spending $17.6 billion for COVID-19 assistance.\25\ As of March 
2024, FEMA reported expending $125.3 billion from the DRF for 
COVID-19 assistance and expects to continue obligating funds 
through August 2026.\26\

    According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), outlays 
for the COVID-19 response have accounted for 20 percent of all 
DRF expenditures between 1992 and 2021, making it the costliest 
single event in DRF history.\27\ In 2024, FEMA anticipated 
spending around $19.8 billion, or 40 percent of its total 
obligations for the year, on reimbursements related to pandemic 
activities.\28\

DHS OIG REPORT

    On August 14, 2024, the DHS Office of Inspector General 
(OIG) released a report estimating that FEMA has more than 847 
open disaster declarations, totaling $73 billion in 
unliquidated obligations.\29\ Of these, $8.3 billion were 
associated with 79 disasters declared in 2012 or earlier, 
including 26 with expired Periods of Performance (POP).\30\ 
Under the statute, these expired POPs represent $9.4 million 
that could be returned to the DRF and made available for other 
Stafford Act activities. The OIG has recommended that FEMA 
conduct a thorough review of all expired POPs across authorized 
grant programs and appropriately deobligate the funds to return 
them to the DRF.\31\

                 IV. FEMA'S RESPONSE TO 2024 DISASTERS

CURRENT STAFFORD ACT DECLARATIONS

    In 2024, FEMA has provided assistance for 89 Presidentially 
declared emergencies and major disasters including: Hurricane 
Beryl, Hurricane Debby, Hurricane Francine, Hurricane Helene, 
Hurricane Milton, western wildfires, and multiple unnamed 
severe storms, landslides, and an active tornado seasons that 
impacted many states across the country.\32\ The 2024 Atlantic 
Hurricane Season has a death toll of at least 326.\33\ Although 
disaster damage estimates are still being calculated, the 
latest overall estimates exceed $300 billion.\34\ While 2020 
holds the all-time record for Presidentially declared 
emergencies and major disasters due to declarations related to 
COVID-19, at 230,\35\ the size and severity of Stafford Act 
declarations in 2024 have drawn congressional attention to 
FEMA's resource constraints and response challenges, 
particularly as it relates to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\36\

September 26, 2024, as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum 
sustained winds of 140 miles per hour.\37\ As Helene traveled 
across the Appalachian Region, it resulted in catastrophic 
flooding, landslides, and tornadoes. Currently, six states 
(Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and 
South Carolina) have major declared disasters associated with 
Helene, and Alabama is under an emergency declaration.\38\ Just 
two weeks later, Hurricane Milton formed in the Gulf of Mexico 
and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane with peak 
windspeeds of 180 miles per hour.\39\ By the time Milton made 
landfall near Siesta Key on October 9, 2024, the storm had 
weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, but it brought a front of 
deadly tornados and storm surge to Florida.\40\

                             V. CONCLUSION

    FEMA currently has active disaster declarations for recent 
floods, hurricanes, and wildfires that have impacted multiple 
regions across the United States, including the aftermath of 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Given the intensity and frequency 
of these 2024 disasters and the current fiscal state of the 
DRF, the hearing will focus on evaluating the Nation's current 
state of disaster readiness, response, and recovery efforts 
under FEMA's leadership. The hearing will examine FEMA's 
resource allocation strategies, coordination with state and 
local partners, and response agility, with an emphasis on 
identifying improvements to support communities facing repeated 
and complex disasters.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF PENNSYLVANIA, 
    CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC 
              BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

    Mr. Perry. I thank the witnesses for being here today to 
discuss FEMA's response to Hurricane Helene and other 2024 
disasters, as well as the broader impact of FEMA's disaster 
recovery policies on the Agency's response efforts.
    First and foremost, our hearts go out to everyone affected 
by these disasters. Communities impacted by these storms are 
clearly facing a long and difficult road to recovery. While we 
might not always agree on who should be the tip of the spear 
when it comes to emergency response, disaster survivors deserve 
to know that help is available, and taxpayer resources intended 
to provide for their recovery should be used effectively and 
fairly.
    Just last week, there were extremely concerning press 
reports from Lake Placid, Florida, that FEMA skipped over homes 
impacted by Hurricane Milton that displayed signs supporting 
President-elect Trump. While the FEMA Administrator quickly 
responded that the employee was terminated, it is very clear 
from a recent interview that the employee believes she was 
carrying out direction from the Agency and suggested that this 
avoidance tactic occurred not only in Florida, but also in the 
Carolinas.
    Last month, while FEMA was quick to issue a rumor control 
page arguing that criticisms of the response would discourage 
people from applying for aid, FEMA workers themselves were 
apparently avoiding the very disaster victims we are talking 
about.
    Let me be clear. The thousands of men and women who deploy 
to help communities across this Nation serve an important role 
for the American people. I am not disparaging those workers. To 
the contrary, it seems this particular worker believes she is 
being treated like the scapegoat, and if that is the case, more 
people at FEMA must be held accountable.
    In response to these claims, the committee sent a letter to 
the Administrator last week requesting information and 
documents pertaining to the allegations of this FEMA employee. 
The Chair asks unanimous consent that this letter be included 
in the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I hope we will get responses to the questions posed in that 
letter and that the Administrator is prepared to discuss the 
issue today.
    More broadly, as we assess FEMA's response to recent 
disasters, I believe there are other critical areas we also 
need to address. First, aid needs to reach impacted communities 
quickly without unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. Early on, 
there were reports from North Carolina, in particular, 
residents concerned about FEMA's slow reaction pace to the 
storm and feeling as though they were left to fend for 
themselves. In fact, there are still areas FEMA has not reached 
to assess the damage. I can't wrap my head around the fact that 
the Federal agency charged with leading our response to 
disasters cannot seem to maneuver to homes in the mountains of 
western North Carolina. I mean, as an editorial, my goodness, 
one of the Members of Congress was somehow able to navigate to 
these areas. I was in contact with him asking for the 
information because I couldn't get it anywhere else, and he was 
giving me firsthand accounts at the time.
    Well, then we learned how long of a process it has been for 
FEMA to deliver temporary housing trailers to communities in 
western North Carolina living without power and heat. Clearly, 
something is wrong with FEMA's process. I hope that my 
congressional colleagues on our first panel will provide us 
with candid insights into FEMA's response to Hurricane Helene, 
the successes you have seen, and the areas where there is cause 
for concern.
    In past disasters, we have seen delays in relief reaching 
the ground, sometimes due to the scope of the disaster's impact 
and the resulting infrastructure damage, but also because of 
redtape and complex requirements. It seems at every turn, there 
is some regulation, policy, or ``this is the way we have always 
done it'` approach that defies common sense.
    For example, as Secretary Mayorkas mentioned recently that 
the Disaster Relief Fund was being depleted, right after we 
appropriated $20 billion, the DHS inspector general noted 
billions of unspent funds tied to delayed disaster closeouts of 
up to 16 years.
    Congress and this committee continue to pass bills to 
streamline FEMA assistance, but it seems the more we try to cut 
redtape, FEMA adds more or just simply doesn't change course. I 
am eager to hear from FEMA today on how they have worked with 
the Federal, State, and local partners to speed up this 
process.
    In response to concerns about FEMA's response to the recent 
disasters, on October 11, Chairman Sam Graves and I sent a 
letter to FEMA raising critical questions about the response to 
Hurricane Helene, reports of the slow pace of FEMA aid, and the 
state of the DRF.
    The Chair now asks unanimous consent that this letter be 
included in the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    The response from the FEMA Administrator described how the 
continuing resolution passed by Congress brought the balance of 
the DRF to $21.9 billion, and FEMA immediately obligated $8.8 
billion in previously delayed projects. This reduced available 
funds for future disasters to $13.1 billion.
    The Chair asks unanimous consent that FEMA's response 
letter also be included in the record.
    And, without objection, so ordered.
    [The three letters referenced by Mr. Perry are on pages 71-
88.]
    Mr. Perry. I am deeply troubled by how fast the DRF was 
depleted. Equally troubling are FEMA's forays into providing 
sheltering assistance to illegal aliens at the southern border, 
which has cost taxpayers more than $1 billion since 2019. 
Although these funds have not come from the DRF, they are 
certainly taking dollars and staffing resources away from 
helping American citizens in need.
    FEMA's focus should be--correction--FEMA's focus should 
remain on helping communities respond to and recover from 
natural disasters, rather than on diverting taxpayer resources 
towards political initiatives like exacerbating the crisis at 
the southern border, climate change, or picking and choosing 
which homes to canvas based on political signs.
    With that, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on 
these topics.

    Mr. Perry. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member 
Titus for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DINA TITUS OF NEVADA, RANKING MEMBER, 
  SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND 
                      EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

    Ms. Titus. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank our 
witnesses for joining us, the Administrator, and our 
colleagues, Representatives Edwards and Castor, whose districts 
and communities have been greatly impacted by this year's 
deadly and devastating hurricane season.
    As I have said many times before, in this committee and 
beyond, climate change and its related severe weather events 
have changed the disaster landscape, and they have strained 
capacity for all levels of Government to respond. What's more, 
the data shows that these disasters are becoming more 
expensive, they are lasting longer, and they are having a 
greater impact on our communities than ever before. While we 
still await exact figures, preliminary estimates show that the 
combined pricetag for just Hurricanes Milton and Helene will 
eclipse $170 billion.
    So far this year, FEMA has provided assistance for 89--89--
Presidentially declared emergencies and major disasters, 
including those covering hurricanes, wildfires, landslides, and 
tornadoes.
    One of the main sources for providing support to disaster-
stricken communities, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, is FEMA's 
Disaster Relief Fund, the DRF, which funds repair and 
restoration of public infrastructure. It supports hazard 
mitigation initiatives, and it provides financial assistance to 
disaster survivors. When the program is nearing depletion, 
however, it enters Immediate Needs Funding, INF, which pauses 
all DRF-funded projects that are not lifesaving operations. 
Since 2001, INF has been implemented 10 times, the most recent 
being just August of this year.
    The current continuing resolution provides $20 billion in 
budget authority for the DRF, so, FEMA is no longer operating 
under INF. We know, however, these funding challenges will 
continue as fewer than $5 billion currently remains in that 
budget. That is why President Biden submitted a $100 billion 
supplementary request to Congress yesterday, and that includes 
$40 billion for FEMA. Congress must pass the supplemental to 
sufficiently fund the DRF so FEMA can continue to support 
ongoing recovery efforts, as well as address those that will 
undoubtedly emerge in the future. This funding is not for FEMA. 
It is for FEMA to provide to communities and individuals 
impacted.
    We also need to provide solutions for survivors and 
communities so they can recover more quickly and to ensure that 
resources are deployed fairly. One of those solutions is my 
Disaster Survivors Fairness Act, which I introduced with my 
colleagues Congressmen Garret Graves and Troy Carter, and 
Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon. It also has the support 
of Congressman Chuck Edwards, who you will hear from later 
today.
    One of the most important aspects of the bill, which has 
already passed this committee unanimously at the beginning of 
the Congress, is to simplify the process for seeking assistance 
following a major disaster. It does this by creating a 
universal relief application across Federal agencies so that we 
can ease the burden on families and small businesses, get rid 
of some of the redtape, speed up the process, because these are 
the worst days of their lives, and they need to have at least 
some assistance in the application process.
    In this committee, we have held numerous hearings on the 
challenges faced by FEMA's workforce, and I look forward to 
discussing those today. As we move forward, however, we must 
also acknowledge the impact misinformation has on the ability 
to respond to these events. I was disgusted with the ridiculous 
rumors that were floating around, cautioning people that 
Government was going to bulldoze over their communities, seize 
their homes, and divert disaster aid to other programs. And 
those who perpetuated these claims, spread the claims, claimed 
that they were legitimate, well, shame on you. That just makes 
the process even worse.
    I was also very upset to learn that a FEMA employee 
directed her Disaster Survivor Assistance Team to skip homes 
that had Trump signs. I condemn the employee's decision about 
discriminating with aid, that should never be the case, and 
Administrator Criswell immediately did the right thing when she 
learned about this incident by firing the employee and 
referring the case to the Office of Special Counsel.
    To my colleagues testifying today and to Administrator 
Criswell, we recognize the challenges you are facing, and this 
committee wants to do what it can to help aid your help to 
those in the recovery process. So, I look forward to your 
testimony and hope that we can stick to the issues at hand and 
not use this as a springboard to get into politics.
    And I yield back.

  Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress

        Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our witnesses for joining 
us today, including my colleagues Reps. Edwards and Castor, whose 
communities are among the many that have been impacted by this year's 
deadly and devastating hurricane season.
    As I have said time and time again, climate change and its related 
severe weather events have changed the disaster landscape and strained 
capacity for all levels of government to respond. What's more is that 
data shows these disasters are becoming more expensive and have a 
greater impact on our communities than ever before. While we still 
await exact figures, preliminary estimates show that the combined price 
tag for just Hurricanes Milton and Helene will eclipse $90 billion.
    So far this year, FEMA has provided assistance for 89 
Presidentially declared emergencies and major disasters including those 
covering hurricanes, wildfires, landslides, and tornadoes.
    One of the main sources for providing support to disaster-stricken 
communities is FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) which funds repair and 
restoration of public infrastructure, supports hazard mitigation 
initiatives, and provides financial assistance to disaster survivors.

the most recent being August of this year.
    The current Continuing Resolution provides $20 billion in budget 
authority for the DRF, so FEMA is no longer operating under INF. We 
know, however, these funding challenges will continue as fewer than $5 
billion currently remains in the DRF. That is why President Biden 
submitted a $100 billion supplemental request to Congress yesterday, 
which includes $40 billion for FEMA. Congress must pass a supplemental 
to sufficiently fund the DRF so FEMA can continue to support ongoing 
recovery efforts, as well as address those that will undoubtedly emerge 
in the future.
    We also need to provide solutions for survivors and communities to 
recover more quickly and to ensure resources are being deployed fairly. 
One of those solutions is my Disaster Survivors Fairness Act, which I 
introduced with my colleagues Congressman, Garret Graves, Congressman

cautioning people that the government was going to bulldoze over 
stricken communities, seize homes, and that FEMA was diverting disaster 
aid to other programs. To those who permeated these claims, shame on 
you!
    I was also outraged to learn that a FEMA employee directed her 
disaster survivor assistance team to skip helping homes with Trump 
signs. I firmly condemn that employee's decision; FEMA should never 
discriminate when providing disaster aid. Administrator Criswell 
immediately did the right thing when she learned of this incident--the 
employee was fired and the case referred to the Office of Special 
Counsel.
    To my colleagues testifying today, and to Administrator Criswell, 
we recognize the challenges you are facing, and this committee wants to 
do everything it can to aid with your recovery efforts. I look forward 
to your testimony and I yield back.

    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlewoman. The Chair now 
recognizes the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Graves, for 
5 minutes for his opening statement.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN, 
         COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Chairman Perry, and I do 
want to thank our witnesses for testifying today.
    This hearing comes at a crucial time. We are being told 
that a supplemental appropriations bill is needed after 
Congress recently appropriated $20 billion to the Disaster 
Relief Fund. There have been ongoing concerns about how long 
FEMA takes to provide aid and rebuild after a disaster.
    Further, this committee has highlighted concerns that the 
Biden administration has prioritized equity, climate change, 
and assistance to migrants over disaster victims and readiness 
and response efforts. And then we add, on top of all of this, 
the recent shocking reports that FEMA workers purposely avoided 
hurricane-impacted homes that displayed signs in support of 
President Trump. Each of these reports alone are unacceptable, 
but combined, they show a pattern of incompetence within the 
Agency.
    For more than a decade, I have sponsored and supported 
numerous pieces of legislation aimed at speeding up FEMA aid, 
cutting the bureaucracy and the redtape, and creating more 
transparency. But it seems that, despite these efforts, FEMA 
somehow finds new ways to make the recovery process more 
difficult for impacted communities.
    The Agency is accountable directly to the President, and 
so, the buck stops with the President regarding the constant 
mismanagement and lack of focus on its core mission.
    I trust that under new leadership, we will finally be able 
to reform FEMA in a way that works to support all Americans and 
refocus the Agency on what it is supposed to do, and that is: 
help people prepare for and recover from disasters without 
regard to an individual's political views.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield back.

 from the State of Missouri, and Chairman, Committee on Transportation 
                           and Infrastructure
    This hearing comes at a critical time. We are being told a 
supplemental appropriations bill is needed after Congress recently 
appropriated $20 billion to the Disaster Relief Fund. There have been 
ongoing concerns about how long FEMA takes to provide aid and rebuild 
after a disaster.
    Further, this committee has highlighted concerns that the Biden 
Administration has prioritized equity, climate change, and assistance 
to migrants over disaster victims and readiness and response efforts. 
And then we add on top of all of this the recent shocking reports that 
FEMA workers purposefully avoided hurricane impacted homes that 
displayed signs in support of President Trump. Each of these reports 
alone is unacceptable--but combined they show a pattern of incompetence 
from the agency.
    For more than a decade, I have sponsored and supported numerous 
pieces of legislation aimed at speeding up FEMA aid, cutting 
bureaucracy and red tape, and creating more transparency. But it seems 
like despite these efforts, FEMA somehow finds new ways to make the 
recovery process more difficult for impacted communities.
    The agency is accountable directly to the President, and so the 
buck stops with the President regarding the constant mismanagement and 
lack of focus on its core mission.
    I trust that under new leadership, we will finally be able to 
reform FEMA in a way that works to support all Americans and refocus 
the agency on what it is supposed to do--help people prepare for and 
recover from disasters without regard for an individual's political 
views.

    Mr. Perry. The chairman thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. 
Larsen, for 5 minutes for his opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING 
     MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank 
the subcommittee Ranking Member Dina Titus. Just one more 
speech, and then we will get to the Members of Congress panel, 
but thanks for calling this hearing today.
    The devastation that Hurricanes Helene and Milton created 
in the Southeast and Appalachia is gut-wrenching. Over 200 
individuals lost their lives to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. 
The storms have left over $170 billion of damage in their 
wakes. So, that is the dollar amount we know of. Damage to 
water infrastructure in western North Carolina was so severe 
that much of the region still does not have drinkable tap 
water.
    To aid affected communities, the administration approved 
major disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. So, the 
recovery will take a lot of work, and we are ready to provide 
the resources needed, and I am grateful that Representatives 
Edwards and Castor are here today to share what they have seen 
on the ground in their districts as a result. And I think they, 
along with the rest of Congress, would agree that we have to 
focus on passing a disaster supplemental immediately.
    Without funding, Federal agencies, including FEMA and the 
Small Business Administration, cannot fulfill their missions 
and help disaster survivors. For over a month now, the Small 
Business Administration disaster fund has been empty. In that 
time, the applications of over 11,000 survivors have been 
approved for disaster loan assistance, but they will not 
receive any money until Congress makes more funding available.
    It is not a new problem. Congress has failed to approve 
critical, long-term recovery funds for disasters in 2023 and 
2024 that occurred in 21 States, ranging from Alabama and 
Arkansas to Texas, Vermont, and Washington State.
    FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund is once again approaching 
concerningly low levels, with less than $5 billion remaining. 
That sounds like a lot of money, but it is not a lot of money 
when you consider the cost of these disasters. Disaster 
survivors should not be left wondering if promised disaster aid 
is coming. After losing everything, families should be focused 
on rebuilding their lives, not worrying about congressional 
dysfunction.
    Again, this is not isolated to the challenges that the 
people in North Carolina and Florida are facing; they are 
challenges that even my constituents are facing from previous 
disasters. So, I would just call on the Speaker to schedule a 
vote for Congress to consider President Biden's $100 billion 
disaster supplemental request as soon as possible.
    Now, in the wake of catastrophic disasters, it is important 
for Congress and FEMA to take stock of lessons learned. The 
misinformation that has circulated after recent disasters is 
creating barriers to recovery and putting disaster relief 
workers at risk. The presence of misinformation after disasters 
is not new. After Hurricane Katrina, false reports of 
widespread looting bred chaos and led to the tragic shooting of 
civilians, as an example. After the Maui wildfires, bogus 
claims that the Federal Government would steal survivors' land 
were widely circulated, harming those in need of assistance.
    False rumors following Hurricane Helene, especially in 
North Carolina, were described by Administrator Criswell as the 
worst misinformation she has ever heard. These rumors increased 
distrust in the Federal Government, resulting in armed threats 
against FEMA workers in the field and caused some survivors to 
refuse Federal assistance. The spread of misinformation on 
social media after disasters is increasing, and this committee 
needs to work with FEMA to find solutions that can contain this 
phenomenon in the future.
    I am disappointed that the President-elect himself 
amplified the misinformation by falsely claiming FEMA spent all 
of their funding on housing undocumented migrants. We can have 
a difference of opinion on whether that funding should occur, 
but that information was false. He also said FEMA would provide 
only $750 to disaster survivors who lost everything, which, 
again, is false.
    To set the record straight, disaster survivors may be 
eligible for up to $42,500 of home repair assistance and 
$42,500 of other needs assistance from FEMA. And perhaps the 
debate we should have is whether that should be increased or 
not.
    And it is the responsibility of all Members of Congress to 
correct that record, regardless of who is providing the 
misinformation, and lead rather than amplify, lead in providing 
good information, like Representative Edwards did 
unapologetically and consistently in western North Carolina.
    Now, reports following Helene and Milton also indicate it 
is still too difficult for survivors to access FEMA assistance. 
Again, not isolated to Helene and Milton. Same problem in my 
district and many other districts around the country in 
previous disasters.
    First, the lack of a universal application for Federal 
assistance means survivors may have to complete separate 
applications for several Federal agencies to receive the 
assistance they are entitled to. That is why this committee 
supports Ranking Member Titus' and Representative Garret 
Graves' bipartisan bill to create a universal application for 
Federal disaster assistance.
    Second, I am troubled by reports that 47 percent of calls 
made to FEMA during the week of October 14 through 20 were not 
answered, and that of the more than 260,000 survivors that 
registered for FEMA assistance, nearly 50 percent have been 
denied. Difficulty accessing this assistance is not unique to 
this disaster. The Government Accountability Office conducted 
nationwide interviews about disaster responses occurring 
between 2016 and 2020 and found that FEMA regularly faces 
challenges managing its call center and field staff.
    FEMA often responds to high denial rates by saying 
survivors can appeal their award decision. That is not an 
adequate response, nor is that an adequate solution. Eligible 
survivors should have to fill out one application for FEMA 
assistance, and it should be this committee's intent to make 
accessing FEMA aid simple and easy.
    Finally, when Administrator Criswell gets here, we will 
have questions for her, but I do want to thank her for her 
service to this country as the first female FEMA Administrator 
and for all the positive policies she has implemented during 
her tenure.
    I want to thank you all for being here, and I look forward 
to our Members' views on Helene and Milton.
    With that, I yield back.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. CHUCK EDWARDS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

    Mr. Edwards. Thank you, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member 
Titus, and the members of the subcommittee. I appreciate this 
opportunity to speak to you today about FEMA's response to 
Hurricane Helene in North Carolina's 11th Congressional 
District. As a former member of this subcommittee, it is a 
privilege to offer a unique perspective, especially after being 
on the ground for 7 weeks during one of the deadliest storms to 
hit the mainland United States in the last 50 years.
    To put this disaster into perspective, Hurricane Helene 
took 230 lives across 7 States; 102 of those lives were in 
North Carolina. And tragically, 80 of those were from the 
district that I represent. Eighty of those were from the 
district that I represent. Only three storms since 1950 have 
claimed more lives, with Hurricane Katrina being the most 
notable among those.
    The storm struck western North Carolina on September 27, 
2024. The National Weather Service issued early and dire 
warnings about the threat of catastrophic flooding, as 10 to 15 
inches of rain had already swelled rivers and creeks over the 
previous 3 days. And while this storm claimed 230 lives, I 
think it is important for me to tell you that NOAA and the 
National Weather Service worked expertly to save countless more 
lives.
    However, the destruction that followed was immense. In some 
areas, water crested up to 40 feet above its normal levels, 
destroying entire communities as it rushed through the mountain 
valleys, carrying away homes, cars, and roads. And massive 
landslides crushed many unsuspecting victims while they thought 
they were in the safety of their homes from the raging waters.
    The economic damage in North Carolina alone is estimated at 
$53 billion, with only about 5 percent of this damage covered 
by insurance. In the aftermath, FEMA's response was in some 
ways effective, but there were significant issues that need to 
be addressed. FEMA's core responsibility is to coordinate 
Federal emergency management efforts and support State and 
local officials with critical resources. It seemed to me and 
many local officials in western North Carolina that it took up 
to 3 days before there was any real visibility from FEMA, and 
that is just simply not good enough.
    Allow me to put this in perspective. The storm was over on 
September 27, for all practical purposes, at about 10 a.m. We 
had 1 million people without power. We had 25 water systems 
destroyed. And for it to take 3 days for the visibility of FEMA 
is just not acceptable. There were folks in their homes not 
only without power, they couldn't flush toilets, they had no 
drinking water. We were shut off from the rest of the world.
    And I can't help but think, had this been an attack on 
American soil, would it take, should it take 3 days to see any 
real evidence of help from our Federal Government? I would hope 
not.
    The distribution of supplies in the immediate aftermath of 
Helene left much to be desired. For example, on day 3 after the 
storm, FEMA announced to me that it had delivered 400 pallets 
of desperately needed water to western North Carolina. But when 
asked where those supplies had been delivered, FEMA couldn't 
provide one single location. They deferred responsibility to 
the State, which left local officials in the dark about where 
resources were going, and who could also not answer my simple 
question.
    A major concern in my district was FEMA's slow response in 
getting boots on the ground in some areas. For example, in one 
county, FEMA didn't arrive until over a week after the storm, 
and it wasn't until 20 days later that a disaster recovery 
center was opened.
    In addition, FEMA's communication with local governments 
and the public was inconsistent and at times confusing. On one 
occasion, FEMA sent out a press release stating that a disaster 
recovery center would close temporarily without informing local 
officials, only to retract it hours later after confusion, 
numerous inquiries, and local demands.
    Other failures include FEMA personnel changes with little 
or no notice to county governments, no-shows for scheduled 
appointments, issuing hotel vouchers to displaced families that 
could only be redeemed 2 hours from those displaced families' 
work or school, an inefficient inspection process that slows 
consideration of critical benefits, and the 50-percent 
threshold for ``substantial improvement'` and ``substantial 
damage'` definitions and their required actions are riddled 
with inconsistencies and irrational thinking. I could share 
with you many other breakdowns in the FEMA response, but 5 
minutes is just not enough time.
    My office is also seeing a significant number of casework 
issues related to FEMA's Individual Assistance process. 
Constituents have reported receiving confusing correspondence, 
especially regarding initial denials, which only adds to the 
stress and confusion for people already dealing with the 
aftermath of the storm.
    I don't share these issues to criticize FEMA or its 
employees on the ground. Many hard-working men and women are 
doing everything that they can in incredibly difficult 
circumstances. However, as Congress, it is our job to conduct 
rigorous oversight and ensure that FEMA is held accountable and 
improves upon their processes. We must address the flaws in 
FEMA's response to prevent further delays and confusion in the 
recovery process.
    And in conclusion, the people of western North Carolina are 
tired. The grief that they are experiencing is compounded by 
bureaucratic missteps, delays, and poor communication.
    Thank you again for this opportunity, and I would welcome 
any questions that you may have.
    [Mr. Edwards' prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
Prepared Statement of Hon. Chuck Edwards, a Representative in Congress 
                    from the State of North Carolina
    Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today 
regarding FEMA's response to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina's 11th 
Congressional District.
    I have the unique pleasure of being a former Member of this very 
subcommittee and am heartened by your willingness and interest in 
having me testify ahead of FEMA's Administrator, The Honorable Deanne 
Criswell, to give you an alternate perspective to FEMA disaster 
response that I gained by being on the ground during one of the most 
recent and deadliest storms to hit the mainland United States in the 
last 50 years.
    Before diving into FEMA response, I want to briefly take a moment 
to put this disaster into perspective for you. Hurricane Helene took 
230 lives across seven states. 102 of those lives were from my home 
state of North Carolina, and 80 of those 102 were direct constituents 
of the community I represent, North Carolina's 11th Congressional 
district.\1\ Only three storms since 1950 have surpassed the death toll 
from Hurricane Helene, and only one of those storms, Hurricane Katrina, 
has taken place since 2000.\2\

hurricanes-since-1980/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the days prior to the storm's arrival in Western North Carolina 
on September 27, the National Weather Service's Greenville-Spartanburg 
team were deeply concerned by the 10-15 inches of rain that had already 
swelled rivers and creeks in the mountains to dangerous levels, and 
issued numerous dire warnings for individuals to evacuate well before 
conditions became catastrophic.
    In my view, the men and women of the National Weather Service (NWS) 
saved many thousands of lives by getting critical warnings into the 
community as early as possible. In a statement posted to X on September 
28, the NWS team characterized Helene as ``the worst event in our 
office's history.''
    Helene not only ravaged our people, but nearly 30-foot flooding 
crests absolutely destroyed our communities too. It was not quick 
flooding like you might expect on the coast where water comes in and 
goes out in one fell swoop. Water swelled over 20-30 feet in areas, 
forming rapids as the water got caught between mountains and rushed to 
funnel out at singular flow points, picking up and taking homes, cars, 
and entire roadways, with it.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In American history, only eight hurricanes have reached the $50 
billion damage threshold across the multiple states they impacted.\4\ 
For Hurricane Helene, the NC Office of State Budget and Management has 
calculated at least $53 billion in damage in North Carolina alone, not 
including the six other states of impact. Even worse, Aon Edge 
Insurance Agency, which specializes in flood coverage, estimates an 
average of 44% of all hurricane damage being insured. In the case of 
Helene, a generous 5% of damage has been estimated as insured, though 
the company believes that estimate is high.\5\ Also, according to 
Census Bureau and National Flood Insurance Program data, only 0.7% of 
residences of NC-impacted counties had flood insurance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FEMA's response was bound to be a bit clunky; the mountains are not 
a traditional location for flooding of this magnitude. And while I 
would like to applaud FEMA for their overall response to Helene, there 
are quite a few sticking points that I think, with the help of this 
committee, could be improved.
    First and foremost, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's core 
responsibility following a hurricane is to coordinate federal emergency 
management efforts and provide support, resources, and expertise to 
state and local emergency managers. Within this responsibility is the 
distribution of pre-staged resources like water and food to hard-hit 
communities.
    Hurricane Helene hit on September 27, 2024. Immediately following 
the storm, local governments were focused on emergency services. 
Contracted FEMA teams, called Urban Search & Rescue, were there on day 
one alongside county folk, conducting search and rescue operations, 
providing emergency medical services, and the like; however, by day 
two, local folks started to turn their attention to the greater 
community's basic needs, beginning with food and water.
    During a FEMA briefing on hurricane response on September 29, 2024, 
FEMA stated that they had delivered 400 pallets of water to Western 
North Carolina. When pressed about where in Western North Carolina 
those truckloads were delivered, Federal Emergency Management personnel 
could not name one single location where one single pallet had been 
delivered. Instead, FEMA kicked the bucket to the state, sharing that 
they had provided the pallets to North Carolina Emergency Management 
who was then responsible for distribution.
    For days, seemingly nobody in Western North Carolina was receiving 
supplies and nobody with the State or Federal government could share 
where the resources they were promoting had been sent. NC Emergency 
Management had their own hiccups in this whole process, but if the 
federal government is going to use taxpayer dollars to purchase 
recovery resources for impacted communities, does it not feel prudent 
to follow those resources to their final location so the government can 
ensure resources are making it to the people they were meant to 
support?
    In the past 5 years, FEMA has been activated to respond to 911 
disasters and other declarations.\6\ How much fraud, waste, and abuse 
and do you think has or could take place if FEMA is dishing out 
resources and not following up on final delivery to the final 
recipient? It is not unreasonable to think that FEMA should know where 
the resources they are providing get delivered, and it's my belief that 
this committee can and should address this issue for future disasters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A major concern my staff and I have encountered through our local 
government counterparts is the inconsistency of both delivery of 
services and reliability of information provided by FEMA officials to 
the community, especially in the early and most dire weeks following 
the storm.
    I'd like to use Transylvania County as an example. County 
leadership, thanks in large part to the early warnings of the National 
Weather Service, issued a first-ever mandatory evacuation order and 
conducted over 60 swift-water rescues, underscoring the catastrophic 
nature of Helene's impact on the community.
    However, county officials were frustrated that it took FEMA over a 
week to get boots on the ground in their area, and it took until 
October 17 for a Disaster Recovery Center to be opened in the county. 
This delay in direct assistance on the ground, particularly in an area 
where internet capability was severely lacking, only served to slow the 
delivery of much-needed benefits.
    On October 16, officials in one of the counties in my district were 
provided by FEMA with confirmation that a Disaster Survivor Assistance 
(DSA) crew was going door-to-door in the county, but that was not the 
case--FEMA representation in the area that day was at a fixed location. 
Every day counts in the wake of a major disaster, and we can't afford 
lapses in accurate communication like what occurred that day.
    On October 21, we encountered a prime example of how FEMA 
miscommunication can sow confusion in the community, both among the 
public and local governments. That day, FEMA sent a media advisory that 
a DRC will be temporarily closed without informing the County manager, 
County liaison managing the facility or the County emergency Management 
Director. After a barrage of emails and calls, including from my 
office, FEMA retracted the press release and kept the facility open, 
all in the span of about three hours.
    This issue is compounded by the fact that FEMA, in their staff's 
own words to me at a DRC visit I made on that exact same day, relied in 
part on my office to spread the word about FEMA information, shifting 
disaster center sites, and the like. As my staff and I work to keep 
constituents informed through daily newsletters for over a month after 
the storm and once a week currently, we must be able to trust the 
information we receive from FEMA as factual, and instances like this 
are a cause for concern in that regard.
    As we moved from relief to recovery in Western North Carolina, my 
office has seen see a massive influx of FEMA-related casework. I hear a 
lot of the same things from my casework team and folks in the 
community--the correspondence they receive after filing their 
applications are not well-written and cause confusion, especially 
related to initial denials.
    FEMA inspections, a crucial component of the application process 
for individuals, are also in need of fine-tuning. On October 18, a 
constituent in Waynesville asked if the FEMA inspector that was coming 
to conduct a neighbor's inspection for their Individual Assistance 
application could do all of the applicants on their private road that 
day, as all of their applications related to clearing their road. FEMA 
told my office that the inspections are issued to the inspector's 
tablets and worked accordingly in the order they are received, and they 
have no control over inspection scheduling.
    This issue has also been proven frustrating in congregate living 
facilities, where multiple individuals are denied just because they are 
applying from the same address, and there is no ability in the 
application process to explain the situation, and the time-consuming 
appeal process is the only path forward.
    I also want to touch on a newer aspect of the FEMA assistance 
regime, the $750 in Serious Needs Assistance (SNA) program has served 
to help a lot of folks in my district with immediate needs, but it is 
evident that FEMA can learn from this disaster for improving the 
program's administration in the future.
    Based on my office's experience on the casework side, some people 
applied for just the SNA program and received it immediately while 
others applied for it and waited weeks. Others received a denial letter 
and then received the $750 afterward.
    Another prominent issue with SNA is that FEMA does not notify an 
individual when they deposit this into your account. One must 
constantly check their bank to know if they've received it.
    I share this report from the front-line not to disparage FEMA and 
the tireless work that thousands of its employees have carried out in 
Western North Carolina and other states. However, Congress, through 
rigorous oversight responsibilities, must hold the Agency accountable. 
To do so, we must delve deep into the good, the bad, and the ugly of 
FEMA's responses in impacted areas.
    I'll be frank--the folks back home are worn-out, and the 
frustration and grief that result from the unnecessary difficulties 
that FEMA's adjudication of their applications is stress that they do 
not need.
    I hope that in her testimony and through the question-and-answer 
that Administrator Criswell will face in the next panel, she lays out a 
clear and well-developed plan to remedy the shortfalls in their 
response that have held back the recovery of many in Western North 
Carolina.
    Chairman Perry and Ranking Member Titus, I thank you again for this 
opportunity and I welcome any of your questions.

    Mr. Perry. We thank the gentleman from North Carolina. The 
Chair now recognizes Congresswoman Castor for 5 minutes for her 
testimony.

 TESTIMONY OF HON. KATHY CASTOR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Ms. Castor of Florida. Well, thank you, Chair Perry and 
Ranking Member Titus, Chair Graves, and Ranking Member Larsen, 
and the entire committee for the opportunity to testify before 
the committee today. I really appreciate the opportunity to be 
here with Congressman Edwards.
    My heart goes out to your community, Congressman. Many 
Floridians have a special relationship with western North 
Carolina. We always think that this is a place that we can go 
to escape many of the impacts of the extreme summer heat, so, I 
don't think there is anywhere you can go right now to escape a 
lot of these extreme events. So, we have got to do a better job 
providing for our neighbors, strengthening our infrastructure.
    But this hurricane season was particularly costly and 
deadly for my community and the State of Florida. Think of the 
west coast. Think of from Congresswoman Cammack's district in 
the Big Bend, down through Representatives Bilirakis to Luna to 
Buchanan over to probably Congressman Webster. When Milton came 
over, it even spawned hurricanes over on the east coast in 
Representative Mast's district.
    So, this had really started in August. Hurricane Debby 
dumped an extraordinary amount of rainfall, 10 to 14 inches, on 
the State. But the real damage came September 26 with Hurricane 
Helene. It roared up the gulf, bringing a record 7 feet 8 
inches of storm surge along the coast. So, it has flooded out 
thousands of homes. It swamped the Coast Guard Air Station. It 
swamped MacDill Air Force Base that is the home to Special 
Operations Command and Central Command. It washed away the 
navigational channel markers for Port Tampa Bay so fuel could 
not be delivered. Whole neighborhoods were ruined, businesses 
ruined.
    But then, 2 weeks after that, on October 9, with some of 
our neighbors still in shelters, Hurricane Milton slammed into 
the State with wind speeds up to 105 miles per hour and a new 
record rainfall total of up to 18 inches in some areas that 
they said was a 1-in-1,000-year flood event. So, if you 
survived the storm surge of Helene, it is likely that you were 
flooded out weeks later by Milton, and many of the rivers took 
weeks to crest. There were widespread power outages; for some 
people, well over a week. This inhibited the ability of small 
businesses to bounce back. Many of these small business owners, 
are just--they have a very limited range of what they can take. 
So, when power was out, when fuel could not be distributed, 
when we have police officers guarding gas stations, folks are 
really asking--there must be a better way.
    So, here are a few recommendations on the aftermath and 
what I saw leading up to the catastrophes and the aftermath.
    The misinformation regarding FEMA was a real distraction. 
It was unnecessary. A lot of time was spent on combating that 
false information, rather than encouraging people to sign up. 
Communities need to understand where the damage has occurred, 
and people need those emergency funds right away.
    I am grateful for the Federal resources and personnel that 
were surged into the region, including Administrator Criswell 
being there a couple of times, pre-positioning of resources, 
search and rescue, the medical assistance teams, but also the 
guarantee that debris could be cleaned up. Local communities--
you would not believe the heartache and the cost of people 
having their lives out on the street. We have never seen 
anything like the scale of this. And to be able to say that 
FEMA is going to be there, that Congress is going to be there 
to help you clean up your communities is absolutely vital.
    The massive damage is going to require extensive rebuilding 
of homes and infrastructure across the area. And Floridians are 
resilient, but the impact of these back-to-back monster storms 
is straining our local resources. People are--my neighbors are 
already spending more on property insurance than any other 
place in the country. Electric bills are out of sight. They 
need Congress now to follow through with help and helping them 
rebuild their lives.
    What Ranking Member Larsen highlighted as the Small 
Business Administration to--there are so many homeowners and 
businesses that need to tap those low-interest loans. There is 
nowhere else to turn. You don't want them going on a credit 
card with those high interest rates to rebuild their lives. We 
have got to replenish the SBA fund right away.
    President Biden's proposal of the $98 billion disaster 
relief bill is good, it is robust. But the Congress now has to 
take the wheel and make sure that these dollars are getting to 
where they need to be.
    I understand the large-scale water and wastewater 
rebuilding that has to go on in North Carolina, but it is also 
all across the State of Florida. They were swamped. They have 
polluted bays, rivers, the Gulf of Mexico. And we are a tourism 
economy. We cannot rebound with polluted waterways. We have got 
to be able now to build back stronger, build back in a more 
resilient way, one that protects the taxpayer dollars so we 
don't go through this time and time again.
    Fifth, during widespread power outages, the traditional 
grid is destroyed. Like I highlighted, it took weeks in some 
places to get the power turned back on. We have got to be 
smarter about our electrical systems in this country and build 
in a more resilient way with microgrids, solar battery systems 
that can safeguard our critical infrastructure. We had 
hospitals lose power with patients inside. We had community 
health centers massively damaged. We had shelters where people 
were trying to stay safe, and the power went out for weeks. We 
have got to do a better job making sure that these places are 
safe and resilient from these extreme weather events.
    I will highlight a few other things in written testimony 
and answers to the committee, but thank you for inviting me to 
this important hearing today. The heating climate is costing us 
a lot, and we need to better adapt for our pocketbooks and for 
our people. Thank you very much for the chance to be here.
    [Ms. Castor of Florida's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Kathy Castor, a Representative in Congress 
                       from the State of Florida
    Chair Perry, Ranking Member Titus and Members of the Subcommittee:
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Committee about 
the devastating, back-to-back hurricanes, the coordinated response so 
far, and next steps for FEMA and the Congress.
    This was the most destructive hurricane season ever for the Tampa 
Bay area on the west coast of Florida. On August 5th, Hurricane Debby 
unleashed torrential rainfall across the state, where many of my 
neighbor experienced 10-14 inches of rain.
    The real damage came on September 26th, Hurricane Helene roared up 
the Gulf, bringing with it a record of 7,8,, of storm surge in Tampa 
Bay, unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes. Whole neighborhoods 
were flooded out and thousands of homes and businesses were ruined.
    And two weeks after that on October 9th, with some neighbors still 
in shelters, Hurricane Milton slammed into the state with wind speeds 
of up to 105 mph and a new record rainfall total of 12-18 inches--a 1-
in-1,000-year extreme rain event.
    This year (2024) is by far the wettest year on record in the Tampa 
Bay area--77.11,, of rain which is 33,, over the average yearly amount, 
and we still have over a month to go!
    My Tampa Bay area community was not the only community impacted by 
these extreme storms, but our experience grappling with the aftermath 
is instructive for how to better prepare and respond.
    First, I have spent the last seven weeks assessing the damage and 
speaking with my neighbors directly about the tragic losses of homes, 
livelihoods and property. Most people are of the view, and I agree, 
that the local, state and federal coordination in the immediate 
aftermath of the disasters was very good. FEMA personnel was embedded 
in county emergency operations centers and the State EOC. Emergency 
shelter, food, and water were distributed across the damaged areas 
right away. I also was pleased to see FEMA inspectors immediately out 
in the field assessing the damage, talking with homeowners and 
disbursing needed emergency funds.
    I am so grateful for the federal resources and personnel that were 
surged into our region, including a visit from Administrator Criswell. 
FEMA's prepositioning of strike force teams on the ground helped 
relieve pressure on state and local authorities and saved lives.
    Yet, I can tell you that the mis- and dis-information regarding 
FEMA was pervasive and harmful. We were constantly trying to beat back 
rumors that FEMA was out of money. If someone is discouraged from 
signing up for disaster assistance it risks a delay in resources or 
worse, endangers lives and property.
    FEMA has approved more than $2.1 billion in disaster assistance in 
Florida so far after the 3 hurricanes. This includes $975.5 million in 
awards directly to survivors, and over $1.18 billion in grants to state 
and local governments.
    Second, the massive damage will require extensive rebuilding of 
homes and infrastructure across the area.
    Floridians are resilient, but the impact of these back-to-back 
monster storms is straining local resources, as well as the bank 
accounts of my neighbors who are already paying more for property 
insurance and electric bills than just about anywhere else.
    It will require Congress to fund a comprehensive, forward-looking 
disaster supplemental package that allows us to rebuild in the smartest 
and most cost-effective way.
    Nearly everyone I have spoken to--from families to business owners 
to local officials--has said they need to use disaster assistance to 
rebuild with mitigation measures that will protect property from future 
damage. This is imperative in low-lying coastal areas like Tampa Bay, 
where natural disasters are becoming more costly, frequent and severe. 
If Congress wants to avoid costs in the future, we need to make smart 
investments now.
    Third, and more specifically, rebuilding homes and bringing them up 
to code is cost-prohibitive for many people. So while my neighbors 
appreciate the ability to secure a low-interest SBA loan for home 
repairs, they are disappointed to learn that they can only use up to 
20% of their loan to make upgrades.
    And while FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and Flood 
Mitigation Assistance can be used to help homeowners rebuild in a safer 
and stronger manner, these initiatives take years to arrive and are 
very competitive.
    We need to address this now to allow for flexible and larger loans 
to homeowners and small businesses to encourage more cost-saving 
mitigation and upgrades. This would go a long way towards keeping our 
communities whole and resilient.
    Fourth, instead of simply rebuilding water and wastewater 
infrastructure as they were before, communities need to be able to 
modernize now to avoid future costly disasters, such as installing 
upgraded pump stations and elevated lift stations and connecting the 
infrastructure to solar and resilient backup power sources. This could 
help municipalities avoid the spillage of tens of millions of gallons 
of sewage or communities being left without potable water for days.
    Fifth, during widespread power outages when the traditional grid is 
destroyed, hospitals, emergency shelters and food banks must be able to 
operate autonomously. Microgrids and solar/battery systems could play a 
lifesaving role by allowing critical infrastructure to continue 
functioning without waiting days for gas- and diesel-powered fuel 
distribution lines to restart after the next natural disaster.
    The losses from the triple-whammy of Hurricanes Debby, Helene and 
Milton exposed our outdated infrastructure. We can avoid future 
devastating hits to our economy, environment, public health and safety, 
and national security if Congress leads the way in mitigating future 
flood and disaster risks.
    Thank you for inviting me to this important hearing today as 
Congress begins to craft a disaster supplemental package with the goal 
of strengthening our communities and avoiding costs and loss in the 
future. Our planet, our pocketbooks, and our people depend on it.

    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks our witnesses. Are there 
questions?
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman?
    Mr. Perry. Mr. Graves.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I don't have any questions. I just 
want to, first of all, tell you how much I appreciate your 
efforts on behalf of your constituents.
    I did have the opportunity to visit western North Carolina 
with Congressman Chuck Edwards, and I am just so sorry for what 
happened to you and your constituents. I know that you are both 
working really hard to get them back on their feet. I want to 
thank you for your service and, again, just know that we are 
praying for you all's folks, and really sorry that you all are 
having to go through this, but thank you.
    Mr. Perry. Others?
    All right. Seeing none, thank you for being here today, and 
thank you for your testimony and your comments.
    This concludes the first panel, and I will give you a 
couple of minutes to go ahead and exit, and we are going to 
introduce the second panel. Thank you.
    [Pause.]
    Mr. Perry. All right. Administrator Criswell, thanks for 
your patience here, and thanks for your service. I am going to 
welcome you, as the FEMA Administrator, to our second panel.
    As a reminder, your written testimony has also been made 
part of the record, so, the subcommittee asks that you limit 
your oral remarks to 5 minutes. And with that, you are now 
recognized for that 5 minutes.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. DEANNE CRISWELL, ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL 
   EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
                            SECURITY

    Ms. Criswell. Thank you, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member 
Titus, and members of the committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify regarding FEMA's efforts in response to 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We value this committee's 
legislative support and oversight of our Agency, and I really 
look forward to our conversation today.
    On September 26, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida 
as a powerful, fast-moving category 4 storm with hurricane-
force winds extending 40 miles and tropical storm-force winds 
extending 310 miles from its center. Helene then entered 
Georgia as a category 2 hurricane before becoming a powerful 
tropical storm that continued to release historic rainfall over 
already saturated soils as it marched through South Carolina, 
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. There were also 
impacts in West Virginia and Kentucky.
    Helene's powerful winds and floodwaters altered landscapes 
and devastated communities in many places not accustomed to 
experiencing such storms. The destruction caused by Helene was 
catastrophic. Less than 2 weeks later, Hurricane Milton rapidly 
intensified into a category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After making landfall in Florida as a category 3, it moved 
across the State into the Atlantic, spurring a formation of 
tornadoes and leaving an overlapping trail of destruction in 
many communities still reeling from Hurricanes Helene and 
Debby. Many of these same communities were still recovering 
from Ian, Idalia, and Debby from previous years.
    Our hearts have been heavy with the stories of survivors we 
have encountered, people who lost their loved ones, their 
homes, and their businesses. These two catastrophic storms led 
to the loss of over 200 lives and caused extensive damages to 
homes and neighborhoods across the impacted States.
    There was also widespread disruption of critical services 
across the Southeastern United States, including the 
obstruction of transportation routes which isolated some homes 
and communities.
    FEMA's mission statement is a simple one, spelled out in 
seven powerful words: helping people before, during, and after 
disasters. And in my written testimony, I have provided a 
detailed account of FEMA's preparation, pre-positioning of 
assets and personnel, and coordination with other Federal 
agencies in support of our State, local, and Tribal partners. I 
have described in detail how FEMA responded to these two storms 
across eight States, mobilizing the full weight of the Federal 
Government to help impacted areas that were not accustomed to 
this kind of disaster, prioritizing search and rescue efforts; 
reopening roads to reconnect hard-to-reach areas; delivering 
essential food, water, and other supplies to residents; and 
restoring critical infrastructure.
    And I have described how FEMA is leading recovery efforts 
in the impacted States, doing everything we can to cut through 
redtape and expedite assistance to survivors. This has been a 
challenging time for our workforce of over 22,000 dedicated, 
hard-working people, many of whom were also impacted by one of 
these storms themselves and delayed their personal and family 
recovery to meet our mission and respond to the disaster.
    Our workforce persevered through all of the challenges I 
have just described, and they also persevered through a 
difficult security environment generated by misinformation 
about FEMA's work spread through social media. We help all 
survivors, all people obtain all of the assistance that they 
are qualified for under the law, and misinformation was making 
that work much more difficult.
    I greatly appreciate the voices from Members of Congress 
from across both sides of the aisle who attested to the work 
that FEMA was doing on the ground. So, I was very concerned 
when I learned that a FEMA employee had given directions to her 
Disaster Survivor Assistance Team that were completely at odds 
with FEMA's mission. A critical function of these teams is to 
go door to door, meet with survivors, meet them where they are, 
make them aware of available FEMA resources, and help them 
register for assistance. This employee wrote to about 11 
staffers under her supervision that they should, ``avoid homes 
advertising Trump.'`
    My senior leadership team provided me with this visual 
evidence that the employee had, in fact, issued this statement, 
these instructions, and they recommended that this employee be 
terminated. I concurred and directed the termination, and the 
employee was fired. I released a statement that day, and I will 
repeat what I said to all of my employees and the American 
people: This type of behavior and action will not be tolerated 
at FEMA, and we will hold people accountable if they violate 
our standards of conduct.
    I do not believe that this employee's actions are 
indicative of any widespread cultural problems at FEMA. FEMA, 
however, has taken appropriate action to ensure that this 
matter is fully investigated, and I am committed to ensuring 
that nothing like this ever happens again. In the meantime, we 
have sent a different team to the field to contact all of the 
homes that had been skipped over at this one employee's 
direction, and that work has been completed.
    Now, I know that this incident is on the minds of many 
members of this committee, and I will be happy to answer all of 
your questions about it. However, I hope that we will also have 
a chance to discuss the great work of our workforce and 
responses to both Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as the 
important challenges that lie ahead in the recovery effort 
across these States.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I 
look forward to your questions.
    [Ms. Criswell's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal 
   Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
    Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of the 
Subcommittee: thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) efforts in response to 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We value this committee's legislative 
support and oversight of our agency, and I look forward to our 
conversation today.
    On September 26, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a 
powerful and fast-moving Category 4 storm, with hurricane-force winds 
extending 40 miles and tropical-storm-force winds extending 310 miles 
from its center. Helene then entered Georgia as a Category 2 hurricane, 
before becoming a powerful tropical storm that continued to release 
historic rainfall over already saturated soils as it marched through 
South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. And while not 
as widespread or catastrophic, there were also significant impacts in 
West Virginia and Kentucky. Helene's powerful winds, floodwaters, and 
landslides altered landscapes and devastated communities in many places 
not accustomed to experiencing such storms, including the areas around 
Asheville, forcing residents to seek higher ground from rapidly rising 
waters. The destruction caused by Helene was catastrophic.
    Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified 
into a Category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico. After making landfall in 
Florida as a Category 3, it moved across the state into the Atlantic, 
spurring the formation of tornados, and leaving an overlapping trail of 
destruction in many communities still reeling from Hurricane Helene. 
Sadly, many of these same communities are still recovering from 
Hurricanes Ian, Idalia, and Debby.
    Our hearts have been heavy with the stories of survivors we have 
encountered--people who lost their loved ones, their homes, and their 
businesses. These two catastrophic storms led to the tragic loss of 
over 200 lives, and in their wake, caused extensive damages to homes 
and neighborhoods across impacted states. There was also widespread 
disruption of critical services across the southeastern United States. 
This included losses of power, water, and cellular services, as well as 
the obstruction of transportation routes which isolated some homes and 
communities.
    The magnitude of damages across an expansive, geographically 
diverse, and topographically challenging range of impacted areas has 
required a whole-of-government response and recovery effort. FEMA has 
led the coordination of our federal colleagues in support of our state, 
local, and tribal partners to provide lifesaving assistance and help 
communities begin to rebuild.
    FEMA's mission is helping people before, during, and after 
disasters. In today's testimony, I will describe FEMA's response to 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the order of this powerful mission 
statement.
                                 Before
    Before the storms hit, FEMA drew upon lessons learned from major 
hurricanes of the past to preposition personnel and supplies, ensure 
constant communication with impacted states and tribes, and quickly 
process requests for pre-landfall Emergency Declarations from impacted 
states for the President's review.
Coordination with NOAA
    In partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), FEMA began tracking Helene as soon as it became 
a tropical disturbance on September 18--eight days before the storm's 
eventual landfall. NOAA has meteorologists embedded across FEMA 
providing regular weather updates and forecasts to support disaster 
operations. Additionally, FEMA has personnel embedded across various 
NOAA offices, including the National Hurricane Center, to support 
analysis of any impacts to FEMA operations and enable FEMA decision 
making on preparatory actions, such as prepositioning supplies and 
personnel, and ensuring our state and local partners have access to the 
latest information to support their decision making. On September 23, 
NOAA advised a Tropical Depression or Tropical Storm was likely to form 
within a day or two as the system moved northward, and the potential 
for impacts to the Florida Panhandle and portions of the Florida west 
coast were highlighted for later in the week.
NRCC and RRCC Activations
    FEMA activated its National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) on 
September 23, three days before Helene's landfall, enabling increased 
federal coordination for the approaching storm. As part of this, FEMA 
leveraged its Stafford Act authorities to task other federal agencies 
to provide disaster assistance in support of FEMA response operations. 
The NRCC also partnered with FEMA's Regional Response Coordination 
Centers (RRCC) in the affected FEMA Regions, which were Regions 3 and 4 
in the case of Helene. FEMA's Regional Offices generally serve as the 
first point of communication with our state and tribal partners and are 
often the first to receive a state's Emergency Declaration request. 
Emergency Declarations enable FEMA to provide federal resources to the 
potentially impacted states and aid critical, initial upfront response 
and stabilization efforts.
Pre-Landfall Declarations and Prepositioning
    On September 23, Florida was the first state to request an 
Emergency Declaration, and the President swiftly approved the request 
on September 24. FEMA deployed Incident Management Assistance Teams 
(IMATs) and Federal Coordinating Officers (FCOs) to Florida to 
integrate with state emergency management operations. At the same time, 
FEMA deployed an Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) Incident Support Team 
to Florida to initiate coordination and integration of federal search 
and rescue resources, as well as emergency communications capabilities 
across the state.
    On September 24, NOAA advised that the now Potential Tropical 
Cyclone Nine was forecast to become a hurricane the following day and a 
major hurricane as it approached the northeastern Gulf Coast later in 
the week. At this time, NOAA issued the first storm surge, hurricane, 
and tropical storm watches for Florida and advised of a moderate risk 
of flash flooding across portions of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, 
and North Carolina. On this day, FEMA's Region 4 RRCC activated to 
initiate and coordinate response activities across the impacted states. 
Later this day, NOAA advised that the storm had officially become 
Tropical Storm Helene, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. 
Continuing on September 24, FEMA deployed emergency communications 
capabilities with federal response teams to Georgia, as well as an FCO 
to Alabama, and began staging Disaster Survivor Assistance personnel in 
Atlanta, Georgia for immediate onward deployment to affected areas once 
conditions would allow.
    On September 25, NOAA advised that Tropical Storm Helene had 
maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and began expanding watches and 
warnings for portions of the United States, forecasting a major 
hurricane to approach the Big Bend of Florida late the next day. It was 
at this time that the NOAA first forecast a high chance of flash 
flooding for portions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina 
over the following five days. Shortly after that forecast, Georgia, 
Alabama, and North Carolina requested Emergency Declarations, which 
were all approved on September 26.
    Also on September 25, FEMA enhanced the NRCC's activation to its 
highest level, with federal departments and agencies representing all 
Emergency Support Functions activated to provide support. Concurrently, 
FEMA deployed IMATs and Federal Coordinating Officers to Georgia and 
North Carolina to integrate with state emergency operations and 
deployed an IMAT with emergency communications capabilities to the 
state emergency operations center in Alabama.
    Early on September 26, NOAA advised Helene had maximum sustained 
winds of 90 mph (Category 1) and was 385 miles south of Apalachicola, 
Florida; hurricane warnings extended from Florida into Georgia and 
tropical storm warnings extended across Florida, Georgia, South 
Carolina, and into portions of North Carolina. FEMA staged federal 
search and rescue capabilities and the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) deployed health and medical capabilities under a mission 
assignment, including healthcare site assessment teams and health and 
medical task forces, in Georgia and Florida for rapid deployment. At 
the same time, FEMA deployed search and rescue capabilities throughout 
western North Carolina to rapidly respond to impacted areas as soon as 
there was a need, as well as emergency communications capabilities to 
augment and ensure interoperability across all federal response teams.
    By mid-afternoon on September 26, Helene had reached major 
hurricane status (Category 3 and higher) with maximum sustained winds 
nearing 120 mph. On this same day, South Carolina requested and 
received approval for an Emergency Declaration. Later that evening, at 
approximately 11:10 pm EDT, Helene made landfall as a Category 4 
hurricane in Dekle Beach, Florida just east of the mouth of the Aucilla 
River, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 140 mph. On the day of 
Helene's landfall, there were already over 1,500 FEMA personnel 
deployed across Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, and South 
Carolina.
    On September 27, Helene entered the State of Georgia as a Category 
2 hurricane, and NOAA downgraded it to Tropical Storm status by 5:00 AM 
EDT on Friday morning. The storm continued to track across Georgia, 
South Carolina, and North Carolina, causing widespread damage. 
Additional search and rescue teams deployed by FEMA arrived in North 
Carolina along with health and medical resources, including HHS 
healthcare site assessment teams. FEMA deployed a Federal Coordinating 
Officer to the South Carolina State Emergency Operations Center, with 
emergency communications capabilities. Tennessee requested, and 
received, an Emergency Declaration.
    By September 28, the storm's windspeed diminished further, but its 
effects--especially its associated rainfall--continued. Virginia 
requested an Emergency Declaration, which the President quickly 
approved the following day. FEMA continued to deploy additional 
personnel and teams, including search and rescue teams, health and 
medical resources to North Carolina, an IMAT to South Carolina, and 
moved thousands of FEMA and other Federal personnel into all impacted 
states. In total, over 3,300 total federal personnel were deployed as 
of September 28.
    During the response to Helene, FEMA continued to monitor for future 
threats and maintain mission readiness for additional disaster 
activity. Beginning on September 26, NOAA identified another tropical 
disturbance, which later became Hurricane Milton. FEMA and our 
interagency partners immediately began developing a multi-incident 
threat outlook, analyzing the ongoing response to Hurricane Helene, 
potential impacts from an additional tropical cyclone, and its effects 
on federal response operations. The threat outlook was updated daily as 
the forecast for Hurricane Milton became clearer, informing our efforts 
to begin preparations for another hurricane landfall in the U.S.
    Using this information, FEMA took similar steps to coordinate with 
our state partners and preposition federal assets in anticipation of 
Hurricane Milton. The NRCC, which remained activated to its highest-
level throughout the Hurricane Helene response began to simultaneously 
support for Hurricane Milton preparations on October 6, including 
coordinated pre-planning with the State of Florida. Throughout this 
time, FEMA led the coordination with the interagency to prioritize 
resource movements and staging of assets to ensure ongoing response 
needs from Hurricane Helene were being met, while preparing for 
anticipated impacts in Florida from Hurricane Milton. On October 6 and 
7, FEMA received requests from the State of Florida and the Seminole 
Tribe of Florida for Emergency Declarations, which were subsequently 
approved on October 7 and 8, respectively. Hurricane Milton later made 
landfall on October 10 near Siesta Key, Florida.
    Ahead of both of these storms, FEMA stayed in consistent 
communications with our partners, including all levels of state 
government. For example, I communicated with governors from states such 
as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Virginia ahead of both Helene and Milton, in order to ensure their 
needs were being met. Partnerships such as these are vital for ensuring 
that the right resources are delivered to where they are needed most 
before, during, and after the disaster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FEMA-led federal prepositioning efforts ahead of Hurricanes 
Helene and Milton were massive. For Helene, FEMA staged Urban Search 
and Rescue Task Forces across the states anticipated to be impacted, as 
well as U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) rotary wing aircraft, USCG fixed wing 
aircraft, USCG water rescue teams, Department of Interior (DOI) water 
rescue teams, and Department of Defense (DOD) high clearance vehicles 
and rotary wing aircraft. Ahead of Hurricane Milton, additional federal 
search and rescue resources were staged and re-positioned to rapidly 
respond to impacts across Florida while maintaining search and rescue 
capabilities for continuing Helene requirements. In total, FEMA 
deployed 24 Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, over 15 USCG fixed and 
rotary wing aircraft, numerous USCG and DOI water rescue teams, 41 DOD 
rotary wing aircraft, and 60 DOD high clearance vehicles were deployed 
and pre-positioned to support search and rescue operations across 
impacted states.
    Additionally, using the National Medical Transport Services 
contract, FEMA activated over 700 ambulances, medical helicopters, and 
medical airplanes ahead of Helene and Milton to provide rapid emergency 
medical services capabilities across impacted states. And in 
coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), FEMA directed water and 
wastewater system, temporary power, and debris assessment teams or 
subject matter experts to be pre-positioned along both Helene and 
Milton storm tracks to support restoration of critical services.
    Ahead of Hurricane Helene, FEMA and its federal partners also 
established staging operations for commodities, equipment, and fuel, in 
coordination with state emergency officials, across several sites. 
These sites include FEMA's Distribution Center in Atlanta, Maxwell Air 
Force Base (AFB) and Craig Field in Alabama as well as Warner Robbins 
AFB, in Georgia. This footprint was quickly expanded with operations at 
Conley, Georgia; Charlotte and Hickory, North Carolina; and Ft. 
Campbell, Kentucky. FEMA sustained these operations through Hurricane 
Milton's landfall and response.
    As part of these efforts, FEMA initially staged 9 million meals, 10 
million liters of water, over 300 generators, ample supplies of tarps 
and protective roof sheeting, as well as bulk supplies of diesel and 
gasoline and other commodities. FEMA ensured continuous availability of 
these commodities by resupplying staging areas with meals and water 
from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and General Services 
Administration (GSA), as well as through pre-negotiated contingency 
contracts with a wide variety of vendors.
                                 During
Lifesaving Operations
    In further support of these efforts to save lives during the 
immediate response to these storms, FEMA mobilized the Federal Search 
and Rescue Coordination Group to bring together all federal, state, and 
local search and rescue organizations to develop and execute a unified 
and coordinated search and rescue strategy across the six impacted 
states.
    The 24 National Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) task forces that 
FEMA deployed saved lives during the responses to Hurricanes Helene and 
Milton. This included over 1,500 US&R task force personnel, 110 
canines, and 90 swift water resources such as flood skiffs during 
deployments which stretched from September 25 to October 18. Due to 
prepositioning efforts, many of these teams were able to engage in 
lifesaving operations before impacts from the storms had subsided. For 
example, in North Carolina, from September 27 to 29, FEMA US&R teams 
conducted more than 2,000 structural evaluations; rescued, assisted, or 
evacuated 121 people and 12 pets; and checked on the wellbeing of more 
than 500 people who were sheltering in place.
    In addition to FEMA US&R task forces, USCG, DOI, and DOD provided 
rotary and fixed wing aircraft, water rescue capabilities, and high 
clearance vehicles to further augment and support federal search and 
rescue operations. USCG resources arrived and were pre-positioned ahead 
of the storm beginning on September 25, and conducted search and rescue 
operations September 27 through October 13. DOI resources were pre-
positioned and staged beginning September 27 and conducted operations 
from October 6 through October 12. DOD resources were initially pre-
positioned on Sept. 26th, with additional resources becoming available 
October 1. DOD began search and rescue operations on September 27 and 
continued through October 12. In total across all federal departments 
and agencies, federal personnel searched over 375,000 specific sites 
across the impacted states and had over 18,000 interactions with 
survivors for both Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
Life Sustaining Operations
    Beyond their immediate lifesaving needs during response operations, 
many survivors required life sustaining resources such as shelter, 
food, and water.
    During the response to Helene and Milton, state and local 
governments, as well as non-profit organizations, operated evacuation 
and emergency shelters throughout the impacted areas. At the peak of 
Hurricane Helene, more than 30,000 people sought safe shelter in 130 
facilities across the States of Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and 
North Carolina. During Hurricane Milton, more than 83,000 people in 
more than 280 shelters sought safety across Florida while the storm 
made landfall.
    The pre-landfall Emergency Declarations approved by the President 
authorized FEMA to reimburse costs for sheltering actions taken by 
state, local, and tribal governments. FEMA also provided food, water, 
and medical supplies for shelter facilities.
    During the responses to Helene and Milton, FEMA made food and water 
available to impacted communities not only for those in shelters, but 
also for those who had sheltered in place and were in need, making 
initial use of the prepositioned 9 million meals and 10 million liters 
of water. FEMA has continued to push deliveries of food, water, and 
other items from our staging sites, our distribution centers, from the 
DLA, GSA, and through pre-negotiated contracts with a variety of 
vendors to the affected states at their request. As of November 13, 
FEMA has delivered over 16 million meals, 18 million liters of water, 
over 3,000 rolls of blue roof sheeting, more than 700,000 gallons of 
fuel, and other products, representing deliveries of over 2,000 tractor 
trailer loads of critical supplies across six states.
    FEMA delivered these requested commodities to states, and the 
states then distributed these supplies to impacted communities, through 
state Points of Distribution (PODs). And states coordinated with local 
voluntary agencies who specialize in volunteer and donations management 
on feeding missions. For example, voluntary partners served over 2.1 
million meals to survivors following Hurricane Helene, and over 467,000 
meals following Hurricane Milton.
    In certain regions, the extensive damage from Helene created unique 
obstacles to delivering these critical supplies. These obstacles 
required a whole-of-government approach to overcome.
    Every disaster is unique, and Helene resulted in widespread road 
and bridge damages across locations, including the mountainous terrain 
of Western North Carolina. Intense rainfall saturated steep slopes, 
triggering landslides that buried roads. Narrow valleys across 
Appalachia funneled floodwaters into confined river channels, washing 
away critical transportation routes, such as portions of I-40, which 
provide key connections for communities in western North Carolina and 
eastern Tennessee. In western North Carolina alone, a total 655 roads 
were closed. As a result, many communities were isolated and 
significantly more difficult for emergency responders to reach.
    The National Guard is often activated by states to fulfill a wide 
range of missions during disaster response, including distributing 
commodities. In North Carolina, they proved pivotal. In addition, given 
the scale of this disaster, on October 2, FEMA, at the request of 
Governor Cooper, directed 1,000 active-duty troops to partner with the 
North Carolina National Guard on the ground to support critical 
missions, including commodity distribution and emergency route 
clearance. Governor Cooper requested this assistance on October 1. On 
October 6, the Administration ordered another 500 active-duty troops to 
move into western North Carolina to surge additional resources and 
capacity at the request of the Governor. The relief efforts by both 
State National Guard and Title 10 personnel were consolidated under a 
Dual Status Commander to ensure efficiency and unity of effort. Using a 
combination of air and ground assets, the force multiplier of our DOD 
partners further enabled the rapid delivery of these critical 
resources. DOD personnel directly supported 11 PODs across western 
North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and facilitated the delivery of 
over 10.5 million pounds of commodities through air and ground 
distribution efforts. This included delivering over 3.4 million liters 
of water and over 30 thousand meals.
    Getting these life sustaining supplies to the last mile, and into 
the hands of survivors in isolated communities, was part of what became 
known as the PODs to People effort. National Guard and Title 10 trucks 
and ground vehicles delivered commodities to isolated communities 
identified by the state, including right to individual survivor's 
doorsteps. And when heavy vehicles could not travel by ground, 
helicopters were used to lift commodity shipments and drop them at 
designated locations within the impacted community. From there, more 
nimble trucks and other ground vehicles would transport them to the 
identified POD locations where they were needed most. Members of the 
National Guard, together with active duty servicemembers, conducted 
more than 1,200 ground missions and more than 400 air missions in 
coordination with the state of North Carolina. Service members 
supported these operations across Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, 
Caldwell, Haywood, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, 
Watauga, and Yancey counties, as well as with the Eastern Band of 
Cherokee Indians.
Whole of Government Response--Mission Assignments
    In responding to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, FEMA leveraged its 
authorities to mission assign over 64 other federal agencies to conduct 
a variety of response and recovery operations. As of November 13, FEMA 
issued 612 mission assignments across the operation, totaling over $1.8 
billion in obligations. Federal agencies which received a mission 
assignment include: AmeriCorps; other components of the Department of 
Homeland Security, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA); Department of Commerce and its components, 
including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); 
DOD and its components, including DLA and the USACE; Department of 
Energy and its components; DOI and its components, including National 
Park Service and US Geological Survey (USGS); Department of Justice and 
its components, including the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) 
and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); 
Department of Labor; Department of State and its components; Department 
of Transportation and its components, including Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA); National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB); 
Department of Veterans Affairs and its components, including the 
Veterans Health Administration; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC); GSA; Department of Health and 
Human Services and its components, including Administration for 
Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR); Department of Housing and 
Urban Development; National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA); Small Business Administration (SBA); Department of the 
Treasury; US Agency for International Development (USAID); as well as 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its components, including US 
Forest Service (USFS).
    These mission assignments and contributions from our federal 
partners have supported response operations in fundamental ways, such 
as by clearing debris and roads, repairing water facilities, and 
conducting damage assessments.
    As previously referenced, Hurricanes Helene and Milton left 
landslides and debris strewn across landscapes, creating dangerous 
obstructions that blocked roadways and complicated recovery efforts. To 
help our state partners overcome these obstacles, USACE, the USFS, and 
the USGS have provided technical assistance and direct support to 
impacted states for debris removal actions. To date, they have 
supported the removal of millions of cubic yards of debris across 
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Virginia, and assisted in clearing over 120 miles of roadways. 
Additionally, DOD personnel are deployed into western North Carolina 
and eastern Tennessee to support ongoing debris removal operations. To 
date, DOD personnel have supported clearing over 375 miles of blocked 
roadways across these specific impacted areas. Additionally, all local 
and state response operations for eligible debris removal and emergency 
protective measures in these six states will be reimbursed at 100 
percent federal share by FEMA for specific and limited periods of time.
    In addition to clearing debris and roadways, our federal partners 
played a vital role in helping impacted states to stabilize critical 
infrastructure impacted by the storms, such as damaged water and 
wastewater facilities. For example, catastrophic flash flooding in 
western North Carolina comprehensively damaged water and wastewater 
facilities across the region, resulting in significant structural 
breaks in places like Asheville, which impacted over 510,000 customers. 
Federal resources were deployed to bolster state and private sector 
efforts and bring this critical infrastructure back online. By October 
31, the EPA and USACE provided 32 detailed assessments for the most 
heavily damaged rapid water and wastewater facilities to help state and 
local officials determine the best courses of action for both the 
immediate term and long recovery. And during this time, USACE installed 
a reverse osmosis unit to support potable water needs at the University 
of North Carolina-Asheville campus. Additionally, USACE is working with 
the City of Asheville to obtain and install a large-scale filtration 
unit at the Burdett Reservoir to expand potable water access across the 
community.
    In the weeks that followed Helene, Asheville regained water, 
representing a significant step for residents, though boil water 
advisories remain in place. FEMA continues to proactively identify 
temporary solutions to water and wastewater service restoration in 
these highly impacted areas. And in collaboration with local, state, 
and federal partners like USACE and EPA, phased assessments of impacted 
facilities are continuing to identify appropriate courses of action for 
repair and restoration. FEMA will continue to work with USACE to assist 
in the installation of emergency temporary systems as identified and 
requested by the state.
    Whole-of-government partnerships such as these have also helped 
FEMA to increase the speed of damage assessments during the response to 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In addition to leveraging our internal 
capabilities, FEMA coordinated closely with numerous federal 
departments and agencies, including NOAA; DOD and component agencies, 
such as the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) and USACE 
through the Army Geospatial Center and Field Force Engineering program, 
other components of DHS, such as the USCG; and NASA to capture aerial 
and satellite imagery immediately following the storms using advanced 
imaging, analysis, and modeling technologies. This information was then 
used to more rapidly inform lifesaving response operations across 
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Virginia.
    These damage assessments are additionally used to inform the Major 
Disaster Declaration process. In order to swiftly process state 
requests for major disaster declarations and get assistance to 
survivors faster, FEMA rapidly sourced and assessed the overhead aerial 
imagery mentioned above, and supplemented it with ground-level photos, 
and observed hazard data such as wind speeds, flood gauge depths, 
precipitation accumulation, power outages, and modeled inundation 
depths. FEMA's team of trained analysts then reviewed this information 
to expeditiously assemble and route disaster declaration requests with 
supporting data to the President.
Major Disaster Declarations
    FEMA's Major Disaster Declarations provide a wide range of federal 
assistance programs for impacted individuals and public infrastructure 
that exceeds the assistance available under pre-landfall Emergency 
Declarations. For individual survivors, this can include help with 
urgent needs, such as food, water, and diapers, temporary housing, home 
repair and many other types of assistance. For public infrastructure, 
this can include federal support for the repair and replacement of 
disaster damaged roads, bridges, water control facilities, utilities, 
and schools. FEMA also provides assistance to state, tribal, and local 
governments for emergency protective measures and debris removal. 
Declared states additionally receive hazard mitigation grants to employ 
cost effective measures that will reduce future disaster losses.
    In order to jumpstart the recovery process after Helene and Milton, 
FEMA worked closely with state, tribal, and local officials to expedite 
assistance to survivors impacted by these disasters. To ensure FEMA was 
getting aid to survivors as quickly as possible, the initial Major 
Disaster Declarations included a subset of counties where major damage 
could be clearly and rapidly identified, either through on-the-ground 
damage assessments or utilizing geospatial technology as described 
above. Following these initial Major Disaster Declarations, FEMA has 
continued to work closely with state and local partners to conduct 
additional damage assessments which enable additional counties to be 
added to the original declaration. Once additional counties are 
assessed and confirmed to qualify for assistance, they can be quickly 
added on a rolling basis. By utilizing this approach, FEMA was able to 
rapidly process Major Disaster Declaration requests for the President's 
approval, as demonstrated below.

\<dagger>\ Not an expedited request


Individual Assistance
    These expedited declarations led to positive and tangible impacts 
for survivors. Under the Major Disaster Declarations, the President 
approved Individual Assistance (IA), which is one of the principal ways 
FEMA can directly help households impacted by the storms. The IA 
program provides two primary types of support. The first is financial 
assistance, and the second is housing assistance.
    Impacted individuals and families can apply for IA by registering 
online at disasterassistance.gov; calling the FEMA hotline; by talking 
with Disaster Survivor Assistance (DSA) teams that work in impacted 
areas going door-to-door, in congregate shelters, and at other 
established locations in communities like fire departments; or by 
visiting one of the 116 Disaster Recovery Centers (DRC) opened for 
Helene and Milton. The first DSA teams began working in the field on 
September 29, and at its peak on October 30, more than 1,400 FEMA DSA 
team members are in affected neighborhoods helping survivors apply for 
assistance. Additionally, survivors can register within one of FEMA's 
37 Mobile Registration Intake Centers (MRICs). These mobile vehicles 
move around throughout impacted communities to assist survivors with 
registering for FEMA assistance.
    So far in 2024, nearly 4.3 million households have registered for 
assistance and more than $3.6 billion in assistance has been provided. 
Specifically for Hurricanes Helene and Milton, more than 2.4 million 
households have registered and FEMA has already provided more than $1.6 
billion in assistance, with millions more being awarded each day.
    One of the initial ways in which FEMA can financially help 
survivors is through Serious Needs Assistance (SNA). SNA is upfront, 
initial assistance intended to help survivors with costs such as food, 
clothing, baby formula, diapers, or medications when they have serious 
needs created by the disaster. This program offers survivors a one-time 
payment of $750 for disasters declared in FY24 and $770 for disasters 
declared in FY25 that does not need to be repaid. To receive SNA, the 
survivor must be eligible for assistance generally, have had their 
identity verified, and have a completed home inspection. When it is 
apparent to FEMA that damage is so widespread in a particular area that 
it is more likely than not that someone applying for assistance will be 
eligible for SNA, FEMA may expedite the assistance before a home 
inspection, for survivors that indicate they have a need. FEMA took 
this expedited approach for the areas hardest hit by Hurricanes Helene 
and Milton. For Hurricanes Helene and Milton, the average time from 
registration to approval of SNA is two days. Following approval, it 
takes approximately one to two business days for funds to be deposited 
in the survivor's account.
    SNA helps survivors begin their recovery by providing real-world, 
tangible benefits in their time of greatest need, and ensuring 
financial access to vital resources such as food, water, medication, 
and other emergency supplies. As of November 13, more than 671,000 
households affected by Hurricane Helene have received over $503 million 
in SNA, while more than 218,000 households affected by Hurricane Milton 
have received over $145 million in SNA.
    This program is, however, by no means the only type of FEMA 
assistance directly available to survivors. SNA is a single tool among 
many that can be used to help individuals during the immediate 
aftermath of the disaster. FEMA also provides financial assistance to 
individuals and households to make critical repairs to their disaster 
damaged residences and to address other vital needs, such as damaged 
personal property, damaged vehicles, and medical care, as well as 
rental assistance.
    Residents in many of the counties impacted by Hurricanes Helene and 
Milton who have applied for disaster assistance are also eligible for 
FEMA's Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program. Under the TSA 
program, survivors can temporarily stay in a hotel paid for by FEMA and 
the State while they work on their long-term housing plan. Survivors do 
not need to request this assistance. FEMA will notify them of their 
eligibility through an automated phone call, text message, or email, 
depending upon the method of communication preferred by the survivor. 
Individuals and households may be eligible if they cannot return to 
their disaster-damaged home and their housing needs cannot be met by 
insurance, shelters, or rental assistance provided by FEMA or another 
agency. In the weeks following Helene and Milton, FEMA has provided TSA 
to more than 30,000 households who have checked into participating 
hotels since the storms. FEMA has also provided more than $3 million in 
rental assistance to more than 1,000 households.

    FEMA is also providing Direct Temporary Housing Assistance (DTHA) 
in certain counties in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Florida. DTHA 
provides safe, secure housing to eligible disaster survivors who are 
unable to obtain temporary housing through other means. Multiple 
approaches are used to provide direct housing. These include 
manufactured housing units, the Direct Lease Program, and the Multi-
Family Lease and Repair Program. FEMA determines which forms of direct 
housing are used in each county based on survivor preferences, 
logistical considerations, and availability of resources.
    Direct temporary housing solutions are tailored to meet individual 
survivors' needs, so they take time to implement. FEMA is actively 
working with survivors in all three states to assess eligibility and 
housing needs. FEMA is also working to identify property owners 
interested in participating in direct lease or multi-family lease and 
repair as well as evaluating potential commercial park and other 
properties for placement of temporary housing units. FEMA works with 
survivors and to secure potential properties in parallel to meet 
survivors' needs as quickly as possible. Survivors are already moving 
into temporary housing units in North Carolina, and we will see similar 
progress in Florida and Tennessee in the coming weeks.
                                 After
Recovery
    In the immediate weeks that followed Helene and Milton, FEMA and 
our partners prioritized search and rescue efforts, reopening roads to 
reconnect hard-to-reach areas, delivering essential commodities to 
residents, restoring critical infrastructure, and getting help to those 
who need it most. As these operations began to stabilize, we initiated 
long-term recovery efforts across the six impacted states.
    The long-term recovery goals of each state are unique to the 
specific needs and challenges of their impacted communities. 
Recognizing this, FEMA is working closely with each state and with 
critical federal partners to coordinate a whole-of-government recovery 
effort that addresses the specific goals of each community. In support 
of this mission, FEMA has activated Interagency Recovery Coordination 
(IRC) teams in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Virginia. The IRC teams are focusing on coordinating 
assistance in areas such as housing, infrastructure, community support, 
natural and cultural resources, health, education, human services, and 
economic recovery. Using the National Disaster Recovery Framework, 
which organizes federal recovery support into six Recovery Support 
Functions (RSFs), the IRC team collaborates with state partners to 
maximize the resources and support the federal government can provide 
for recovery efforts.
    These RSFs are the Community Assistance Recovery Support Function.; 
the Economic Recovery Support Function; the Health and Social Services 
Recovery Support Function; the Housing Recovery Support Function; the 
Infrastructure Systems Recovery Support Function; and the Natural and 
Cultural Resources Recovery Support Function.
Flexibilities
    FEMA is focused on cutting red tape to expedite the road to 
recovery wherever possible. For example, FEMA has authorized a series 
of waivers and flexibilities to accelerate the clearance and 
appropriate disposal of disaster debris. This was especially critical 
in Florida, where our state partners had to move very quickly to move 
debris following Hurricane Helene that posed an immediate public safety 
risk prior to Hurricane Milton. And then following the widespread 
impact of both hurricanes in Florida, FEMA has worked to help 
communities overcome the challenges associated with indistinguishable 
damages from the two storms. In order to do this, FEMA is considering 
all work that cannot be obviously attributed to only Hurricane Helene, 
to be the result of Hurricane Milton. This includes debris removal in 
jurisdictions impacted by and designated for assistance under the 
declarations for both hurricanes. This approach is intended to simplify 
the process for the development and submission of project applications 
under the FEMA Public Assistance Program.
    FEMA is also exploring flexibilities to help repair the thousands 
of private roads and bridges washed away by the catastrophic flooding 
or landslides. Many residences, particularly those in mountainous 
areas, rely upon these private roads and bridges to cross steep terrain 
and access their homes or communities. First responders and emergency 
services, such as ambulances and firetrucks, also rely upon these same 
roads and bridges to deliver lifesaving assistance. In order to rebuild 
these vital connections between survivors and their communities, FEMA 
is utilizing its Home Repair Assistance to help cover these uninsured 
costs and ensure that local government emergency services are able to 
reach these residences. FEMA has also authorized limited, emergency 
repairs to enable emergency access through the Public Assistance 
program. FEMA is doing this by providing policy flexibility to permit 
state and local governments to conduct emergency repair of private 
bridges as a Category B emergency protective measure, making the work 
eligible for Public Assistance funding in limited circumstances when it 
is necessary to restore emergency access to private residences. As an 
emergency protective measure to protect public health and safety, such 
repairs will be conducted as quickly as possible. Repairs are limited 
to only what is necessary to restore emergency access to provide 
emergency services to private residences in accordance with issued 
Disaster Specific Guidance (DSG). The DSG offers multiple flexibilities 
including the ability to make repairs utilizing volunteer labor, 
authorization to spend up to $40,000 per property for repairs, 
exclusive of overhead, and the ability to request an increase on a 
case-by-case basis when greater repairs are in the public interest. 
FEMA will also allow repairs to roads and bridges to access private 
property if the owner is eligible for direct housing assistance and the 
site is suitable for a temporary housing unit.
    As another example of increased flexibilities, FEMA has 
authorized--for the first time--expedited funding for projects less 
than $1 million. This policy waiver allows FEMA to advance up to 50% of 
the project costs while jurisdictions complete final paperwork. Many of 
the communities impacted by these disasters are small, and the budgets 
of local governments can quickly become overwhelmed by the scale of 
these challenges. To help our local partners overcome this, FEMA 
authorized this kind of expedited funding for projects below the large 
project threshold in Public Assistance. This will provide communities 
with immediate access to capital to help cover the costs of the 
emergency protective measures they had to take. Additionally, FEMA has 
streamlined the process for Community Disaster Loans to make them more 
readily accessible to communities and help support their normal 
operating costs while their tax base recovers. The Community Disaster 
Loan Program provides funding for local governments to operate their 
essential community services after substantial revenue loss caused by a 
disaster, such as police and fire protection, trash collection, revenue 
collection, public facilities maintenance, and hazard insurance.
    FEMA will continue to identify ways to remove bureaucratic barriers 
and find new opportunities to help survivors. For example, USACE 
contractors in North Carolina are removing damaged trees from the North 
Carolina Arboretum and delivering logs to identified staging areas. 
Volunteers are sorting wood under the guidance of the USDA subject 
matter experts according to potential use such as furniture, firewood, 
or mulch. Appropriately trained volunteers are cutting wood that is 
unsuitable for furniture into firewood. Municipalities and local 
volunteers are then distributing wood to artisans and other residents 
for use. This innovative approach has the opportunity to create new 
business opportunities, reduce home heating costs, and lessen landfill 
requirements.
Resilience
    As we rebuild in these communities, we must also ensure that we 
build back better with more resilient infrastructure. During the 
rebuilding process, communities will have access to FEMA's Hazard 
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which provides funding to state, 
local, and tribal governments so they can develop hazard mitigation 
plans and rebuild in a way that reduces, or mitigates, future disaster 
losses in their communities.
    During Hurricanes Helene and Milton, we have seen examples of the 
ways in which past mitigation grant funding helped to blunt the impact 
of these disasters. For example, in Surry County, North Carolina, 
generators had been purchased and installed at two different wastewater 
facilities using HMGP grants. During power outages from Helene, the 
generators provided continuous service without interruption to both 
Mount Airy and the nearby town of Pilot Mountain, in a region where 
many other wastewater facilities went offline for extended durations. 
Similarly, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency had purchased 18 
generators using HMGP funding, and each of them played an important 
role during Hurricane Helene. All 18 were deployed during the response 
to provide power for water, wastewater, hospitals, nursing homes, and 
911 Centers across the affected areas. In Florida, the Flood Mitigation 
Assistance (FMA) grant program had mitigated 415 homes across the state 
against flood damage. In Pinellas County alone, there are numerous 
examples of these homes that had been elevated out of harm's way. These 
are homes that families could return to after evacuating and not have 
to worry about the damage and challenges of rebuilding. The broad 
usages of mitigation grants program funding has the power to keep 
critical facilities operational, such as the wastewater facilities, and 
mitigate individual residential structures--allowing the returned 
families access and usage of the residence, thus minimizing the time in 
temporary housing or shelters.
    As we move forward, FEMA will work with our partners to ensure that 
mitigation opportunities are identified and maximized during recovery, 
and every opportunity is taken to rebuild in more resilient ways.
Road Ahead
    In the weeks since Helene and Milton, FEMA has provided more than 
$1.6 billion in assistance to more than 910,400 households, as well as 
$1.29 billion in total Public Assistance obligations to impacted 
states. And as of November 13, more than 7,500 FEMA employees remain 
deployed, along with 800 Surge Capacity Force members, to support the 
ongoing response and recovery operations for Helene and Milton. But the 
road ahead is long. And FEMA with its partners, will remain on the 
ground until the job is done.
    To that end, we continue to seek out ways to expand our workforce 
and incorporate local insights. In addition to growing our ranks 
through local hire programs across impacted states, FEMA is launching a 
new Community Liaison Program in North Carolina. These community-based 
staff will be embedded in every impacted county in North Carolina, and 
work directly with county administrators, mayors, and local leaders to 
ensure that the community has a leading role in the recovery process.
    As we look to the challenges and opportunities ahead, we recognize 
the importance of leveraging and relying upon the relationships we have 
built with leadership from all levels of federal, tribal state, and 
county governments, non-profit organizations, private sector, and 
impacted communities. As previously stated, the scale of this disaster 
will require a coordinated recovery effort at all levels of government 
and civil society.
    And the Members of the Committee here today represent one of the 
fundamental federal partnerships during this process. I ask for 
continued support from each of you, and to ensure that both FEMA and 
our partners have the resources needed as we all work together to 
rebuild a more ready and resilient nation.
    I would also like to thank the Members here today for favorably 
passing the Disaster Management Costs Modernization Act out of 
committee just days before Hurricane Helene made landfall. As we all 
seek opportunities to empower our state and local emergency manager 
partners, this bill would allow state, tribal, and territorial 
governments to repurpose unused FEMA funding previously allocated for 
management costs after a disaster. These funds would be used to bolster 
their administrative capacities to prepare for, recover from, or 
mitigate future disasters. FEMA cannot accomplish this mission alone. 
It requires mature and strong partnerships, and this bill that would 
provide additional flexibilities that can help to build the emergency 
management capacities of state, tribal, and territorial governments. 
Thank you for your support as this bill continues to work its way 
through the legislative process.
Conclusion
    In closing, I want to extend my deepest condolences to the families 
of those who lost loved ones or their homes in the storms. I would also 
like to emphasize my gratitude to the first responders, state, local, 
and tribal emergency managers, FEMA personnel, and partner agencies for 
their adaptability and endurance. Many of them put themselves in harm's 
way during the response and continued to answer the call while feeling 
the impact of the storms firsthand. I also want to recognize the heroic 
work of community groups and everyday people--our neighbors and 
friends--who sprang into action and supported their community during a 
time of great need.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to 
your questions.

[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Administrator, for your testimony. We 
will now turn to questions from Members. The Chair recognizes 
himself for 5 minutes.
    Administrator, last week, we sent a letter signed by myself 
and all the committee's Republican Members to you about the 
recent allegations that you just mentioned: FEMA workers 
skipped the homes of supporters of the President-elect. 
Following the allegations, you issued a statement that one FEMA 
employee departed from FEMA's values and was terminated. 
However, she alleges that those were the instructions from FEMA 
when she was deployed. She asserts that FEMA supervisors and 
leadership were aware. And independently, we have received 
reports of similar practices in places like North Carolina.
    Tell me about the investigation. Tell me about the 
investigation. Who is conducting it? And has there been an IG 
investigation initiated by yourself or anybody in FEMA?
    Ms. Criswell. Chairman Perry, there is nothing in our 
policies, in our procedures, in our training that would direct 
any employee to bypass anybody's home based on their political 
party. I cannot speak to what her motivations were, but this 
came to my attention again on November 7. I directed my team to 
get me information. They gave me factual information on 
November 9, which is when I directed the termination of this 
employee.
    This first came to our Office of Professional 
Responsibility on October 28 through the team member from TSA 
who was working under this individual. She immediately raised 
it to the Office of the Special Counsel, who took the case as a 
potential violation of the Hatch Act. There were ongoing 
investigations with that, and the Office of Professional 
Responsibility is currently working with the IG to determine 
what the investigative matters will be going forward. The IG 
has not of yet stated they want to investigate this, but I 
highly encourage them to take on this case and look and see if 
this was a widespread issue or if this was just a single 
incident.
    Mr. Perry. So, you are working with them, and you have 
encouraged them, but you haven't requested they do so.
    Now, according to the your employee, Ms. Washington, who 
was asked--and this is a public report--``So, you are telling 
me these orders came from somebody above?'`
    And she said, ``Correct.'`
    So, what has your investigation gleaned regarding her 
direct supervisors or the people above her? Have you questioned 
them? And what have your answers been?
    Ms. Criswell. Chairman Perry, we do have an ongoing 
investigation, and we have questioned other personnel in this 
chain of command, and we find no information at this point that 
there was anything beyond her direction to her employees to 
skip and bypass a home.
    Mr. Perry. So, the same employee alleged that the Florida 
team had already been avoiding Trump voters' homes prior to her 
work there, and that this was, as she said, the culture. Now, 
these aren't my words. These are the words from a FEMA employee 
who is claiming that she is being the scapegoat. She said, 
``But I am just simply executing again what was coming down 
from my supervisors.'`
    Do you know--how many supervisors does she have? How many 
people above her before she gets to you?
    Ms. Criswell. She is a crew lead, which is the lowest level 
of supervision.
    Mr. Perry. So, there are a lot of people above her, so to 
speak----
    Ms. Criswell [interposing]. There are several people.
    Mr. Perry [continuing]. In the chain of command, if you----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. I would be happy to forward an 
organizational chart that would show where she sits within the 
organization.
    Mr. Perry. And your investigation has spoken to, certainly, 
the immediate and maybe two or three steps above that?
    Ms. Criswell. We have an ongoing investigation, Chairman 
Perry, to determine if there were any additional acts that 
violated our core values of compassion, fairness, integrity, 
and respect.
    Mr. Perry. Okay----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. And at this time we have 
found----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. So, I get there is an ongoing 
investigation. But this isn't a law enforcement thing, where 
you can't say, well, we have an investigation, so, we can't 
talk about it. You can talk about this. Does the investigation 
include her immediate supervisors and several steps above them?
    Ms. Criswell. The investigation includes those that were 
deployed in this particular incident, and we have found no 
evidence that there is anything beyond this one employee's 
specific direction.
    Mr. Perry. You found no evidence at this point.
    Let me ask you this. Now, you can understand that, from 
America's perspective--certainly the people that weren't 
visited when FEMA was in town--that it would be in FEMA's best 
interest to just investigate this internally, say this is a 
one-off employee, that this claim of hers that it is a culture 
is just her trying to kind of make sure that the 
responsibility, the accountability doesn't fall on her. Why 
shouldn't this be an independent investigation by at least 
somebody like the IG?
    Ms. Criswell. The actions that this employee took are 
unacceptable----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I know that, and you know that. 
We agree on that.
    Ms. Criswell. I would welcome an investigation by the IG.
    Mr. Perry. But you haven't requested. Will you request one?
    Ms. Criswell. I will request one.
    Mr. Perry. Thank you.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady, the ranking member 
from Nevada, Ms. Titus.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you.
    I mentioned in my opening statement about how FEMA, in the 
new reality, has to deal with misinformation. And then you 
heard one of our witnesses, the Congresslady from Florida, 
mention how it had been a problem as they tried to recover from 
the hurricanes. I wonder if you could talk to us about what 
kind of policy or official strategy you all might be developing 
to deal with misinformation, and how it does indeed hurt your 
attempts to get relief out to people who have been hit by these 
disasters.
    Ms. Criswell. Ranking Member Titus, we have experienced 
some level and type of misinformation probably throughout 
FEMA's history. We have a standard practice of standing up a 
rumor control page, where we can put factual evidence out there 
because part of it is we also have a lot of people that are 
trying to defraud those that have just lost so much, and 
pretending to be a Federal agency such as FEMA to register even 
on their behalf.
    So, we have had a standing practice of, when we identify 
this information, of standing up some type of mechanism to 
ensure that the general public can get factual information from 
a validated Government source. In this case, it would be our 
source. But we continue to see this rise. We saw an increase in 
the amount of misinformation during the response to the Maui 
wildfires. But the amount of information and misinformation 
that we saw during the responses to Hurricanes Helene and 
Milton was at a scale that I had never seen before.
    And so, this requires us to now include in our planning and 
preparedness how we are going to be able to reach people. The 
goal is not necessarily to take down misinformation, but how do 
we ensure that people are getting actual correct information so 
they are not afraid to reach out to their Federal agency and 
apply for the assistance that they need, that they deserve, and 
that they are eligible for under the law.
    Ms. Titus. Did you provide this information in different 
languages? And do you work with community leaders who can help 
you to get the information out? Just not elected officers, but 
church leaders or civic leaders?
    Ms. Criswell. We work in a number of ways. For example, 
during Maui, we had one of our Native Hawaiian employees 
develop a public security safety announcement and deliver that 
out through her own social media channels to let people within 
her community know that they could and should apply for 
assistance.
    I remember an opportunity during Hurricane Ida in 
Louisiana, where we found a Vietnamese community, and we 
developed information in their native language and sent it out 
through their channels. And it was one of our most watched 
videos on FEMA, so we could get them actual information about 
what resources were available for them.
    We have a strong network through our faith-based leadership 
team to reach out to local faith leaders to help us get the 
information out to individuals and communities that may be 
apprehensive to try to reach out and apply for assistance.
    This is a team effort. It takes all of us in this holistic 
approach to be able to ensure anyone that was impacted by any 
natural disaster has access to the programs that we have, and 
that we remove the barriers for them receiving the critical 
assistance to start their recovery process.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you for that.
    GAO consistently reports that you all are drastically 
understaffed. We have tried to address that by having people be 
able to take time off and go back to their jobs to go and fight 
disasters. I think the most recent figure was 35 percent below 
what is needed, and we continue to put increasing demands on 
the Agency. We point out how they fail to be there in a certain 
amount of time, or not enough people on the ground, or not fast 
enough. But if you don't have the people and the resources to 
do this work, what can you expect?
    So, could you talk to us a little bit about how you are 
addressing those staffing challenges, and what we might do to 
be able to help you?
    Ms. Criswell. The number that we report on our daily 
operations brief, which has been in the news as of late showing 
that we had less than 5 percent of our personnel available, is 
one very specific part of our workforce, and that is those that 
are solely responsible to deploy to disasters, our disaster 
workforce.
    We have a layered staff to approaching--to approach--when 
we have multiple events or catastrophic events like we 
experienced during Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We reach out 
to our steady state staff, and we deploy them out into the 
field. We have our surge capacity force, which can bring in 
members from across the Federal Government that can go out into 
the field for 30 days. And we had over 800 members from across 
the Federal Government that went out into the communities to 
support them.
    This type of layered staffing approach is what we plan for. 
We plan for multiple events like this, but we appreciate tools 
like the CREW Act that was passed recently that give us the 
flexibility to recruit more people into our reservists, our 
intermittent workforce, which are really the heart of what we 
do. And that is the workforce that we need to continue to focus 
on because we don't need everybody every day. But given the 
amount of disasters that we are experiencing, this surge 
availability of our intermittent, our reservist workforce is 
critical to us being able to do the work.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Representative Graves.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator, thank you for being here.
    I want to make note, Mr. Chairman, we have discussed 
Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. We have not discussed 
Hurricane Francine.
    Administrator, I want to thank you for coming down to 
Louisiana for that. But I want to tell you why we are not 
talking about that today. We are not talking about that today 
because the citizens of Lafourche and Terrebonne Parish, where 
that hurricane made landfall, imposed both a sales tax and a 
property tax on themselves, have invested nearly $1 billion in 
building hurricane protection. We are at an interim phase of 
protection. We have built an 11-foot levee. Storm surge for 
Hurricane Francine was 11 feet. If that levee had not been 
there, if we had not done what we did, we would be having a 
very different hearing today.
    Administrator, I want to ask you a quick question. There 
are rumors, reports that FEMA is having discussions with 
Department of the Treasury about using ARP funds, American 
Rescue Plan funds, to help out with recovery. Is that accurate?
    Ms. Criswell. So, with the National Flood Insurance 
Program, at this moment, we are outpacing our payments, over 
$800 million in payments from the National Flood Insurance 
Program----
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. So, you all are 
having discussions about using American Rescue Plan funds for 
recovery?
    Ms. Criswell. We are not using American Rescue Plan----
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. There are no 
discussions about doing that?
    Ms. Criswell. Not for FEMA using American Rescue Plan 
funds.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Okay, okay, because there were 
reports that FEMA was having discussions about----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. No.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [continuing]. Using those--okay, 
thank you for clarifying.
    Now something else I would like for you to clarify. There 
has been a lot of discussion about FEMA's Emergency Food and 
Shelter Program and how it is handled. And I just, number one, 
that is a FEMA program. Number two, that is funded with 
taxpayer dollars. And so, whenever folks say that, well, no, 
no, no, you got to understand, it is a different program. These 
are all taxpayer dollars. And what you do is you triage or you 
prioritize what is needed, what is most important, and that is 
where we need to focus. I mean, do you agree with that?
    Ms. Criswell. The Shelter and Services Program is a program 
that was directed by Congress for FEMA to administer, yes----
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. Right, and so, 
these are all Federal taxpayer dollars. And so, if we need 
taxpayer dollars in a higher priority area, it would make sense 
to take funds from a lower priority area.
    What I am really struggling with is, as I understand--is 
that in North Carolina, for example, where I visited, you could 
have a flood or disaster victim that can get a check for $750. 
Yet when I go through and I look at the programs and resources 
that are available to a citizen of a different country that 
came illegally into the United States under the FEMA 
administered program using nonprofits, you could be eligible 
for housing, for food, for transportation, for healthcare 
costs, and others.
    I was able to come, and looking at the very documents that 
these nonprofits were using, I was able to get to a figure in 
excess of $10,000 for an individual--let me make note again--as 
a citizen of a foreign country. How would I explain to a 
taxpayer that a taxpayer, a citizen of the United States, is 
eligible for $750, yet a citizen of a foreign country under 
your Agency is still eligible for assistance of $10,000? How 
would I explain that to somebody?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, the resources that are available 
to people impacted by disasters are a variety of resources, and 
that $750 payment is just to cover those immediate needs. They 
are eligible for $42,500 in fiscal year 2024 for housing 
assistance, and $42,500 for other needs assistance. Those are 
the programs that are available to people that were impacted by 
disasters.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, it is very clear that today--
and I just visited North Carolina just a few weeks ago--it is 
very clear to me that there are folks that are in need right 
now. The disparity that exists in that a citizen of a foreign 
country that broke the law and came here illegally is they can 
get a plane ticket paid for, they can get a hotel room paid 
for--I think 200-and-something bucks a night if I remember 
right in some of the areas of maybe around Midland, Texas, 
somewhere around there. Again, healthcare, food, clothing. We 
have citizens of our own country that I engaged in North 
Carolina weeks and weeks after the disaster that have some of 
those same needs.
    This is ridiculous. It really is. And I understand that all 
of these decisions aren't yours. But, Administrator, you 
understand the ridiculousness of this situation, that we are 
not helping our own citizens yet we are out there using our own 
taxpayer dollars when we have a debt right now of $35 trillion 
as a Nation, and we are helping out citizens of other countries 
when we are not even meeting the fundamental needs of our own 
citizens. This really is an unacceptable situation.
    And I think if I were in your situation--yes, I understand 
you are asking for $100 billion, but I think that we should be 
looking and asking for reprogramming opportunities, because we 
have got to prioritize the limited resources that our Nation 
has and focus upon our own citizens.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes 
the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Larsen.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Just to sum up, I heard you say, in the case of North 
Carolina and probably in the case of Washington State if 
something similar happened, someone would be eligible for up to 
$85,000 of aid. Is that what I heard you say, $42,500 plus 
$42,500?
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, sir, $42,500 for fiscal year 2024. That 
went up in fiscal year 2025. But that also does not include the 
amount that we pay to support people in hotels, the amount that 
we put in to support people in manufactured housing units, or 
rent reimbursements. Those do not come out of the $42,500.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And on the emergency shelter 
support program, did FEMA create that program?
    Ms. Criswell. That program was directed by Congress.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Congress created that program.
    Ms. Criswell. Congress created that program.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And told you to do it.
    Ms. Criswell. And asked me to do it, directed me to do it.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, they didn't--we don't ask 
you to do things.
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, you don't.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. We told you to do it. So, it is 
really up to Congress to decide----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. Congress directed FEMA to 
administer the legacy program of EFSP humanitarian assistance--
--
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. All right----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. And then the establishment----
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. I got it. I think 
we should just issue a mirror to every Member of Congress who 
complains to you about the emergency shelter program, so they 
can look at who is responsible for doing anything about it, 
which--you are responsible for administering it, but you are 
not responsible for creating it.
    Ms. Criswell. Correct.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. On the disaster relief, so, it is 
a $100 billion request, not $100 million?
    Ms. Criswell. $100 billion.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, with a B.
    Ms. Criswell. $40 billion of which is FEMA's request.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. $40 billion which is FEMA's 
request. And tell me why FEMA needs that supplemental funding 
for the--especially for the Disaster Relief Fund before the end 
of the year.
    Ms. Criswell. We were given the ability to spend against 
the fiscal year 2025 budget with the continuing resolution----
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interposing]. Right.
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Which was just over $20 billion.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Right.
    Ms. Criswell. We went into that with a negative, because we 
had paused close to $9 billion in payments through our 
Immediate Needs Funding for fiscal year 2024.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Right.
    Ms. Criswell. So, the first bills that we paid were those 
recovery projects in communities across the United States.
    In Hurricane Helene and Milton, those costs are expensive. 
And the cost to respond to these two disasters is outpacing all 
other disasters in the previous 10 years, except for Hurricane 
Maria. And so, that is----
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. And I don't want 
to diminish the importance of Helene and Milton, but in that $9 
billion, some of that money went to places that weren't in the 
Southeast or Appalachia because of outstanding disaster 
recovery requests. Is that right?
    Ms. Criswell. Correct. It was projects--over 3,000 recovery 
projects across the United States we were not able to reimburse 
while we were in Immediate Needs Funding.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And so, that was the $20 billion. 
And now you are spending the $11 billion, plus that which you 
need otherwise because of Helene and Milton and because of the 
other outstanding requests that Congress hasn't funded since 
October 2023 in the last supplemental disaster request. Is that 
right?
    Ms. Criswell. We have been very transparent with Congress 
about what the health of the DRF is, and anticipated a shortage 
going into fiscal year 2024 as well as fiscal year 2025. We 
have put forth two supplemental requests in fiscal year 2024, 
neither of which were allowed. And so, we find ourselves in a 
situation----
    Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Neither of which 
were passed.
    Ms. Criswell. Weren't passed, correct.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, right, yes. No, we are 
allowed to pass them. We chose, as a Congress, not to, which 
is, again, we should--for some of this, we need to be looking 
at ourselves. But a lot of--for some of these things, we need 
to be looking at you.
    For instance, on Individual Assistance, a universal 
application as a for-instance, we want to get Representative 
Titus' and Representative Graves' bill passed so there is a 
universal application instead of having to fill out several 
applications just to get, sort of--it is like trying to fund a 
road, you've got to go for five or six different grants to get 
a road funded in transportation, rather than just get the one 
pot of money to do this. And for someone who is in a situation 
where they are trying to find a place to live because of a 
disaster, we need to cut down on the time and on the paperwork 
that they have to do to get access to this.
    So, can you talk a little bit about the need for universal 
application?
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, the Disaster Survivors Fairness Act, we 
really appreciate the efforts that have gone forth with this 
because it gives us a lot of flexibilities. It allows us to do 
direct repair to homes. But the other piece is about the 
universal application. We want to reduce the burden that these 
individuals are facing after they have just experienced 
probably the worst day in their life. And so, to be able to 
make it easier on them is the goal of the universal 
application.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. That is great. I want to just 
conclude by talking a little bit about the politics of the 
situation. And I condemn what this employee did, as well. And 
playing politics with disaster aid hurts Americans. It hurts 
all of us, especially when they need the Government most. And 
so, it is troubling that even the President-elect said he would 
deny disaster aid to California if the Governor there doesn't 
listen to him. And at an event in September, the President-
elect said that the Governor of California is going to sign 
those papers--if he doesn't sign those papers related to 
California water policy, he won't get money to put out all the 
fires, and we won't give him the money to put out fires, and 
then he has got problems. It is not the first time he has done 
something like this.
    In 2019, the President-elect tweeted, ``Billions of dollars 
are being sent to the State of California for forest fires 
that, with proper forest management, would never happen. Unless 
they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered 
FEMA to send no more money.'`
    The point I want to make is that it is up to this committee 
to responsibly hold anyone accountable who is seeking to 
politicize disaster aid, from a crew leader at FEMA to the 
President-elect or the President. None of this is acceptable, 
and we have a responsibility to hold everyone accountable for 
these comments that get in the way of getting disaster aid to 
people.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes the Representative from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, Administrator Criswell, for being here 
today. A few months ago, you agreed to consider the flood maps 
fully funded by the Mississippi State Legislature and 
implemented by the Southern Mississippi Planning and 
Development District. I appreciate your commitment, as so many 
of my constituents are suffering due to FEMA's outdated, 
inaccurate flood maps.
    Last month, I hosted a roundtable on this issue, and was 
pleased to hear that your staff is working in good faith with 
district stakeholders. I will give credit where credit is due. 
However, as we have discussed today, the recent reports of one 
of your staffers intentionally withholding Federal aid solely 
on political preference is beyond unacceptable, and 
dramatically increases the political divide in our country. 
Unfortunately, we could keep hammering this point. But today I 
am not here--I want to focus on something else, some of the 
things going on in my district.
    One of my goals as a Congressman is to improve the 
efficiency of FEMA. During my first term, I have engaged with 
region 4 regarding the dozens of projects in my district, from 
the gulf coast to the Pine Belt, that have drug out far too 
long without a resolution or, in some cases, even without a 
clear update. These include projects throughout Biloxi, 
Gulfport, Long Beach, Pass Christian, and Bay St. Louis, 
Waveland, and Hattiesburg.
    Here is a timeline of events my staff and I have discussed 
with your team at region 4.
    [Poster displayed.]
    Mr. Ezell. Administrator Criswell, this upcoming August 
will be a 20-year anniversary for Hurricane Katrina, 20 years. 
That is nearly two decades the city of Biloxi is still waiting 
on some of their infrastructure projects. How, 20 years later, 
are there still unresolved projects from Katrina?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, recovery is very complicated, 
and every project has its own unique situation. I am happy to 
look into the specific projects that you are most----
    Mr. Ezell [interposing]. And thank you----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Concerned about.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you for that. As you can see, this is 
pretty hard to defend. Twenty years, you know, twenty years is 
a long time waiting on to get some infrastructure projects 
fixed, which have been funded.
    Another answer I hope you can clarify for me today: If an 
applicant identifies an error or omission in the original cost 
estimate, do you believe FEMA may increase funding for an 
improved project, yes or no?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I would have to understand the 
specifics of that to be able to answer it accurately.
    Mr. Ezell. If an applicant identifies an error or an 
omission in the original cost estimate, do you believe FEMA may 
increase funding for an improved project?
    Ms. Criswell. Again, Congressman, without understanding the 
specifics of that project, I don't have an accurate answer.
    Mr. Ezell. Okay, let's move on. I take that as a no.
    According to FEMA, this project--and this is in Biloxi and 
Waveland--Biloxi, correction. According to FEMA, this project 
has not been finished because it was not accurately estimated. 
But I have in writing a letter from FEMA right here [indicating 
letter] that the most recent CEF in 2019 accurately reflected 
the complexity of the project. Can you follow up with this 
letter--and we will make sure that you get it--that FEMA has 
already confirmed, and direct your staff to fund the project at 
the cost accurately reflected?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I would be happy to follow up on 
that specific project.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much. I take that as a yes.
    The second project that I would like to raise with you 
today is the Waveland Mississippi Pier. In October, I learned 
that the original reason why this project was not funded was 
because the scope of the work had changed. However, the city 
has told me the project has not changed since day one of the 
disaster. Now I am hearing the original project reflected what 
the city says, but your Agency claims it should not have.
    So, now we are kind of back to step 1. This stuff just gets 
so confusing, our people just don't know which way to go 
sometimes. So, what is it going to be? Was the mitigation work 
never included to begin with, or did FEMA include this work by 
mistake?
    Again, confusing. We get one answer from you sometimes, and 
we try to go along with it, and things just keep changing until 
it gets so confusing until nobody really knows what to do. So, 
we got to get this figured out, as we can see how this creates 
so much uncertainty and confusing the people who are trying to 
navigate through the process, because Waveland has got issues 
going on right now.
    My staff and I have worked tirelessly to try to work some 
of these things out with FEMA. But still, if you look at 20 
years for projects from Katrina that have been funded that have 
not been completed, and again, I don't want to keep beating the 
drum about what one employee said or what may be the policy, 
but I truly hope that the lack of funding these projects isn't 
due to Mississippi being a red State.
    And with that being said, I need a commitment from you 
today that you will look into all these projects, that they 
will be handled, and that my constituents will get the help 
that they need back home.
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, you have my commitment that we 
will look into all of those projects, and you have my absolute 
determination that we do not discriminate against any State. We 
provide support for everyone impacted by disasters.
    Mr. Ezell. And we appreciate that. But when you are looking 
at 20 years from Katrina, we should not be having this 
discussion. So, thank you very much.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from Washington, DC, Representative 
Norton.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Climate change has fueled an alarming rise in the number 
and severity of natural disasters. With once-in-a-century 
storms becoming a matter of course, it is critical to continue 
to invest in our emergency management workforce to respond to 
these increasing emergencies and help rebuild affected 
communities. Yet the Government Accountability Office found 
that in recent years, FEMA has been significantly understaffed.
    Administrator Criswell, what actions should Congress take 
to train, expand, and retain FEMA's emergency management 
workforce?
    Ms. Criswell. Congresswoman Norton, our workforce is the 
heart and soul of what we do. These are often people that I 
have talked to that have been disaster survivors themselves and 
have chosen to come work for FEMA because they wanted to be 
able to give back like they received assistance when they were 
impacted.
    We appreciate the passage of the CREW Act that was 
instrumental in allowing us the flexibilities to have a more 
diverse and expansive workforce through our intermittent 
workers of our reservists, giving them the ability to keep a 
full-time job, yet deploy when needed to come support people 
that have been impacted by disasters.
    I encourage you to continue to reach out to your 
communities and have them reach out to FEMA. We often hire 
local hires in communities who turn into our reservists, our 
core employees, or our full-time employees, and we appreciate 
Congress' continued support of our workforce, making sure that 
they have all of the tools and the resources they need to 
continue to do the critical work of helping people before, 
during, and after disasters.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you. Administrator Criswell, what would 
be the impact on communities and disaster survivors if Congress 
does not pass the disaster supplemental appropriation bill?
    Ms. Criswell. Our current balance within the Disaster 
Relief Fund is just under $5 billion. We went into Immediate 
Needs Funding earlier this year in August, when we reached a $3 
billion mark. We expect, without a supplemental, that we will 
have the need to go back into Immediate Needs Funding within 
the next few weeks without a supplemental.
    What that means is we will continue to support the 
lifesaving, life-sustaining work, especially what is going on 
in western North Carolina and all of the States impacted by 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But we have to pause the 
reimbursement to communities that are rebuilding. FEMA 
reimburses communities as they rebuild and repair their 
critical infrastructure. Many of these small, rural communities 
often can't move on to the next project until they get 
reimbursed from the one that they are waiting for, and so, this 
has a significant impact on a community's ability to have an 
effective recovery when they don't have the cash flow because 
they are waiting for the Federal Government to reimburse them 
for what they are eligible for under the disaster declaration.
    Ms. Norton. I commend you and FEMA's thousands of staff 
from across the country who left their homes to deploy to 
communities in need and provide them with assistance in the 
face of destruction, trauma, and loss.
    And I urge the House to bring a disaster supplemental 
appropriations bill to the floor immediately. And I yield back, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now 
recognizes the Representative from Utah, Representative Maloy.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Criswell, I have been sitting here listening 
to some of my colleagues talk about how FEMA is battling 
underfunding and understaffing and misinformation, and I just 
want it noted that I think the willingness of the public to 
believe information is a symptom of distrust of Federal 
agencies. And being here and answering questions and addressing 
these problems is probably the best thing we can do to battle 
misinformation. If FEMA employees are making political 
decisions that they shouldn't make and being fired for it, and 
we are talking about it here, I think that will help.
    And then as far as funding and staffing issues, they have 
got to be at least partly caused by deploying FEMA to non-
Stafford Act events. And as a member of the legislative branch, 
I have a responsibility, as a member of this committee, to 
exercise oversight of FEMA. And one of the things that we have 
to look into is whether FEMA is understaffed and underfunded, 
or if they are outside of their mission. I think it is 
critical, as a Member of Congress, that we hold agencies 
accountable to be doing the things they are authorized by 
Congress and only the things they are authorized to do by 
Congress.
    So, with those observations, I am going to yield the 
remainder of my time to Mr. Graves to continue his line of 
questioning from earlier.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you very much, Ms. Maloy. I 
appreciate it.
    Administrator, I want to get something clear here. I mean, 
I understand you are saying that there is $42,500 in programs 
that are available. Let me say it again. There is still $10,000 
and maybe even more available for citizens that have come here 
illegally from other countries that are not citizens of the 
United States. So, I don't think that we reconcile by saying 
that, oh, yes, but they could potentially be eligible for this 
much. There still is $10,000 or more that we are potentially 
giving to people that broke the law, that are citizens of other 
countries that came to the United States illegally.
    I understand what Mr. Larsen said, Ranking Member Larsen 
said. But the reality is, you are the Administrator of this 
Agency. You are the one who prepares the budget request and 
asks for these funds, and you are the one who is sitting here 
now saying we need $100 billion more.
    I think it is appropriate in this case to reprioritize 
funds and say this isn't an appropriate use of taxpayer funds 
under the fact that we are facing a $35 trillion debt.
    One of the other issues, the inspector general report came 
out just in August and said in excess of $70 billion in 
unliquidated assets, unliquidated obligations dating back to 
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 are still out there and aren't being 
used. Why can't those funds be tapped and get the resources out 
to the people that need them right now?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, again, the Shelter and Services 
Program was directed by Congress for FEMA to administer. The 
funding for that program was given to CBP and directed by 
Congress to be transferred to FEMA to administer that program, 
and we are administering it in accordance with the law at the 
direction of Congress.
    As far as the programs and the funds that you are talking 
about as it relates to unobligated projects dating back to 
Hurricane Katrina, we consistently review all of the projects 
that are out there. Projects are obligated at what they expect 
the cost to be, and we are always reviewing to see which funds 
are no longer going to be needed because the estimates came in 
lower, and bringing those back in. We provide this in detail to 
Congress on a monthly basis on what those recoupments are.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Administrator. Look, 
the last thing I want to say is that I am very concerned about 
this prejudice about the Trump signs. I have seen other 
policies coming out of FEMA that I believe also are prejudiced. 
You and I have had discussions about some of those, and I look 
forward to getting to the bottom of this.
    I yield the remaining time to the chair.
    Mr. Perry. Did you--who do you--who did you yield to? Okay.
    Ms. Maloy. I will take the remainder of my time----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. All right, thank you.
    Ms. Maloy [continuing]. And yield it to the chairman.
    Mr. Perry. Administrator, just a followup on my friend from 
Louisiana here. Look, you are an American citizen. Shelter and 
Services Program, we get it, we agree. Look, not something I 
would vote for, but it happened, and you have the job of 
administering it. But you are an American citizen. You see 
illegal foreign nationals receiving money to the tune of 
billions of dollars in this administration alone, while your 
own citizens in your own country dealing with an Agency for 
which you work, and are being criticized right now because they 
are not getting the money--have you requested a reprogramming 
of this money?
    I understand it has been thrown in your lap, I get it, not 
something I agreed with, but it is in your lap. But you see it. 
Have you requested a reprogramming of the money?
    Ms. Criswell. This is funding, Chairman, that we were 
directed to administer by Congress. We are administering it at 
the direction of Congress.
    Mr. Perry. And you have no interest in reprogramming it.
    Ms. Criswell. This is funding that was directed to us to 
administer----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I understand, but you are a 
citizen, too. You are working here. So, do you see this as a 
misalignment of priorities when you are asking for more money--
maybe rightly so--asking for more personnel, knowing that 
millions, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars sent to 
people here illegally while people, the citizens of this 
country for which the administration and the organization that 
you work is supposed to be there for them, aren't receiving 
that money. Do you have any interest in requesting a 
reprogramming of that funding?
    Ms. Criswell. This is funding that was given to CBP and 
directed by Congress to transfer to FEMA to administer the 
Shelter and Services----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Yes, ma'am. I understand that, 
and I guess I get your answer.
    I would just say this in support of this organization 
called the Cajun Navy. People are frustrated and upset with 
FEMA's response. Maybe rightly so, maybe not rightly so. But it 
seems to me that this nonprofit known as the Cajun Navy can get 
in the game immediately, make changes on the fly that impact 
people's lives. They don't have to go through a bunch of 
redtape and cry ``We don't have people, we don't have money.'` 
They get people and equipment to the site on time and make a 
difference. And quite honestly, that is what FEMA should be 
doing.
    So, maybe FEMA should go talk to the Cajun Navy and say, 
``Why can't we do what you are doing? What have we got to 
change here to do that?'`
    And with that, I yield, and I now recognize the gentleman 
from California, Representative Garamendi.
    Mr. Garamendi. No, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to take the 
bait. I think she identified the problem, however. It is us. If 
you have a problem with what the CBP is doing in transferring 
their responsibility to FEMA, well, why don't you write the 
bill?
    Now, let me move on to what I really want to get to here. 
Yes, there is a shortfall of funding. I think it has been 
discussed multiple times here. In that funding program, or the 
shortfall, there is a question about unpaid obligations. We 
have heard about 20 years ago with Katrina, but there are some 
that are much more recent, specifically the COVID response in 
2021, 2022. There was a Federal program authorized in the 
American Rescue Plan that hospitals and other agencies were 
directed to provide services, and FEMA programs would reimburse 
them. You have made good effort on reimbursing them as far as 
the money would go. Still, about 40 percent of the money--
specifically to hospitals--in California and other States have 
yet to be paid in the supplemental that you are requesting.
    Do you intend to use some of that supplemental money to pay 
for those obligations that were incurred by public agencies--
hospitals, specifically--so that they would be reimbursed? You 
are at 60 percent. There is another 40 percent to go.
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, part of our supplemental request 
does include the anticipated cost to reimburse jurisdictions, 
hospitals, and other eligible entities for the costs that they 
incurred through COVID-19.
    For the hospitals specifically, we are undergoing an 
extensive review with a third party to make sure that we are 
not duplicating funding that they already received. We feel 
that this is an important step to ensure that we are using the 
taxpayer dollars to support the actual needs, and not 
duplicating payments that they may have received from other 
sources or from insurance, et cetera. And so, both of those 
will work in unison.
    As we continue to review the submissions from hospitals, we 
validate that the costs have not been paid by another source. 
This supplemental request will include then reimbursing those 
jurisdictions, those hospitals, those entities for those costs.
    Mr. Garamendi. I really like your ``yes, but'' answer. 
Normally we don't like the ``but'` part, but I am pleased to 
hear that FEMA is auditing and also very carefully looking into 
these payments. I am confident that you won't find a problem in 
California. I say that with certainty. However, nonetheless, it 
is important that you do the audits and that you make sure 
that--and it applies to other programs also, some of those that 
may date back 20 years or more. So, thank you for doing that.
    I will note that the California Hospital Association 
believes that there is $1.3 billion that would be appropriately 
owed to California. However, check to be sure.
    Moving on, there are other issues that are also in play, 
some of which are really important in small communities. And I 
want to thank you for a change that you have made in your 
policies of prior funding for very small projects for across 
mostly small communities, some urban, some rural. I believe it 
is at a $1 million level. That might have enough money to get a 
large culvert repaired. I would ask you to take a look at that, 
and probably better to add a zero.
    And once again, the ``but'` part of your answer, really 
important here. So, if you are going to put money out ahead of 
the normal process of reimbursement, good. It is necessary, 
the--many small communities, counties, cities simply cannot 
front the money for 3, 4 years before they get reimbursed. 
However, $1 million is a good step. Add a zero and you are 
probably at a level that would allow those communities to get 
their projects underway.
    I want to thank you for your courage. I want to thank you 
for your standing tall and honest about the incredible pressure 
that you have received from the two recent hurricanes and from 
those other disasters that have been declared. You have an 
incredibly difficult job, and you are leading in a way that is 
exemplary.
    With that, I yield back.
    Oh, by the way, I got 11 seconds. Mr. Chairman, if we've 
got a problem with illegals getting money, I look forward to 
your bill.
    Mr. Perry. You might see it there, Mr. Garamendi.
    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana to make a 
request.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous 
consent to include in the record a November 18 letter from 
United Cajun Navy official Brian Trascher that includes 
observations from Todd Terrell, Sara Galliano, and others 
related to Hurricane Milton and----

Hon. Chairman Sam Graves (MO),
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
Hon. Chairman Scott Perry (PA),
Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency 
        Management,
United States House of Representatives.

    Dear Chairman Perry:
    My name is Brian Trascher, and I am the National Vice President and 
Public Information Officer for the United Cajun Navy. We are a 501c3 
Nonprofit disaster response and relief organization based in Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana, and we have more than a dozen state chapters. As 
Hurricane Helene approached the coast of Florida's ``big bend'' on 
September 27th, 2024 I was actually inside of the National Response 
Coordination Center at FEMA headquarters in Washington DC. This was by 
invitation and had been scheduled a couple of months prior to the 
visit. Coincidentally, our meetings and tour of FEMA headquarters took 
place on the same day that the NRCC was put on a Level 1 activation due 
to the impending Hurricane Helene. We were invited to sit in the main 
conference room as FEMA leadership participated in video meetings with 
regional offices, appointed and elected officials who were all 
coordinating the National Response to what was expected to be a 
catastrophic weather event.
    Our President and Founder, Todd Terrell, flew back to Baton Rouge 
that evening so that he could ensure that supplies were being loaded 
onto trucks from our warehouse and ready to preposition in Florida. I 
stayed behind in DC with our Executive Director Sara Galliano to finish 
out our meeting schedule she had arranged with the Red Cross and 
Pentagon, then I flew back to Louisiana on September 28th.
    We had prepositioned supply trucks and SAR teams in the Florida 
Panhandle to more efficiently mobilize into affected areas when the 
weather conditions became safe. Prior to Helene making landfall, the 
United Cajun Navy's chief meteorologist Jeff George warned Todd and I 
of his concern about the forward speed of the storm. He explained that 
by moving so fast, the high intensity center would not degrade quickly 
enough before reaching inland to the mountainous areas of Eastern 
Tennessee, Eastern Georgia, and Western North Carolina. He suggested 
that the rainfall amounts could cause massive mudslides and 
catastrophic flooding in those communities who were not likely 
expecting this type of weather event.
    After watching this prediction unfold, and getting reports from 
team members within our Georgia chapter, we quickly realized that the 
greatest need was going to actually be in these mountainous regions 
well north of the Florida Coast. On September 29th, we redirected 
approximately half of our fleet of supply trucks northward to Eastern 
Georgia. We also received reports that traditional interstate routes 
going into parts of Tennessee and North Carolina were potentially 
washed out and impassable by vehicles. Todd ordered me to fly to North 
Carolina to get a sitrep from the ground since communications were very 
spotty. I arrived in Hickory, North Carolina on October 1st and took a 
reconnaissance flight via helicopter into the mountains where I was 
able to survey the towns surrounding Asheville, North Carolina. When I 
made a fuel stop in Asheville, I did run into some FEMA executives who 
were already on the ground. They were coordinating the arrival of more 
of their own associates as well as planning missions with the National 
Guard. We can testify to the fact that FEMA was on the ground early, 
however there are many reasons that will no doubt be investigated as to 
why the execution of the response was largely viewed by the public as 
delayed at best. Some of the meetings we had participated in at FEMA 
headquarters the week before had to do with FEMA's desire to work with 
NGOs such as the United Cajun Navy to coordinate first response as FEMA 
is not technically a first responder. There are many regulations and 
parts of the Stafford Act that will need to be examined so that these 
relationships can be solidified and better coordinated in the future. 
We hope that whoever leads FEMA in the next administration will 
continue these efforts to work with groups like ours.
    During my initial aerial surveillance, I was immediately able to 
surmise that our traditional method of swift water rescue was not going 
to be the appropriate response for this mission. We put out a call to 
our network for fixed and rotary wing aircraft pilots to deploy to the 
region as soon as possible. One of the first chopper pilots to contact 
me was a volunteer named Ezra Rickards from Delaware, who flew his long 
range Bel helicopter all the way down to North Carolina at his own 
expense. Ezra performed over 80 rescue missions with his aircraft alone 
and was the first aircraft to make a supply drop for the United Cajun 
Navy in Black Mountain in those first days. Our Georgia chapter 
president, Shannon Ross, coordinated a fleet of approximately 45 
private fixed wing aircraft out of an airport in Peachtree, Georgia 
where the United Cajun Navy had delivered supplies and provided fuel 
for these aircraft to fly into Western North Carolina airfields. We 
then expanded the role of our helicopter vendor, Total Flight 
Solutions, out of Davidson County North Carolina. TFS was able to reach 
beyond their own fleet and coordinate approximately 50 total rotary 
aircraft that flew non-stop missions of supplies into the mountains and 
evacuating people out of the mountains. This air operation went on from 
dusk till dawn for at least 7 days. In addition to the United Cajun 
Navy, other NGOs such as Operation AirDrop, Operation Helo, and Mercury 
One were coordinating air operations in much of the same manner for 
roughly the same period and beyond. Congressman Cory Mills of Florida 
personally participated in airlift and heavy lift rescue operations for 
several days or a week, he can confirm that precise duration.
    It's hard to estimate how many pounds of supplies were brought in 
to the affected areas and how many people were evacuated out, but 
between the joint operations of United Cajun Navy and our partner NGOs 
It's safe to say that hundreds of thousands of pounds of emergency 
supplies and hundreds of the flood victims were evacuated out of those 
towns. Some of our partner agencies may have more accurate numbers in 
this regard.
    Since it took a while for routes to open for our semi-trucks, part 
of my job became to identify regional airports that were open and could 
handle airdrop supplies as the Hickory airport was starting to exceed 
capacity. On October 4th I came upon the regional airport in Stanley 
County, North Carolina and I noticed there were a lot of National Guard 
troops in uniform at this location. It turns out that Stanley County is 
home to the 235th ATC Squadron and the 118th ASOS Squadron of the NC 
Air Guard. These are two air guard units whom one specializes in air 
traffic control and landing zones, while the other specializes and 
aerial surveillance and SAR. These are skills that were crucially 
necessary to the ongoing rescue ops in Western North Carolina. The 
reason why there wasn't much activity at that location was because 
neither squadron had been activated yet. Imagine my incredulity of 
learning this information after UCN and many other small nonprofits and 
volunteers had spent days risking life and limb to save strangers while 
these two native North Carolinian expert squadrons sat idle and 
frustrated by their lack of orders to go in and help. The 235th and 
118th were eventually activated, but not until at least 6 days after 
Helene made landfall in North Carolina.
    As we canvased the affected areas in the mountain towns surrounding 
Asheville, the United Cajun Navy was able to make local contacts and 
partner on staging sites with landing zone capabilities. We first set 
up at Excel College in Black Mountain, where the Director and many of 
the students of that school volunteered sorting and making supply runs 
to victims in the community. Excel is still participating in relief 
operations to this day. We also coordinated with a gentleman named Adam 
Smith, a retired special forces soldier who was able to set up a supply 
drop and staging area with the landing zone at the Harley-Davidson 
dealership in Swannanoa.
    The typical UCN deployment to a disaster area usually ranges from 7 
to 14 days, because by that time the locals are up to speed and we're 
able to pass the baton to the long-term recovery groups. Since Western 
North Carolina has, in our opinion, been so badly neglected and the 
damage is so vast, we have made an exception and have joined the long-
term recovery group and will participate for as long as we have the 
resources to support the mission. We've made many partnerships with 
local, national, and international nonprofits who are committed to the 
long-term recovery for Helene victims. UCN has secured warehouse space 
as well as land where we have been able to place camper and RV 
donations dedicated to housing displaced families. Winter has arrived 
in Western North Carolina and far too many of our fellow Americans are 
still sleeping in tents without electricity or potable water. We're 
doing everything within our power to help these people, but we can only 
operate within our means, and we can't help but wonder when the cavalry 
will finally arrive for them.
    Many people ask us why we do what we do. The answer is simple, this 
happened to us, and we know the path forward. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina 
caused the levees surrounding New Orleans to fail and the city rapidly 
flooded forcing many unsuspecting residents out of their homes and 
neighborhoods, and unfortunately drowned an untold number of innocent 
people. The world watched as Good Samaritans came in their own boats at 
their own expense to rescue their fellow Louisianians from the 
floodwaters. Our Founder Todd Terrell was part of the original 68 
vessels informally deputized by Lt. General Russell Honore, then 
Commander of Joint Task Force Katrina. And thus, the ``Cajun Navy'' was 
born. It's been 19 years, and the federal government still doesn't seem 
to understand the concept of a rapid response to a natural disaster. 
Again, we do this because it happened to us, and we don't want to see 
it happen again to any of our fellow Americans. The federal response in 
Western North Carolina has brought back many bad memories for us, but 
being able to respond quickly, save lives, and give hope to our new 
Appalachian friends has helped to heal some old wounds. But that 
doesn't change the fact that in the richest country on earth, we should 
have a better coordinated response between government agencies and 
experienced NGOs like the United Cajun Navy and others to make sure 
that the loss of life is minimal after the next major weather event. We 
like to say that we are the ``First Shrimp Boots on the Ground, From 
Landfall to Light''. Western North Carolina, Eastern Georgia, and 
Eastern Tennessee are still waiting for the light. We thank all members 
of Congress for their service and commitment to finding the answers 
we're all seeking. We stand ready to continue serving in our own 
capacities as well as field any questions Members may have. Thank you 
for the opportunity to testify.
            Respectfully submitted,
                                            Brian Trascher,
    National Vice President and Public Information Officer, United 
                                                        Cajun Navy.

    Mr. Perry. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New 
York, Representative Molinaro.
    Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Perry, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you, Administrator.
    I want to just take issue with--this could be my last 5 
minutes on this committee, so, I am going to take all 4 minutes 
and 10 seconds. My colleague across the aisle, with all due 
respect, offered what is by far the easiest and most 
disingenuous argument.
    You administer the one department in domestic policy that 
has to triage and to set priorities, your department. And in 
the case of a declared emergency, either as it affords itself 
under the Stafford Act or by some extension by the President or 
your own determination, you are empowered and your department 
is empowered to decide what of the programs you are running 
today should take precedent or priority over the others.
    Yes, sure, we can pass a law that limits the Shelter and 
Services funding that stops dollars getting to illegal 
immigrants, but you have to make that decision every day. It is 
the only department in the Federal Government that empowers you 
to do so.
    My colleague, Mr. Graves, said earlier that you have to 
agree that it is absurd for Americans in the South, having now 
faced what is, by far, among the worst emergencies to befall 
our country, that they see those who were placed here, illegal 
immigrants placed here by their Federal Government, they see 
the not-for-profits you engage with handing out ease-of-access 
dollars while they have to struggle to get first the $750.
    I administered emergency response for 20 years at the 
county level. Believe me, there is a lot of improvements and 
coordination that FEMA must engage in. But do you see the 
absurdity? Because I haven't heard an answer that suggests it. 
Do you see the absurdity that American citizens are getting 
their $750 and then, yes, struggling through a very complicated 
process to meet the thresholds necessary to get the aid they 
need to have housing, food, and shelter, while your Agency is 
contracting with not-for-profits to easily hand out access to 
those who are here, placed here illegally? Do you see the 
absurdity?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, our mission is to support 
people, help people before, during, and after disasters, and 
I----
    Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. Do you think that there is----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. [Inaudible] priority decisions--
--
    Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. Ma'am, do you think that--do 
you think, in responding to an emergency, the priority of 
Government ought to be to ensure that American citizens are 
triaged, and that the services of FEMA are focused on 
responding to them and their service programs first?
    Ms. Criswell. I absolutely believe that the services that 
FEMA provides should be supporting the people that have been 
impacted by disasters.
    Mr. Molinaro. Should there be equity in that distribution 
and response? Should there be fairness in that response?
    Ms. Criswell. We should make sure that all people have 
access to our programs, and that we----
    Mr. Molinaro [interposing]. Fair enough.
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Remove the barrier----
    Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. So, this is my time, and I get 
4 minutes--2 minutes to do it.
    So, in fairness, do you not see the inequity in those 
placed here illegally having taxpayer support, a plane ticket, 
a house, a hotel, food, cell phones, access to healthcare--do 
you not see the inequity that they have access immediately?
    I want us to be a welcoming Nation, but if we cannot 
respond to those who are living in emergencies, then we do not 
have the right to claim that we are the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. Do you not see the inequity?
    Ms. Criswell. Congress directed----
    Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. No, Congress established law. 
You have to prioritize, triage, and decide. During COVID, there 
were Federal agencies and local governments who were 
responsible for providing lots of services. We said in this 
emergency, you are not going to do that. We told Federal 
employees, ``Get back out onto the ground, because you have got 
to respond to a public health pandemic,'` and most of them were 
never involved in public health response.
    You established the priority. Why can you not say today 
that the priority ought to have been to make sure that American 
citizens were getting first response, adequate response, and 
not distracted response? Why can you not say that?
    Ms. Criswell. Our priority is the American people, and we 
administered our disaster programs----
    Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. And you will not admit to or 
acknowledge the inequities. I am not trying to be combative. 
This is absurd. Today, you spent some time and my colleagues 
talked about misinformation, first, misinformation is freedom 
of speech, whether it is true or not. But you know what fuels 
misinformation? The inequity that FEMA has engaged in, because 
it allows for people to assume, whether true or not, a level of 
either incompetence, inefficiency, or lack of concern for those 
who are struggling the most when they see individuals entering 
this country illegally and then are transported here and 
receiving services.
    And you know that it is easier to access the Shelter and 
Services funding than it is to access disaster relief aid, 
housing assistance, small business aid. You know that it is 
more complicated. Doesn't that, in and of itself, fuel the 
misinformation?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, we are administering that 
program, as directed by Congress.
    Mr. Molinaro. You are not administering the program as 
directed by Congress. We established the law, we established 
the provisions, and we expect the person, whether it is the 
President or the Administrator of FEMA, to decide what is and 
is not priority in response to emergency. And by that very 
measure, with all due respect, the Agency has failed.
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman----
    Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. And it has lost focus.
    My time is up. I yield back to the chairman.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from Oregon, Representative Hoyle.
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you 
for being here today.
    A few things. We have a lot of fires, ice storms, floods 
that have gotten more and more severe. This year, we have had 
1.9 million acres of land that was burnt with fires, and that 
is over twice the 10-year average.
    But as things are getting hotter and drier, and climate is 
getting more extreme, some of my colleagues want to argue about 
why, but what I want to say is the fact of the matter is FEMA 
is set up for when natural disasters happen every once in a 
while, maybe every 6 months. And so, you have a lot of 
temporary Stafford Act employees. Is it true that four-fifths 
of your employees are in that temporary Stafford Act category?
    Ms. Criswell. Ma'am, can you repeat the number that you 
said?
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. Four-fifths. My understanding is 
20,000 out of your 25,000 employees are in that, is that----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. I believe that would be high. 
I believe about half of our workforce, maybe a little bit more 
than half, are direct employees out of the Disaster Relief Fund 
and support disasters directly. The rest support our steady 
state missions.
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. Okay. So, half of your employees. And 
the fact is this has become a full-time job.
    I represent a lot of rural communities. I have never seen a 
difference between how FEMA treats my rural, conservative areas 
and my more blue areas. And it seems like you had an employee 
that acted inappropriately, unethically, in an untrustworthy 
manner, and then lied about who--apparently, according to the 
facts that we know so far--lied about who was responsible for 
that, right?
    Ms. Criswell. We had a single employee that took actions 
that were unacceptable by directing her team to avoid homes.
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. Right. I just think that if you have 
an employee that acts in an unethical manner, it follows that 
maybe they are not telling the truth. But again, I have never 
seen any difference.
    And I am going to go on to a different subject, because I 
do represent Oregon. We had 23 fires in mid-July at the same 
time, earlier than we had ever had fires, 23 incident command 
centers. Just following a massive ice storm, we had floods. We 
have our range land, our ranchers, our farms that were burnt.
    Now, we have a mix of Federal and State and private land, 
and our Governor has asked for President Biden to approve a 
major disaster declaration for wildfire and storm damage 
between July 10 and September 7. Our requests include Public 
Assistance for our six frontier counties--Gilliam, Grant, 
Jefferson, Umatilla, Wasco, and Wheeler; Hazard Mitigation 
Grant Programs to support projects that reduce the impact of 
future disasters; and a State cost-sharing waiver waiving the 
State's costs for emergency work in response to this disaster. 
This has been the most expensive fire season ever.
    And what it seems like is FEMA is looking at each of these 
fires individually, when really what we would like to see is 
for all of these to be taken together, because that is how we 
had to manage it. So, when can this--and if you have to get 
back to me, I understand because this isn't a committee hearing 
on this--but when can the State reasonably expect a response to 
the disaster declaration request? We have our farmers and 
ranchers that are really, really struggling, have lost 
everything, and they really need this help.
    Ms. Criswell. Congresswoman, we did receive that request 
from the Governor, I believe, on October 21, and I recognize 
and know how important this is to you. I will certainly go back 
and follow up with my team to see where it is at in the 
process, and we will get back with your staff.
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. Okay. And then the disaster 
declaration process often feels slow to affected communities 
and--we have had this--again, blue and red districts. And I do 
think that your Agency has a giant job and doesn't necessarily 
always have the resources to do it. How can FEMA streamline the 
steps between the Agency receiving a disaster declaration 
request and submitting a recommendation to the President?
    Ms. Criswell. The biggest thing that we see is really at 
the capacity of the State and local level, and whether or not 
they have the resources to be able to quickly and effectively 
determine the amount of damage and submit that paperwork. We 
have been increasing our support by putting what we call FEMA 
integration team members and embedding staff right with State 
offices so they can assist with that process. We have 10 
regions and a regional administrator over each of them that 
have great relationships with the State directors and work very 
closely with them to help them understand what the steps are, 
where they need to go, and to work through and provide 
technical assistance as needed.
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. We are over time. What I will say is 
these are cash-strapped----
    Ms. Criswell [interposing]. Yes.
    Ms. Hoyle of Oregon [continuing]. Rural counties that lost 
a lot of their economic engine when the timber industry 
crashed. And so, they are doing the best they can. But what I 
would say is we really need to figure out how to get these 
answers quicker. And thank you for your response.
    Ms. Criswell. I am happy to work with you on that.
    Mr. Perry. The gentlelady yields. The Chair now recognizes 
Representative Stauber.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much.
    Administrator, thanks for being here today. And also, 
thanks for your service in the Colorado National Guard, I 
appreciate that. I also appreciate your willingness to tell 
us--and you have been in several committee hearings--to talk 
about how you let that employee go who weaponized the Federal 
Government. The Federal Government has been weaponized against 
the American people. This is case in point. I think you did 
your job, and I think you did it well. You terminated that 
employee who weaponized the Federal Government as quickly as 
you can. And I think we need to do more of that.
    With that being said, your mission statement is helping 
people before, during, and after disasters. When you were in 
the Colorado National Guard, did you have annual reviews?
    Ms. Criswell. Did I have a what?
    Mr. Stauber. Annual reviews.
    Ms. Criswell. I was a traditional Guard member, I wouldn't 
have had----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Well, you would still have 
annual reviews, okay? Outstanding, meets standards, and does 
not meet standards. Would that be fair enough?
    Ms. Criswell. As I recall.
    Mr. Stauber. Okay. So, if you were in the Colorado National 
Guard, and you were in charge of disasters in Colorado, and the 
TAG said you are responsible, and there was a major disaster 
that the National Guard had to be brought out in Colorado, and 
it took 3 days for you to deploy and 5 days to even get into 
some neighborhoods, would the TAG say that is acceptable for 
you, as the leader of the management team, emergency management 
team?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, FEMA was on the ground before 
the disaster happened.
    Mr. Stauber. So, let me--we had two Members of Congress 
that represent 778,000 people, stood here or sat here just 
within the hour and said there were people that didn't even get 
responded to for 3 days, and some in a week. So, that 
contradicts what you just said, okay? I am asking you, if you 
were in Colorado, what would the TAG do to you if you didn't 
respond for 3 days to the citizens of Colorado in a disaster?
    Ms. Criswell. Well, Congressman----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. What would the--would he be 
upset with you, or would she or he be upset with you?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, our teams were on the ground 
before the disaster happens.
    Mr. Stauber. Ma'am, with all due respect, I am not asking--
--
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. Our search and rescue teams--
--
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Ma'am, I am not asking that 
question. I am not asking that question. I asked you, would the 
TAG be disappointed in you if it took you 3 days to help the 
citizens of Colorado or some neighborhood----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. I think the Adjutant General 
of Colorado----
    Mr. Stauber [continuing]. Would he be----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Would be impressed with the way 
FEMA responded to this disaster.
    Mr. Stauber. Ma'am, I am trying to help you here. I 
understand you have a tough job. I want you to be able to tell 
the American people that we could have done better. And as a 
traditional guardsman, I totally respect your service. And I 
expect honesty. And you should expect honesty from my 
questioning.
    I asked you, would the TAG be upset with you if you didn't 
send your people into a disaster in Colorado for 3 days--3 
days--and sometimes some neighborhoods didn't get it for 5, 
would the TAG be upset with you?
    Ms. Criswell. Well, that information is inaccurate, and I 
would hope he would look for accurate information.
    Mr. Stauber. Ma'am, do you--how would you score yourself in 
this response to Helene?
    Ms. Criswell. I think that there is always room----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Would you score yourself 
outstanding? Would you score yourself outstanding, meets 
standards, or does not meet standards?
    Ms. Criswell. I am incredibly proud of the work that the 
22,000 members of this workforce have done to support the 
American people----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. So, we had----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Across six States impacted by 
one of the most----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Administrator?
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Catastrophic events in recent 
years.
    Mr. Stauber. Administrator, we had two Members of Congress 
that would challenge you on that statement. The American 
citizens needed you at the time. They needed you, and they are 
still needing you. For 3 days. I mean, we had a major disaster 
in Minnesota. We had a Governor for 3 days that watched 
Minneapolis burn. That is unacceptable, simply unacceptable. 
And I would just hope that as we go forward--I don't want to 
politicize this. I mean, we--there is enough. But your 
response--you are the leader, the buck stops with you. From 
what--the testimony I heard here from the Representatives of 
the people, it was disappointing. Do you think you could have 
done better?
    Ms. Criswell. I encourage you, Congressman, to read my 
written testimony, which describes in detail how we were on the 
ground before the disaster happened.
    Mr. Stauber. Do you think----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. And I respect the testimony of 
the two panel Members earlier----
    Mr. Stauber [continuing]. Do you think you could have done 
better?
    Ms. Criswell. We can always improve, and we will review 
all----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Is that a yes?
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Of our response efforts.
    Mr. Stauber. Is that a yes?
    Ms. Criswell. Nobody is perfect, Congressman. We can always 
improve, and we strive to always improve on the----
    Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Do you think you could have 
done better, though? Yes?
    Ms. Criswell. We can always do better.
    Mr. Stauber. Okay. Listen, I want to thank you for your 
service. It is not easy. But when we come and ask you 
questions, we just expect--this is a dialogue. You represent 
us, the people. And if it happens in Minnesota, I would expect 
you to be there as quickly as I can. And I would say that from 
the statements of the two Representatives, both a Democrat and 
a Republican, you could have done much better in the response.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The gentleman yields. The gentleman from South 
Dakota, Representative Johnson, is recognized.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, under the heading of ways 
that we can all improve, I want to look at ways that the 
current legislative regime, I don't think, provides enough 
flexibility to States. I will tell you what I mean.
    So, now, when a President declares a Federal disaster, in 
those affected areas, Governors can have the flexibility to 
increase the weight limits on interstates. Makes sense, makes 
the delivery of recovery and disaster supplies a lot more 
efficient.
    I think we have heard two things from you today, 
Administrator, with your colloquies with some of my colleagues. 
Number one, as you said to Mr. Ezell, recovery is complicated 
and it can take a long time. We all know that is true. And 
number two, disaster supplies can get pulled in from a large 
geographic area.
    So, here, I think, are the weaknesses in the current 
legislative regime, and you will tell me where my assumptions 
are wrong. So, first off, recovery can take a long time. Right 
now when the President issues this disaster declaration, I 
think Governors are only given the flexibility to increase 
those weight limits for 120 days. Clearly, recovery can take a 
lot longer than that. Number two, disaster supplies get pulled 
from a large geographic area. If you are a Governor in a State 
where the disaster supplies originate--so, you are not in the 
area that has been impacted directly by the disaster, but you 
have got supplies that can help those folks a couple of States 
away--you don't have the flexibility to increase the weight 
limits on the interstates within your State.
    So, the MOVE Act, which is a bipartisan effort in this 
committee--Mr. Costa and myself--would provide flexibility in 
both those areas by moving the amount of time that Governors 
can have that flexibility from 120 days to 270 days; and then--
again, large impacted area--allows Governors to waive those 
weight limits if they are in an area where the supplies 
originate.
    So, Madam Administrator, the MOVE Act, does that sound like 
that would increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of 
disaster response?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I know that, as I have worked 
many disasters across the United States, we are often reaching 
out to the Department of Transportation to help waive some of 
the limitations to move supplies across. And so, I think 
anything that makes it easier to move resources in support of 
immediate response efforts would be welcomed.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Anything else you can think of 
in the transportation logistics supply chain space that would 
make it easier for us to get supplies to the people who need 
them?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I think the biggest thing that 
we have and the biggest resource we have is the Emergency 
Management Assistance Compact, which allows Governors to 
request resources from other States, which then, if a Federal 
disaster declaration is declared, those costs are all 
reimbursed through the disaster declaration. Those types of 
resources and tools to be able to share resources across States 
are the things that actually make a big difference in the speed 
and the delivery of Governors being able to support their 
communities that were impacted.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Yes, I do think those aspects, 
as well as passage of the MOVE Act, would help with recovery 
efforts.
    We have talked a little bit about this terrible employee, 
this crew leader that you had, ma'am. Obviously, you have 
weathered a lot of questions about that. I think you have been 
upfront that this was a bad employee who was terminated from 
her job. Is there a culture problem within FEMA? I mean, is 
this a one-off, or are there other employees who would, as Mr. 
Stauber said, would be interested in weaponizing Government 
against citizens?
    Ms. Criswell. The actions of this employee are 
unacceptable, and it is not indicative of the culture of FEMA, 
and I do not believe that there is a widespread cultural 
problem. I have directed ongoing investigations, working with 
the IG, working with the Office of the Special Counsel. And if 
we find any other acts of similar behavior, we will take 
appropriate disciplinary measures.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, what should Congress, what 
should this committee look for? I mean, we want to take you at 
your word. We want to believe that we don't have a culture 
problem within FEMA. What should we be looking for over the 
course of the next 3 months to validate your assertions?
    Ms. Criswell. I think that you should look at the results 
that we come out with from ongoing investigations and the 
amount of assistance that we continue to provide in communities 
and the support during their recovery process. We will be with 
them throughout their recovery, helping them rebuild, and 
rebuild in a way that is going to make them more resilient 
against future disasters.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Would an investigation from an 
inspector general or an ombudsman or some other third party 
help increase the confidence of this committee that your 
assertions are accurate?
    Ms. Criswell. We are currently in conversations with the 
IG, and I would welcome an inspection from the IG. And as I 
stated to Chairman Perry earlier, I will personally request 
that investigation from the IG.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Very good. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes Representative Webster from Florida.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This 
question is on behalf of Lake County, one of the four counties 
I represent in Florida.
    It is critical for communities to know what is and what is 
not eligible for FEMA reimbursement so they can plan, they can 
plan accordingly for a natural disaster. Counties may have in 
place, sort of, a debris removal contract in advance of the 
disaster so the debris removal can move quickly and follow up 
from the storm. However, depending on the circumstances, actual 
cost may exceed the contract. Unfortunately, my office has not 
been able to get a clear answer from FEMA on whether or not the 
increase is reimbursable.
    And I just ask the Administrator, are those costs 
reimbursable, or are the communities only reimbursed at the 
amount that they had in a pre-existing contract?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I would need to understand the 
specifics of what they are asking for, and I am happy to follow 
up with you and your team on that case to see what is eligible 
and not eligible.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. I think what they are asking is, 
okay, there is this contract, they have it, and they perform 
that, although the contract was exceeded. And so, by exceeding 
it, do they only get what they had a contract for reimbursed, 
or can the excess also be reimbursed?
    Ms. Criswell. On the basis of what you are saying, that 
doesn't sound like a reasonable approach from FEMA. We would be 
reimbursing all eligible costs. I mean, if they had to incur 
additional costs beyond their contract, that should, from what 
you are saying, fall under the eligible circumstances. But I 
would again have to see that specific case.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from New York, Representative 
D'Esposito.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good 
morning, Administrator. How are you?
    First, I want to start off with, I am sure, as you have 
heard time and time again from colleagues on this committee, it 
is absolutely reprehensible to withhold aid and support based 
on political affiliation. As you know, in addition to being on 
this committee, I serve as the subcommittee chairman of the 
House Homeland Security Committee's Emergency Management and 
Technology Subcommittee that is also looking into this matter.
    Additionally, I was the chief of the Island Park Fire 
Department when Hurricane Sandy brought destruction and 
devastation to Long Island. And I will tell you that no 
political affiliation, no campaign sign, nothing would have 
prevented me and those who served under me from helping our 
neighbors. So, I am sure you can understand why reports of FEMA 
employees skipping homes based on political affiliation and 
support of President-elect Donald Trump is both shocking and 
absolutely disturbing.
    First off, what has FEMA done or planning to do to ensure 
the homes that were passed over because of President Trump's 
signs are made whole?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I appreciate your ongoing 
support of FEMA, and I share your concerns over the actions of 
this employee. We have, first, terminated that employee to 
ensure that we can continue to do the good work to support the 
American people. We have also sent in an additional team to go 
to those 20 homes that we have identified as having been 
skipped over to ensure that they have had an opportunity to 
register for assistance. And we have provided refresher 
training to all of our staff in the field to remind them about 
the importance of serving all people, meeting them where they 
are, and ensuring that anyone who has been impacted has an 
opportunity to apply for assistance.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Okay. So, the employee at the center of 
this who, as you said, was terminated, which--I appreciate 
that, and I think that that was the correct course of action--
but she claims that her instructions were part of an 
``institutional FEMA policy of avoiding potentially hostile 
homes.'`
    So, I think you briefly touched on it, but what are your 
plans to change or clarify this, what could be a very bogus 
policy, but nonetheless one that people in FEMA feel that 
exists, to make sure that it never happens again?
    Ms. Criswell. There is nowhere in any FEMA policy, any 
training material or information that would direct any of our 
staff to avoid a home because of a political sign in their 
yard. We do provide training to our staff about aggressive 
behavior, and how they can make sure that they can feel safe. 
And as we have conducted this refresher training, we have 
reminded them that this is reactive behavior when somebody is 
approaching you, not proactive, to discriminate against 
somebody.
    Mr. D'Esposito. All right, thank you. Now, I am going to 
bring it a little closer to home.
    So, earlier this year on Long Island there was a 1-in-
1,000-year rain event which produced nearly 10 inches of rain, 
leading to widespread flash flooding that caused road closures, 
travel disruptions, and significant damage to public and 
private property. Following the rain event, New York State 
applied for both Public and Individual Assistance from FEMA. 
The State was successful in receiving a declaration for Public 
Assistance. However, Individual Assistance was just denied last 
week. And I know that this is an issue both my colleagues from 
Long Island, Mr. LaLota and Mr. Garbarino, are working on.
    But FEMA's Public Assistance Program has defined the 
threshold of $37.5 million in damages for eligibility to New 
York State. However, according to the Division of Homeland 
Security and Emergency Services in New York State, determining 
eligibility for Individual Assistance is more complex and 
cannot be assessed as straightforwardly as the Public 
Assistance threshold.
    So, first, is there a comparable threshold or specific 
dollar amount for uninsured damages that must be met for a 
disaster to qualify for Individual Assistance?
    Ms. Criswell. Our Individual Assistance Program does not 
use a very clear cut guideline like that, because we understand 
that the community impact could also be a consideration. And if 
a community has had such significant trauma to it, we wouldn't 
want an arbitrary line, an arbitrary number to prevent them 
from getting assistance. So, we have flexibility within our 
authorities to understand the impact of a community, but also 
what the availability and the capacity is of the State or the 
local jurisdiction to support them.
    Mr. D'Esposito. So, we are going to be talking about this 
in the Homeland Subcommittee. But if you wouldn't mind, if you 
could have you and your staff, if you would be willing to 
provide more detailed information on how those thresholds for 
Individual Assistance are determined. I understand that it is 
sort of a cloudy area, but that would be able to help us on 
Long Island assist our neighbors and give them concrete answers 
as to what they are dealing with.
    I know that, again, Mr. LaLota and Mr. Garbarino are both 
dealing with a lot of phone calls, a lot of concerns, people 
that really don't know where to turn to next. And as we know, 
these storms were devastating, unexpected, which sometimes 
makes them even more devastating, and we just want to give them 
answers. So, if you could provide a little bit further detailed 
information, we would all appreciate it.
    Mr. Chairman----
    Ms. Criswell [interposing]. I would be happy to do that.
    Mr. D'Esposito [continuing]. I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The chairman thanks the gentleman. The Chair now 
recognizes Representative Yakym.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you for being here, Administrator Criswell. The 
hard-working men and women at FEMA have an important role to 
play in our communities, helping lift up their fellow Americans 
when they have been knocked down by a disaster. But recent 
months have exposed a capabilities gap and a trust gap, and 
that trust gap is no act of God. And I want to better 
understand this recent scandal in which houses in Florida were 
skipped by FEMA canvassers because of Trump signs in their 
front yard.
    You have referenced an investigation that is currently 
underway. There have been concerns expressed that FEMA is 
deleting emails related to the employee's assertion that it was 
a directive from her supervisors to skip homes displaying signs 
supporting President Trump. Ms. Criswell, can you commit to us 
today that all FEMA records, including Teams messages, emails, 
and text messages, have been and will be preserved for this 
investigation?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, all of our records are 
preserved, and I can commit to you that any requests that you 
make we will make sure to send them to you.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you. You have been fairly consistent and 
insistent that this was one employee who acted alone. But are 
you able to guarantee that no one at FEMA headquarters gave 
verbal or written guidance in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and 
Milton that recommended skipping or that otherwise warned 
canvassers about interacting with houses with Trump signs in 
their lawn?
    Ms. Criswell. We are continuing to investigate the 
circumstances surrounding this, but I have been presented with 
no evidence at this point that there was anything beyond this 
one person's direction.
    Mr. Yakym. And what steps will you take as--it sounds like 
you cannot at this point guarantee that that is not taking 
place. What steps are you taking at FEMA headquarters to ensure 
and guarantee us that no guidance was given from headquarters 
to skip over houses that have Trump signs in the front yard?
    Ms. Criswell. Again, we want to make sure that all people 
impacted by these disasters have the assistance that they are 
eligible for and that they deserve. We are continuing to 
conduct an investigation. Our Office of Professional 
Responsibility is currently working alongside the Office of the 
Inspector General, and we expect them to fully investigate the 
circumstances around this to ensure that this was only a single 
incident.
    Mr. Yakym. And the employee at the center of this scandal 
hinted that a policy to skip houses with Trump signs may have 
also been in place in North Carolina, as well. Are you able to 
guarantee that there was not a similar policy in North 
Carolina?
    Ms. Criswell. Again, I have seen no evidence that shows 
that this was anything beyond this one person's specific 
instructions to her team.
    Mr. Yakym. The number-one goal under FEMA's strategic plan 
for 2022 through 2026 is what? What is the number-one goal 
under your strategic plan?
    Ms. Criswell. Equity as a foundation of emergency 
management.
    Mr. Yakym. And for reference, what was the number-one goal 
under the 2018 through 2022 strategic plan?
    Ms. Criswell. I do not know. That was before my time.
    Mr. Yakym. To build a culture of preparedness. Does 
skipping houses with Trump signs advance equity, which is your 
number-one strategic plan goal?
    Ms. Criswell. Equity, as we look at it, is to make sure 
that we are reducing barriers for anybody that has a need to 
access our programs. And so, we are ensuring that we are taking 
down barriers so all people impacted by disasters have access 
to the programs that they need and that they are eligible for.
    Mr. Yakym. And equity, according to FEMA's own guidance in 
the Executive order signed by President Biden--Executive Order 
No. 13985 defines equity as ``The consistent and systematic 
fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals.'` Do 
you believe that the individuals with Trump signs in their 
front yard were treated fairly and impartially?
    Ms. Criswell. They were not, which is why we terminated 
her.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you, and I would like to yield the balance 
of my time to the chairman, Mr. Perry.
    Mr. Perry. Well, the Chair thanks the gentleman.
    Administrator, you are in support of the supplemental 
request, you are in support of that, right? And you would kind 
of agree with the assertion that you don't have the staffing 
necessary to complete your mission in one form or another?
    Ms. Criswell. That I don't have the staffing?
    Mr. Perry. Staffing, you don't have personnel.
    Ms. Criswell. I have the staffing and personnel to complete 
our mission.
    Mr. Perry. You do?
    Ms. Criswell. I need funding to continue to support 
reimbursing----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. You need the funding. Okay. So, 
let me ask you this.
    You figure out your strategic plan, and it seems to me that 
your strategic plan bumped your core mission of helping people 
before, during, and after disasters. Can you explain? I mean, 
you sent, I think, is it two people to Azerbaijan? I don't know 
how far Azerbaijan is, but your organization sent, as I 
understand--is it more than two people or just two people to 
the--as it is stated, the Solidarity for a Green World 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change--COP, probably, 24 or 25, or 
whatever the heck it is. Two people? How many?
    Ms. Criswell. COP29, I believe we sent two people.
    Mr. Perry. Two people? Who approves that?
    Ms. Criswell. I do.
    Mr. Perry. You approve that? So, can you provide the 
committee the details on how much that cost, how much their 
stay was, and how that--look, people here talk about 
disinformation. One of the biggest portions of disinformation 
that I consistently see is that disasters are more frequent, 
they are more devastating. Simply, the data doesn't support any 
of that and it is all--and allegedly, that is all caused by us, 
and no data supports that either, yet those assertions are 
made.
    And one of those assertions is, of course, about climate 
change itself. And of course, you are sending your staff, which 
apparently you have enough of, but you don't have enough money, 
but you are paying--so, we would like to know how much all that 
cost to send them to Azerbaijan.
    With that, the Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New 
Jersey, Representative Van Drew.
    Dr. Van Drew. Chairman, thank you.
    Administrator, you seem like a really nice person, and you 
have a very nice personality, and you seem calm and gentle. So, 
I am going to apologize in advance, because I am angry, and I 
am tired of it. I don't only sit on Transportation, I sit on 
Judiciary. And I have been at hearings for hours where we were 
told that there wasn't any plan to go into Roman Catholic 
Churches--and I am digressing, I realize that--and yet we found 
out there was, and they had to apologize. We were told that 
nobody was going to school board meetings because people were 
reflecting their individual opinions. And again, over time, we 
dug in and found out there was. There is a culture in America 
that this issue represents and symbolizes. And I am a plain 
speaker, I am a plain talker, and I am very direct. So, I am 
going to ask you some things.
    I know you have talked about it, but the reason we keep 
going back to it, Administrator, it is a really big deal. It is 
the First Amendment that people have the right to express their 
viewpoint, their feelings, who they want to vote for, what they 
believe, whether they are liberal or conservative, Republican 
or Democrat, Trump or Harris. Who cares? Because guess what? 
The folks on the other side of the aisle should know if it 
happened to us, it could happen to them. That is the reality.
    And I believe that FEMA has blatantly neglected its core 
mission of providing emergency support to all Americans without 
prejudice or bias. And I also believe this doesn't happen in a 
vacuum. And I understand the person who has been fired, she 
swears that this came from above her. So, the first question I 
am going to ask you, that this was part of the administration: 
Is she a liar?
    Ms. Criswell. Her allegations, I have not seen any evidence 
that this is beyond her specific direction. But we are 
conducting additional investigations to ensure that this is an 
isolated incident----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. So, the truth is we----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. and that we will take 
disciplinary action if there was more than her----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. The truth is we don't know 
yet. It is the culture. It is the culture of what is going on.
    And part of what they said, this individual, they called 
Trump supporters--and I know you got the--I know your answer is 
going to be ``no'' to this--as ``vicious dogs.'` I want to just 
say how deep and mean this was. Do you believe that Trump's 
supporters are vicious dogs?
    Ms. Criswell. That was a comment that was not made by me, 
and I do not believe in that comment, no.
    Dr. Van Drew. Okay, I am sure you don't.
    Do political affiliations with the Republican Party make 
someone inherently dangerous because they happen to be a 
Republican? Yes or no?
    Ms. Criswell. That is not in alignment with our core 
mission and our values of integrity, compassion, fairness, and 
respect.
    Dr. Van Drew. And I agree, and I understand that. But think 
about this. People, when they are their most vulnerable, most 
in need, most scared, most worried, in the most trouble 
probably in their entire lives, hard-working men and women of 
America looking to a Federal agency to protect them, to help 
them, to take care of them, and they got literally a knife in 
the heart, I mean, that is what this really represented. Those 
people, how do they feel? They break their back, paying the 
taxes that keep us all going here. So, when we finally are 
supposed to do a job, this is what happens. How heartbreaking 
is that?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, this was unacceptable, and it is 
heartbreaking.
    Dr. Van Drew. I know, and I----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. I have pushed for 3\1/2\ years 
to put people first----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. And you know what?
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. In everything that we do.
    Dr. Van Drew. And that is what kind of--and again, forgive 
me, I am going to editorialize for a minute. We speak of 
equity, which is different than equality, and it has become a 
political symbol to some degree, whether folks want to admit it 
or not. We are worried about pronouns. We are worried about 
illegals. We are worried about everything, and I get it. But 
how about just worrying about the average man and woman who is 
working, who lives in America, who is legal, who pays their 
taxes, who obeys the laws, and finally, finally needs help?
    Because most of these people never need help. They don't 
want anything. They get their Social Security when they retire, 
and that is about it. Just think how they feel. And I am 
concerned, and I have to tell you I have personally asked Joe 
Cuffari, who is the inspector general in Homeland Security, 
personally asked him, sent him a letter--he is a good man, he 
is an honest broker--to look into this and really dissect this 
and see what is going on.
    I think we are going to find it is more than one person. 
That culture allowed this one person to think it was okay. That 
culture that we have had, whether it is in the Department of 
Justice, in my--or whether it is here in Homeland Security or 
other areas, that culture has allowed this to take place. That 
culture is wrong, and it denies the most fundamental values of 
Americanism.
    Somebody said to me humorously, hey--this wasn't humorous--
President Trump had a really good result in the State of New 
Jersey. It didn't quite make it, but it is usually a very, very 
blue State. It is the State I am from, New Jersey. Because we 
are having wildfires right now, as you probably know, people 
wonder: Are we going to be punished because it was so 
supportive of President Trump?
    I would hope not, because, to be honest with you, I do my 
job--I was a dentist in my other life, and your job is kind of 
like that. We have to take care of people not in the political 
end, but in the governmental end, regardless of who they are, 
what they believe, what they feel, what they have said. That is 
our responsibility and job. This is so unbelievably, 
fundamentally wrong. And I am not showboating here as a 
politician. I swear to God, this really bothers me. It really 
bothers Americans. It is a grievous mistake. It is awful that 
it happened, and it has to be fixed.
    I wanted to see if there are any other questions. Hold on 
for a second.
    Mr. Perry. The gentleman's time----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. I completely----
    Mr. Perry [continuing]. The gentleman's time----
    Dr. Van Drew. Oh, my time is up. Well, there are no more 
questions, right, Chairman?
    Chairman, thank you for making me aware of that. I yield 
back.
    Mr. Perry. The gentleman yields. He might seek time from 
the next Representative if he has any left, the next 
Representative, Representative Bean from Florida, is 
recognized.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. A 
very good morning to you. Good morning, T&I Committee, and good 
morning, Administrator. Welcome.
    Let's cut through the disinformation that has been talked 
about. So, let's play a game called true or false. I will say a 
statement. You say true or false, Madam Administrator.
    After Helene, it was widely reported that a FEMA supervisor 
told aid workers to avoid homes advertising Trump. Is that true 
or false?
    Ms. Criswell. A single employee directed her team to not go 
to homes with Trump signs.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. I am going to put you down for a true, 
then. Is that correct? True?
    Ms. Criswell. A single employee.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. I am putting you down for a true.
    FEMA--here is the next one--FEMA is supposed to be 
nonpartisan. FEMA is supposed to be like the police or fire 
department. When they come, they are going to deliver aid. They 
don't care about your race, political affiliations, or 
anything. They are supposed to just get the job done. Is that 
true or false, Madam Administrator?
    Ms. Criswell. True. FEMA is a nonpartisan agency.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Another true. Putting you down for a 
true.
    According to an email to committee staff, that person 
responsible was fired from FEMA. Is that true or false, Madam 
Administrator?
    Ms. Criswell. That individual was terminated at my 
direction.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. I am going to put you down as a true. 
How do you know, though, it is only one person? How do we know?
    Ms. Criswell. This is why I have ongoing investigations, 
and we will be working with the IG to establish that it was 
just a single incident.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. You are working with the IG. That is 
fantastic.
    The Daily Wire has obtained screenshots of multiple entries 
in the system that said, ``Trump sign, no contact per 
leadership.'' So, that could be evidence. At least it is a 
trail to begin your investigation. Would you say that is true? 
That is a good lead. Is that a good lead?
    Ms. Criswell. Those were the staff that the individual in 
question directed not to go to Trump homes.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. I am going to put you down for another 
true.
    So, here is the question: Do you understand why Americans 
lack confidence in FEMA leadership? You understand that.
    Ms. Criswell. Trust is the most important thing that we can 
have in Government.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Again, you would say yes?
    Ms. Criswell. And to have one individual----
    Mr. Bean of Florida [interrupting]. Can I put you down as a 
yes, that you do understand why so many people are upset?
    Ms. Criswell. It is unacceptable why this one person made 
this direction----
    Mr. Bean of Florida [interrupting]. I am going to put you 
down for a yes.
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. And I can understand why they 
are upset.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Yes is so much easier to say. Yes, I 
understand it. You understand why people are mad. I am not 
trying--it is not a gotcha question.
    Ms. Criswell. No, I said that.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. I am just saying----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. I said yes----
    Mr. Bean of Florida [continuing]. You understand.
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. I understand why the actions of 
this one individual can be so hurtful.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Very good. And I want to--I am going 
to congratulate you on saying we might need some help from the 
inspector general, because Americans just need trust in their 
fire department, their police department, and in FEMA.
    So, what is the plan to restore Americans' trust in FEMA? 
What is the plan?
    Ms. Criswell. We are going to continue with our absolutely 
committed 22,000-plus employees to assist in the recovery 
efforts across these disasters, and the over 100 other open 
disasters across the United States, helping them rebuild and 
restore their lives to get back to some sense of normalcy.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you, Administrator.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The gentleman yields. Are there further 
questions from any members of the subcommittee who have not yet 
been recognized?
    Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would 
like to--and I am going to--thank each of the witnesses.
    Administrator, it has been tough, but we do appreciate you 
being here. I know it is not always fun or pleasant, but we are 
very appreciative that you took the time to come and hear our 
questions and provide your answers.
    So, with that, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]


                       Submissions for the Record

                              ----------

    Management Agency, from Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, Committee on 
    Transportation and Infrastructure; Hon. Scott Perry, Chairman, 
 Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency 
    Management, et al., Submitted for the Record by Hon. Scott Perry

The Honorable Deanne Criswell,
Administrator,
Federal Emergency Management Agency, United States Department of 
        Homeland Security, 500 C St. SW, Washington, DC 20472.
    Dear Administrator Criswell:
    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Committee) is 
aware of disturbing news reports detailing how a Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) employee tasked with leading recovery efforts 
in and around Lake Placid, Florida, directed FEMA workers to avoid 
homes with Trump campaign signs.\1\ These reports have surfaced while 
thousands of Americans continue to deal with the devastation and loss 
inflicted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. As the FEMA Administrator, 
you are responsible for leading the Nation's efforts to prepare for, 
protect against, and respond to natural disasters.\2\ The Committee is 
troubled that under your leadership FEMA failed to aid all Americans, 
regardless of party affiliation.

    In reporting that first emerged from The Daily Wire, it was 
revealed that a FEMA supervisor sent a best practices message to FEMA 
workers canvassing the Florida area impacted by Hurricane Milton, which 
instructed the workers to ``avoid homes advertising Trump.'' \3\ As a 
result, FEMA workers passed over homes with Trump campaign signs or 
flags, and reported that approximately 20 homes were skipped from the 
end of October and into November.\4\ In a system used by FEMA to track 
which homes were contacted, FEMA worker entries show that homes were 
skipped as a direct result of the guidance issued by FEMA 
leadership.\5\ Screenshots obtained by The Daily Wire show entries in 
the system which state ``Trump sign, no contact per leadership.'' \6\

    You issued an official statement on November 9, 2024, asserting 
that the actions of the FEMA supervisor were a ``clear violation of 
FEMA's core value and principles'' \7\ and that the employee had been 
terminated and the matter referred to the Office of Special Counsel.\8\ 
Yet, under the Biden Administration, FEMA's number one strategic goal, 
per its Strategic Plan, is focused on equity, while preparedness and 
readiness were relegated to FEMA's third goal, after climate change.\9\ 
In fact, the FEMA employee disputes the notion that her actions were 
out of line with direction from FEMA leadership and that as of November 
11, 2024, she had not received anything in writing with respect to her 
termination.\10\ She further asserts a trend of avoidance by FEMA, not 
just in Florida but also in the Carolinas.\11\

    Your inability to ensure that FEMA provide relief to all Americans 
affected by disasters, free of discrimination, represents a substantial 
failure of leadership. The blatant disregard of President-elect Trump 
supporters directly contradicts FEMA's core mission and values. This 
reporting follows previous media coverage, which found that residents 
in North Carolina felt they had been left to fend for themselves, and 
FEMA was too slow in providing relief, compounding the Committee's 
concerns related to FEMA's capacity to aid disaster victims.\12\ It is 
clear that, under the Biden-Harris Administration, FEMA has been ill-
prepared to provide assistance and relief to many Americans in need.

    The Committee is continuing its oversight of FEMA's ability to 
adequately respond to natural disasters. In order to assist the 
Committee with its investigation, please provide a briefing to 
Committee staff by December 2, 2024. At the briefing FEMA should be 
prepared to discuss concerns related to the agency's failure to aid 
Americans regardless of party affiliation, including the steps FEMA has 
taken to assist unaided families, policies implemented to prevent 
future political discrimination, and the prevalence at which the agency 
fell derelict in its duty to assist victims. In addition, please 
provide the requested documents and information, as soon as possible, 
but no later than 5:00 p.m. ET on December 2, 2024:
    1.  Please provide all documents and communications sufficient to 
show when FEMA leadership became aware of the discriminatory guidance 
given to FEMA workers in Florida.
    2.  Please provide all documents and communications, if any, 
related to FEMA's efforts to contact and provide assistance to the 
Florida residences skipped as a result of the discriminatory guidance.
    3.  Please provide all documents and communications, if any, 
related to FEMA's effort to notify state and local officials of the 
discriminatory guidance.
    4.  Please provide all documents and communications, if any, 
related to FEMA's efforts to notify the skipped residences of Federal 
grants and assistance that may be available.
    5.  Please provide all documents and communications related to any 
actions taken to investigate whether homes in other communities and 
states were similarly impacted.
    6.  Please provide copies of any guidance documents and policies 
for field workers on canvassing in response to Hurricanes Helene and 
Milton.

    Pursuant to House Rule X, clause 1(r), the Committee has 
jurisdiction over these issues and shall conduct appropriate oversight 
of these actions. This request and any documents created as a result of 
this request will be deemed Congressional documents of the Committee.

    Dear Administrator Criswell:
    On September 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall on the 
Florida Gulf Coast and progressed up the East Coast as a Category 4 
storm that devastated states and local communities in its path. To 
date, at least 227 Americans have lost their lives to Hurricane Helene 
as people continue to search for missing loved ones and local officials 
rebuild their towns and neighborhoods.\1\ Less than two weeks later, on 
October 9, 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall along the west coast of 
Florida.\2\

    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is charged with 
leading the Nation's efforts to prepare for, protect against, respond 
to, recover from, and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters, 
acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters.\3\ The Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure (Committee) is aware of troubling 
media reports of how FEMA, under your leadership, has failed to rise to 
the challenge and adequately respond to Hurricane Helene. Therefore, 
the Committee seeks to understand FEMA's preparation and strategies for 
response, as well as its capacity to provide relief for disaster 
victims.

    On October 2, 2024, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary 
Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters that FEMA lacked sufficient funding 
to make it through the current hurricane season as the agency works to 
support communities devastated by Hurricane Helene.\4\ Secretary 
Mayorkas's comments were made just weeks after Congress passed 
legislation that provided $20 billion to the agency for disaster relief 
spending.\5\

    In July 2022, concerns were raised with the use of FEMA's Emergency 
Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) to support the crisis at the Southern 
Border.\6\ Because of insufficient responses, another letter was sent 
on January 23, 2023, more broadly requesting information on FEMA's role 
in the crisis at the border and requesting documents related to FEMA's 
activities related to the border.\7\ In response, FEMA indicated that 
FEMA personnel, including a Regional Administrator, had been reassigned 
for a period of time to assist at the border.\8\ While FEMA has 
maintained that these diversions of resources were small in number, 
given FEMA's overall staffing shortage of approximately 6,200 
personnel, any diversion of FEMA resources is concerning.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the most troubling media reports has been from residents in 
North Carolina who have voiced complaints with the Federal response to 
Hurricane Helene, and in particular criticized FEMA's reaction pace to 
the storm.\10\ The New York Times reported that individuals in rural 
areas of North Carolina affected by the storm are skeptical of FEMA's 
ability to provide assistance and feel that they have been left to fend 
for themselves.\11\ The Committee remains concerned by reports 
detailing FEMA's slow response and ability to provide aid to victims, 
as well as FEMA's interactions with non-Federal efforts to assist 
Americans in need.

    In response to negative news coverage surrounding FEMA's response 
to Hurricane Helene, FEMA created a ``Rumor Control'' page specific to 
Hurricane Helene. Unfortunately, the information on that page, as well 
as FEMA social media postings, do little to provide disaster victims 
the help they need. For example, FEMA clarifies that $750 is not the 
only assistance survivors may receive. However, the agency ignores the 
challenge survivors face with online applications, that survivors who 
have successfully applied have raised concerns about denials of aid, 
and the reality that $750 in this economy with high inflation is not 
enough to cover the items FEMA claims the assistance can be used for--
``food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and 
other supplies.'' \12\ The Committee is committed to ensuring that 
FEMA's emphasis on messaging has not detracted from efforts to provide 
aid to victims.

Response, available at https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since Hurricane Helene, officials from the National Security 
Council (NSC) have participated in, and appeared to lead, some of the 
Congressional briefings on the response. The NSC has no statutory 
authority with respect to managing disasters, and its capabilities and 
expertise in emergency management is questionable and unclear. Under 
the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), you 
are the Principal Advisor to the President during a disaster.\13\ In 
light of the questions surrounding the Federal Government's response, 
the Committee seeks clarification about NSC's role in the response and 
information to determine whether NSC created additional bureaucratic 
hurdles to providing relief.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ 6 U.S.C. Sec.  313.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We are seeking clarity as to the actions FEMA has taken in our 
efforts to assess FEMA's preparedness and response to Hurricanes Helene 
and Milton. In order to assist the Committee with its investigation, 
please provide the requested documents and information by October 25, 
2024:
    1.  Please provide specific details regarding the NSC's involvement 
in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
      a.  Has this involvement been the same as in previous disasters? 
Please explain.
      b.  What is the role of the NSC in managing disasters? Where does 
the NSC derive its statutory authority to support this role?
      c.  Is FEMA providing direct advice to the President on disaster 
response as required by law? Please describe the frequency and method 
of communications with the President on disaster advice.
      d.  Have you been advised to report to anyone other than the 
President in relation to the recent disasters? If so, to whom have you 
been instructed to report, and who gave that instruction?

    2.  Earlier this year, FEMA made significant changes to the 
Individual Assistance (IA) Program. These changes included implementing 
a Serious Needs Assistance program, which would provide individuals 
with cash payments of $750.
      a.  Does FEMA characterize the implementation of the Serious 
Needs Assistance program as a success? Please explain.
      b.  Has there been any discussion about adjusting the amount of 
assistance provided to victims? If so, please describe.
      c.  There are reports that this assistance is not provided 
immediately and that some victims have even been denied.
        i.  What is the average period of time from application to the 
time the $750 would be received by the applicant?
        ii.  What are the eligibility requirements for FEMA's IA 
Program, and how are they communicated to disaster victims?
        iii.  On what basis are people denied, and what does the appeal 
process entail?
        iv.  Does FEMA's notification of denial provide clear 
information about the appeals process?
        v.  How does FEMA ensure that victims without cellphone service 
or access to internet are able to apply for assistance? Can individuals 
apply outside of congregate housing shelters by working directly with 
FEMA officials?

    3.  Please provide details of the number, locations, and functions 
of FEMA personnel deployed for Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton.
      a.  Does FEMA still have a staffing gap? If so, please detail the 
staffing gap.
      b.  What percentage of FEMA's disaster personnel were called up 
for each Hurricane?
      c.  What percentage of FEMA disaster personnel was unavailable 
for each Hurricane?
      d.  Did FEMA have any challenges with deployments due to 
unavailable FEMA disaster personnel? Please explain.

    4.  Please provide details of shelters, distribution centers, and 
other resources for disaster victims, including locations and number of 
people served.
      a.  Has FEMA been involved in efforts to redirect supplies, 
donations, and volunteer activities? Has FEMA's involvement included 
confiscating or refusing supplies or services?
      b.  Does every FEMA operated facility have adequate signage and 
staffing from FEMA?

    5.  How has the Shelter and Services Program (SSP) impacted FEMA's 
ability to respond to Hurricanes Helene and Milton?
      a.  Please provide a detailed breakdown of the resources that 
FEMA has allocated for SSP, including staffing and funding.
      b.  Within the last six months, have any FEMA resources or 
personnel been diverted or reassigned to assist at the Southern Border 
or on migrant issues, generally? If so, please provide details.

    6.  On October 3, 2024, FEMA began publishing a ``Hurricane Helene: 
Rumor Response'' resource on its website. Please provide all documents 
and communications relating to FEMA's decision to establish the 
``Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response'' webpage.
      a.  The webpage clarifies that $750 is not the only assistance an 
individual may be eligible to receive, yet ignores complaints about 
denials and whether the assistance is enough to cover basic needs. How 
does FEMA determine which ``rumors'' are included on the website and 
what questions the agency will respond to?
      b.  How does FEMA determine what is a ``rumor'' or 
``misinformation''?
      c.  Did any Biden-Harris Administration official, outside of 
FEMA, direct the agency to establish its ``Hurricane Helene: Rumor 
Response'' webpage?
      d.  Has FEMA previously published an agency webpage to counter 
``misinformation'' in the aftermath of a significant storm or natural 
disaster?

    7.  Please provide a detailed timeline and summary of the Federal 
response to Hurricane Helene, beginning from pre-positioning prior to 
the disaster to the present. Please include details on which Federal 
agencies and departments were activated, what assets and resources were 
deployed and where, and which Emergency Support Functions were 
activated.

    8.  On September 30, 2024, President Biden signed a Continuing 
Resolution into law which provided $20 billion in funds to the Disaster 
Relief Fund (DRF), bringing an end to FEMA's Immediate Needs Funding 
status. Days later, DHS Secretary Mayorkas stated that FEMA did not 
have sufficient funds to last through the Hurricane Season.
      a.  What is the basis for the Secretary's statement? When does 
FEMA estimate returning to INF status?
      b.  What funding level did FEMA indicate to the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees would be sufficient?
      c.  Please provide a detailed accounting of FEMA's project 
approvals since the last appropriation to the DRF. Specifically, 
include details showing the rate of project approvals leading up to and 
during INF.
      d.  Please describe the amounts FEMA estimates obligating in 
response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

  Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. 
                              Scott Perry

    Question 1. Administrator Criswell, on November 14, 2024, the 
Committee's Republican Members sent a letter to you about the recent 
allegations that FEMA workers skipped the homes of supporters of 
President-elect Trump. Following the allegations, you issued a 
statement that ``one'' FEMA employee ``departed from'' FEMA's values 
and was terminated.\1\ You reiterated this at the hearing. These 
statements directly conflict with the assertions of Ms. Washington who 
claims that these directives already existed when she arrived for 
deployment. The Committee has received information from sources, 
unrelated to Ms. Washington, that substantiates her assertion that this 
may have been commonplace across multiple states and multiple FEMA 
personnel.

Employee Misconduct (Nov. 9, 2024), available at https://www.fema.gov/

employee-misconduct
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question 1.a. Please describe in detail the investigation that FEMA 
conducted prior to terminating Ms. Washington's employment that 
concluded that she was the source of this directive.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.b. Has there been any investigation into who released 
Ms. Washington's name and contact information to the public, and 
information around her message about the Trump signs, and whether such 
a leak violates the Privacy Act or any other laws related to Personal 
Identifiable Information (PII)?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.c. You mentioned at the hearing that FEMA is still 
investigating whether or not the practice of skipping homes with Trump 
signs was isolated to this one FEMA employee.
    Question 1.c.i. Please provide information on who, within the 
agency, is specifically conducting this investigation, including their 
title and position.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.c.ii. Please provide a timeline for when this 
investigation will be concluded.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.c.iii. Is the investigation solely focused on the 
activities in Florida, or is it investigating allegations that similar 
actions occurred in other states? Please explain.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.d. There have been allegations that records related to 
this issue may have been deleted. During the hearing, you mentioned 
that there would be a record of deletions, if any happened.
    Question 1.d.i. Please detail what steps FEMA has taken to 
determine whether any records have been deleted and provide the results 
on that analysis.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.e. Please describe FEMA's official policy and procedures 
for workers canvassing following a disaster on how they are to handle 
what they perceive as a ``hostile'' encounter or if they feel unsafe.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.e.i. Please describe the training provided to FEMA 
workers on how to handle any discomfort in the field and what is or is 
not appropriate.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.f. Please provide details of the team(s), with whom Ms. 
Washington was deployed in Florida, including who was her supervisor, 
who else was working with her, a breakdown of whether they were full 
time FEMA employees, FEMA Reservists, surge capacity workers, and the 
areas they were to cover.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.f.i. To the extent that surge capacity workers were 
involved, were these workers Federal employees or managed through a 
contractor?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.f.ii. If managed through a contractor, please indicate 
the name, describe the role of the contractor, and provide details of 
what training occurred with the contract workers.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.f.iii. During the hearing, you offered to provide an 
organizational chart that would describe the chain of command that Ms. 
Washington served under. Please provide that organizational chart.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 2. Administrator Criswell, your written testimony states 
that FEMA's mission is helping people before, during, and after 
disasters. However, your Strategic Plan bumped that core mission below 
the missions of equity and climate change. While communities across 
this Nation are recovering from devastating hurricanes, wildfires, 
floods and other disasters, we've learned that instead of focusing on 
efforts to rebuild, your resiliency office leadership have been in 
Azerbaijan for the ``In Solidarity for a Green World Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.''
    Question 2.a. Please describe how FEMA's participation in the 
conference falls under the core mission of helping Americans before, 
during, and after disasters.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 2.b. Can you provide the Committee details on this travel, 
including who from FEMA attended, who approved this travel, length of 
stay, and the total costs to the taxpayer?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 3. The Biden Administration's request for supplemental 
funding included a request for $40 billion for the Disaster Relief 
Fund, but requested authority to transfer up to $1.5 billion for the 
Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon claims. Congress provided authority for FEMA 
to manage this claims office, but it seems that FEMA is being asked to 
pay out the claims from its own budget, despite the allegations that 
liability falls with another Federal agency.
    Question 3.a. Please provide a breakdown of all costs to FEMA of 
managing this claims office, including actual claims paid out, 
staffing, and other administrative costs.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 3.b. Is FEMA receiving any reimbursement from the Federal

  Question to Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. Rick 
                                 Larsen

    Question 1. Following catastrophic disasters, including Hurricanes 
Helene and Milton, one of the most common frustrations cited by 
disaster survivors is difficulty navigating the complex application 
system for federal disaster aid.
    Does FEMA have the resources necessary to maintain modern 
application system software? Would additional funding for the 
modernization of FEMA's survivor intake software improve the disaster 
survivor experience?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

  Questions to Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. John 
                               Garamendi

    Question 1. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and other local 
agencies in California have brought to my attention that FEMA's current 
guidance for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities 
(BRIC) program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program do not allow grant 
awards to water infrastructure projects specifically for fire 
suppression to protect at-risk communities. Will FEMA commit to making 
water infrastructure projects for fire suppression eligible for these 
two FEMA disaster preparedness programs?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 2. FEMA is advancing up to 50% of costs while 
jurisdictions complete final paperwork for projects under $1 million. 
What additional authorities or funding does FEMA need to expand these 
programs to help small, impoverished communities or areas of persistent 
poverty and facilitate recovery efforts in small communities?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 3. The Public Assistance Alternative Procedures Program 
(PAAP) provides an alternative route to traditional public assistance 
funding, incentivizing cost-saving and simplifying reporting 
requirements. However, the program's status as a pilot program may lead 
to inconsistent implementation. Are there particular difficulties 
smaller communities face when applying for assistance through the 
Alternative Procedures Program? Moreover, would the Alternative 
Procedures program benefit from being made permanent, allowing FEMA to 
promulgate necessary regulations to administer the program?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
