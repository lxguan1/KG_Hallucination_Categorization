                                       U.S. Senate,
                               Committee on Indian Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m. in room 
628, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Brian Schatz, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    The Chairman. Good afternoon. During today's legislative 
hearing, we will consider the following bills: S. 2908, The 
Indian Buffalo Management Act; S. 3263, the Poarch Band of 
Creek Indians Parity Act; S. 4000, A Bill to Reaffirm the 
Applicability of the Indian Reorganization Act to the Lytton 
Rancheria of California, and for other purposes; and S. 4442, 
the Crow Water Rights Settlement Amendment Act of 2024.
    Before we begin, I want to say a few words about the 
Supreme Court's misguided decision in Carcieri v. Salazar. The 
Carcieri decision put rebuilding tribal homelands into a 
tailspin, and for 15 years, it has slowed Interior's land-into-
trust process and frustrated Indian Country, increased 
administrative costs and spurred often needless litigation. So 
I think we are all clear that we support legislation to fix 
Carcieri for all tribes.
    I share Indian Country's frustration with Congress' failure 
to pass a universal fix. But we have to recognize that Congress 
has acted on tribal specific legislation before, and Senator 
Britt's and Senator Padilla's bills are in line with those past 
successful efforts.
    With that, I will briefly describe today's bill with a more 
fulsome description entered into the record.
    S. 2908 was introduced by Senators Heinrich and Mullin. The 
bill would establish a buffalo management program at BIA to 
help tribes and tribal organizations manage buffalo herds and 
habitat for cultural, subsistence and economic development 
purposes.
    S. 3263 was introduced by Senator Britt and Senator 
Tuberville. This bill would reaffirm the Indian Reorganization 
Act's applicability to the Poarch Band of Creek Indians and 
ratify the trust status of lands the tribe previously acquired 
administratively.
    S. 4000 was introduced by Senator Padilla. The bill would 
reaffirm the Indian Reorganization Act's applicability to the 
Lytton Rancheria of California and clarify that the tribe is 
eligible to have its lands taken into trust through the 
Department of Interior's land-into-trust process.
    Our final bill on the agenda is S. 4442, introduced by 
Senator Tester and Senator Daines. This bill would amend the 
Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010 to change the 
scope of the water infrastructure system authorized under that 
Act to provide the Crow tribe more flexibility in developing 
regional irrigation and municipal and industrial water 
projects, and to allow the tribe additional time to develop 
hydropower projects to deliver clean energy and water to the 
reservation.
    Before I turn to the Vice Chair for her opening statement, 
I would like to extend our welcome and thanks to the witnesses 
for joining us today. I look forward to your testimony and our 
discussion.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?

               STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
today's hearing. You have covered much of the details of the 
bills that will be before us.
    I want to discuss quickly S. 2908, the Indian Buffalo 
Management Act, this has impacts on my State. It would make 
permanent the small but important program operated by the BIA 
that is rebuilding buffalo populations on tribal lands.
    The Indian Buffalo Management Act was first introduced in 
the House during the 116th Congress by my friend and Alaska's 
Congressman, Don Young. We know the history, the story of the 
Plains bison and how they were a vital source of food and 
nutrition for Native people. Tens of millions of buffalo once 
roamed the west until they were decimated in the 1800s by 
misguided and inhumane policies of the forced removal area.
    Today, the Federal Government is partnering with tribes and 
tribal organizations like the Intertribal Buffalo Council to 
reestablish bison herds. I never know whether to say ``bison'' 
or ``bizon'' [phonetically], I think it depends on the part of 
the Country you are in. Take it whichever way it makes you 
happiest.
    What we are trying to do is, again, reestablish these herds 
for economic development as a traditional food source and 
provide food security for Native communities. We have two 
communities in Alaska, Old Harbor and Stevens Village, that are 
part of this. Both communities manage herds that total around 
500 buffalo, so now it is buffalo, not bison.
    This is a new subsistence species for them. Some of the 
bison in Alaska today were rounded up and relocated from the 
lower 48, with assistance from the buffalo program. In recent 
years, Interior has assisted with the transfer of surplus bulls 
from Yellowstone National Park to Alaska. So if you ask the 
question, how do they get from Yellowstone to Alaska, they put 
these one-ton animals on a FedEx plane, then they transport 
them by barge and truck and occasionally helicopter to their 
new homes. Once they make it to places like Kodiak Island, they 
roam free and have a pretty good life there.
    But as the original sponsor of the Indian Buffalo 
Management Act, Don Young understood that the BIA program could 
be utilized to improve the health and genetic diversity of the 
herds in our State. But in order to build this food source, 
resources are needed to cover the cost of transporting more 
cows, calves, and mobile slaughter facilities to the interior 
villages. Because as you can imagine, it is not cheap. But we 
are looking forward to additional resources to help not only 
develop the program, but to expand training and educational 
opportunities for the tribal herd managers.
    So it is a good bill. I am pleased that Assistant Secretary 
Newland is here. We will have some questions for him on that.
    I appreciate the testimony of the witnesses that are before 
the Committee here today.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair.
    First, Senator Tester, and then I am going to go a little 
bit out of order and have Senator Heinrich make some opening 
remarks, because he has to chair a different hearing.
    Senator Tester?

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Vice 
Chair Murkowski.
    This is really a good hearing. I commend you both for 
having it. These are important bills that need to get advanced, 
and today is the start of that.
    I also want to thank Chairman Whiteclay for being here 
today. Chairman Whiteclay is the leader of the Crow Tribe. I am 
grateful for his strong leadership on important issues like law 
enforcement, fiscal management, infrastructure.
    This Crow Water bill in front of the Committee today is an 
excellent example of the good work that the Chairman is doing 
serving his tribe. This bill would not be in the shape it is 
today without his strong leadership, and we thank you for that.
    I also want to recognize my friend, Erv Carlson. Erv, it is 
great to have you here. He is a member of the Blackfeet Tribe, 
and a long-time champion for Indian buffalo management. I am 
glad to see the Buffalo Management Act getting here, and I 
think it is a very important piece of legislation.
    But I want to talk a minute about water and the Crow Water 
bill that is on today's agenda. Many years ago, my Native 
friends told me that water is life, and it is, for all lives. 
It powers Montana's economies, it is critical to the health of 
our communities, it connects us together. That is why it is 
critical that the Crow Tribe has the tools and infrastructure 
they need to deliver clean water to its communities.
    This bipartisan Crow Water Settlement Amendment Act will do 
exactly that. It will provide the tribe vital flexibility in 
developing water infrastructure, using the most up-to-date 
technology to create water systems that are more cost-effective 
and work for the Crow Tribe and the region. It will also 
bolster energy development by extending the timeline for the 
tribe to develop hydropower on the Yellowtail Afterbay Dam 
until 2030, providing clean energy that will provide an 
economic boost to the Crow community.
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, I am pleased to 
share that we can accomplish all this with no additional cost, 
without changing any existing water rights, and without 
reopening the water settlement. The Crow Water Settlement 
Amendments Act is a simple, made-in-Montana solution that is 
going to help the Crow Tribe develop the infrastructure needed 
to deliver clean water to the folks for years to come.
    Lastly, I want to quickly add that I am glad to see the 
Poarch bill, and Katie Britt, thank you very, very much for 
your leadership on this. It is a long time coming.
    And the Lytton bill, if Senator Padilla was here, I would 
say the same thing to him. Those bills are important. These 
bills would restore the Secretary of Interior's authority to 
take land into trust for the tribes. I am a long-time supporter 
of this effort, following the enforcement of the 2009 Supreme 
Court decision that wrongly oppressed some tribes for having 
land taken into trust.
    With that, once again, Mr. Chairman, Vice Chair, thank you 
for having this hearing.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Tester, and 
thank you for your leadership on all these issues.
    Senator Heinrich?

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARTIN HEINRICH, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, and I want to 
thank Vice Chair Murkowski for your words as well.
    Several years ago, I was proud to lead, along with Senator 
Hoeven, the effort to designate the bison as our national 
mammal. This species has been a critical part of our culture in 
New Mexico, across the west, most especially in Indian Country.
    The growth of tribal buffalo herds over the last few 
decades is both a symbol of the enduring resilience of this 
iconic species and a major economic development opportunity for 
many tribes. Dozen of tribes and several in New Mexico, 
including the Pueblos of Taos and Picuris, Pojoaque and Sandia, 
have done important work to establish tribal buffalo herds on 
their lands.
    I have been privileged to see this first-hand. Two years 
ago, I visited Picuris Pueblo and went out with the herd 
manager, Danny Sam, to see their operation up close. I learned 
about how the community is reincorporating bison meat back into 
their diets. The tribal herd at Picuris has allowed the Pueblo 
to distribute much of that healthy, locally grown, culturally 
important protein to the community for free.
    Our bipartisan, bicameral bill, the Indian Buffalo 
Management Act, would strengthen Federal support for tribal 
bison programs like the one I saw at Picuris. It would 
authorize a permanent program at Interior and provide dedicated 
funding to promote and develop capacity for tribes to manage 
those buffalo herds.
    As you will hear from Erv Carlson from the InterTribal 
Buffalo Council, establishing and managing a new bison herd is 
a resource-intensive process for tribes. There is a very real 
need for technical and resource support.
    I want to thank you, Erv, and ITBC for all of your 
guidance, all of your feedback, that helped us as we drafted 
this legislation, and for your organization's support for 
tribal bison herds all across Indian Country.
    I would also like to thank my Republican partner on this 
bill, Senator Markwayne Mullin, and our bipartisan colleagues 
in the House, Representatives Doug LaMalfa and Mary Peltola. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not also recognize the late 
Representative Don Young, who was one of the original leaders 
in this effort in Congress.
    Thank you, Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski, for 
giving me time to speak on this bill. I hope that in my 
lifetime, thanks in large part to these tribal buffalo herds, 
we will see bison return to the prominent place that it once 
occupied as a keystone species on America's short grass 
prairies.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Heinrich.
    I will now turn to our witnesses. We are happy to see the 
most frequent of frequent fliers in this Committee, the 
Honorable Bryan Newland, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs 
at the Department of Interior. Welcome.
    The Honorable Andy Mejia, Chairperson of the Lytton 
Rancheria of California, in Winsor, California; Mr. Erv 
Carlson, Sr., President of the InterTribal Buffalo Council in 
Rapid City, South Dakota.
    Senator Tester, would you do the honors of introducing our 
next witness?
    Senator Tester. It would be an honor to do the honors.
    Chairman Whiteclay, who I addressed in my opening 
statement, is the leader of the Crow Tribe. I would just tell 
you, when Chairman Whiteclay took over the Crow Tribe, it was 
not under the best of leadership, and that is being generous.
    Frank stepped forward, he put financial responsibility as a 
key part of his administration, and he is working hard to make 
sure it remains that way. He put law enforcement as a keystone 
of his administration, and he is working hard to keep Crow 
Country safe. This bill deals with infrastructure, and that is 
another area that Chairman Whiteclay has done great work on.
    It is great to have you here. I know this is not an easy 
trip to make, but we certainly appreciate your making the trip.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Tester.
    We are pleased to have Senator Britt to both introduce her 
guest and talk a little bit about the legislation pending 
before the Committee. Senator Britt?

                STATEMENT OF HON. KATIE BRITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

    Senator Britt. Thank you so much. I appreciate the 
opportunity, Chair Schatz, and Vice Chair Murkowski, for the 
ability to be here today and introduce Stephanie Bryan, the 
Poarch Creek Indians Tribal Chair and Chief Executive officer 
to this Committee today. Stephanie, it is an honor to introduce 
you.
    Chairwoman Bryan is here testifying to S. 3262, the Poarch 
Band of Creek Indians Parity Act. This bill is intended to 
clarify that the Poarch Band of Creek Indians should be 
considered as now under Federal jurisdiction for the purposes 
of the Indian Reorganization Act. The Poarch Band of Creek 
Indians is a critical part of Alabama's culture and heritage.
    As a leader of the Poarch Nation, Chairwoman Bryan 
represents the tribe's interests at both the State and national 
level. She is nationally recognized as an advocate on issues 
critically important to Indian Country, and serves in several 
significant national roles.
    In Alabama, Chairwoman Bryan works directly with the 
governor, State agencies, and local leaders. Her service in her 
community and in State leadership positions is truly 
incredible. She serves on the business council of Alabama's 
Executive Committee, Leadership Alabama, Montgomery Area 
Chamber of Commerce, Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, just to 
name a few. Through these roles, she contributes directly to 
the growth of our great State.
    She has also been instrumental in growing the Poarch Creek 
Tribe's business portfolio. Last year, Business Alabama 
recognized her as the publication's first ever CEO of the Year.
    The Poarch Creek Indians have a growing business supporting 
the Department of Defense, NASA, and the tribe continues to 
reinvest over a billion dollars just in the last decade alone 
into over 40 businesses across a range of industries. 
Chairwoman Bryan, thank you for testifying today. We are 
grateful for your service to the community, the State, our 
Nation and the tribe. We are excited to have you here.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Britt.
    Are there any other members wishing to make an opening 
statement? If not, I want to remind our witnesses that your 
full written testimony will be made part of the official 
hearing record, and so if you could please keep your remarks to 
five minutes or fewer, the Committee would appreciate that.
    We will start with Assistant Secretary Newland. Please 
proceed with your testimony.

          STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN NEWLAND, ASSISTANT 
       SECRETARY, INDIAN AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE 
                            INTERIOR

    Mr. Newland. Boozhoo, [phrase in Native tongue.] Good 
afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, members of 
the Committee.
    My name is Bryan Newland, I have the privilege of serving 
as the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. I am glad to be 
back again in front of the Committee to testify on these four 
bills. I want to say right from the get-go that the department 
supports passage of each of these bills.
    S. 2908, the Indian Buffalo Management Act, would establish 
a permanent program within the department to develop, promote 
and support tribal management of buffalo and buffalo habitat on 
Indian lands. This bill would also authorize $14 million in 
annual appropriations to support this work.
    This legislation will advance food sovereignty and support 
the protection and revitalization of cultural practices for 
tribes all across the United States. It will also support the 
department's efforts to work with tribes in co-stewardship of 
ecosystems and wildlife.
    S. 3263 and S. 4000 would ensure that the Poarch Band of 
Creek Indians and the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians have the 
ability to restore and protect their tribal homelands under the 
Indian Reorganization Act. Since the Carcieri decision, the 
department must examine whether each tribe seeking to have land 
placed into trust under the Indian Reorganization Act was 
``under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.'' This analysis is done 
on a tribe-by-tribe basis and is both time consuming and costly 
for tribes as well as the department.
    The ability to restore and protect tribal homelands is an 
important part of our trust responsibility, and it has been the 
policy of the United States for nearly a full century.
    In addition to S. 3263 and S. 4000, the department has 
consistently expressed strong support for a universal 
legislative solution to the Carcieri decision for all tribes. 
The department urges Congress to consider a legislative fix to 
the Carcieri decision for all tribes to eliminate the need for 
each tribe to seek its own separate legislation.
    S. 4442 would amend the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement 
Act of 2010 by establishing a non-trust fund account to allow 
the Bureau of Reclamation to continue work on rehabbing the 
Crow Irrigation Project in a new municipal, rural, and 
industrial projects trust fund to be used by the Crow Tribe for 
specified purposes.
    This Administration recognizes that water is a sacred and 
valuable resource for tribes, and that longstanding water 
crises continue to undermine public health and economic 
development all across Indian Country. Access to water is 
fundamental to human existence and economic opportunity, and 
that is no less true for people in tribal communities.
    This bill would not increase funding for the Settlement 
Act. Instead, it simply changes the way some of the funds are 
held and expended.
    When the Crow Water Rights Settlement Act, that is hard to 
say all at once, when that law was passed it did not provide 
for the creation of a non-trust interest-bearing account for 
funds appropriated for project construction. More recent Indian 
water rights settlements have provided for such accounts to 
allow funds to accrue interest while projects are being 
planned, designed, and constructed.
    This bill would authorize the establishment of a non-trust, 
interest-bearing account in Treasury to receive the funds 
already appropriated as well as future appropriations for the 
Crow Irrigation Project rehabilitation.
    S. 4442 would convert the MR&I portion of that settlement 
act from an infrastructure based settlement act from an 
infrastructure based settlement to a trust fund based 
settlement. It would direct the Secretary to establish in the 
existing Crow Tribe water rights settlement trust fund a new 
MR&I projects account. The tribe would use funds from this 
account for several purposes: planning, designing and 
constructing MR&I systems; planning, designing and constructing 
wastewater treatment facilities; and purchasing on-reservation 
land with water rights.
    Finally, this bill would extend the period during which the 
tribe has the exclusive right to develop hydropower at the 
Yellowtail Afterbay Dam until 2030.
    Again, the department is pleased to support each of these 
bills and is willing to provide further technical assistance to 
sponsors and members of the Committee upon request.
    Chairman Schatz and members of the Committee, I want to 
thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to answering any questions you may have.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Newland follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Bryan Newland, Assistant Secretary, Indian 
                Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior
    Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and 
members of the Committee. My name is Bryan Newland, and I am the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of the 
Interior (Department). Thank you for the opportunity to present 
testimony on S. 2908, ``Indian Buffalo Management Act,'' S. 3263, 
``Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act,'' S. 4000, ``To reaffirm the 
applicability of the Indian Reorganization Act to the Lytton Rancheria 
of California, and for other purposes,'' and S. 4442, ``To amend the 
Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010 to make improvements to 
that Act, and for other purposes.''
S. 2908, Indian Buffalo Management Act
    The North American Bison, commonly called buffalo, is the official 
mammal of the United States and plays an important role in the history 
and ecology of this continent. For many Tribes, buffalo play a 
significant role in their identity, subsistence, economic development, 
and conservation and land management practices. The historical, 
cultural, and spiritual connection between buffalo and Tribes cannot be 
overstated. Buffalo sustained many Indian Tribes in North America for 
many centuries before they were nearly exterminated by non-Indian 
hunters in the mid-1800s.
    Indian Tribes have long desired the reestablishment of buffalo 
throughout Indian Country. The successful restoration of buffalo allows 
an Indian Tribe to benefit from the reintroduction of buffalo into the 
diets of the members of the Indian Tribe. Working to restore buffalo 
and increase Tribal access to buffalo is a priority for the Biden 
administration and for Secretary Haaland. The BIA's Branch of Fish, 
Wildlife, and Recreation funds buffalo restoration and management 
activities through annual appropriations. S. 2908, the Indian Buffalo 
Management Act, would establish a permanent program within the 
Department to develop and promote Tribal ownership, conservation, and 
management of buffalo and buffalo habitat on Indian lands.
    Under S. 2908, two entities are eligible for program participation: 
Indian Tribes, as defined by the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), and Tribal organizations organized 
under Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). The Department 
recommends amending the definition of ``Tribal organization'' to avoid 
the exclusion of Tribal corporations Federally chartered under Section 
3 of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, P.L. 74- 816, or Tribal 
organizations contracting for the administration and operation of 
certain Federal programs which provide services to Indian Tribes and 
their members. The Department looks forward to working with the 
sponsors on these issues.
    S. 2908 authorizes $14 million in annual appropriations. The 
Department previously testified on H.R. 6368, the House companion to S. 
2908, in which we raised concerns about the lack of dedicated funding 
for the activities authorized under H.R. 6368. For both bills, 
activities will be eligible for contracting or compacting by Tribes 
under ISDEAA. In the event of a Tribe utilizing ISDEAA, as amended, to 
contract or compact that permanent program, the Secretary may be 
required to utilize funds from other programs to meet the Department's 
statutory obligations under ISDEAA. The Department appreciates the 
opportunity to work with Congress to ensure that we have the resources 
to implement the provisions of S. 2908 if enacted and strongly supports 
the provision authorizing dedicated funding.
    Buffalo once roamed this continent in the tens of millions and the 
Department appreciate efforts to improve management of this vital 
species. The Department recognizes our shared interest in modernizing 
buffalo management in Indian Country and appreciates Congress's 
attention to this effort. The Department supports S. 2908. The 
Department welcomes the opportunity to work with the sponsors and the 
Committee to provide technical assistance to clarify eligible entities 
and to ensure that other offices at the Department can enter into co-
stewardship and comanagement agreements with Indian Tribes.
S. 3263 and S. 4000 and the Impacts of the Carcieri v. Salazar Decision
    In Carcieri v. Salazar, the United States Supreme Court was faced 
with the question of whether the Department could acquire land in trust 
under section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) on behalf of the 
Narragansett Tribe of Rhode Island for a housing project. The Court's 
majority noted that section 5 permits the Secretary to acquire land in 
trust for Federally recognized Tribes that were ``under Federal 
jurisdiction'' in 1934. It then determined that the Secretary was 
precluded from taking land into trust for the Narragansett Tribe, who 
had stipulated that it was not ``under Federal jurisdiction'' in 1934.
    The Carcieri decision upset the settled expectations of both the 
Department and Indian Country and led to confusion about the scope of 
the Secretary's authority to acquire land in trust for all Federally 
recognized Tribes-including those Tribes that were Federally recognized 
or restored after the enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act. As 
many Tribal leaders have noted, the Carcieri decision is contrary to 
existing congressional policy, and has the potential to subject 
Federally recognized Tribes to unequal treatment under Federal law.
    Since the Carcieri decision, the Department must examine whether 
each Tribe seeking to have land acquired in trust under the Indian 
Reorganization Act was ``under Federal jurisdiction'' in 1934. This 
analysis is done on a Tribe-by-Tribe basis, even for those Tribes whose 
jurisdictional status is unquestioned. This analysis may be time-
consuming and costly for Tribes and for the Department. Overall, it has 
made the Department's consideration of fee-to-trust applications more 
complex and created an additional administrative burden for the Federal 
government and Tribes related to decisions taking land into trust. The 
Tribes at issue in S. 3263 and S. 4000 are just two of the many Tribes 
who have experienced undue burdens to reclaim and develop their lands.
    S. 3263 would address the impact that the Carcieri decision has had 
on the Poarch Band of Creek Indians by deeming that the Band shall be 
considered as having been under Federal jurisdiction as of June 18, 
1934, for the purposes of the IRA. The bill would also congressionally 
reaffirm previous decisions by the Secretary to take land into trust 
for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians under IRA authorities.
    S. 4000 would clarify that the IRA applies to the Lytton Rancheria 
and that the Secretary has the authority to take land into trust for 
the Lytton Tribe under Section 5 of the IRA. The bill would also deem 
lands taken into trust under Section 5 of the IRA for the Lytton 
Rancheria as part of the Tribe's reservation and would be administered 
accordingly.
    The Department supports S. 3263 and S. 4000. Tribal homelands are 
at the heart of Tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and self-
governance. The power to acquire lands in trust is an important tool 
for the United States to effectuate its longstanding policy of 
fostering Tribal selfdetermination. Congress has worked to foster self-
determination for all Tribes and did not intend to limit this essential 
tool to only one class of Tribes. In addition to S. 3263 and S. 4000, 
the Department has consistently expressed strong support for a 
universal legislative solution to the Carcieri decision for all Tribes. 
Further, the President's budgets for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 
proposed a simple and clean fix to the IRA to ensure the Secretary has 
the authority to take land into trust for all Tribes without the need 
for the complex review of whether a Tribe was ``under Federal 
jurisdiction'' in 1934. The Department urges Congress to consider a 
legislative fix to Carcieri decision for all Tribes to eliminate the 
need for each Tribe to seek separate legislation.
S. 4442, Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Amendments Act of 2024
    S. 4442 would amend the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 
2010 (Pub. L. 111-291; 124 Stat. 3097) (``Settlement Act''). The 
Department supports S. 4442 and recommends an amendment to the bill, 
which we have discussed with the Crow Tribe, that would ensure that 
trust fund expenditures prioritize providing clean drinking water over 
land acquisitions.
Introduction
    The Biden Administration recognizes that water is a sacred and 
valuable resource for Tribal Nations and that long-standing water 
crises continue to undermine public health and economic development in 
Indian Country. This Administration strongly supports the resolution of 
Indian water rights claims through negotiated settlements. Indian water 
settlements help to ensure that Tribal Nations have safe, reliable 
water supplies; improve environmental and health concerns on 
reservations; enable economic growth; promote Tribal sovereignty and 
self-sufficiency; and help advance the United States' trust 
relationship with Tribes. At the same time, water rights settlements 
have the potential to end decades of controversy and contention among 
Tribal Nations and neighboring communities and promote cooperation in 
the management of water resources.
    Congress plays an important role in approving Indian water rights 
settlements and we stand ready to work with this Committee and Members 
of Congress to advance Indian water rights settlements and ensure their 
successful implementation.
    Indian water rights settlements play a pivotal role in this 
Administration's commitment to putting equity at the center of 
everything we do to improve the lives of everyday people--including 
Tribal Nations. We have a clear charge from President Biden and 
Secretary Haaland to improve water access and water quality on Tribal 
lands. Access to water is fundamental to human existence, economic 
development, and the future of communities--especially Tribal 
communities.
Background
    The Settlement Act authorized $460 million, indexed to inflation, 
for the Bureau of Reclamation to plan, design and construct two major 
projects on the Crow Reservation: (1) the rehabilitation and 
improvement of the Crow Irrigation Project (CIP), and (2) the design 
and construction of a Municipal, Rural, and Industrial (MR&I) water 
system. Both projects were to be designed and constructed as generally 
described in detailed engineering reports prepared by consultants to 
the Tribe and cited in the Settlement Act. In addition, the Settlement 
Act gave the Tribe a 15-year exclusive right to construct hydropower 
facilities at the Yellowtail Afterbay Dam, a Bureau of Reclamation 
facility. That exclusive right expires in 2025.
Proposed Amendment
    S. 4442 would amend the Settlement Act by establishing a non-trust 
fund account to allow the Bureau of Reclamation to continue work on 
rehabilitation of the CIP and a new MR&I projects trust fund to be used 
by the Tribe for (i) planning, permitting, designing, engineering, 
constructing, reconstructing, replacing, rehabilitating, operating, or 
repairing water production, treatment, or delivery infrastructure, 
including for domestic and municipal use or wastewater infrastructure; 
(ii) purchasing on-Reservation land with water rights; and (iii) 
complying with applicable environmental laws. The amendments do not 
increase the funding for the Settlement Act but merely change the way 
some funds are held and expended. If enacted as written, it is our 
interpretation that while the Amendment would repeal Section 406 in its 
entirety, funding for the MR&I projects trust fund would not exceed 
$246,381,000, as indexed, as provided in section 414(b) of the 
Settlement Act (which would be redesignated as 415(b) pursuant to S. 
4442).
    When the Settlement Act was enacted, it did not provide for the 
creation of a non-trust interestbearing account for funds appropriated 
for project construction. Subsequent Indian water rights settlements 
have provided for such accounts to allow funds to accrue interest while 
projects are being planned, designed, and constructed. Because the 
Settlement Act did not provide this authorization, the Department and 
the Tribe instead opened a joint-signature account with a private bank 
for the investment of settlement funds. While this has allowed the 
funding to earn interest, it has come with costs associated with 
maintaining a private bank account. The Tribe now seeks to establish a 
non-trust interest-bearing account in Treasury so it can enjoy the 
benefits of earning interest without having to pay management fees to a 
private banking institution. S. 4442 would authorize the establishment 
of a non-trust interest-bearing account in Treasury to receive the 
funds already appropriated and yet to be appropriated for CIP 
rehabilitation. Reclamation would continue to be the lead agency 
responsible for the planning, design, and construction of CIP 
rehabilitation features.
    With respect to the MR&I system, S. 4442 would convert this portion 
of the Settlement Act from an infrastructure-based settlement to a 
trust fund-based settlement. S. 4442 would direct the Secretary to 
establish in the existing Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Trust Fund 
a new ``MR&I Projects'' account. The Tribe could then use funds from 
this account for several authorized purposes: plan, design, and 
construct MR&I systems; plan, design, and construct wastewater 
treatment facilities; and purchase on-Reservation land with water 
rights. S. 4442 would provide the Tribe with flexibility and discretion 
to plan, design, and construct the MR&I and wastewater systems that it 
believes will best serve communities on its Reservation.
    Finally, S. 4442 would extend by five years the period during which 
the Tribe has the exclusive right to develop hydropower at the 
Yellowtail Afterbay Dam, to 2030.
    The Department supports S. 4442. Allowing the Tribe to use the 
funding authorized for a large, centralized MR&I system to instead 
build smaller MR&I projects will allow it to make decisions regarding 
how, when, and where to develop water infrastructure on the 
Reservation. This approach is consistent with Tribal sovereignty and 
self-determination. We would like to work with the Tribe and the 
Committee, however, to include language in S. 4442 to ensure that trust 
fund expenditures prioritize providing clean drinking water over land 
acquisitions. The expansion of the authorized uses from a single use 
(MR&I) to multiple uses, including wastewater projects and purchases of 
land with water rights, will necessarily reduce the amount of funding 
available for badly needed drinking water systems on the Reservation. 
Provisions prioritizing funding for MR&I would ensure safe, reliable 
drinking water for the Tribe.
Conclusion
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Department's 
views.

 STATEMENT OF HON. STEPHANIE BRYAN, CHAIR/CEO, POARCH BAND OF 
                         CREEK INDIANS

    Ms. Bryan. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair 
Murkowski, and members of the Committee. My name is Stephanie 
Bryan, and I am honored to be the Chair and CEO of The Poarch 
Band of Creek Indians.
    I greatly appreciate this opportunity to testify today 
about the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act. I want to 
thank Senator Britt and Coach Tuberville for introducing this 
bill.
    The Poarch Band of Creek Indians has been a leading 
advocate for a national Carcieri fix to clarify that the Indian 
Reorganization Act applies to all federally recognized tribes. 
We offer our full support to the Tester-Moran bill, Senate Bill 
563, which would accomplish that goal.
    We will continue to work to pass a national fix, but our 
tribe, like many others, has been forced to take a parallel 
approach by working with our Congressional delegation to 
clarify that the IRA applies to our tribe. For decades, Poarch 
Creek leaders have balanced the desire to preserve our tribe's 
history and culture with the need to rebuild our community and 
provide basic services to our citizens. Today, we are blessed 
to be able to provide our tribal citizens and neighbors with 
essential services that include police and fire protection, 
health care, elder care, education and infrastructure.
    We have made careful decisions about how best to use our 
resources and our property. But we have a limited land base, 
and we can't meet the growing needs for housing and other 
essential services for our citizens.
    In 2018, it became clear that we needed to expand our Boys 
and Girls Club, but we didn't have the trust land. So that cost 
us $1 million to do an area where our ponds are located.
    But we are not alone. Tribal governments nationwide have a 
shortage of usable trust land and seek to acquire trust lands 
to meet basic needs of our people.
    The Supreme Court's 2009 Carcieri decision upended the 
Interior Department's land-into-trust process. That decision 
placed a cloud of uncertainty over tribal trust lands, impeding 
investment and economic development in Indian Country. It has 
led to frivolous lawsuits challenging the status of these trust 
lands.
    The tribe has spent almost $10 million to defend ourselves 
against attacks on our sovereignty. Thankfully, every court 
reviewing these frivolous cases has upheld the status of our 
lands, which the Interior placed into trust decades ago.
    However, these lawsuits have taken a toll, and that is why 
our tribe is seeking a legislative solution that will provide 
us with much-needed clarity. Our bill affirms that the IRA 
applies to our tribe and it allows us to be treated fairly, 
like other federally recognized tribes.
    These frivolous lawsuits have not just hurt us; they have 
cost taxpayer dollars, because the Interior Department and DOJ 
have had to use their budgets to defend our trust lands. This 
bill has strong support from the Alabama Congressional 
delegation, also, the cities and counties that surround us.
    I respectfully ask the Committee to mark up Senate Bill 
3263 and pass the bill before the end of the year. On behalf of 
our tribe, I am honored to testify today and will answer any 
questions that you may have.
    [Phrase in Native tongue].

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Stephanie Bryan, Chair/CEO, Poarch Band of 
                             Creek Indians
    Good afternoon, Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and Members of 
the Committee. My name is Stephanie Bryan, and I am honored to serve as 
the Chair and CEO of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. Thank you for 
this opportunity to testify today about S. 3263, the Poarch Band of 
Creek Indians Parity Act. On behalf of the Tribal Council, I extend our 
great thanks to Senators Britt and Tuberville for introducing this 
bill.
History of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians
    I want to begin by sharing some history about the Poarch Band of 
Creek Indians. ``The Poarch Band of Creeks of today originated in the 
aboriginal and historical Creek Nation.'' \1\ At the time of our 
Nation's founding, the Creek Confederacy governed an expansive 
territory. Creek lands--guaranteed in the Treaty of New York in 1790--
covered most of modern-day Georgia and Alabama, as well as parts of 
Florida. That territory was reduced twice via treaty over the ensuing 
two decades, and then again as a result of the War of 1812, when the 
Creek Confederacy was divided between those who joined with the British 
and those who remained friendly to the United States. After the war, 
however, the United States continued to recognize land rights of Creeks 
who had allied with it. In 1814, the United States granted those Creeks 
the right to occupy individual reservations in Southern Alabama under 
the Treaty of Fort Jackson. \2\

(Operations), U.S. Dep't of Interior, to Assistant Secretary--Indian 
Affairs, on Recommendation and Summary of Evidence for Proposed Finding

pursuant to 25 C.F.R.  83, at 3 (Dec. 29, 1983).
    \2\ 7 Stat. 120 (Aug. 9, 1814).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Little time passed before the United States' policy toward the 
Creeks began to change. In 1817, Congress provided that fee simple 
patents to Creek reservation lands should be issued upon the death of 
the original reservation grantees. Moreover, in what came to be known 
as the Trail of Tears, the United States decided to pursue a policy of 
forced removal of the Creeks and other tribal nations in the South and 
Eastern United States. Thousands of Native children, women, and men 
died on these forced marches to the Indian Territory--which is now the 
state of Oklahoma. Our Tribe avoided this fate. Like other Indian 
nations located in the South and East today, we were able to do so only 
by fleeing into remote homelands.
    Specifically, our tribe found refuge and settled on the McGhee 
reserve, located now in the Community of Poarch, Alabama. A Creek 
leader, Lynn McGhee, had been granted a reserve pursuant to the 1814 
Treaty. Under the terms of the Treaty, McGhee and his descendants 
retained the right to the reserve as long as they occupied it and were 
to be ``protected by and subject to the laws of the United States.'' 
\3\ This land was ``technically individually owned.'' \4\ ``[I]n 
practice,'' however,''[the McGhee lands] were usable by the entire 
community'' that ``settled there'' during the removal era. \5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unlike other Creek reservations established in the wake of the War 
of 1812, the McGhee reserve was held in trust and never fee patented. 
As noted, in 1817 Congress passed a statute that generally removed 
Creek reservations from trust status. McGhee, however, had been unable 
to enter his claim for a reservation before the deadline set by the 
1814 Treaty of Fort Jackson because of a war injury. For this reason, 
Congress subsequently acted specifically on behalf of McGhee, granting 
him the right to select a reservation under the terms of the 1814 
Treaty after the deadline. In so doing, Congress opted not to subject 
the McGhee reserve to the 1817 Act.
    In the early 1900s, the Department of Justice confirmed the McGhee 
reserve's trust status. Specifically, in 1912, the federal government, 
acting in its role as trustee, sued a timber company for trespass on 
the McGhee reserve. This action was accompanied by a series of internal 
memoranda within the Department of Justice, which analyzed whether the 
land remained in trust and concluded that it did. \6\

Johnson, at 6-7 (Apr. 23, 1913).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite this confirmation of trust status, the Government Land 
Office improperly issued a fee patent to the McGhee heirs in 1924. 
However, because these fee grants were unlawful, they did not erode the 
protections owed to our Tribe. Later analysis by the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs concluded that the descendants of McGhee ``who to this 
day occupy his reserve continue to be `protected by and subject to the 
laws of the United States.''' \7\

Affairs, to Mr. Keep, Associate Solicitor, Indian Affairs on the

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 1984, after years of living in obscurity and abject poverty, the 
Reagan Administration reaffirmed the status of the Poarch Band of Creek 
Indians as a federally recognized Tribe. The United States acknowledged 
that Poarch has been an autonomous, distinct tribal community for 
centuries, that we have maintained governing authority over our tribal 
citizens, and that our citizens descend from an historical Indian 
Tribe. We remain based on the McGhee reserve, which was never 
disestablished. \8\

    Our Tribe is also a successor to the pre-Removal Creek treaties and 
as such we have at all times since then enjoyed a treaty relationship 
with the United States. Our ancestors were part of the Creek Nation 
before the removal era. We were recognized by the United States as 
autonomous, and our ancestors signed the pre-removal Creek treaties as 
a subset of the Creek Confederacy. \9\ The Department of the Interior 
has accordingly recognized that we are a ``successor of the Creek 
Nation of Alabama prior to its removal.'' \10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Acknowledgement as a federally recognized Indian Tribe was a 
turning point for our government. In 1984, we began working with the 
Interior Department to establish a small land base for our community. 
Using authority provided in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the 
Tribe worked with Interior to place approximately 389 acres of fee 
lands into trust from 1985 to 1995. The majority of these trust lands 
(229.5 acres) were approved by Interior on April 18, 1985. \11\

Establishment of Reservation: Correction (50 Fed. Reg. 19813 (May 10, 
1985)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Over the past four decades, Poarch Creek leaders have balanced the 
preservation of our Tribe's history and culture with the need to 
rebuild our community. Today, we are blessed to be able to provide our 
tribal citizens and neighbors with essential services, including 
functioning infrastructure, police and fire protection, healthcare, and 
eldercare.
    The Tribe has developed positive working relationships with our 
neighboring counties of Elmore, Escambia, and Montgomery. We have 
engaged in dozens of MOUs and intergovernmental agreements with these 
and other local governments that have helped upgrade fire and rescue 
stations, conduct miles of road repairs and upgrades--including 
lighting installations, provide resources to improve health care and 
education, and much more. We are also the first responders for 15 miles 
north and south of the Reservation on Interstate 65. These agreements 
and services far exceed revenue from any potential tax receipts these 
neighboring governments would receive if our lands remained in fee. As 
Alabama Natives and Alabama Neighbors, we are driven to give back to 
these communities by our belief that working together and giving back 
makes us all stronger, together. We are proud that our neighboring 
Counties, mayors, and state representatives have pledged their support 
for S. 3263, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act. Attached to 
my written testimony is a letter of support from our neighboring local 
governments.
    We have been able to improve the economic condition of not only 
Poarch, Alabama, where we are headquartered, but also in other parts of 
the State. Our Tribe operates more than 40 companies that do work 
worldwide and generate 9,000 jobs. I am proud to say that we generate 
more than 4,000 jobs for families in Alabama. Beyond these enterprises, 
we also welcome people to visit our lands, especially the Magnolia 
Branch Wildlife Reserve, which welcomes 30,000 visitors annually. It is 
one of the prettiest places you can imagine to go fishing, tubing, 
horseback riding, and camping.
    We honor our blessings by giving back to local non-profits and 
community organizations. We donate nearly $8 million annually to local 
governments, educational institutions, health care systems, and other 
philanthropic causes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to 
give back to the State of Alabama with a $500,000 donation to the 
Alabama Department of Health for COVID-19 vaccine storage and 
administration. In fact, knowing how important protecting rural Alabama 
is to us, the State asked us to run clinics to vaccinate rural 
Alabamians.
    We have made careful decisions about how to best use our resources 
and property. However, we have a limited land base, and at this point, 
we are no longer able to meet the growing housing and many other needs 
of our nearly 2,900 citizens.
    For example, when it became clear we needed to expand our Boys and 
Girls club, we were forced to fill in the ponds around the community 
center because there was no more buildable land. The lack of trust land 
forced our Tribe to invest more than $1 million to fill in these ponds 
to expand the size of our Boys and Girls Club in 2018.
    As our population ages, the Tribal Council has prioritized 
providing the best healthcare and eldercare available. We have an 
Assisted Living Facility (ALF) but will soon need a nursing home. We do 
not have the current land available to provide this service, and the 
passage of S. 3263 will allow us to make this dream of a nursing home a 
reality. As our community grows, enhancing our governing land base is a 
not only a need, it is a must.
    We are not alone. Tribal governments nationwide have a shortage of 
usable land, and many--like us--have made land restoration a priority.
The Indian Reorganization Act: Restoration of the Tribal Government 
        Land Base
    This Committee has repeatedly examined the history of tribal 
government land tenure, documenting impacts of the federal policies of 
Removal, Allotment and forced Assimilation, and Termination, all of 
which displaced many tribal governments, leaving some completely 
landless. Former Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Chairman Byron 
Dorgan acknowledged that ``Tribes ceded close to 200 million acres of 
land during the treaty-making and removal periods prior to 1881. Tribes 
lost an additional 90 million acres through the Allotment period 
between 1881 and 1934.'' \12\

    The late Professor William Rice testified that:

        By 1934, Indian land ownership had been reduced . to 48,000,000 
        acres. But this did not tell the whole story. Even these 
        shocking figures were misleading. Of the 48,000,000 remaining 
        acres, some 20,000,000 acres were in unallotted reservations, 
        another 20,000,000 acres were desert or semi-desert lands, and 
        some 7,000,000 were in fractionated heirship status awaiting 
        sale to non-Indians. \13\

Tribal Homelands and Promote Self-Determination, S. Hrg. 112-113 at 14

Indian Affairs Committee hearings on the ``Wheeler-Howard Indian 
Reorganization Act'') (online at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/
CHRG-112shrg68389/pdf/CHRG-112shrg68389.pdf).

    The policy of forced Allotment and Assimilation (1881-1934) sought 
to destroy tribal governments by mandating the division of communally 
held tribal government homelands to individual tribal members. After 
allotments were made, remaining Indian lands were deemed ``surplus'' 
and opened to settlement. As noted above, the Allotment policy resulted 
in the taking of more than 90 million acres of Indian lands, and led to 
the checkerboard land ownership of many tribal communities and the land 
fractionation problems that continue to this day. Allotment and 
Assimilation also devastated tribal government economies, tribal 
culture, and indigenous social systems. \14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ Allotment and its authorized takings of ``surplus'' Indian 
lands stripped tribal governments of untold natural resources. In 
addition, the policy of Assimilation authorized the government to take 
Indian children from their homes, forcing them into federal boarding 
schools where they were forbidden from speaking their language or 
practicing their religion. We commend the Committee for advancing S. 
1723, which would establish a Truth and Healing Commission on Indian 
Boarding School Policies, and strongly support its final passage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, 
this Committee and your House counterpart have also frequently examined 
the history, purposes, and impacts of the Indian Reorganization Act of 
1934 (IRA). The primary purposes of the IRA were to put a stop to the 
unilateral allotment of Indian lands and to authorize the Interior 
Department to rebuild the tribal government land base. \15\ Section 5 
of the IRA provides:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ 25 U.S.C.   5101 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, in his 
discretion, to acquire through purchase, relinquishment, gift, 
exchange, or assignment, any interest in lands, water rights or surface 
rights to lands, within or without existing reservations, including 
trust or otherwise restricted allotments whether the allottee be living 
or deceased, for the purpose of providing land for Indians. \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ 25 U.S.C.  5108.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The IRA also sought to place a check on the often-unchecked 
authority of the Interior Department over local tribal government 
decisionmaking. To reverse the Allotment policy's efforts to undermine 
Tribal governments, Section 16 of the IRA sought to empower Tribes to 
organize their own governing structures by establishing Tribal 
constitutions and bylaws that fostered the enactment and enforcement of 
Tribal laws to govern their lands. \17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ See The IRA--75 Years Later: Renewing our Commitment to 
Restore Tribal Homelands and Promote Self-Determination, S. Hrg. 112-
113 at 15-16 (June 23, 2011) (statement of Prof. William Rice, quoting 
Indian Affairs Commissioner and architect of the IRA, John Collier, in 
his testimony before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in the run-
up to passage of the IRA: ``Paralleling this basic purpose [of 
reversing the allotment system] is another purpose just as basic. The 
bill stands on two legs. At present the Indian Bureau is a czar. It is 
an autocrat. It is an autocrat checked here and there by enactments of 
Congress; but, in the main, Congress has delegated to the Indian Office 
plenary control over Indian matters. It is a highly centralized 
autocratic absolutism. Furthermore, it is a bureaucratic absolutism.'')

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For 75 years, from 1934 to 2009, the Department of the Interior 
restored approximately 8 million acres of tribal government fee lands 
into trust status. Interior Departments of presidents of both political 
parties used the IRA to place land into trust for all federally 
recognized Indian tribes regardless of whether they were formally 
acknowledged as a tribe before or after 1934. Tribes have used their 
trust lands to build schools, health centers and housing to serve their 
communities. These lands are also used for tribal enterprises to 
promote economic development in mostly rural communities that are 
underserved and overlooked. \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ There is a common misperception that the Interior Department's 
fee to trust process serves to expand Indian gaming. The IRA authorizes 
Interior to place tribal government-owned fee land into trust and 
nothing more. State and local governments are notified and have an 
opportunity to comment and work with the Tribe to negotiate agreements 
to address any concerns with pending trust land applications. Nothing 
in the IRA authorizes or regulates Indian gaming, which is 
comprehensively regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, NIGC 
regulations, the Interior Department's Part 292 regulations, and the 
compact review process. The question of whether Indian trust lands are 
eligible to be used for gaming is governed solely by IGRA and the NIGC 
and Interior Department regulations developed to implement that 
separate law. Admittedly, some Tribes do submit land into trust 
applications for gaming purposes. However, those relatively few 
applications must not only meet the requirements of the IRA's Part 151 
regulations, but they must also separately meet the requirements of the 
Interior Department's Part 292 IGRA regulations. As former Assistant 
Secretary Kevin Washburn noted, of the 1,300 trust acquisitions 
submitted to Interior from 2008-2013, fewer than 15 were for gaming 
purposes. See testimony of Kevin Washburn before the House Resources 
Committee's Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs, at 2 
(Sept. 19, 2013) (online at https://naturalresources.house.gov/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2009 Carcieri v. Salazar Decision and its Impacts
    The Supreme Court, in Carcieri v. Salazar, reversed these 75 years 
of practice and precedent. The Court tied the Interior Secretary's IRA 
Section 5 authority to place land into trust for Indian tribes to the 
Act's definition of ``Indian'', which provides that:

        The term `Indian' as used in this Act shall include all persons 
        of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian 
        tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are 
        descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing 
        within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and 
        shall further include all other persons of one-half or more 
        Indian blood. \19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ 25 U.S.C.  5129 (emphasis added).

    The Court held ``that the term `now under Federal jurisdiction' in 
[the IRA] unambiguously refers to those tribes that were under the 
federal jurisdiction of the United States when the IRA was enacted in 
1934.'' However, Court's decision provided no guidance to determine the 
meaning of the phrase ``under federal jurisdiction'', and nothing in 
the text of the IRA or its legislative history defines that phrase.
    In this Committee's first Carcieri-related hearing, former Chairman 
Dorgan acknowledged ., ``I just want to say that I am concerned about 
the court's decision in Carcieri and the impact it may have on those 
tribes that were recognized after 1934. I believe that Congress will 
likely need to act to clarify this issue for tribes and to ensure that 
the land in trust process is available to all tribes regardless of when 
they were recognized.'' \20\ He predicted that the decision could 
impact hundreds of tribes by: slowing the land-into-trust process; 
leading to costly litigation over the status of Indian lands; 
complicating criminal jurisdiction in Indian country; hindering 
economic development; and creating two classes of Indian tribes. \21\ 
Sadly, each of these predictions have come true.

Costly and Time-Consuming Litigation
    We know the effects of the Carcieri decision all too well. Our 
Tribe has been forced to defend the status of our trust lands in 
several federal court cases. In 2013, the State of Alabama relied on a 
Carcieri-based argument in seeking to enjoin federally approved gaming 
on Poarch Creek trust lands. The United States, while not named as a 
defendant in the proceedings, filed amicus curiae briefs in support of 
the Tribe's successful motion to dismiss the case and again when the 
State unsuccessfully appealed dismissal of its claims to the Eleventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals. \22\ While both the trial and appellate 
courts rejected the State of Alabama's Carcieri challenge, the Tribe 
was forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and the federal 
government was forced to devote limited attorney resources to secure 
that result.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ Alabama v. PCI Gaming Auth., 801 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Similarly, the Tribe was forced to file its own federal lawsuit in 
2015 in response to the Escambia County, Alabama, tax assessor's 
attempt to assess state taxes on Poarch Creek trust lands in erroneous 
reliance on the Carcieri decision. The Tribe again prevailed before the 
federal district court and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, with 
the United States filing an appellate amicus curiae brief in support of 
the Tribe's position. \23\ And once again, Poarch Creek and the United 
States were forced to devote limited, valuable time and other resources 
to litigating spurious claims that resulted directly from the 
uncertainty generated by the Carcieri decision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Hildreth, 656 F. App'x 934 
(11th Cir. 2016).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These are but two examples. We have seen specious Carcieri 
arguments raised in numerous other cases filed in state and federal 
courts, many of which have nothing whatsoever to do with the trust 
status of Poarch Creek lands, but where the Carcieri argument is 
nonetheless raised either out of lack of understanding or in an attempt 
to extort an unwarranted settlement from the Tribe.
    The impacts of Carcieri of course go far beyond our Tribe. Many 
dozens of cases making Carcieri-based arguments have been filed in 
federal and state courts by state and local governments and individuals 
throughout the United States. In addition, the Interior Board of Indian 
Appeals has been bogged down for more than 15 years now with Carcieri-
related challenges to the BIA's IRA fee to trust decisions. \24\ It is 
difficult to fathom the hours and legal fees related to these cases, 
not only to the tribal governments forced to defend the attacks on 
their land, but also to the teams of attorneys at the U.S. Department 
of the Interior's Solicitor's Office and the U.S. Department of 
Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thankfully, every court reviewing the issue has upheld the Interior 
Department's decisions to place our land in trust. However, these 
lawsuits have taken a toll, and that is why our Tribe is seeking a 
legislative solution that will provide us with long needed legal 
certainty.
Two Classes of Tribes
    In addition, as Senator Dorgan anticipated, the Carcieri decision 
has created two classes of tribes: those able to prove that they were 
``under federal jurisdiction'' in 1934, and those that cannot. This 
result directly conflicts with Congress' 1994 amendments to the IRA, 
which mandated that all federally recognized Indian tribes be treated 
the same for all purposes under the Act.
    The 1994 amendments were passed in direct reaction to efforts at 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs to use Section 16 of the IRA to classify 
Indian tribes as being either ``created'' or ``historic''. Senator John 
McCain, then Vice Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, offered the 
amendment, in part, in response to the BIA's treatment of the Pascua 
Yaqui Tribe of Arizona. In his floor statement that led to passage of 
the amendment, Senator McCain shared the following:

        According to the Department, created tribes are only authorized 
        to exercise such powers of self-governance as the Secretary may 
        confer on them. . . I can find no basis in law or policy for 
        the manner in which section 16 has been interpreted by the 
        Department of the Interior. . .

        The recognition of an Indian tribe by the Federal Government is 
        just that-the recognition that there is a sovereign entity with 
        governmental authority which predates the U.S. Constitution and 
        with which the Federal Government has established formal 
        relations. Over the years, the Federal Government has extended 
        recognition to Indian tribes through treaties, executive 
        orders, a course of dealing, decisions of the Federal courts, 
        acts of Congress and administrative action. Regardless of the 
        method by which recognition was extended, all Indian tribes 
        enjoy the same relationship with the United States and exercise 
        the same inherent authority. All that section 16 was intended 
        to do was to provide a mechanism for the tribes to interact 
        with other governments in our Federal system in a form familiar 
        to those governments through tribal adoption and Secretarial 
        approval of tribal constitutions for those Indian tribes that 
        choose to employ its provisions.

        Clearly the interpretation of section 16 which has been 
        developed by the Department is inconsistent with the 
        [principal] policies underlying the IRA, which were to 
        stabilize Indian [tribal] governments and to encourage self-
        government. These policies have taken on additional vitality in 
        the last 20 years as the Congress has repudiated and repealed 
        the policy of termination and enacted the Indian Self-
        Determination and Education Assistance Act and the Tribal Self-
        Governance Demonstration Project. The effect of the 
        Department's interpretation of section 16 has been to 
        destabilize Indian tribal governments and to hinder self-
        governance of the Department's unilateral and often arbitrary 
        decisions about which powers of self-governance a tribal 
        government can exercise. \25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \25\ 140 Cong. Rec. 11234 (May 19, 1994).

    Senator Inouye, then-Chair of the Committee, who also co-sponsored 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the amendment, made the following statement to clarify its purpose:

        [O]ur amendment will correct any instance where any federally 
        recognized Indian tribe has been classified as `created' and 
        that it will prohibit such classifications from being imposed 
        or used in the future. Our amendment makes it clear that it is 
        and has always been Federal law and policy that Indian tribes 
        recognized by the Federal Government stand on an equal footing 
        to each other and to the Federal Government. . .. Each 
        federally recognized Indian tribe is entitled to the same 
        privileges and immunities as other federally recognized tribes 
        and has the right to exercise the same inherent and delegated 
        authorities. This is true without regard to the manner in which 
        the Indian tribe became recognized by the United States or 
        whether it has chosen to organize under the IRA. By enacting 
        this amendment to section 16 of the IRA, we will provide the 
        stability for Indian tribal governments that the Congress 
        thought it was providing 60 years ago when the IRA was enacted. 
        \26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ 140 Cong. Rec. 11235 (May 19, 1994).

    The amendment, enacted on May 31, 1994, added subsections (f) and 
(g) to the Section 16 of the IRA. Subsection (f), titled ``Privileges 
and Immunities of Indian Tribes'' prohibited all federal agencies from 
promulgating regulations or making decisions ``that classifies, 
enhances, or diminishes the privileges and immunities available to the 
Indian tribe relative to other federally recognized tribes by virtue of 
their status as Indian tribes.'' Subsection (g) accomplished this same 
goal, but retroactively, by proclaiming that any regulation or 
administrative decision that treated tribal governments in a disparate 
manner ``shall have no force or effect.'' \27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \27\ P.L. 103-263 (May 31, 1994), codified at 25 U.S.C.  5123(f), 
(g). Given the background of Section 16 of the IRA detailed by 
Professor Rice, it is beyond comprehension why or how the Interior 
Department undertook this effort.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of many tragic results of the Carcieri decision is that it has 
breathed life back into this misguided argument that Tribal governments 
are either ``historic'' or ``created''. Former Assistant Secretary for 
Indian Affairs, Kevin Washburn, testifying in his capacity as a 
Professor of the University of Iowa College of Law, attempted to refute 
this line of thinking:
    Since the 1990s, there has been a requirement that each year the 
Federal Government publish the list of tribes that are recognized. It 
would have been nice if we had had that in 1934. That would have saved 
a lot of this work for tribes. But the fact is there is no tribe that 
exists today that did not exist in 1934. We don't create tribes out of 
whole cloth in this country. We spend a lot of time working on the 
reformation of that tribal recognition process, and those tribes have 
always existed and so they deserve to have land if they have existed. 
So, I would respectfully urge the Committee to try to move H.R. 375 
through the House. \28\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Attempts to Address the CarcieriDecision
    In the wake of the Carcieri decision, the Interior Department was 
forced to make determinations of whether a Tribe that filed an IRA 
application to place land into trust was under federal jurisdiction on 
a case-by-case basis. Tribal governments were given little guidance 
about what factors would be considered in this determination.
    To provide Tribes and the public with some guidance, the Interior 
Department's Office of the Solicitor issued an official M-Opinion on 
March 12, 2014 that provided a framework of how the agency would 
determine whether an Indian tribe was ``under federal jurisdiction'' in 
1934 for purposes of the administrative fee to trust process. The M-
Opinion set forth a two-part test. The first factor requires a 
sufficient showing that ``the United States had, in 1934 or at some 
point in the tribe's history prior to 1934, an action or series of 
actions--through a course of dealings or other relevant acts for or on 
behalf of the tribe or in some instance tribal members--that are 
sufficient to establish, or that generally reflect federal obligations, 
duties, responsibility for or authority over the tribe by the Federal 
government.'' The second question is to ``ascertain whether the tribe's 
jurisdictional status remained intact in 1934.'' \29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \29\ The Meaning of Under Federal Jurisdiction for Purposes of the 
Indian Reorganization Act, M-37029 at 19 (Mar. 12, 2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While the M-Opinion provided some needed transparency to the land 
into trust process post-Carcieri, it required attorneys and historians 
from both the applicant Tribe and the Interior Department. Some ``under 
federal jurisdiction'' determinations took years to achieve. Often, 
when a land into trust decision was finalized pursuant to the M-
Opinion, the Tribe had to wait additional years for the land to be 
placed into trust by wading through the federal court process. However, 
federal courts have generally upheld Interior's determinations pursuant 
to the 2014 M-Opinion.
    On March 9, 2020, then-Solicitor Daniel Jorjani issued a new M-
Opinion withdrawing the 2014 M-Opinion, replacing it with two 
memoranda. The first examines the recognition and jurisdiction elements 
of the phrase ``any recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction''. 
The second established a four-part test that replaced the test 
established in the 2014 M-Opinion. Step 1 acknowledged that if Congress 
enacted a law after 1934 making Section 5 of the IRA applicable to the 
Tribe, then no ``under federal jurisdiction'' determination would be 
necessary. \30\ In the absence of post-IRA legislation, Step 2 required 
a Tribe to show evidence that it was subject to ``the federal 
government's administration of its Indian affairs authority with 
respect to that particular group of Indians.'' If there is sufficient 
evidence ``presumptively demonstrat[ing]'' federal jurisdiction, the 
trust acquisition may proceed. Step 3 required a Tribe to show that it 
was recognized prior to 1934 and remained under federal jurisdiction in 
1934. Examples meeting Step 3 include ``ratified treaties still in 
effect in 1934; tribe-specific Executive Orders; tribe-specific 
legislation, including termination legislation enacted after 1934, 
which acknowledges the existence of a government-to-government 
relationship with a tribe at the time it is enacted.'' \31\ If a Tribe 
did not meet Steps 1-3, Step Four asks whether the ``totality of an 
applicant tribe's nondispositive evidence. . .is sufficient to show 
that the tribe was `recognized' in or before 1934 and remained `under 
federal jurisdiction' through 1934 [notwithstanding gaps in the 
historical record].'' Step 4 also stated that applicant tribes 
recognized after 1934 or acknowledged after 1978 under the 
administrative procedures at Part 83 could also show evidence of 
``political-legal `recognition' in or before 1934.'' \32\

Regulatory Improvements to the Land into Trust Process
    Recognizing the limited shelf life of Interior M-Opinions, in 
October of 2021, the Interior Department initiated an effort to amend 
its Part 151 regulations that implement the IRA's Section 5 land into 
trust provision. On December 12, 2023, the Interior Department 
published a final rule to amend these regulations governing the 
discretionary acquisition of tribal fee to trust applications at 25 
C.F.R. Part 151. \33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \33\ Land Acquisitions, 88 Fed. Reg. 86,222 (Dec. 12, 2023) (to be 
codified at 25 C.F.R. pt. 151).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is the first substantive update of the administrative Tribal 
fee into trust process since 1995. The regulatory changes streamline 
the land into trust process by establishing a 120-day deadline for the 
Department to make a final determination on trust land applications. 
Importantly, the new regulation establishes criteria for a Tribal 
Government's eligibility to use the regulation by clarifying the 
Department's process to determine whether a Tribe was ``under federal 
jurisdiction'' in 1934, as required by the Supreme Court's Carcieri 
decision. \34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \34\ In October 2021, Interior held Tribal Leader consultation 
sessions that discussed the need to improve the administrative process 
to restore tribal homelands. On March 28, 2022, the Department released 
draft revisions to Part 151, and held four Tribal Leader consultations, 
which led to a proposed rule that was published on December 6, 2022. 
The Interior Department held several consultations on the proposed 
rule, and accepted verbal and written comments through March 1, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Our Tribe truly appreciates the Interior Department's efforts to 
improve the administrative land into trust process, and we fully 
support these changes. While the updated regulations make the process 
for a Tribe to prove that it was ``under federal jurisdiction'' much 
clearer, the updated process still requires teams of attorneys and 
historians from both the Tribe and the Interior Department to navigate 
through the regulatory process. If the prior M-Opinions are any 
indication, even the streamlined process could take years to come to 
resolution.
    In addition, we remain concerned that the regulations will be the 
subject of future litigation. Just as the Department's recent land into 
trust decisions made pursuant to the various M-Opinions have been 
challenged in court, decisions made pursuant to the updated regulations 
will likewise be challenged. The ensuing legal process will also take 
many years to achieve a final ruling. The legal challenges will most 
likely start at the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, which is already 
backlogged with dozens of tribal trust land acquisition appeals and 
faces a number of administrative judicial vacancies. Claims will then 
have to wind their way through the federal district and appellate 
courts, again consuming countless hours and resources.
    As a result, our Tribe is taking what for us is a new approach to 
addressing our government's need for additional trust lands by working 
with our congressional delegation and nearby local governments to gain 
support and passage of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act, 
which would clarify that our Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 
1934 for purposes of the IRA. Our approach is consistent with the 
Interior Department's updated land to trust regulations and both past 
and recent precedent in Congress.
    Section 151.4(b) of Interior's updated regulation clarifies that if 
Congress enacted legislation after 1934 making the IRA's land into 
trust provisions applicable to a specific Tribe, no ``under federal 
jurisdiction'' analysis is needed. Section 151.4(b) of the final rule 
provides,

        (b) For some Tribes, Congress enacted legislation after 1934 
        making the IRA applicable to the Tribe. The existence of such 
        legislation making the IRA and its trust acquisition provisions 
        applicable to a Tribe eliminates the need to determine whether 
        a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934. \35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While this approach may seem novel or new, it simply follows the 
approach that Congress has taken since the 1970s for a number of Tribes 
that were restored to federal recognition through an act of Congress.

    February 24, 2024, marked the 15-year anniversary of the Carcieri

every year for the past 15 years. \37\ With some minor differences, 
each of these bills sought to amend the IRA to eliminate the phrase 
``under federal jurisdiction'' and clarify that the IRA's land to trust 
provision applies to all federally recognized Indian tribes. The House 
of Representatives passed a national Carcieri fix in the 116th and 
117th Congresses with broad bipartisan support each time under

    The Poarch Band of Creek Indians has been one of the leading 
advocates for a national ``Carcieri fix.'' Today, I again offer our 
full support of Senator Tester's bipartisan bill, S. 563, which would 
accomplish this goal.
    In the 118th Congress, however, we are seeking a parallel track 
that is similar to the strategy taken by dozens of Tribes who have 
worked with their congressional delegation to enact bills to mandate 
fee-to-trust actions, reaffirm trust lands, or clarify that the IRA 
applies to their individual tribe. \39\ We are grateful to Senator 
Britt for introducing the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act, S. 
3263, which would clarify that the IRA's land-into-trust process 
applies to our Tribe. S. 3263 will enable us to work with the Interior 
Department and local governments restore and protect our lands to meet 
the acute needs of our growing community. This bill is targeted and 
tailored, and it has the strong support of the Alabama congressional 
delegation and the cities and counties surrounding our trust land.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \39\ See e.g., NDAA for FY'2020, P.L. 116-92 (Dec. 20, 2019) (as 
enacted included the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians Land 
Affirmation Act ( 2868), the Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act ( 2869), 
the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act ( 2870));

Reaffirmation Act, P.L. 113-590 (July 30, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I respectfully ask the Committee to bring S. 3263 to a markup and 
advance the bill to final passage in the 118th Congress. On behalf of 
the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, I am honored to speak to you today, 
and I am happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you.

    Attachment

    On behalf of the undersigned, we write in strong support of the 
Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act, legislation to clarify the 
Land Into Trust Process for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians (Tribe.)
    The Tribe is a major economic driver in our counties and cities and 
throughout Alabama, and employs over 3500 Alabamians, 90 percent of 
whom are not Tribal members. Additionally, with over 2,700 enrolled 
Poarch Creek tribal members who are citizens of our state, we feel a 
duty to do our small part to ensure the Tribe can exercise its inherent 
sovereignty to provide for future generations.
    This legislation is necessary because the Supreme Court ruled in 
2009 that the Department of Interior's (DOI's) tribal fee-to-trust 
authority is limited to only those tribal governments that were ``under 
federal jurisdiction'' as of June 18, 1934, the date of enactment of 
the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). DOI has struggled to consistently 
define the term ``under federal jurisdiction.'' The term ``under 
federal jurisdiction'' is not defined in the IRA and there is no 
legislative history to discern congressional intent of the term. Since 
2009, DOI has relied on multiple Solicitor M-opinions to determine 
whether a tribe is under federal jurisdiction. This ambiguity has made 
the process subject to litigation based on unfounded legal claims and 
has resulted in heavy legal/administrative burdens for tribes. As such, 
the Tribe has been subjected to unnecessary litigation over the status 
of its lands since 2009. Further, the U.S. must commit significant 
resources from the Departments of Justice and Interior to do archival 
analysis, legal research, and litigation support for these decisions at 
great taxpayer expense.
    Fortunately, the Tribe has prevailed in these cases, but these 
constant attacks have taken an unnecessary toll on the Tribe--stalling 
development for improved housing, health care, and other essential 
services to the community. The Tribe is a great community partner, and 
it is important that we support their efforts to correct this legal 
ambiguity. This legislation would allow the Tribe to strengthen its 
capacity to better provide for its nation and the surrounding 
communities. We offer our full support of the Poarch Band of Creek 
Indians Parity Act.

STATEMENT OF HON. ANDY MEJIA, CHAIRPERSON, LYTTON RANCHERIA OF 
                           CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Mejia. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair 
Murkowski and members of the Committee on Indian Affairs. My 
name is Andy Mejia, Chairperson of the Lytton Rancheria of 
California, a tribe based in Sonoma County.
    Thank you for allowing me to be here today to speak in 
support of S. 4000, a technical amendment to reaffirm that the 
Indian Reorganization Act applies to the tribe. I would like to 
thank Senator Padilla for introducing this bill and for his 
work on behalf of Indian Country.
    If enacted, S. 4000 would only clarify the intent of 
previous legislation and confirm that the Lytton Rancheria is 
able to take land into trust for the administrative process as 
other tribes nationwide and in Sonoma County are able to do. 
The bill itself does not take any lands into trust, but only 
makes explicit that the tribe is able to go through the 
Department of Interior's approval process.
    On behalf of the members of the Lytton Rancheria of 
California, I ask that you support S. 4000.
    In 1995, Madam Chairwoman Marge Mejia was elected 
Chairperson of the Rancheria of California Tribe. She was my 
mother. At that point in time, we were a landless and penniless 
tribe. Madam Chairwoman had three promises during her tenure, 
that was self-sufficiency, land, and housing. The promise of 
self-sufficiency was accomplished by establishing San Pablo 
Lytton Casino in the City of San Pablo, California, which is 
one of the most successful Class II gaming facilities in the 
Nation.
    Due to the success of the San Pablo Lytton Casino, and 
under Madam Chairwoman's leadership, the tribe has been able to 
purchase almost 3,000 acres of land in Sonoma County, of that 
3,000 acres, 800 acres being high-end vineyard.
    Madam Chairwoman fought tirelessly for 12 years to take 511 
acres into trust to build a 146-home housing development and 
fulfill her last promise to the tribe. In 2019, that 511 acres 
was taken into trust through the legislative process, and 
construction began in January of 2020.
    On October 19th, 2022, Madam Chairwoman, my mom, passed 
away unexpectedly at the age of 66. It truly breaks my heart 
that my mom is not here to enjoy the fruits of her hard work, 
dedication, sacrifice, and the legacy she leaves behind after 
her 27-year tenure. No tribe should have to spend 12 years 
taking land into trust.
    Construction of the Lytton Homeland was completed this 
January. It is a very pinnacle moment for our tribe as we 
navigate through the process of bringing tribal member families 
back to their aboriginal land.
    The Lytton Rancheria has become a prime example of all that 
the IRA can do for Indian Country. We presently only ask to be 
placed on the same footing as other federally recognized 
tribes. This bill makes explicit that the IRA applies to the 
tribe and does not itself take any land into trust but only 
allows the tribe to apply through Interior's land-into-trust 
process as neighboring tribes were able to do.
    Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Mejia follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Andy Mejia, Chairperson, Lytton Rancheria of 
                               California
    I am thankful for the opportunity to present testimony to the 
Committee on a bill that would have a significant impact on the 
citizens of the Lytton Rancheria of California, a federally recognized 
Pomo Tribe from the San Francisco Bay area. My name is Andy Mejia, and 
I am the Tribe's Chairperson.
    The Pomo people historically resided in lands across northern 
California. Our ancestors were subsequently devastated by the Gold 
Rush, and hostile government policies in the 19th Century. By the early 
1900's the surviving Pomo peoples were poverty stricken, landless and 
homeless. As a result of the harrowing condition of California's 
Indians, Congress enacted legislation to help purchase reservation 
lands for many of them. The Lytton Rancheria was one such tribe, which 
then received reservation lands in Sonoma County.
    Unfortunately, the Tribe was subjected to additional hardships when 
the Federal Government wrongfully terminated the rancheria on April 4, 
1961. The Tribe subsequently lost all of its rancheria lands and once 
again became destitute and landless, with no means of supporting 
itself.
    In 1991, our Tribe, after decades of fighting to regain our 
recognition, received a welcome development when a federal court 
concluded the termination was unlawful and ordered the government to 
reverse its decision to terminate the Tribe and to restore our Tribal 
status. The Stipulated Judgment which did so contained a provision 
which reads, ``. . .that the distributees of the Lytton Rancheria are 
eligible for all rights and benefits extended to Indians under the 
Constitution and laws of the United States; and that the Lytton Indian 
Community and its members shall be eligible for all rights and benefits 
extended to other federally recognized Indian tribes and their 
members,. . .``
    While the Tribe's status was restored, its land base, now owned by 
non-Indians, was not returned to us and the Tribe remained landless and 
impoverished. Subsequently, after due consideration and with strong 
local support, Congress in 2000, passed legislation directing the 
Secretary of the Interior to take certain land into trust for gaming 
purposes for the Tribe in San Pablo, California. The bill declared that 
the land was part of the reservation of the Tribe under Sections 5 and 
7 of the IRA. The Tribe then established a small, successful Class II 
gaming operation. Since its establishment, the Tribe's casino in San 
Pablo has been the cornerstone of a fruitful and mutually beneficial 
relationship between the City of San Pablo and the Lytton Rancheria. As 
a result, our Tribal members have realized significant benefits 
including improved housing and educational opportunities for our 
children, and medical care for our elders.
    With the revenues from the casino, the Tribe also began purchasing 
property near and within our original rancheria. We did so in order to 
diversify our economic development and to potentially provide a future 
homeland for our members, as the 9.5-acre San Pablo trust parcel is 
only large enough for the gaming facility and could not meet our 
housing needs. The Tribe's current economic development includes 
various viniculture projects where the Tribe has invested in previously 
deteriorating vineyards, with a focus on environmental responsibility 
and stabi lity. Many of the Tribe's vineyards and grapes are now being 
used to produce high-quality wines.
    Throughout this time period, the Lytton Rancheria has continued to 
be good neighbors to our local non-Indian communities. In San Pablo, 
the Tribe provides approximately 60 percent of the City's operating 
budget and donates to many local charities. This includes a golf 
tournament the Tribe sponsors providing nearly $100,000 annually. The 
Tribe has also donated millions of dollars to children's charities and 
arts programs in Sonoma County as well as to the Sonoma Indian Health 
Clinic, which offers healthcare to all Native Americans residing in 
Sonoma County, regardless of tribal affiliation.
    In the time since our restoration, the Tribe has persisted in 
efforts to re-establish a homeland for our members. This culminated in 
the passage of the Lytton Homelands Act in 2019. This legislation 
directed the federal government to take some of the land purchased by 
the Tribe into trust, primarily for tribal housing. In order to pass 
this legislation, we worked hard to develop agreements and 
understandings with local non-Indian communities. These agreements with 
Sonoma County, the Windsor Fire Protection District, and the Windsor 
Unified School District reflect our commitment to work with local 
governments in a mutually respectful manner and we appreciate the 
support that they and the State of California provided to the 2019 
legislation.
    Since the passage of the legislation, we have completed the 
development of the initial phases of our tribal housing project and 
moved 146 tribal households onto the Lytton Rancheria. For the first 
time since our termination, we are able to live together on our tribal 
homeland.
    However, it was never intended that the land taken into trust by 
the 2019 legislation would be the final trust acquisition for the 
Tribe, as the Tribe will need additional trust lands as it continues to 
grow. In fact, the 2019 legislation contemplates that the Tribe would 
have future lands taken into trust and includes an agreed-to ban on 
gaming on such lands in Sonoma County. The Tribe has subsequently 
sought to take additional lands into trust via the administrative 
process to support the needs of our growing community. These lands, 
which we own, are contiguous to and surrounding the current homeland. 
Unfortunately, despite the ability of neighboring Tribes with similar 
histories, to do so, and the 2000 and 2019 pieces of legislation, which 
already explicitly and implicitly extend the IRA to the Tribe, we have 
been unable to get an opinion from the Interior Department on our 
ability to do so, and thus have been unable to proceed with our 
application. With S. 4000, the Tribe only seeks to make explicit our 
ability to go through the administrative process. This would not give 
us any special treatment and would merely place us on equal standing 
with other tribes throughout the country and in Sonoma County.
    The Tribe has previously agreed not to conduct gaming within the 
county of Sonoma, pursuant to the terms contained in our Memorandum of 
Agreement with the county and further, the Tribe is also prohibited 
from doing so by the 2019 legislation. That being said, land is 
essential for tribes to function as governments. Tribal trust lands are 
especially important to this advancement. Tribes need trust lands so 
that they can provide governmental services for their members, whether 
it be for housing, health care, education, or economic development. 
Having such lands in trust provides us with the necessary 
infrastructure and planning to provide for future generations and 
allows us to protect our historic, cultural and religious ties to our 
homeland.
    This Committee has been supportive of the Tribe in the past and the 
Lytton Rancheria continues to be grateful for that. Additionally, we 
are tremendously proud of our homeland and the community we have been 
able to re-build on it. All members of the Committee are welcome to 
visit and receive a tour.
    With S. 4000 we only ask to be placed on the same footing as other 
federally recognized tribes. This bill does not itself take any land 
into trust, but makes clear that the IRA extends to the Tribe and that 
we are therefore able to apply through the Department of the Interior's 
land into trust process, just as neighboring tribes are able to do. We 
are willing and able to answer any and all questions.

    The Chairman. Thank you, Chairman. I am sorry for the loss 
of your mother, and may her memory be a blessing.
    Chairman Whiteclay, thank you for being here. Please 
proceed.

  STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK WHITECLAY, CHAIRMAN, CROW NATION OF 
                            MONTANA

    Mr. Whiteclay. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, 
Vice Chair Murkowski, honorable members of the Senate Committee 
on Indian Affairs. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    I am Frank Whiteclay. I am Chairman of the Crow Nation, 
home to approximately 7,500 of the total 14,350-plus members of 
the Crow Tribe.
    The Crow Tribe negotiated a water compact with the State of 
Montana that was adopted by the Montana legislature in 1999 
that provides water from surface flow, groundwater, and storage 
for the Crow Tribe and protects all State and tribal current 
water users in the State, and future water users in the 
compact.
    The compact was ratified by the Crow Water Rights 
Settlement Act of 2010, and the Act also provides for the 
rehabilitation and improvement of the Crow Irrigation Project, 
a project owned and operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
construction of municipal, rural and industrial water systems 
for the delivery of clean drinking water, provides tribal water 
rights for tribes, the tribe and allottees, identifies storage 
of water in the Big Horn Lake of 300,000 acre-feet per year in 
addition to the 500,000 acre-feet in the Big Horn and all 
groundwater on the Crow reservation. It provides an exclusive 
right of the tribe to develop and market power generation on 
the Yellowtail Afterbay Dam.
    I am here to support the amendments on S. 4442, the 
amendments to the Act to revise it from a project-based 
settlement to a fund-based settlement that will allow 
flexibility on delivery of clean water. The Amendments Act will 
extend the upcoming deadline on the exclusive right to develop 
the power generation project.
    The tribe completed engineering for the water intake 
facility on the Big Horn in 2022, and advertised bids for 
construction. We received no bidders. This led the tribe to 
reconsider the viability of the MR&I system pipeline. We 
identified the following concerns.
    The pipeline construction was approximately 20 years, at a 
cost of $400 billion plus, with an expectation that estimated 
construction costs will rise, which they did with the supply 
chain rise in materials, likely resulting in a shortfall to 
complete construction. Pipeline construction will be daunting 
with the size of the reservation, 2.4 million acres across 
varying geographical features.
    The pipeline construction timeframe would result in a 
lengthy delay of water delivery for reservation communities, 
and some communities would wait many years for clear drinking 
water, and others would not receive it at all. The water 
settlement included a finite amount for operation, maintenance 
and replacement costs, which other water settlements have in 
perpetuity, operation and maintenance costs.
    The Water Settlement Act did not include a mandatory hookup 
for households along the pipeline, leaving the number of actual 
customers unknown. However, if a tribal household was hooked up 
to a pipeline, monthly consumer costs to cover operational 
costs would be approximately $120 per month in today's dollars, 
which would burden an already impoverished reservation 
household.
    Private landowners were unwilling to grant temporary 
permits to cross lands for water sampling and testing for 
placement of the water intake unit closer to reservation 
communities, which resulted in moving the intake to tribal 
lands at the Yellowtail Afterbay location, much farther from 
the reservation's larger communities.
    The Environmental Protection Agency expressed concerns to 
the BOR in a letter dated October 31st, 2022, with the location 
of the intake unit resulting in a water age concern for most 
customers, and the proposed use of complex chemicals for 
treatment that would necessitate operators with advanced 
certification requirements. The tribe is proposing to move the 
funds into a trust account for Federal management which would 
draw upon approval to develop clean water.
    On behalf of the Crow tribal membership, I am hopeful that 
the Crow Water Settlement Amendment Act will be adopted in this 
Congressional session.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Whiteclay follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Frank Whiteclay, Chairman, Crow Nation of 
                                Montana
    Good Afternoon, Honorable Members of the Senate Committee on Indian 
Affairs. I am Frank Whiteclay, Chairman of the Crow Nation of Montana, 
and I am honored to present this testimony in support of the Crow Water 
Settlement Amendments Act, Senate Bill 4442. I would like to thank 
Senator Tester and Senator Daines for their co-sponsorship of this 
important legislation for the Crow Nation.
    The Crow Tribe proposed these amendments to the Crow Water Rights 
Settlement Act of 2010 to amend the Act from a project specific Act to 
a fund based settlement Act that is consistent with more recent Indian 
water rights settlements and provides flexibility for clean water 
delivery systems.
Background
    The Crow Reservation, formally established pursuant to the Fort 
Laramie Treaty of 1868, is located in southeast Montana, and currently 
encompasses 2.3 million acres with three mountain ranges, significant 
range lands, dry farm and irrigated lands with numerous water sources 
originating on and off the reservation. Approximately 7500 Crow Tribal 
members reside on the Reservation and approximately 1500 non-Indian 
residents possess state-adjudicated water rights throughout the 
reservation with the majority along the Big Horn River.
    The Bureau of Indian Affairs constructed the Crow Irrigation System 
in the early 1900's to enhance agricultural efforts on the Crow 
Reservation through irrigation of farmlands along the Big Horn River, 
Little Bighorn River, Pryor Creek and Lodge Grass Creek. A significant 
portion of lands along the irrigation systems are in non-Indian fee 
ownership.
    The Crow Tribe negotiated a Water Compact with the State of Montana 
Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission that was ratified by the 
Montana Legislature in a special session in June 1999. The Compact:

  <bullet> provides water from surface flow, groundwater and storage 
        for the Crow Tribe for existing and future Tribal water needs.

  <bullet> Provides protection for all state and Tribal current water 
        uses in the affected water basins from the Tribe's future 
        exercise of its water rights; also protects the local 
        conservation districts' right to future water use.

  <bullet> Creates an administrative process for resolution of any 
        future disputes between Tribal and non-Tribal water users.

Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010
    The Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010 ratifies, 
authorizes, and confirms the water rights 1999 Compact between the Crow 
Tribe and the state of Montana and provides for: (1) the Tribe to 
rehabilitate and improve the Crow Irrigation Project; and (2) the Tribe 
and Reclamation to construct the municipal, rural, and industrial water 
system; (3) provides tribal water rights for the tribe and allottees; 
(4) provides for leasing and selling of water with federal approval; 
(5) identifies 300,000 acre-feet per year of water stored in Bighorn 
Lake, Yellowtail Unit, Lower Bighorn Division, Pick Sloan Missouri 
Basin Program, for the Tribe in addition to the allocation of 500,000 
acre-feet per year in the Big Horn and all groundwater on the Crow 
Reservation; and (6) provides the exclusive right of the Tribe to 
develop and market power generation on the Yellowtail Afterbay Dam.
    The Crow Tribe proposed Amendments to the Crow Tribe Water Rights 
Settlement Act of 2010 to create a fund for water delivery purposes and 
related uses, to revise the management of the funds allocated for the 
Crow Irrigation Improvement Projects, and to extend the deadline for 
right to develop and market power generation at the Yellowtail Afterbay 
Dam.
Municipal, Rural, and Industrial Water System
    The Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010 (Act) ratified 
and confirmed the 1999 Crow Tribe/State of Montana Water Rights Compact 
and directed the Secretary, through the Bureau of Reclamation, to 
design and construct a Municipal, Rural, and Industrial (MRI) water 
system through an agreement with the Tribe. Section 403 of the Act 
specifically described the MRI system as ``raw water intake, water 
treatment plant, pipelines, storage tanks, pumping stations, pressure 
reducing valves, electrical transmission facility and other items.'' 
The Tribe has spent the last 10 years designing the pipeline project as 
specifically described in the Act.
    In 2022, 10 years after the enforcement date of the Water 
Settlement, engineering work for the MRI system water intake unit at 
the Yellowtail afterbay was completed and the project was advertised 
for bids. However, no bids were received due to the complexity of the 
project and the requirement for specialized divers for underwater 
construction. Following this setback, the Tribe reviewed the overall 
MRI project plan and identified the following concerns with the MRI 
project as specifically described in the Water Settlement Act of 2010.

  <bullet> The pipeline construction timeframe was approximately 20 
        years at a cost of $400 million plus with an expectation that 
        estimated construction costs will rise, likely resulting in a 
        shortfall to complete construction. Pipeline construction would 
        be daunting with the size of the reservation and the varying 
        geographic features.

  <bullet> The pipeline construction timeframe would result in a 
        lengthy delay of water delivery for reservation communities and 
        some communities would wait many years for clear drinking 
        water.

  <bullet> The water settlement included a finite amount of $47 million 
        for Operation, Maintenance and Replacement costs which was 
        projected to cover approximately eight years of costs, without 
        unforeseen breaks or interruptions, following project 
        completion.

  <bullet> The Water Settlement Act did not include mandatory hook-up 
        for households along the pipeline leaving the number of actual 
        customers unknown. However, if every Tribal household was 
        hooked up to the pipeline, monthly consumer costs to cover 
        operational costs would be approximately $120 per month in 
        today's dollars which will be a burden to impoverished 
        reservation households.

  <bullet> Private landowners were unwilling to grant temporary permits 
        to cross lands for water sampling and testing for placement of 
        the water intake unit closer to reservation communities which 
        resulted in moving the intake to Tribal lands at the Yellowtail 
        afterbay, a location much further from the reservation's larger 
        communities.

  <bullet> The Environmental Protection Agency expressed concerns to 
        the Bureau of Reclamation, in a letter dated October 31, 2022, 
        with the location of the intake unit resulting in a water age 
        concern for most customers and the proposed use of complex 
        chemicals for treatment that would necessitate operators with 
        advanced certification requirements.

  <bullet> Despite years of attempting to secure rights of way for the 
        pipeline from the Yellowtail afterbay intake to the first 
        reservation community, across approximately 50 fee and trust 
        tracts, and expending $4 million, no rights of way were 
        perfected.

    Upon re-assessment of the feasibility of the pipeline MRI system, 
the Tribe reviewed an alternative water delivery system that would 
utilize regional water plants in each reservation community that would 
be more cost-effective and deliver clean water within 2 to 4 years. 
Additionally, the Tribe proposed improvement of existing water wells 
for rural households as the majority of wells are shallow with 
compromised water quality.
    The Bureau of Indian Affairs provided funds for a water study to 
support the proposed regional water plants and rural well concept. The 
water study indicated a vast supply of available water in two major 
aquifers below the Crow Reservation, the Judith River and Parkman 
formations which are currently largely untapped. Thus, use of water in 
the existing aquifers would not interfere with or compromise existing 
water rights in the Big Horn river or Little Big Horn river.
    The water study further revealed that over 50 percent of Crow 
Reservations households have contaminated water due to inefficient 
water treatment and shallow wells. This fact created greater incentive 
to pursue a water delivery system that could be operational in a short 
number of years to best serve the population.
    The amendments would move the MRI funds from a private bank into a 
trust fund for clean water deliver and related projects that would be 
managed pursuant to the 1994 Trust Reform Act that requires submission 
of an annual expenditure plan and a budget to DOI for review and 
approval before release for funds to the Tribe. The Tribe agrees with 
this management process.
Crow Irrigation Improvement
    The Crow Water Settlement Act of 2010 directs the Secretary, 
through the Bureau of Reclamation, to improve the Crow Irrigation 
Project (CIP) in accordance with an agreement with the Crow Tribe. 
Implementation of projects was preceded by in-depth studies to 
modernize the dilapidated 100-year-old system and allocate funds for 
the various components of the system. The proposed amendments do not 
revise the current project implementation plans and co-management of 
the irrigation improvement projects by the Tribe and the Bureau of 
Reclamation. However, the Amendment Act would move the CIP funds from a 
private bank to federal treasury in a non-trust interest bearing 
account that would maintain the joint Tribe and BOR management. This 
move reduces the costs of managing funds but still complies with the 
original Settlement Act mandate for indexing of funds.
Energy Development Project
    The Crow Water Settlement Act of 2010 provided an exclusive right 
for the Crow Tribe to develop hydro power in the Yellowtail Afterbay 
that would expire in 2025 and provided a lump sum to cover a portion of 
the costs. The Crow Tribe delayed pursuit of the project due to the 
initial engineering design plan prospectively interfering with 
Yellowtail Dam operations and, later, the on-set of the COVID pandemic. 
The Tribe has now engaged a hydro plant developer, revised the site and 
engineering concerns, and intends to start construction prior to the 
December 2025 deadline. The Tribe has proposed a five-year extension of 
the deadline to complete the project to accommodate any unexpected or 
unforeseen complications that may arise.
Conclusion
    On behalf of the Crow Tribal membership, I am hopeful that the Crow 
Water Settlement Amendments Act will be adopted this Congressional 
session. At present, without the Amendments, the Tribe is unable to 
proceed with clean water delivery projects as the specifically mandated 
pipeline construction is not feasible. Clean water has become critical 
for the Crow Reservation as many studies indicate that the high cancer 
rates of the Crow people is likely attributable to contaminated water.
    The Amendments the Tribe seeks are at no new costs to the United 
States and do not impact the other provisions of the Crow Tribe/State 
of Montana Water Compact that protects all existing water users on Crow 
Reservation. Further, the Amendments do not revise the on-going Crow 
Irrigation Project improvements or the specific allocation of funds for 
those projects. Finally, the return of funds to federal oversight will 
avoid costs for the Crow Tribe and ensure protection of water 
settlement funds for future generations of the Crow Tribe.
    Thank you for your consideration of this important legislation.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    President Carlson, please proceed with your testimony.

STATEMENT OF ERVIN CARLSON, SR., PRESIDENT, INTERTRIBAL BUFFALO 
                            COUNCIL

    Mr. Carlson. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, 
Vice Chair Murkowski and honorable Committee members. My name 
is Ervin Carlson, and I am a member of the Blackfeet Nation and 
President of the InterTribal Buffalo Council.
    I have submitted a detailed statement that I will now 
summarize. All Natives in this Country depended on the Plains 
buffalo for survival prior to the arrival of the non-Indian to 
this continent. Buffalo were essential to the Native lifestyle 
and provided food, shelter, clothing, essential tools for our 
way of life. They symbolized survival and became central to our 
spirituality and religious practices.
    Our people referred to the buffalo as ``my relative,'' to 
signify how spiritually we were connected to them. Our oral 
history includes details of the vast number of buffalo, between 
30 million and 60 million, inhabiting North America. Due to 
wanton and unbridled over-hunting by non-Indian buffalo 
hunters, millions and millions of our buffalo were slaughtered. 
The destruction was so complete that by the late 1800s only a 
few hundred buffalo remained.
    Many great leaders mourned the loss of the buffalo and the 
Native way of life. With the destruction of the buffalo in the 
Indian Wars, the population of the Indian people, once 
numbering in the millions, dropped to approximately 250,000 by 
the early 1900s. Without the buffalo, surviving Indians were 
forced to live on reservations, losing their independence.
    Historical records show that the U.S. military participated 
in near-extinction of the buffalo as it provided a way to deal 
with their Indian problem. Tribal leaders longed to restore 
buffalo, but had minimal land bases and resources. However, 
early conservationists, including Teddy Roosevelt, had the 
means to prevent the near extinction of buffalo.
    For the Indian people, recovery from this devastation to 
restoration of buffalo herds on our lands began in earnest in 
1991, when a handful of Indian tribes organized the InterTribal 
Bison Cooperative, now known as the InterTribal Buffalo 
Council.
    We were granted a Federal charter in 2009, pursuant to the 
Indian Reorganization Act. Our organization has grown 
significantly, and today I am proud to tell you that we have 83 
tribes in 22 States, all dedicated to restoring herds on our 
lands. The Indian population of our member tribes exceeds 1 
million people.
    We really appreciate that Senators Heinrich, Mullin, 
Sullivan and Tester have introduced S. 2908, the Indian Buffalo 
Management Act. This is the successor to legislation initially 
introduced by the late Don Young, I guess I should say, in my 
way, the great Don Young, which he got through the House before 
he left us. Congressman LaMalfa, Congressman Peltola, and 
others have reintroduced it in this Congress.
    In March, it was unanimously reported out of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. It is pretty basic legislation 
that will create a program at the Interior Department to assist 
tribes and organizations like ours in restoring buffalo herds 
to tribal lands. It requires strict compliance with State and 
Federal laws governing the translocation of buffalo. We had 
extensive discussions with the cattle industry and agreed to a 
series of changes they requested to ensure buffalo did not 
detract from off-reservation cattle operations.
    By enacting this legislation, Congress will commit to 
assisting tribes to restore buffalo herds. We believe that this 
legislation will help Interior to justify decent budgets for 
the buffalo program as opposed to the minimal and stagnant 
funds that we have seen for decades, despite the huge growth in 
our membership.
    When you try and divide up $1.4 million among many tribes, 
it doesn't go very far. Tribes need fencing, watering systems, 
genetic diversity in their herds, supplemental feed, and 
testing that all requires meaningful funds. Some tribes tell us 
they wish to reestablish herds for cultural purposes, and that 
a small herd would be sufficient as a means of teaching 
children the history of our people and this great animal, and 
having all the parts of this animal for our spiritual 
ceremonies. Others wish to create jobs, use the meat in the 
school lunch program, and for community events. Still others 
hope to grow their herds large enough to get into small scale 
commercial production.
    Our members in Alaska have referenced the need for protein 
and basic food security, especially when successful subsistence 
hunts cannot be ensured. Whatever the reason, this legislation 
is very important to advance food sovereignty for Native 
populations. We sincerely hope that you will help to see it 
enacted into law this year.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Carlson follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Ervin Carlson, Sr., President, Intertribal 
                            Buffalo Council
Introduction and Background
    My name is Ervin Carlson and I am a member of the Blackfeet Nation 
in Montana and serve as the President of the InterTribal Buffalo 
Council (ITBC). Please accept my sincere appreciation for this 
opportunity to present this testimony to the honorable members of the 
Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.
    I am here today to present testimony on S. 2908, the Indian Buffalo 
Management Act (IBMA), and encourage passage of this legislation to 
create a permanent Tribal buffalo restoration and management program 
within the Department of Interior. I want to express our deep 
appreciation to Senators Heinrich, Mullin, Sullivan and Tester who have 
sponsored this legislation. I would be remiss if I also did not thank 
the late Congressman Don Young of Alaska who first introduced this 
legislation and was able to get it through the House before he left us. 
We were also pleased that then Congresswoman Deb Haaland joined Don 
Young as the lead co-sponsor in the House.
    Historical records indicate that in the 1840s the buffalo 
population in North America was estimated at 30 million and, at its 
peak, approximately 60 million. At the time of Christopher Columbus' 
arrival in the New World, approximately 7 million American Indians 
populated North America. For thousands of years, Indians were sustained 
by buffalo and, a sacred, spiritual relationship developed between 
them. Indians depended on buffalo for food, shelter, essential tools 
and clothing, and the buffalo became an integral component of Indian 
religion. To this day, the Pueblos in New Mexico still practice sacred 
buffalo dances on an annual basis.
    Simultaneous to the establishment and relocation of Indians onto 
reservations, buffalo were slaughtered by the tens of thousands. Non-
Indian buffalo hunters skinned the animals and, more often than not, 
sent their pelts back east for use in factories. The U.S. military also 
believed that if the buffalo could be eliminated, the ``Indian 
problem'' in America could be solved. A US military leader who was 
deeply involved in the so called Indian Wars of the Great Plains 
brutally stated, ``If I could learn that every buffalo in the northern 
herd were killed, I would be glad.The destruction of the herd would do 
more to keep Indians quiet than anything else that could happen.'' This 
strategy was successful and, in the last three to four decades of the 
1800's tens of millions of buffalo were slaughtered resulting in less 
than 500 buffalo remaining at the turn of the century. Concurrently, 
the population of American Indians was also significantly reduced to 
approximately 250,000 at the turn of the century. With the demise of 
the buffalo and the confinement of Indian Tribes to reservation lands, 
Indians lost their primary food source, lifestyle and independence. 
Sitting Bull, the great and eloquent Sioux Chief said, ``A cold wind 
blew on the prairie on the day the last buffalo fell. A death wind for 
my people.''
    Indians mourned the loss of buffalo and never ceased to dream of 
buffalo restoration for the health of Tribal members and the 
restoration of the land but without resources and the challenges of the 
new reservation lifestyle, they were unable to undertake those efforts. 
In contrast, President Teddy Roosevelt, William Hornaday and the 
American Bison Society, among others played a significant role in 
buffalo conservation efforts in the early 1900s followed by wider scale 
conservation efforts in the mid-1900's. By 1990, approximately 25,000 
buffalo were held in public herds and approximately 250,000 buffalo 
were in private herds. Numerous Indian Tribes had also established 
small herds on Tribal lands. In 1991, approximately 10 Indian Tribes, 
committed to buffalo restoration with approximately 1,500 buffalo among 
them, organized the InterTribal Bison Cooperative and approached 
Congress for federal funding. In 1992, ITBC began receiving federal 
funding through Congressional earmarks on a bi-partisan basis with 
Senator Burns of Montana and Senator Daschle of South Dakota as early 
supporters. ITBC has been included in the President's budget and at 
other times supported administratively but only as a small component in 
the Natural Resource or Rights Protection line item that funds a 
variety of other tribal initiatives. Funding occurred at the discretion 
of senior officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    Despite very small appropriations, with no assurance of recurrence, 
ITBC has nonetheless assisted many Tribes to restore buffalo, enhance 
existing herds and provide necessary technical assistance across the 
twenty-two states where member Tribes are located. ITBC has grown from 
its origins in the Great Plains to now include Tribes from Maine to 
Florida, through the mid-west, Southern Plains, Southwest states, and 
California to Alaska. In Vice Chair Murkowski's home state of Alaska, 
we are very proud of the work we have done with the Alutiq Tribe at Old 
Harbor and our member tribe at Stevens Village in helping both 
establish herds. Some of the most compelling arguments for this program 
we have heard have actually come from our members in Alaska who point 
out that when Native Villages are reliant on subsistence hunting and 
successful hunts cannot be assured, that it is critical that those 
Villages have access to an alternative source of protein. This is a 
food security argument in its most basic form. Our most recent 
deliveries of buffalo were to the Peoria Tribe in Oklahoma and the Taos 
Pueblo in New Mexico. Every single tribe in Montana, North and South 
Dakota are members of the ITBC, and we have assisted each of them with 
live buffalo, or funding for fencing, supplemental feed, water systems 
or technical support. Of course we have undertaken similar efforts in 
many other states.
    In an effort to formalize as a national Indian organization, ITBC 
petitioned for and was granted a federal charter in 2009 pursuant to 
Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act. Today, ITBC is now 
comprised of 83 federally recognized Indian Tribes in 22 states with 
over 60 buffalo herds. In recent years, ITBC membership has grown by 
about 5 Tribes per year expanding the total number of Tribal members 
served to over one million.
    Tribal buffalo restoration to Tribal homelands signifies much more 
than simply conservation of the National Mammal. Tribes enter buffalo 
restoration efforts to counteract the near extinction of buffalo that 
was analogous to the tragic history of American Indians in this 
country. Today's successful reintroduction of buffalo to Tribal lands, 
largely through the efforts of ITBC, signifies the resurgence of the 
revered Tribal buffalo culture and exemplifies the resilience of the 
American Indians and their culture.
Authorization Versus Funding
    We have been asked why an authorization would best serve ITBC 
rather than -only relying on continued annual appropriations. First, 
when Congress endorses a program that authorization both sends a 
message and likely enhances recurring appropriations specifically for 
the program. Some conservatives even argue that programs must have an 
authorization in place before appropriations should be allowed. 
Congress has authorized numerous statutes over the years to address and 
guide particular Indian Affairs issues. Just a few examples would 
include the Tribal Law and Order Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act, the 
Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, the Indian Dam Safety Act, 
the Indian Employment and Training Act, the National Indian Forest 
Resources Management Act, the Treaty Fishing Site Access Act, ANILCA, 
legislation dealing with Hoopa fisheries and Metlakatla fisheries, etc. 
etc. The list is literally pages long. While the Administration could 
have used the broad Snyder Act to create programs to address these 
various Indian affairs issues and did not, Congress properly adopted 
statutory authorizations. Since the federal government played a key 
role in the near extinction of the buffalo, Congressional action to re-
establish herds and fund management activities is reasonable and 
appropriate.
    As indicated above, ITBC has received appropriated funding since 
1992 in varying amounts, but actual annual allocations have remained 
stagnant for many years However, the annual Congressional appropriation 
to ITBC does illustrate Congressional support for buffalo restoration 
and management from a limited or one-time project to a recurring 
program despite no equivalent BIA program. Presently, ITBC enters into 
annual Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act contracts 
with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for restoration and management 
activities. However, this contractual relationship remains tenuous 
without an actual permanent buffalo program within the BIA and various 
BIA officials have recommended that a Congressional authorization for 
this the buffalo program would justify appropriations. Assistant 
Secretary Tara Swaney was one of key DOI leaders who discussed with us 
the benefits of a permanent authorization.
Federal Commitment to Traditional Food Sources
    Article XI of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie guarantees Tribes 
access to buffalo ``so long as buffalo may range.'' The Tribes 
considered this language as a perpetual guarantee. Unfortunately, like 
many other treaty provisions, the Federal Government failed to live up 
to this promise. Congressional adoption of the IBMA now provides an 
opportunity for the Federal government to honor a commitment to 
American Indians to access buffalo, similar to the commitment to Tribal 
fish commissions. Recently, the United States Supreme Court examined 
the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty and upheld Tribal off-reservation hunting 
rights in the Herrera decision. This right to hunt supports a right of 
access to traditional food sources.
    The Federal government has had a long-standing and justifiable 
commitment to Tribal fish commissions and treaty fishing rights 
following the well-known Boldt decision. That federal district court 
case gave the fishing Tribes co-management authority over salmon with 
the States and declared the security of Indian fishing rights was a 
trust obligation of the United States. This case stands for the 
proposition that all American Indians have a right to their traditional 
foods, and therefore, this ruling supports a Federal government trust 
responsibility to return buffalo to Tribes, in the same manner the 
Federal government has protected the security of Tribes to access fish.
    Currently, seven fish commissions cover 52 tribes, in 12 states, 
that represent a population of approximately 525,000 enrolled tribal 
members. ITBC represents significantly more Tribes, with a larger 
member base, over a much larger geographic area. Ten Tribes have 
memberships in both ITBC and a fish commission.
    ITBC and fish commissions both seek to provide access to a 
traditional food source to member Tribes. However, fish commissions 
receive approximately 100 times ($140,000,000) the funding from the 
Federal government. The Tribal Management/Development Program (that 
also funds ITBC), the Rights Protection Implementation Program, and the 
Fish, Wildlife, and Parks and Natural Resources Tribal Priority 
Allocation Programs within the BIA all fund the fish commissions. 
Additionally, the fish commissions receive funding from USFWS, the 
Department of Commerce, and the Environmental Protection Agency. This 
allows a single fish commission to employ 10 times the staff and 
operate two additional offices compared to ITBC. We do not remotely 
disparage the funds that the fishing tribes receive. It is entirely 
consistent with the trust responsibility owed those tribes. However, 
ITBC seeks some parity as it has the challenge to restore buffalo in 
contract with the right to co-manage an existing resource.
Indian Buffalo Management Act
    Adoption of the Indian Buffalo Management Act will create a 
permanent program within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and specifically 
authorize an annual appropriation. While funding will depend on annual 
appropriations, the IBMA should create some degree of parity with other 
Tribal wildlife programs. Additionally, the IBMA will solidify the 
contractual relationship between the BIA and ITBC, or individual Tribes 
should they choose to seek an ISDEAA contract. Hopefully this will 
eliminate our present situation where funding is so uncertain. With 
meaningful, funding, we will be able to help our members who are still 
working toward the reestablishment of buffalo herds on their lands and 
move toward the goal of establishing self-sustaining herds and a role 
in the tribal buffalo industry that will create jobs, feed tribal 
populations and provide economic opportunities to Tribes.
    The IBMA, with an increase in current funding, will allow ITBC to 
provide more meaningful Tribal Herd Development Grants to create the 
necessary infrastructure to provide buffalo to a larger segment of the 
Indian community. This in turn will lead to greater self-determination 
and food-sovereignty opportunities for Tribes through production of 
their own traditional foods and creation of economic opportunities. An 
expansion of the Herd Development Grants will increase on-reservation 
buffalo related jobs, infrastructure development, range management, 
fence construction and repair, construction of corrals, handling 
equipment, and will help pay for supplemental feed. Increased Herd 
Development Grants will further allow Tribes to market buffalo for 
economic development through branding, advertising and developing 
enough product to meet consumer demands. Tribes, unlike off-reservation 
agriculture producers, have limited access to traditional financing due 
to limitations of utilizing Tribal trust land for collateral. Thus, 
without enhanced Herd Development Grants, Tribes remain at a 
disadvantage in herd expansion and marketing.
    The Indian Buffalo Management Act will enhance ITBC's ability to 
serve as a meaningful partner to Federal agencies involved in buffalo 
management. ITBC collaborates with the National Park Service, the U.S. 
Forest Service, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
on buffalo management issues. However, this involvement is limited by a 
scarcity in resources. The IBMA will enhance population management 
through roundups and distribution of surplus buffalo to Tribes from the 
Badlands, Theodore Roosevelt, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Wind Cave 
National Parks. Translocation of surplus buffalo from those parks to 
Tribes prevents or at least reduces needless slaughter when the parks 
reach their carrying capacity and fulfills restoration objectives. 
However, ITBC and Tribal participation is often limited due to a lack 
of resources for transport.
    The IBMA will enhance the objective to reintroduce buffalo into the 
diets of Indian populations to prevent and treat diet related diseases. 
An increase in funding will allow Tribes to have sufficient product for 
cultural purposes, product to sell at reasonable costs for Tribal 
members and product to market on a larger scale. Further, enhanced 
funding will allow ITBC to develop concrete evidence of health benefits 
that will facilitate ITBC partnerships with health programs to prevent 
and treat diet related diseases in Native populations.
    The IBMA will reinforce on-going technical services from ITBC to 
Tribes, which are currently provided by a very limited staff of three 
people, for wildlife management, ecological management, range 
management, buffalo health, cultural practices, and economic 
development. Adoption of the IBMA will allow ITBC to enhance current 
training sessions (national and regional) designed to enhance Tribal 
buffalo handling and management.
    Additionally, the IBMA will support ITBC staff educational 
presentations to school-age youth, tribal buffalo managers, and others. 
The topics of these presentations range from buffalo restoration, 
conservation efforts, and the historical, cultural relationship between 
buffalo and American Indians. Current funding limits outreach, 
educational efforts, and staff training.
    Indian buffalo herds are grass-fed and, hormone and antibiotic 
free. This creates a lean final product that would fulfill a niche in 
meat production markets. ITBC strives to develop these markets for 
buffalo meat and products for interested member-Tribes at the local and 
national level. The IBMA would facilitate creation a centralized herd-
made from the member-Tribes' buffalo-in a centralized location to 
create a steady source of buffalo for markets. This herd could also be 
used to exchange buffalo among the member-Tribes to enhance each herd's 
genetic diversity.
Conclusion
    S. 2908, the Indian Buffalo Management Act, will further efforts to 
restore buffalo to Tribes on a broader scale and to establish a Tribal 
buffalo industry for job creation and new revenue for Tribal economies. 
ITBC ultimately hopes to restore Tribal herds large enough to support 
local Tribal health needs and achieve economically self-sufficient 
herds.
    ITBC and its member Tribes are appreciative of past and current 
support from Congress and the Administration. However, we urge the 
Committee to adopt the IBMA to permanently create a buffalo restoration 
program and demonstrate Congressional commitment to Tribes to access 
this critical, traditional food source.
    I would like to again thank this Committee for the opportunity to 
present testimony and I invite you to visit ITBC Tribal buffalo 
projects and experience firsthand their successes.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much, President Carlson.
    Senator Tester?
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the 
flexibility.
    This goes to you, Chairman Whiteclay. You talked about, in 
your statement you talked about why the settlement doesn't work 
after the fact, no bidders, construction time too long, delay 
in water delivery, the list is long. I know this is what the 
bill says, but I want you to flesh this out a little more.
    You said this would set up a trust account to develop clean 
water. Tell me what you are going to do to replace that 
pipeline to deliver clean water to the people in Crow Country, 
because, if we get this bill passed, what will it allow you to 
do? Because you are not going to build a big old pipeline, you 
are not going to build an intake that is too far away. Tell me 
what you are going to do.
    Mr. Whiteclay. Thank you, Senator Tester. Yes, the Crow 
Tribe is planning on putting regional water plants throughout , 
to each individual community. The regional water plants will 
not be from surface water, it will be to the aquifer, which we 
requested an aquifer study to be done. We are thankful to the 
BIA for paying for that study. We have more than adequate 
drinking water, it is safe, it is clean throughout. So each, 
like we said, our reservation is very large. So what is in all 
those communities that we will put regional water plants to all 
communities and we will have well systems for the rural folks. 
We have a lot of folks that live in the country. I myself haul 
water to my own residence through a cistern.
    So giving us the ability to have wells to all the community 
members, which is roughly about 1,680 households.
    Senator Tester. In the end, do you think you can deliver 
this at or less of a cost the pipeline would have run you, 
assuming you would have gotten bidders for the pipeline?
    Mr. Whiteclay. Yes, we are very confident that we would be 
able to build the whole system out and include the wastewater 
systems and all of the above under the amount.
    Senator Tester. I want to talk about the hydro project that 
you have, and this bill also addresses it. I believe it moves 
up the deadline to 2030. What is the deadline right now?
    Mr. Whiteclay. Yes, the previous settlement, the settlement 
has a sunset date through 2025. And it doesn't give a clear 
statement of substantial completion. So this moves that 
forward.
    Senator Tester. So that substantial completion statement is 
further fleshed out and clarified?
    Mr. Whiteclay. Yes.
    Senator Tester. Okay. Then, have you started on the hydro 
project yet?
    Mr. Whiteclay. Yes, we have designs already, we have 
contractors, we are moving very quickly on the hydro project 
because of that sunset date, keeping in mind I have only 
recently been in our term for the last three years. So we are 
making leaps and bounds.
    Senator Tester. As you project forward, do you think the 
2030 date will be adequate? You will have it done by then, 
substantial completion?
    Mr. Whiteclay. Yes, we believe so.
    Senator Tester. Okay. Thank you for being here, Chairman.
    Erv, you have been doing this basically your whole life. 
You have been doing it with no resources whatsoever. You talked 
about fencing and water and feed and testing. Would this be 
done by grants to the people who apply for it, or how do you 
visualize this happening?
    Mr. Carlson. What we do is the minimal dollars, the funding 
that we do get, we have a herd development grant process that 
goes out to the tribes. They put in each year for all of their 
needs, which far exceeds the dollars, the amount that we do 
get.
    So they put in that and put it in their grants of what they 
would need for that year, whether it be fencing, waterways, and 
sometimes supplemental feed for the tough winters that we have, 
or the ones with minimal land base.
    Senator Tester. And the testing you are talking about, I 
hate to bring up this word but I am going to say it, is that 
brucellosis testing, or what kind of testing?
    Mr. Carlson. Well, not necessarily brucellosis. I think the 
only place we do have that is in Yellowstone. But we do test 
the other animals that do come out of there, Wortham and Fort 
Peck. But on certain times, the tribes, within the animals that 
they do have, they like to go ahead and test just to make sure 
that their animals are all still disease-free.
    Senator Tester. Okay, thank you.
    Just one last thing. I have 36 seconds left. I do 
appreciate the fact that both Poarch and Lytton got the 
delegation on board. It is so really, really important that you 
guys have the home Senators on board for this stuff.
    This has been a problem for you guys for a long, long time. 
Now I think it is going to get fixed. So I appreciate your hard 
work. And for you, Secretary Newland, it is always good to have 
you in front of the Committee.
    The Chairman. Senator Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you to 
those who have testified today. President Carlson, you 
mentioned our good friend, the great Congressman Don Young.
    As it turns out, the 9th of June, just on Sunday, was 
Congressman Young's birthday, and it is also the day that has 
been designed in Alaska as Don Young Day. So I think it is only 
appropriate that we are hearing this bill just so close in time 
to the Congressman's special acknowledgement. Thank you for 
recognizing him in that way.
    This is a question for you, Assistant Secretary Newland. 
This relates to the Indian Buffalo Management Act. As I 
mentioned, this is a program that we are looking to grow in 
Alaska to provide for subsistence needs for several Alaska 
Native communities. I mentioned transportation costs. You have 
spent enough time up there to know that this is real.
    Is it the department's interpretation of S. 2908 that the 
bill will cover the cost of transporting the bulls, the cows 
and the calves to the villages that are working to establish 
these bison herds?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Vice Chairman. Yes, we believe that 
would be an allowable cost.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. And is it also your understanding 
that the bill would cover the cost of transporting the bison 
within Alaska from village to village to promote sustainable 
grazing practices and herd health?
    Mr. Newland. Again, I believe the answer is yes. Yes.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Thank you for that. That is 
important. As I mentioned, these are expenses that are very 
real.
    Another challenge, though, is the need for mobile 
processing trailers when you have communities that are not 
connected by road, you have to move them in other ways. 
Sometimes you can only do it by air, or by barge. Is it the 
department's interpretation of the bill that it would cover the 
cost of transporting mobile meat processing facilities by air 
or barge to places like Old Harbor or Stevens Village or other 
rural and remote areas?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Vice Chair. Yes, I would say that 
within this program, as I understand the bill, there is a lot 
of flexibility for tribes and organizations, our partners at 
ITBC, to do all manner of activity to both manage herds and 
ecosystems as well as on the back end with processing.
    Senator Murkowski. Great. Your testimony states that the 
bill would allow the tribes and tribal organizations to enter 
into 638 self-governance contracts to assume BIA bison herd 
management functions. Does this mean that buffalo restoration 
and economic development activities would be managed like 638 
compacts that we see with tribal education or law enforcement? 
How do you envision that?
    Mr. Newland. For tribes that want to use that route, yes. 
It would work like any other 638 program.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. So do you know if there are any 
BIA livestock or wildlife programs that are somewhat analogous 
to the buffalo program that the BIA contracts with the tribes 
on now?
    Mr. Newland. I would have to get back to you on that, Vice 
Chair. This is also a program that we have been running on an 
year-by-year basis with much less funding. So we have good 
practice at it, and a $14 million authorization would allow us 
to really grow it really support tribes that want to 
participate in it.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Pivoting just a little bit in my 
last question to you, it is in regard to tribal applications 
for land into trust. You had mentioned in your written 
testimony that the department must review each individual 
tribal application when requesting to place land into trust on 
a tribe's behalf. On average, how long does this review take 
BIA to review an application? What are you looking at?
    Mr. Newland. On the whole, we know that it takes us now 
around three years, before the new regulations went into 
effect, it takes the BIA around three years to process a single 
application, on average.
    Senator Murkowski. So, three years. I am looking then to 
Chair Bryan, and to Chairperson Mejia. What does this mean when 
you have a three-year review plan, and you are trying to put 
into place some plans for your people? Tell me the implications 
of a three-year review process.
    Ms. Bryan. We do appreciate the process and the 
administration and the revisions to 151. These are lands that 
have been in trust for over a decade with the Department of 
Interior. But that doesn't actually clarify these lands that we 
have had into trust.
    So we have not submitted any applications to place any land 
into trust, just because we have spent millions of dollars on 
frivolous lawsuits, and we have won all those lawsuits, the 
people questioning the jurisdiction of our land.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, the Crow Settlement Act of 
2010 requires that the settlement be fully appropriated by June 
30th of 2030. This bill does not extend that deadline. Does DOI 
expect to fully fund the Crow settlement by or before that 
date?
    Mr. Newland. Yes, Chairman, if I could just add very 
briefly, that settlement was $460 million. We are almost at 90 
percent of the funding appropriated. So we have an additional 
$48 million in discretionary funds to go.
    The Chairman. Okay, thank you.
    On S. 4000, the Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act prohibits 
the tribe from conducting gaming activities on the lands taken 
into trust under the legislation as well as on any future trust 
lands in Sonoma County. Would the gaming restrictions in 
current law apply to future lands taken into trust pursuant to 
S. 4000?
    Mr. Newland. Yes.
    The Chairman. That is all I need.
    President Carlson, can you share more about how the 
InterTribal Buffalo Council's growing membership impacts the 
services it is able to provide? I think you talked a little bit 
about this. But I guess there are two ways to look at it. One 
is, how thin do you have to spread this $1.3 million? And the 
other question is, what are you going to do with $14 million if 
we can pull it off?
    Mr. Carlson. We have grown to 83 tribes now, and $1.2 
million, $1.4 million predominantly, that has been our funding. 
So to get that out to the tribes, of course, I talked about the 
grants that we go through, the process. It is a process every 
year that really, we try to make it equal to all of our tribes, 
all in need. Consequently, it is never enough to really 
significantly help their programs.
    Some of the years we have, not all of the tribes will put 
in. They will hold out; kind of alternate so other tribes can 
get a little more money to get their programs going. So it is 
very minimal, but the tribes are very resilient. We have 
survived on that very little dollars, just as our buffalo are 
resilient and survive on that.
    So with $14 million, there are a lot of tribes, all of the 
tribes would be able to participate each year and significantly 
help their programs. One of the things that we had a meeting 
with our herd managers, and they wanted dollars, funding just 
to stay sustainable with what they are doing, and not even able 
to grow their herds or to grow their land base for them, or for 
all the materials that they might need. So the $14 million 
would significantly increase the help for them.
    I must say also that we do ask the tribes to tell us their 
full needs for the year. Each year, it far exceeds $14 million 
for what they really need. So we are still below on that.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Chair Bryan, if enacted, how will S. 3263 improve the 
Band's ability to provide essential government services to your 
membership?
    Ms. Bryan. First, by saving dollars from frivolous lawsuits 
that we could use to provide housing, education, rural health 
care to communities, better infrastructure for our roads. We 
currently serve over 500 children at our Boys and Girls Club, 
and it seems to grow every year.
    So we would use those dollars that we are using on these 
frivolous lawsuits to continue to grow the community, be a part 
of the community. When it comes to rural health care, there is 
a lot of issues there, people struggling with mental health. So 
that is how we would use those dollars.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have another 
question regarding the Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act. This was 
included in the 2019 NDAA law. And there was a gaming 
prohibition on trust land acquisitions for the Lytton Rancheria 
in that language.
    As I understand it, S. 4000 is meant to be a clarifying 
bill. Does the 2019 prohibition on gaming in that law restrict 
gaming on any lands to be taken into trust for Lytton Rancheria 
going forward?
    Mr. Mejia. Yes, it does, in Sonoma County, and we also have 
a standing MOA with Sonoma County that we would not prohibit 
gaming.
    Senator Murkowski. Very good. Thank you for the 
clarification.
    The Chairman. Senator Daines?

                STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE DAINES, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Daines. Chairman Schatz, thank you, as well as to 
Vice Chair Murkowski.
    First, I want to thank you for holding a hearing on our 
Crow Tribe Water Settlement Amendments Act. I want to thank 
Chairman Whiteclay for coming all the way from Montana here to 
D.C. to support the Crow people, as well as Mr. Carlson from 
the Blackfeet Tribe. It is an honor to have you here as well. 
Thank you for coming from our neighboring State, South Dakota. 
I know Montana, your heart is there, and a number of the 
Blackfeet Tribe.
    In 2010, Congress passed the Crow Tribe Water Rights 
Settlement Act. It codified the 1999 compact between the Crow 
Tribe and State of Montana, that our State legislature passed 
with bipartisan support. Since 2010, the Crow Tribe has worked 
with the Bureau of Reclamation to implement this settlement and 
to bring water to their people.
    Unfortunately, the original water project envisioned in the 
2010 bill was found to be infeasible, the project that they 
defined in the compact, which is why we must make this really 
technical correction, a minor amendment to the bill.
    Let me be clear what this bill does and does not do. It 
does not alter any existing water rights. It does not add any 
additional funds to the settlement. It does not open up the 
compact agreed to by the State, the Crow Tribe, and the Federal 
Government.
    What it does do is very surgically amends the 2010 bill to 
allow a little more flexibility for the Crow Tribe to actually 
build a water system for their people in a way that is more 
cost-effective, lower impact, and brings drinking water to the 
greatest amount of people.
    I want to commend Chairman Whiteclay for his work on this 
bill, and look forward to asking some questions on the impact 
of this legislation.
    Before turning to a couple of questions, I want to make one 
comment regarding the Crow Revenue Act. It is a separate issue. 
I will say I am disappointed that my Crow Revenue Act was not 
included in today's hearing. This bill was made public and 
introduced the same day as the Crow Tribe Water Settlement 
Amendments Act. Both bills significantly help the Crow Tribe.
    Both bills are supported by the tribe, by the State of 
Montana, and by the communities. I truly hope we can have a 
hearing on my Crow Revenue Act as soon as possible, let's say 
July 10th might be a good date.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Daines. Assistant Secretary Newland, for the 
record, will you please verify that our bill does not affect 
existing water rights, does not add additional funds to 
settlements, and does not alter the compact between the State 
of Montana and the Crow Tribe?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. It is great to see you 
again. Yes, those are all correct.
    Senator Daines. Thank you.
    Chairman Whiteclay, the Crow Tribe Water Settlement 
Amendments Act and the Crow Revenue Act both bolster tribal 
sovereignty, increase energy security, and we both know, fund 
much-needed resources on the reservation. Could you explain to 
the Committee why both of these bills need to be enacted this 
year and how they will affect access to services on the 
reservation?
    Mr. Whiteclay. Thank you, Senator. Yes, both bills are 
detrimental for the tribe, excuse me, not detrimental, but I 
believe it is detrimental that we don't have those bills in 
place. For the Crow Tribe, this is a 10-year riddle for clean 
water. It is a basic human right. To have all this funding and 
to not figure out how we can get water to every community and 
have to make that decision on which community doesn't get 
water, that is a decision no leader should make.
    So this bill would support all the communities getting 
clean water and the folks in the country, that live in the 
country, would have clean drinking water. The Crow Revenue Act 
is a bill that basically keeps the tribe afloat for the next 10 
years. With the closure of our single source of revenue, one of 
our single sources of revenue, which is the Soligan Mine, which 
now has no, our main customer shut down, we have no revenue 
coming in from the coal which would completely replace it, it 
would not replace it wholly, but it will make it viable for the 
tribe to find other sources of revenue and diversify our 
portfolio. Because a lot of the funds, the Crow Tribe, we 
didn't get to participate in all the government funding that 
came down because of a problem that we had with a do not pay 
list that the tribe was unjustly put on.
    So all the good government money that was coming down and 
all the grants and all that, we weren't available to 
participate in that. So all the services that we provide, that 
is on ourselves for social services. MMIW, search and rescue, 
Crow Tribe is ground zero for the MMIW right now. You see all 
the documentaries, all the missing and murdered. That is all 
done on the general fund, on the back of the Crow Tribe, with 
no input from the Federal grants.
    We are on a reimbursement basis, meaning that to get 
Federal funds, we have to expend our own funds to start with. 
So the Crow Revenue Act would actually give us some room to 
breathe on that, keep our head almost above water.
    Senator Daines. Thank you.
    I have one more sentence to add as I close it out, Mr. 
Chairman. But I do wish, those who have not been out to Crow 
Country, I would love to see members of this Committee come out 
and spend a day with you to see the serious issues you face as 
chairman, the poverty, the Mexican cartels, we talked about 
that today, the flood of fentanyl coming in. This is an 
existential threat truly to the economic viability of your 
people.
    My last statement is, I ask for unanimous consent to add 
letters of support to the record including one from Governor 
Gianforte of Montana.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. If there are no more questions for our 
witnesses, members may also submit follow-up written questions 
for the record. The hearing record will be open for two weeks. 
I want to thank all of our witnesses for their time and their 
testimony today.
    This hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:37 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

   Prepared Statement of Hon. David Hill, Principal Chief, Muscogee 
                             (Creek) Nation
    Dear Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, Chair Westerman, and 
Ranking Member Grijalva:
    As the Principal Chief of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, I write to 
formally submit my Nation's Written Testimony for the record in 
opposition to S. 3263 and H.R. 6180. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation 
opposes this legislation for three reasons: (1) the legislation will 
selectively help one Tribe to the detriment of others; (2) the 
legislation rewards one Tribe for conduct that is morally reprehensible 
and violative of the cultural code all other sister tribes collectively 
abide; and (3) the legislation encourages other Tribes to engage in 
similar immoral conduct, creating a significant threat that more sacred 
sites will be destroyed in the homelands of forcibly removed Tribal 
Nations. For these reasons, we oppose S. 3263 and H.R. 6180. The 
Muscogee (Creek) Nation advocates for a clean Carcieri fix for all 
Tribal Nations that empowers removed or displaced Tribal Nations to 
protect their sacred sites in their homelands.
    First, there can be no question that the Supreme Court's decision 
in Carcieri v. Salazar has prevented many Tribal Nations from taking 
land into trust. While trust lands can be used for economic 
development, the primary purpose of the United States holding lands in 
trust on behalf of tribes is to protect, preserve and restore tribal 
homelands, including those of cultural and historical significance. The 
Muscogee (Creek) Nation supports a clean fix to address Carcieri, but 
opposes S. 3263 and H.R. 6180 which single out one Tribe at the expense 
of others. We have spoken to many Tribes who fear that if legislation 
passed is for one specific Tribe--instead of all Tribal Nations 
throughout Indian Country--it will set a harmful precedent that will 
require Tribes to get similar legislation in order to protect or 
restore tribal homelands. \1\ This would not only be burdensome to 
Congress, it would create two classes of Tribes--those with the 
resources to advocate for legislation to address the negative impacts 
of Carcieri and those without. Should this proposed legislation become 
law, the multitude of other Tribes excluded from this legislation--
whose need for a Carcieri fix is much greater--will be left at a 
significant disadvantage. A congressional policy should not be 
established where the wealthiest Tribes get to cut the line with a one-
off piece of legislation, while the Tribes who need the most help are 
left stranded. Indian Country and Congress should be working together 
towards a solution that will help all Tribes affected by the Court's 
decision in Carcieri.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Resolutions opposing the Poarch legislation and supporting a 
clean Carcieri fix have been retained in the Committee files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, even if helping one Tribe to the detriment of others could 
somehow be justified. Congress should never condone, legitimize, or 
excuse taking land into trust to desecrate the sacred site and burial 
ground of a separate Tribal Nation. It contradicts the primary purpose 
established in the Indian Reorganization Act for taking lands into 
trust. It would also undermine efforts by the rightful successors to 
those sacred lands and burial grounds from taking action to protect and 
preserve these critical sites.
    The Poarch Band purchased Hickory Ground, a sacred site and 
ceremonial ground from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in present-day 
Wetumpka, Alabama. Poarch could only purchase this sacred site within 
our treaty territory and homeland because Poarch received a taxpayer-
funded historic preservation grant. Poarch received this federal grant 
because they promised to protect and preserve the Hickory Ground 
cultural and ceremonial site on behalf of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. 
In its application for federal funds to buy Hickory Ground, Poarch 
stated that its ``[a]cquisition of the property is principally a 
protection measure.'' \2\ Poarch further stated that its `` 
[a]cquisition would prevent development on the property.'' indeed, 
Poarch told the federal government that if the government gave Poarch 
money to purchase Hickory Ground. then:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Poarch's application for the federal funds used to purchase 
Hickory Ground has been retained in the Committee files.

        The property will serve as a valuable resource for the cultural 
        enrichment of the Creek people . . . . The Creek people in 
        Oklahoma['s] pride in heritage and ties to their original 
        homeland can only be enhanced. There is still an existing 
        Hicko1y Ground tribal town in Oklahoma. They will be pleased to 
        know their home in Alabama is being preserved . . . . The 
        Hickory Ground site will continue to enhance their 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        understanding of their history, without excavation.

    Poarch proclaimed that ``[d]estruction of archaeological resources 
in Alabama . . . destroy[s] the cultural history of Creek people.'' 
Ultimately, Poarch told the federal government that its acquisition of 
Hickory Ground was ``necessary to prevent destruction of the site.'' 
Consequently, Poarch successfully bid to receive federal funding to 
purchase Hickory Ground.
    But just as soon as the federal government placed our sacred site 
in trust for the Poarch, Poarch proceeded to illegally disinter our 
ancestors' remains and cultural artifacts. After breaking their promise 
to preserve the grounds to create space for a bingo hall, they 
eventually ruined Hickory Ground by bulldozing the site for a 26-story 
multi-million dollar luxury casino hotel and resort. All in all, Poarch 
removed 57 of our relatives. Poarch placed their remains in garbage 
bags and sent them off to be stored at a university. Our ancestors have 
never been returned and many remain stored in a garden shed and in 
boxes at a university because Poarch refuses to allow them to be 
repatriated. All of this was done over the strenuous objections of the 
Muscogee (Creek) Nation, in violation of numerous laws, and contrary to 
universal principles of human decency. Poarch has yet to be held 
accountable for its heinous, reprehensible conduct, and now brazenly 
seeks to be rewarded for their behavior through a Congressional act. 
Although gaming is a critical component of tribal self-determination, 
allowing one Tribal Nation to engage in gaming on another Tribal 
Nation's burial ground flies in the face of the protections afforded 
when lands are placed into trust.
    Indeed, enacting this legislation would condone Poarch's behavior 
and encourage others to follow in Poarch's footsteps.
    Furthermore, S. 3263 and H.R. 6180 go beyond simply stating that 
the Poarch Band shall be considered as under Federal jurisdiction in 
1934 (they were not). The bill also ratifies and confirms all lands 
taken into trust prior to enactment, including those outside of 
Poarch's geographic area and within the homelands of the Muscogee 
(Creek) Nation. Should Poarch ever receive legislation allowing lands 
to be taken into trust, the legislation should limit that authority to 
the geographic area their federal recognition was predicated on. When 
the individuals who called themselves ``Poarch Creek'' submitted an 
application to become a Tribe in 1980, they were very explicit in 
telling the federal government that their ancestral ties to the 
Southeast are limited to the areas surrounding Tensaw and Atmore in 
present-day southwestern Alabama. Poarch's federal acknowledgment 
recommendation and evaluation states that the individuals who identify 
as Poarch have ``lived in the same general vicinity in southwestern 
Alabama within an eighteen-mile radius for a time period beginning in 
the late 1700s to the present.'' U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, Memorandum on recommendation and summary evidence for 
proposed finding for Federal acknowledgment of the Poarch Band of 
Creeks of Alabama pursuant to 25 C.F.R. 83 (Dec. 29, 1983) at 2, 
https://www.bia.gov/sites/bia.gov/files/assets/asia/ofa/petition/
O13_prchcr_AL/013_pf.pdf.
    S. 3263 and H.R. 6180, however, attempt to put land into trust for 
the Poarch Band outside of their historical territory and within the 
historic treaty territory of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Given 
Poarch's horrific track record and atrocious treatment of the Muscogee 
(Creek) Nation's sacred sites, there is no reason to give Poarch carte 
blanche ability to take more land into trust within our Nation's 
historic boundaries. Indeed, doing so would violate the treaties our 
Nation signed with the United States. \3\ The United States has treaty 
trust duties and responsibilities to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. One 
of those duties is the duty to uphold, protect, and preserve the sacred 
sites our Nation was forced to leave behind when we were forcibly 
removed from our homeland on the Trail of Tears. That treaty and the 
trust duty the United States owes to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation 
supersedes the Poarch Band's desire to expand gaming operations within 
our Nation's homelands and to the detriment of our cultural history.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Poarch is not a successor in interest to any of the treaties 
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation signed with the United States since, at the 
time of signing, Poarch did not exist as a tribe, entity, or even an 
organized group. The fact that a group of people claiming Creek 
ancestry organized themselves and asked to become a tribe in 1980 does 
not automatically qualify them to be a successor in interest to the 
treaties the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has signed. In fact, historically, 
the people who today call themselves ``Poarch'' chose to politically 
divorce themselves from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. When Andrew 
Jackson sought to exterminate the ``Upper Creeks'' (citizens of the 
Muscogee (Creek) Nation who had not intermarried with whites and who 
opposed removal and slavery), Poarch's ancestors teamed up with General 
Jackson and assisted in his attempts to wipe out the full-blood 
Muscogee (Creek) Nation citizens. In exchange for supporting Andrew 
Jackson, they were given land grants in and near Tensaw. Indeed, the 
Department of the Interior's acknowledgment recommendation and 
evaluation states that Poarch's ancestors fought on the side of Andrew 
Jackson during the ``Creek War.'' See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, Memorandum on recommendation and summary 
evidence for proposed finding for Federal acknowledgment of the Poarch 
Band of Creeks of Alabama pursuant to 25 C.F.R. 83 (Dec. 29, 1983) at 
13, https://www.bia.gov/sites/bia.gov/files/assets/as-ia/ofa/petition/
O13_prchcr_AL/013_pf.pdf (``many of the present group's ancestors, 
including Lynn McGhee, received grants for their land in the Tensaw 
area from the United States for their support in the Creek War.''); see 
id. at 16 (``the lands they chose were . . . close to the Tensaw/Little 
River area''). By agreeing to stay, and by accepting these land grants, 
they gave up all political rights they had previously held as Muscogee 
(Creek) Nation citizens. Having betrayed and divorced themselves from 
our Nation, they have no right to claim any interest in the treaties we 
signed with the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ultimately, Poarch's destruction of Hickory Ground in Wetumpka, 
Alabama, demonstrates why removed or displaced Tribal Nations must be 
empowered to protect the sacred places and ancestral burials they were 
forced to leave behind. The destruction at Hickory Ground is 
heartbreaking and demoralizing. When the law allows for a self-
identified group of people to take control of the sacred sites and 
burial grounds that were never theirs, and empowers that group to 
subsequently excavate graves and desecrate those sites, it fails every 
removed or displaced Tribal Nation in America. Comprehensive 
legislation is essential to ensure all Tribes can restore their land 
base without concern for the destruction of their most sacred sites. We 
cannot afford to let the destruction of another Native, historic, 
sacred site to take place. Thus, any proposed legislation seeking to 
address Carcieri must provide removed Tribes with the ability and 
authority to protect their sacred sites and the burials of their 
relatives within their homelands.
    The Muscogee (Creek) Nation stands ready to work with all of Indian 
Country and Congress to achieve a clean, comprehensive Carcieri fix 
that applies to all Tribal Nations and empowers Tribal Nations to both 
restore their land base and protect sacred sites within the homelands 
from which they were forcibly removed.

    Re: S.4000--To reaffirm applicability of IRA to Lytton 
                                                  Rancheria

    Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chairman Murkowski:

    I write on behalf of Artichoke Joe's to provide further comment on 
S. 4000, a bill concerning the Lytton Rancheria of California, and on 
testimony received during the hearing on the bill.
    During the hearing, Chairman Schatz asked Assistant Secretary 
Newland if the prohibition on gaming in the Lytton Rancheria Homelands 
Act (included in the 2019 NOAA (S. 1790), hereafter the ``2019 Lytton 
Act'') would apply to future lands taken into trust pursuant to S. 
4000, and Assistant Secretary Newland answered ``Yes.''
    A few minutes later, Vice Chairman Murkowski, in addressing Tribal 
Chair Mejia, repeated that the 2019 Lytton Act included a prohibition 
on gaming on any lands taken into trust for the Tribe under its 
provision and she then questioned since S. 4000 is meant to be a 
clarifying bill, whether the 2019 prohibition restricts games on any 
land lands to be taken into trust for Lytton going forward. The tribal 
chairman answered in the affirmative.
    These questions misconceive the nature of S. 4000 and are very 
misleading. The 2019 Lytton Act granted the Lytton rights to have 
certain lands taken into trust without any regard to the Indian 
Reorganization Act (the ``IRA'') or its requirement that the tribe 
existed when the IRA was enacted in 1934. The 2019 Lytton Act did not 
enable land to be taken into trust under the IRA. Rather, in it 
Congress declared that certain land ``is hereby taken into trust for 
the benefit of the [Lytton].'' There was no reason to address whether 
the tribe existed in 1934 or whether it was eligible to have lands 
taken into trust under the IRA, and Congress did not address those 
issues. Further, the reason the tribe asked Congress to pass the 2019 
Lytton Act ordering the land taken into trust was undoubtedly the same 
reason Congress inserted a provision into the 2000 Omnibus Indian 
Advancement Act (H.R. 5528, Sec. 819) to take casino land into trust 
for the tribe--because the tribe did not satisfy the criteria for 
administrative approvals under the IRA and IGRA.
    In contrast to the 2019 Homelands Act, S. 4000 does not direct that 
specific land be taken into trust, but rather addresses the IRA issues 
stemming from Carcieri v. Salazar (2009) 555 U.S. 379, which held that 
the IRA allows land to be taken into trust only for tribes which 
existed and were recognized in 1934. Even though no Lytton tribe 
existed in 1934, S. 4000 backdates the tribe's formation so that the 
tribe can have lands taken into trust pursuant to the IRA.
    S. 4000 would allow the Lytton to qualify to have lands taken into 
trust under the IRA and thus would render obsolete the 2019 Lytton Act. 
Therefore, the gaming restrictions under the 2019 Lytton Act would not 
apply. Thus the answer to the questions asked by the Chairman and Vice 
Chairman should have been in the negative. If and when lands are taken 
into trust, it will be under the IRA, not under the 2019 Lytton Act, 
and the 2019 Lytton Act's prohibition on gaming will not apply.
    Further, the prohibition in the Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act 
applies only to land taken into trust in Sonoma County. S. 4000 does 
not limit the Lytton to putting land in Sonoma County into trust and 
could allow land to be taken into trust in other nearby counties. In 
that regard, years ago, the Lytton obtained an option to buy land in 
American Canyon, barely 10 miles outside Sonoma County.
    So if the Senate is concerned about gaming on the land, which it 
should be and which both the Chairman and Vice Chairman voiced, a 
provision should be inserted into this bill prohibiting gaming on the 
lands to be purchased, pursuant to this backdating provision.
    We further note that the stated purpose of S. 4000, that it is 
clarifying the 2019 Lytton Act, misrepresents the situation and the 
nature of the bill. The Act cannot ``reaffirm the applicability of the 
IRA'' because the applicability of the IRA has never been affirmed. The 
whole reason why Rep. George Miller inserted an amendment for the 
Lytton into the 2000 Omnibus Act and that Rep. Jared Huffman obtained 
the 2019 Lytton Act is because the Lytton were not in existence in 1934 
and did not qualify under the IRA.
    S. 4000 would preclude the fact finding process which is applicable 
in these situations and falsely find facts that are not true. Based on 
these falsehoods, it would then grant the Lytton a privilege not 
granted to any other tribes. This is not fair to other tribes or to the 
general population. Congress should let the administrative and judicial 
processes in place take their course and refrain from granting special 
exemptions, especially a special exemption that attempts to conceal its 
true nature as this one does.
    We appreciate your consideration of these comments.

Dear Chairman Schatz and Vice Chairman Murkowski:

    Artichoke Joe's writes in opposition to S. 4OOO, a bill which would 
declare that the Lytton tribe is subject to the lndian Reorganization 
Act of 1934 even though in 1934, no Lytton tribe existed and no lndian 
people lived on the Lytton Rancheria.
    ln March 1927, the Office of lndian Affairs (precursor to the 
Bureau) purchased a 50 acre tract of land in Healdsburg, a farming area 
about 70 miles north of San Francisco. No lndians lived on the land 
then or for the next 10 years. Then in 1937 , an lndian man named Bert 
Steele wrote to the local lndian Affairs office and asked for land at 
Lytton. Mr. Steele's father was a half-blooded Nomelacki lndian and his 
mother a half-blooded Pit River lndian (from 160 and 200 miles north, 
respectively) and Mr. Steele had previously been allocated land in 
Round Valley (120 miles north). The local agency granted Mr. Steele 16 
acres on the Lytton Rancheria and then a year later assigned 1O acres 
to another lndian family. No other lndians ever lived on this 
ranchieria, and the government gifted the rancheria lands to the 
residents around 1960.
    These two families had left their tribal lands. They never formed 
or constituted a tribe. Tribes lived on reservations and reservations 
restricted individuals. They were looking to break free of tribal life. 
This was not tribal land as people conceive of the term, lands occupied 
by a tribe since before the state was formed, and left largely to 
govern themselves.
    The IRA allows the federal government to take land into trust for 
lndian tribes that existed in 1934 when the Act was passed. That does 
not apply to Lytton. S. 40OO constitutes an attempt to rewrite history 
and create a history that never occurred. lt is a cynical attempt to 
create a Lytton tribe that never existed before 1980 and to backdate 
the creation to before 1934. ln short, it is a lie.
    Second, even if the Lytton had existed as a tribe in 1934, but had 
not yet been recognized, there is a further problem with S. 4000 in 
that it would constitute a ``Carcieri fix'' for a single tribe. ln 
2009, in Carcieri v. Salazar, the Supreme Court ruled that the IRA 
applied only to tribes in existence and recognized in 1934. Since then 
Congress has considered legislation that would allow tribes not 
recognized until after 1934 to have land taken into trust, but has not 
been able to agree on the details of such new legislation. This bill, 
instead of creating a law that would apply equally to all tribes, would 
confer benefits a single tribe, without any findings of why this group 
alone qualifies for such an exception. To date, Congress has wisely 
resisted passing exceptions for single tribes, and the Lytton, a tribe 
that would never satisfy any reasonable criteria applicable to all 
tribes, does not merit an exception.
    Third, the IRA itself only allows for taking land into trust. lt 
does not and cannot create lndian sovereignty on land over which the 
state has sovereignty. With the advent of ``reservation shopping,'' 
this issue has come to the fore, and it has never been adequately 
addressed. lf Congress makes any changes to, or affirms application of 
the IRA to a tribe formed after 1934, it should address this vitally 
important issue.
    We appreciate your consideration of these comments.

        Very Truly Yours,

                                      Mekko George Thompson
                                                      June 20, 2024
    I am shocked and outraged to learn that Congress is considering 
passing legislation that will help the Poarch Creek Band of Indians 
destroy more sacred sites within our Mvskoke homelands.
    When the Poarch asked the federal government for taxpayer funds to 
purchase the original Hickory Grounds site, they promised to preserve 
it. They made a big deal out of telling the government that they were 
protecting it for the ``Creeks in Oklahoma,'' That would have been the 
right thing to do. We are the only tribe to lay our ancestors to rest 
at this place, and it is our ancestors who were left behind when our 
people were herded onto the long walk to Oklahoma.
    But Poarch broke that promise. They dug up my ancestors, put them 
in boxes, and built a casino directly on top of my family's burial 
ground. Many of those people remain in boxes, never returned to us or 
reburied. You can dress it up however you like, but those are the 
simple facts that can never be justified.
    For years, Poarch has misled, obfuscated, and made excuses to 
escape accountability and do the right thing. That's why I filed a 
lawsuit, and we look forward to our day in court sometime this fall.
    I believe the legislation the Poarch is asking Congress to pass is 
just one more attempt to evade accountability for what they did at 
Hickory Ground. One of our claims is that the federal government 
violated federal law when it placed our sacred site and burial ground 
in trust for the Poarch. The Poarch know what they did is wrong, and 
now they want Congress to bail them out.
    What's worse is if this bill is passed, not only will the Poarch be 
rewarded for destroying my family's burial grounds, but there will be 
no protections against them doing it again elsewhere.
    We couldn't believe they would do such a thing when all this began, 
so we went to Alabama to see for ourselves. Our group broke down in 
tears at the site of bulldozers and dirt piles where our ancestors once 
lay in peace. We felt despair and hopelessness. We felt like we had 
failed at our sacred duty to keep our ancestors at peace, as we are 
commanded in our culture.
    But you don't have to be Native to understand how bad this is. I 
suspect most anyone would be outraged if it were their family ripped 
out of the ground and stored in a cardboard box on a shelf somewhere to 
make way for a casino. For years, Poarch kept my relatives stored in 
buckets, trash bags, and news bags, before sending them off to a 
university. To unearth one remain, it's not right. But to unearth 57 
remains, it's beyond comprehension. It's wrong in any culture.
    That is why we will never stop fighting for justice for Hickory 
Ground.
    That's also why any member of Congress with a conscience should 
reject the legislation that the Poarch are asking them to pass.

                           COALITION OF LARGE TRIBES (COLT)
                                                      June 21, 2024
  Re: Coalition of Large Tribes Opposition to H.R. 6180/S. 
                                                       3263

Dear Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, Chair Westerman, and Ranking 
Member Grijalva:

    The Coalition of Large Tribes (COLT) is an intertribal organization 
representing the interests of the more than 50 tribes with reservations 
of 100,000 acres or more, constituting more than 95 percent of Indian 
lands in the United States and encompassing approximately one half of 
the Native American population. We write now to voice our opposition to 
H.R. 6180/S.3263. As an organization representing multiple tribes, we 
are concerned that this legislation wrongfully seeks to benefit one 
tribe and will set a precedent that harms hundreds of others. For this 
reason, we oppose this proposed legislation.
    To be sure, how to address the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in 
Carcieri v. Salazar has generated a good deal of debate and controversy 
over the last sixteen years. While many may disagree on how to 
effectuate a proper Carcieri fix, we believe strongly that the solution 
is not singling out one tribe for favorable treatment to the detriment 
of others. The Court's Carcieri decision affects a multitude of tribes, 
and yet this proposed legislation seeks only to help the tribe that 
already has the most resources. No doubt, should this proposed 
legislation become law, the multitude of other tribes excluded from 
this legislation-whose need for a Carcieri fix is much greater-will be 
left at a significant disadvantage. The passage of single-tribe 
legislation will inevitably diminish the political will to achieve 
additional Carcieri fixes, and it sets a precedent that will require 
every affected tribe to seek to address Carcieri through individual 
legislation. There is no justification for passing a one-off piece of 
legislation to help the wealthiest of tribes when Indian Country and 
Congress should be working together towards a solution that will help 
all tribes affected by the Court's decision in Carcieri.
    Second, the passage of this legislation would also set a dangerous 
precedent for sacred sites by rewarding the tribe that has used gaming 
as a weapon to destroy and desecrate the burial grounds of other tribes 
and, in doing so, incentivize more such acts in the future. There are 
many tribes negatively impacted by Carcieri that have not engaged in 
violations of federal law and have not defiled sacred sites listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places. Thus, if any tribe is to be 
rewarded in such an exclusive manner, it should not be the tribe whose 
course of conduct violates some of the most fundamentally basic moral 
codes understood by sister tribes throughout Indian Country.
    Finally, while we can all agree that a Carcieri fix is essential, 
the desecration of Hickory Ground in Wetumpka, Alabama, serves to 
demonstrate why any proposed Carcieri fix legislation must include 
protections for sacred sites located within the historical homelands of 
removed tribes. The heresy of Hickory Ground was shocking and 
demoralizing. It would be beyond shameful to create a law that invites 
the destruction of a Native sacred site protected on the National 
Register of Historic Places to happen again. Thus, any proposed 
legislation seeking to address Carcieri must provide removed tribes 
with the ability and authority to protect their sacred sites and the 
burials of their relatives within their homelands. We all agree that 
gaming is a critical form of economic development that supports tribal 
sovereignty and tribal self-governance. No one wants to stand in the 
way of a tribe's ability to engage in gaming. But there is no need for 
any tribe to engage in gaming on another tribe's burial ground. Thus, 
protections to prevent repeating what happened at Hickory Ground are 
critical to any proposed Carcieri fix legislation.
    Thank you for considering the position and perspective of COLT. We 
hope you will move away from H.R. 6180 and S. 3263 and instead focus on 
legislation that will benefit all tribes in Indian Country, not one, 
and that you will include protection for sacred sites in any land 
legislation. This is the unanimous policy of COLT and we hope you 
afford our views of our broad consensus the weight they deserve.

        Sincerely,
                      Hon. Marvin Weatherwax, Jr., Chairman
                                 ______
                                 
   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Lisa Murkowski to 
                           Hon. Bryan Newland
    Question 1. Please provide a summary of funding levels and funding 
sources appropriated to DOI and the Inter Tribal Buffalo Council for 
the buffalo program for fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2024.
    Answer. The Department of the Interior, through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs Tribal Management/Development Program (TMDP) has 
provided funds to the Inter-Tribal Buffalo Council (ITBC). The below 
chart details the amount provided, in thousands, for fiscal years 2019 
through 2024. The first row, ``ITBC,'' reflects base funding that the 
ITBC receives for herd development grant projects, salaries, and 
operational costs. The second row below reports additional funds that 
the ITBC has received from the TMDP to assist Tribes in the acquisition 
of surplus bison from Yellowstone National Park.

 Herd
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Inter-Tribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) was established in 1992 to 
return bison to Indian Country to preserve the historical, cultural, 
traditional, and spiritual relationship between bison and Native 
Americans for future generations. Since its inception over 30 years 
ago, ITBC's membership has grown to 82 Tribes in 20 States, which 
collectively comprise nearly one million enrolled Tribal members on 32 
million acres of Tribal land. The organization provides member Tribes 
with technical assistance in wildlife management and ecological and 
cultural enhancement services. ITBC offers assessments of current and 
potential Tribal bison programs and recommendations on fencing, corral 
and facility design, equipment, research, range management, herd 
health, and community awareness. ITBC provides education and training 
to American Indian bison managers and technicians. ITBC staff provides 
educational presentations and resources on bison status, restoration, 
and conservation efforts, as well as the history and culture of bison 
to the American Indian population. ITBC annually operates a bison herd 
development grant program that provides Tribes with funding for program 
startup and other bison restoration activities.
    ITBC employees work with the National Park Service and U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service to obtain surplus bison for redistribution to 
Tribal bison projects. Tribes receive bison for their programs at no 
cost, however, ITBC and other recipients do cover the transportation 
costs for bison from federal herds to their destination. ITBC also 
facilitates some transfers of surplus bison from Tribe to Tribe. When 
Tribes have excess animals, ITBC may assist bison partners with finding 
other Tribes that want the bison and determines the best location for 
the bison. As an economic development initiative for Tribes, ITBC 
employees work to develop markets for bison meat and products that will 
utilize bison from Tribes interested in participating in the program. 
ITBC procures bison from Tribes and sells the meat under the ITBC 
label. ITBC currently markets bison meat from the Tribes to the 
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC and is 
expanding to more customers. ITBC also works to support the efforts of 
United States Department of Agriculture to continue to offer Tribal 
bison meat in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.
    The ITBC provides supports to the Yellowstone Bison Conservation 
Transfer (i.e., brucellosis quarantine) Program, is an active partner 
of the Yellowstone Interagency Bison Management Plan, and participates 
as a cooperator in the Department of the Interior (DOI) Bison Work 
Group. The ITBC also provides technical assistance and services to 
member Tribes, including those participating in the Yellowstone Bison 
Quarantine program, by facilitating the transfer of bison from the 
Federal herds to Tribes.

    Question 2. Is it the Department's interpretation of S. 2908 that 
the bill will cover the costs of transporting mobile meat processing 
facilities by air or barge to places like Old Harbor, Stevens Village, 
or other rural and remote interior villages that manage bison herds? 
Would such authority need to be clarified in the bill?
    Answer. S. 2908 as drafted is flexible and broad so that Tribal 
considerations can be given to elect to use funds for bison and 
equipment transport costs.

                                  [all]
