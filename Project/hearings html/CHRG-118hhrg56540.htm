    SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

    TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Economic Development, 
Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
    FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public 
Buildings, and Emergency Management
    RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Disaster Readiness: 
Examining the Propriety of the Expanded Use of FEMA Resources''
_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, 
and Emergency Management of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure will meet on Tuesday, March 12, 2024, at 10:00 
a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to receive 
testimony at a hearing entitled, ``Disaster Readiness: 
Examining the Propriety of the Expanded Use of FEMA 
Resources.'' The hearing will examine if the expanded use of 
resources is impacting the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency's (FEMA's) ability to carry out its mission related to 
disaster readiness. At the hearing, Members will receive 
testimony from the FEMA Administrator, the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) Deputy Inspector General for Audits, 
and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

                             II. BACKGROUND

FEMA'S MISSION

    FEMA is the Federal Government's lead agency for preparing 
for, mitigating against, responding to, and recovering from 
disasters and emergencies related to all hazards--whether 
natural or man-made.\1\ FEMA's primary authority in carrying 
out these functions stems from the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) (P.L. 100-
707, as amended).\2\ The Stafford Act authorizes three types of 
declarations: (1) major disaster declarations; (2) emergency 
declarations; and (3) fire management grant (FMAG) 
declarations.\3\ The Stafford Act authorizes the President to 
approve states' requests for a Federal disaster declaration 
when ``the situation is of such severity and magnitude that 
effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and 
affected local governments.'' \4\

THE CURRENT STATE OF DISASTERS

    In 2023, FEMA provided assistance for 84 presidentially 
declared emergencies and major disasters which included: the 
Maui wildfire, Hurricane Lee, Typhoon Mawar, and multiple 
tornados that impacted many southern and central states.\5\ 
While 2020 holds the all-time record for presidentially 
declared emergencies and major disasters due to declarations 
related to COVID-19, at 230, last year's disasters accounted 
for an estimated $92.9 billion in damages.\6\ Between 2014 and 
2021, FEMA's National Incident Management Assistance Team 
(IMAT) was deployed twelve times for non-Stafford Act 
disasters, events that have not been granted a fire management 
assistance grant, emergency declaration or major disaster 
declaration, but the President or DHS Secretary has directed 
FEMA to assist with response efforts. Five of those deployments 
occurred in 2021.\7\ In 2022 and 2023, FEMA was deployed eleven 
times for non-Stafford Act disasters.\8\

THE FEMA WORKFORCE

    Amidst the increasing demands placed on FEMA to respond to 
non-Stafford Act disasters, FEMA is also currently facing a 
workforce shortage. In March 2023, GAO published a report 
entitled, FEMA Disaster Workforce: Actions Needed to Improve 
Hiring Data and Address Staffing Gaps, which analyzed FEMA's 
disaster workforce in Fiscal Years (FYs) 2019 through 2022.\9\ 
The report found that during that timeframe, FEMA consistently 
had a staffing gap for its disaster workforce. In FY 2022, 
FEMA's staffing target for disaster employees was 17,670. At 
the time of GAO's report, FEMA had 11,400 disaster employees, 
showing a staffing gap of 35 percent.\10\

Improve Hiring Data and Address Staffing Gaps (May 2023), available at 
https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105663.pdf.
    \10\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In response to GAO's report, FEMA officials, ``attributed 
recent staffing gaps to multiple factors. These included 
additional responsibilities due to COVID-19 and managing the 
rising disaster activity during the year, which increased 
burnout and employee attrition.'' \11\ In conclusion, the 
report found that while FEMA had taken steps to address the 
staffing gap, GAO found it difficult to determine if those 
efforts had been successful.\12\

NON-STAFFORD ACT NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM (IMAT)

    The President's Budget Request for FY 2023 highlights the 
increasing pressure being put on FEMA to respond to non-
Stafford Act disasters. The request included $4.3 million for 
FEMA to establish a non-Stafford Act National Incident 
Management Assistance Team (IMAT).\13\ The budget justification 
asserted this new National IMAT would, ``allow the Department 
and FEMA to meet the increasing need for non-Stafford Act 
incident management support. It will also reduce the 
operational risk to FEMA's ability to respond to Stafford Act 
incidents.'' \14\

Operation Allies Welcome as examples of past events that new 
National IMAT employees would be expected to respond to.\16\

                     III. THE EXPANDED ROLE OF FEMA

COVID-19 RESPONSE

    Beginning on January 31, 2020, a Nationwide public health 
emergency was declared in the United States for a novel 
coronavirus, COVID-19.\17\ On March 13, 2020, the President 
declared a Nationwide emergency under the Stafford Act. Six 
days later, on March 19, 2020, FEMA was appointed to lead the 
Federal response to COVID-19.\18\ For the first time in 
history, 57 major disaster declarations were issued for all 
states, the District of Columbia, and United States 
territories.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This also represented the first time in history that FEMA 
led the Federal Government's response to a health crisis.\20\ 
Once FEMA assumed the role as lead Federal agency, operational 
task forces previously under the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) were transferred to FEMA.\21\ Those task forces 
included: Community Based Testing; Data Management; Laboratory 
Diagnostics; Healthcare System Resilience; Medical 
Countermeasures; Supply Chain Stabilization; Community 
Mitigation Measures; and Continuity of Operations.\22\ 
Additionally, the FEMA Administrator helped oversee the 
coordinated Federal response by serving on the White House 
Coronavirus Task Force.\23\

THE SOUTHERN BORDER

    In recent years, FEMA has been repeatedly called upon to 
help assist with the crisis at the Southern Border, 
specifically on the issue of unaccompanied minors. In response 
to the increased number of unaccompanied minors in 2014, the 
FEMA Administrator was directed to serve as the Federal 
Coordinating Official for the Unified Coordination Group, which 
provided the children with housing, care, medical treatment, 
and transportation.\31\ In 2019, DHS informed Congress of plans 
to reprogram appropriations in the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) 
base account to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\32\ 
Most recently, from March 13, 2021, through June 11, 2021, FEMA 
coordinated with HHS to provide shelter, beds, and other 
supplies to unaccompanied minors.\33\ As reported by DHS OIG, 
HHS and FEMA, the Agency provided shelter to close to 27,000 
unaccompanied minors during that time period.\34\

    FEMA also provides assistance at the Southwest Border 
through the Emergency Food and Shelter Program--Humanitarian 
Relief (EFSP-H). This is not to be confused with EFSP funding, 
which Congress established in 1983 to provide individuals or 
families experiencing homelessness or hunger.\35\ Starting in 
2019, Congress first authorized and appropriated funding for 
EFSP-H which provides, ``food, shelter, and services to 
individuals and families encountered by the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security who entered through the Southwestern Border 
and who are now awaiting their immigration court proceedings.'' 
\36\ Between 2019 and 2023, EFSP-H has received $715 
million.\37\ In 2023, Congress appropriated $800 million to 
establish and fund a new Shelter and Services Program (SSP) to 
replace EFSP-H.\38\

OPERATION ALLIES WELCOME

OIG-22-72: A Review of FEMA Funding for Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) Response and Relief

    This report reviewed COVID-19 pandemic relief funds 
provided to communities in six different geographic locations: 
Springfield, MA; Coeur D'Alene, ID; Sheridan County, NE; Marion 
County, GA; White Earth Nation in Minnesota; and Jicarilla 
Apache Nation in New Mexico. At the time of the review, FEMA 
had provided $49.3 million in COVID-19 funding to these 
communities. The review found that FEMA was inconsistent in its 
data collection, especially at the local level.\41\

Assistance Program

    This audit examined the implementation of FEMA's LWA 
program. FEMA provided the LWA funding to state workforce 
agencies (SWA) who then administered the funds through existing 
unemployment insurance (UI) programs. The audit found that 
because FEMA failed to implement controls over the payments 
that more than $3.7 billion in improper payments had been made 
through the LWA program. The audit also highlighted the fact 
that UI programs are susceptible to fraud and overpayments, a 
concern that the Department of Labor had repeatedly raised to 
FEMA.\42\

    This audit examined FEMA's management over the COVID-19 
Funeral Assistance, which is the largest funeral assistance 
program ever administered by FEMA. The audit found that under 
this program, FEMA expanded the universe of reimbursable 
expenses beyond what was previously established in FEMA's 
Individual Assistance Program and Policy Guide. As a result, 
the OIG found from April 12, 2021, through September 21, 2021, 
FEMA made an estimated $24.4 million in COVID-19 Funeral 
Assistance payments that FEMA's regular program guidance would 
have considered ineligible for assistance.\43\

    This report broadly examined the Federal Government's 
response to COVID-19. As it relates to FEMA's COVID-19 Funeral 
Assistance, GAO found, ``several gaps in FEMA's internal 
controls meant to prevent improper or potentially fraudulent 
payments, such as cases in which these controls did not prevent 
duplicate applications for funeral assistance or assistance 
issued to ineligible recipients.'' \44\ At the time of the 
report, GAO found that $4.8 million of $1.98 billion in COVID-
19 Funeral Assistance awarded to more than 296,000 approved 
applications had been paid out to duplicate applications.\45\

THE SOUTHERN BORDER

OIG-23-20: FEMA Should Increase Oversight to Prevent Potential 
Misuse of Humanitarian Relief Funds

    This audit examined FEMA's EFSP-H that provides assistance 
to individuals and families encountered by DHS at the Southwest 
Border. The audit examined how 25 local recipient organizations 
(LRO) utilized EFSP-H funds. The OIG found that the LRO's were 
not always able to provide documentation for the services they 
provided. OIG reviewed $12.9 million of the $80.6 million 
allocated by the National board. As a result, the audit 
questioned whether $7.4 million, or 58 percent, of the $12.9 
million reviewed, complied with Federal law and regulations. 
The OIG found that this lack of documentation resulted from 
FEMA failing to have proper oversight over EFSP-H.\46\

challenges with calculating and reporting consistent and 
accurate timeframes for hiring to DHS. Additionally, the report

the statutes, policies, and experience of state and local 
officials related to a sample of nine disasters. The report 
found that the Federal approach to disaster recovery is

                             V. CONCLUSION

    In recent years, there has been an expanded use of FEMA 
resources to respond to unprecedented and complex disasters 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic and non-Stafford Act events 
beyond FEMA's traditional mission. As several GAO and DHS OIG 
reports have shown, the scope of COVID-19 and speed at which 
FEMA was expected to respond, resulted in a lack of oversight 
and the misuse of taxpayer dollars. This increasing demand also 
comes at a time when FEMA continues to struggle with staffing 
shortages in its disaster workforce. FEMA officials have 
acknowledged that staff burnout is a significant factor in 
staffing shortages. This hearing will examine existing demand 
for FEMA resources and what the role of FEMA should be in the 
future.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF PENNSYLVANIA, 
    CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC 
              BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

    Mr. Perry. I want to begin by thanking our witnesses, the 
Honorable Deanne Criswell, the Administrator of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency; Ms. Kristen Bernard, the deputy 
inspector general for audits for the Office of Inspector 
General at the Department of Homeland Security; and Mr. Chris 
Currie, the Director of Homeland Security and Justice for the 
United States Government Accountability Office, for being here 
today.
    I'm glad that's on your card. You probably don't want to 
say that every time you meet somebody.
    Today's hearing will focus on examining the propriety of 
the expanding use of FEMA resources and how it's impacting 
FEMA's ability to carry out its core mission.
    Fundamentally, FEMA's core mission is to help people 
before, during, and after disasters. More specifically, States 
lead the responses to disaster, and FEMA comes in at the 
request of the State if the State's resources are overwhelmed, 
or at least that's how it was supposed to work.
    Increasingly, however, it seems that States are asking for 
help in more and more incidents that States themselves should 
be prepared to handle, like snowstorms in the Northeast.
    So, we have an increasing reliance on the Federal 
Government and then we add that FEMA is also being tasked to 
manage nontraditional disasters like pandemics, and help with 
issues completely unrelated to its mission, or so-called non-
Stafford Act disasters.
    Between 2014 and 2020, FEMA was deployed seven times to 
address non-Stafford Act disasters. In just the last 3 years, 
that has jumped to 16 non-Stafford Act disasters. These 
included the crisis at our Nation's southwest border, Operation 
Allies Welcome, Operation Vaccinate Our Workforce, and the list 
goes on.
    There is such an increasing demand on the Agency that FEMA 
created a new National Incident Management Assistance Team to 
respond to disasters that fall outside FEMA's typical mission 
set.
    In addition to being called on to address these non-
Stafford Act disasters, from 2020 to 2023, FEMA also led the 
Federal Government's response to COVID-19. To date, as it 
relates to COVID-19, FEMA has obligated $75 billion in Public 
Assistance, $44.3 billion for Individual Assistance, $36.5 
billion for Lost Wages Assistance, and $3.1 billion for the 
COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program.
    Not surprisingly, with all this money flowing out, the DHS 
IG found billions in fraud and improper payments, sadly. In the 
Lost Wages Assistance Program alone, the DHS OIG estimated more 
than $3.7 billion, that's billion with a ``b,'' in improper 
payments.
    It got to the point that the OIG set up a COVID Fraud Unit, 
and stealing FEMA funding became a crime of convenience for 
criminal organizations, including related crimes like identity 
theft.
    What's more, FEMA has continued to defend the 
administration of the Lost Wages Assistance Program, going as 
far as to say that sufficient internal controls were 
implemented. The fact that FEMA has failed to implement more 
controls raises serious concerns about FEMA's recently 
announced interim rule, which would make significant changes to 
FEMA's Individual Assistance Program.
    Some of the most shocking changes include giving households 
$750 cash payments, paying individuals upfront for housing 
options of their choice, and providing upfront payments to 
individuals who are choosing to stay with family and friends. 
And I think we will get into this under a self-certification 
circumstance. Many of these changes ignore some of the 
inspector general's key recommendations to reduce fraud.
    The question really is: where is the accountability in all 
of this? Why aren't States doing what they need to do to budget 
for these costs? Where is the expectation that States, local 
governments, and individuals carry insurance?
    How are these added responsibilities on FEMA impacting its 
core mission, especially since we know, from the GAO, that FEMA 
has a workforce shortage that seems, from my count, to be 
pretty prolific?
    FEMA can't be all things to all people. We have to get a 
handle on the proper role of FEMA and ensure FEMA's internal 
controls reduce fraud and misuse of taxpayer funds.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on these 
issues.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHARICE DAVIDS OF KANSAS, VICE 
 RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC 
              BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

    Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you, Chairman.
    And I want to extend a thanks to our witnesses for joining 
us today to discuss FEMA readiness and the cause of the 
expanded use of FEMA resources.
    Climate change and related severe weather events have 
changed the disaster landscape and strained capacity and 
resources at local, State, and the Federal level. Government 
and insurance industry data show that disasters are more 
expensive and have greater impact than ever before. To be 
disaster ready, FEMA must acknowledge the strains climate 
change is placing on its programs and develop strategies to 
adapt.
    The FEMA workforce is the backbone of the Agency's programs 
and is key to enabling proper disaster planning and a 
successful response in those disasters, but additional work is 
needed to strengthen that workforce. A recent GAO report found 
that FEMA has fallen short of its yearly staffing targets since 
2019. As disasters grow increasingly frequent and complex, it's 
important that skilled personnel are at FEMA to ensure that the 
Agency can fulfill its mission.
    I would be remiss to not highlight the capacity challenges 
experienced by State and local emergency managers whose 
obligations have been stressed by the increase of complex 
climate and weather disasters is impacting their communities. 
Many are managing recoveries for multiple events and submitting 
reimbursements for multiple Federal disaster declarations. Even 
then, State and local governments are expanding the breadth of 
tasks their managers are being asked to support. It's critical 
that the Federal Government recognizes the magnitude of 
emergency managers' workloads and support policies that are 
going to provide adequate funding and resources to the 
essential workforce.
    The ultimate goal of our work is to protect communities and 
to ease the burden of disaster survivors. Natural disasters 
amplify existing disparities in our society, and it should go 
without saying that the Government must address the needs of 
every American equally during recovery. Some of our most 
vulnerable populations, however, have been neglected.
    As such, I commend Administrator Criswell for the 
publication of FEMA's new interim final rule for the Individual 
Assistance Program. This rule acknowledges the documented 
shortcomings of FEMA's assistance for disaster survivors and 
will help the Agency do everything it can, within existing law, 
to close those assistance gaps.
    But FEMA cannot do everything alone. Congress has to do our 
part, and I am glad that we are having this conversation today 
to better support Americans that have been impacted, both 
physically and financially, by severe weather events.
    Administrator, thank you to you and your colleagues for 
rising to the challenges that our evolving disaster landscape 
has led to and the increase in scope and complexity of your 
mission. And I look forward to the conversation today and 
moving forward with all the witnesses on solutions that are 
going to help emergency managers continue their essential work 
and help guarantee public safety.
    Thank you, and I yield back.

now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. 
Larsen, for 5 minutes.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING 
     MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Perry and 
Ranking Member Davids, for calling today's hearing.
    I welcome the opportunity to discuss how Congress can help 
FEMA better fulfill its mission of helping communities before, 
during, and after disasters.
    Talking about nontraditional disasters, in an ideal world, 
FEMA would have never had to respond to a worldwide pandemic. 
But the worst-case scenario occurred, and FEMA stepped in and 
responded to the unthinkable, which is exactly what we expect 
FEMA to do anytime there is a disaster.
    FEMA's assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic kept our 
healthcare system afloat, provided life-saving medical 
equipment, administered unemployment insurance to help families 
keep a roof over their head and food on the table, ran vaccine 
sites that saved countless lives, and offered grieving families 
a small comfort through Funeral Assistance.
    The testimony from the Office of the IG says that a lot of 
money was lost to fraud and ineligible payments. And that's 
true. We have seen that, and we need to consider that.
    And it was lost when FEMA administered the COVID-19 relief 
programs, including the Lost Wages and Funeral Assistance 
Programs.
    Fraud is bad. We need to protect taxpayer dollars. But no 
program is going to be perfect when you are administering it in 
the midst of a global emergency and the randomness of COVID, 
especially an emergency as unexpected and unprecedented as the 
COVID-19 pandemic was.
    At a certain point, it's necessary to step back and see the 
bigger picture, where scrupulously accounting for every penny 
of disaster relief can result in such a long and complex 
process that a single mother struggling to survive is unable to 
access desperately needed assistance.
    FEMA has also stepped up when asked to provide humanitarian 
assistance for migrants. FEMA's role at the U.S.-Mexico border 
has not undermined its ability to respond to natural disasters. 
I support the mission of the Shelter and Services Program, 
which provides short-term humanitarian assistance, like 
sheltering, food, and medicine for individuals who have come to 
our country fleeing violence or in search of a better life.
    When people are suffering, does America stand by and do 
nothing? Or do we do the right thing and provide assistance 
that can save lives?
    Nontraditional disasters are not the only factor we should 
be considering when discussing disaster readiness. Climate 
change is making disasters more frequent, intense, and costly, 
straining FEMA's workforce and resources.
    In the 1980s, the country experienced, on average, a 
billion-dollar disaster every 4 months. Now, there is, on 
average, a billion-dollar disaster every 3 weeks. In 2023, the 
U.S. experienced climate and weather disasters causing $92.9 
billion in damage. This data shows that climate change is 
expanding the amount of work FEMA must do to carry out its 
mission.
    Investment in mitigation and resilience are proven to 
lessen the impact of climate and weather-related disasters and 
should be at the center of FEMA's strategy to assure readiness 
in this evolving world.
    Communities are vulnerable. Many infrastructure systems in 
the U.S. are at the end of their useful life. They are not 
designed to cope with the additional stress from climate change 
and extreme weather.
    That is why I am a supporter of the resilience investments 
that we made in the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law.
    I am pleased to see FEMA making climate change a central 
focus of its strategic plan while implementing these bills. 
FEMA's work is making mitigation projects possible in 
communities around the country. Funding for mitigation and 
resilience is not enough. FEMA needs a workforce that is ready 
to rise to the challenge.
    The FEMA workforce demonstrated incredible capability and 
resilience during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but 
future success and workforce resilience requires adequate 
staffing.
    I remain concerned with the Government Accountability 
Office's finding that a 35-percent staffing gap exists across 
different positions at FEMA. I am concerned about that, and I 
urge the Agency to prioritize recruitment and retention of a 
resilient and diverse workforce.
    Diversity is important because it will improve program 
delivery and the Agency's understanding of challenges faced by 
disaster survivors across the Nation, from rural Texas to 
northern Alaska, to Puerto Rico, to Maui and Lahaina, and even 
in the Puget Sound.
    The BIL made great progress in making our Nation more 
resilient by providing nearly $7 billion to help communities 
proactively prepare for disasters. Maintaining a resilient 
workforce, incorporating climate change projections into all 
FEMA's programs, and prioritizing investment in mitigation is 
key to ensuring our Nation's readiness to disasters.
    Administrator Criswell, while you have a difficult job, I 
thank you for the work that FEMA has done under your 
leadership. Your dedication to FEMA's mission and service to 
communities before and after disasters are building a safer 
Nation.
    I look forward to discussing with you and the other 
witnesses how we can work together to achieve disaster 
readiness and help the Agency achieve its goals.
    Thank you for being here, I look forward to your testimony, 
and yield back my negative 4 seconds.
    [Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress 
    from the State of Washington, and Ranking Member, Committee on 
                   Transportation and Infrastructure
    Thank you, Subcommittee Chairman Perry and Subcommittee Vice 
Ranking Member Davids, for calling today's hearing on disaster 
readiness.
    I welcome the opportunity to discuss how Congress can help FEMA 
better fulfill its mission of helping communities before, during and 
after disasters.
    Talking about non-traditional disasters in an ideal world, FEMA 
would never need to respond to a worldwide pandemic. But the worst-case 
scenario occurred, and FEMA stepped in and responded to the 
unthinkable, which is exactly what we expect FEMA to do anytime there 
is a disaster.
    FEMA's assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic kept our health care 
system afloat, provided lifesaving medical equipment, administered 
unemployment insurance that helped families keep a roof over their head 
and food on the table, ran vaccine sites that saved countless lives and 
offered grieving families a small comfort though funeral assistance.
    The testimony from the Office of the Inspector General says that 
money was lost to fraud and ineligible payments when FEMA administered 
their COVID-19 relief programs, including the Lost Wage and Funeral 
Assistance programs.
    Fraud is bad. We need to protect taxpayer dollars.
    But no program is going to be perfect when you are administering it 
in the midst of a global emergency--especially an emergency as 
unexpected and unprecedented as the COVID-19 pandemic.
    At a certain point, it's necessary to step back and see the bigger 
picture where scrupulously accounting for every penny of disaster 
relief can result in such a long and complex process that a single 
mother struggling to survive is unable to access desperately needed 
assistance.
    FEMA has also stepped up when asked to provide humanitarian 
assistance for migrants. FEMA's role at the U.S.-Mexico border has not 
undermined its ability to respond to natural disasters.
    I fully support the mission of the Shelter and Services Program, 
which provides short-term humanitarian assistance like sheltering, food 
and medicine to individuals who have come to our country fleeing 
violence or in search of a better life.
    When people are suffering, does America stand by and do nothing? Or 
do we do the right thing and provide assistance that can save lives?
    Non-traditional disasters are not the only factor we should be 
considering when discussing disaster readiness.
    Climate change is making disasters more frequent, intense and 
costly--straining FEMA's workforce and resources.
    In the 1980s, the country experienced, on average, a billion-dollar 
disaster every four months. Now, there is, on average, a billion-dollar 
disaster every three weeks.
    In 2023, the U.S. experienced climate and weather disasters causing 
$92.9 billion in damage.
    This data shows that climate change is expanding the amount of work 
FEMA must do to carry out its mission.
    Investment in mitigation and resilience are proven to lessen the 
impact of climate and weather-related disasters and should be at the 
center of FEMA's strategy to assure readiness in an evolving world.
    Communities are vulnerable--many infrastructure systems in the U.S. 
are at the end of their useful life and are not designed to cope with 
additional stress from climate change and extreme weather.
    This is why I am such a strong supporter of the resilience 
investments included in the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law.
    I am pleased to see FEMA make climate change a central focus of its 
Strategic Plan while implementing these bills. FEMA's work is making 
mitigation projects possible in communities around the country.
    Funding for mitigation and resilience is not enough. FEMA also 
needs a workforce ready to rise to the challenge.
    The FEMA workforce demonstrated incredible capability and 
resilience during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but future 
success and workforce resilience requires adequate staffing.
    I remain concerned with the Government Accountability Office's 
finding that a 35 percent staffing gap exists across different 
positions at FEMA and urge the Agency to prioritize the recruitment and 
retention of a resilient and diverse workforce.
    Diversity is important because it will improve program delivery and 
the Agency's understanding of challenges faced by disaster survivors 
across the nation--from rural Texas to northern Alaska, Puerto Rico, 
Maui and even in the Puget Sound.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made great progress in making our 
nation more resilient by providing nearly $7 billion to help 
communities proactively prepare for disasters.
    Maintaining a resilient workforce, incorporating climate change 
projections into all of FEMA's programs and prioritizing investment in 
mitigation is key to ensuring our nation's readiness to disasters.
    Administrator Criswell, you have a difficult job, and I thank you 
for all the good work FEMA has done under your leadership. Your 
dedication to FEMA's mission and service to communities before and 
after disasters is building a safer nation.
    I look forward to discussing with you and the other witnesses how 
we can work together to achieve disaster readiness and help FEMA 
achieve its goals.
    Thank you all for being here. I look forward to hearing your 
testimony today.

    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    I would now like to welcome our witnesses and thank them 
for being here today.
    Briefly I would like to take a moment to explain our 
lighting system to the witnesses. There are three lights in 
front of you. Green means go, yellow means you are running out 
of time, and red means it's time to stop.
    I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements 
be included in the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing 
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided 
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in 
writing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open 
for 15 days for additional comment and for information 
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record 
of today's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    As your written testimony has been made part of the record, 
the subcommittee asks that you each limit your oral remarks to 
5 minutes.
    With that, Administrator Criswell, you are recognized for 5 
minutes for your testimony.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. DEANNE CRISWELL, ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL 
   EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
                            SECURITY

    Ms. Criswell. Thank you. Chairman Perry, Ranking Member 
Davids, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to discuss FEMA's evolving role in emergency 
management.
    The committee expressed particular interest in two topics, 
FEMA's work on the COVID-19 pandemic and FEMA's facilitation of 
migrant related programs, so, I will focus on these in my 
opening comments.
    The field of emergency management has changed in recent 
years as the problems facing communities are more complex and 
interrelated. And as our field develops, so do the expectations 
of what emergency managers are expected to handle.
    COVID-19 is a prime example. On March 19, 2020, the 
previous administration directed FEMA to assume leadership of 
the Federal Government's coordinated response to the pandemic.
    For the first time in U.S. history, there were concurrent 
major disaster declarations across every State, five 
Territories, three Tribal nations, and the District of 
Columbia.
    FEMA rose to the occasion. During the early response, FEMA 
coordinated with the Federal interagency community to help 
healthcare systems across the country stay staffed and equipped 
so they could deliver lifesaving medical care.
    FEMA also provided financial assistance to all levels of 
Government to cover critical community services. Fast forward 
to January 2021, and FEMA's role continued to evolve, now with 
the focus on achieving President Biden's goal of administering 
100 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 100 days.
    We coordinated with Federal, State, local, Tribal, and 
Territorial partners to support over 2,100 community 
vaccination centers, and we were able to put 213 million shots 
in arms in 100 days, more than double the original goal.
    In February of 2021, the President directed 100 percent 
Federal cost share for eligible emergency protective expenses 
incurred by our State, local, Territorial, and Tribal partners 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic through July 1st of 2022. 
This included reimbursement for vaccination efforts, COVID-19 
screening, and personal protective equipment.
    The COVID-19 disaster declaration period ended on May 11, 
2023, and FEMA is working diligently to complete reimbursement 
of all eligible expenses.
    The scale of this historic event required FEMA to respond 
to the COVID-19 pandemic while simultaneously maintaining 
mission readiness for natural disasters. For example, in 2021, 
even as FEMA supported vaccination distribution, the Agency 
successfully responded to Hurricane Ida, the fifth strongest 
landfalling hurricane to impact the continental United States. 
The lessons we learned during the pandemic have made us even 
stronger.
    I mentioned that FEMA's work on the COVID-19 pandemic began 
during the previous administration, and the same is true of 
FEMA's grant work related to assistance to migrants.
    As you know, FEMA is not an immigration agency or a law 
enforcement agency. However, FEMA has a recognized expertise in 
executing grant programs and providing incident management 
coordination for both Federal partners and our State, local, 
Tribal, and Territorial stakeholders.
    In 2019, Congress directed FEMA to use the Emergency Food 
and Shelter Program to provide financial support to 
organizations that provide humanitarian assistance to migrants 
encountered by the Department of Homeland Security at the 
border. Congress made additional appropriations for this 
purpose in fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. In all, $715 
million was provided for humanitarian assistance through the 
EFSP Humanitarian Program.
    Through the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act, 
Congress directed Customs and Border Protection to transfer 
$800 million to FEMA and transition humanitarian assistance 
from the EFSP program to a new Shelter and Services Program.
    FEMA has executed this congressional direction and to date 
has provided almost $364 million to States, localities, and 
nonprofit organizations for this purpose.
    In addition to these grant programs, a limited number of 
FEMA personnel have intermittently supported the coordination 
of efforts by the Department at the southern border since 2014, 
including under the previous administration in 2019.
    At their peak in 2022, these efforts involved fewer than 
250 FEMA personnel combined. Regardless of the challenges that 
FEMA confronts, we will always prioritize the well-being, 
recruitment, and retention of a well-trained workforce ready to 
deploy at a moment's notice.
    FEMA is well prepared to execute its powerful mission 
statement: helping people before, during, and after disasters. 
Thank you.
    [Ms. Criswell's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal 
   Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
    Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you 
today about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) evolving 
role within the emergency management community. We value this 
committee's legislative support and oversight of our agency, and I look 
forward to our conversation today.
    The Committee expressed particular interest in discussing two 
topics at today's hearing: FEMA's work on the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
FEMA's facilitation of migrant-related programs. I appreciate the 
opportunity to dive into these topics today. The field of emergency 
management has changed in recent years, and emergency managers--at 
every level of government--are being asked to do more. The problems 
facing communities are more complex and interrelated. We are chief 
problem solvers, conveners, coordinators, and strategists. And as our 
field develops and grows, so too do the expectations of what emergency 
managers are expected to handle.
    COVID-19 is a prime example of these evolving expectations. As 
Members of this committee will recall, on March 19, 2020, the previous 
Administration directed FEMA to assume leadership of the federal 
government's coordinated response to the pandemic. For the first time 
in U.S. history, there were concurrent Major Disaster Declarations 
across every state, five territories, three Tribal Nations, and the 
District of Columbia.
    FEMA rose to the occasion. During the early response, FEMA, through 
coordination with the federal interagency community, helped health care 
systems across the country stay staffed and equipped so they could 
deliver lifesaving medical care. FEMA also provided financial 
assistance to all levels of government to cover critical community 
services like emergency medical care and the distribution of necessary 
supplies such as food, medicine, and personal protective equipment.
    Fast forward to January 2021 and FEMA's role continued to evolve, 
now with a focus on achieving President Biden's goal of administering 
100 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 100 days. FEMA coordinated with 
federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners to 
support the establishment and expansion of over 2,100 Community 
Vaccination Centers (CVCs). This included 39 federally led CVC pilot 
sites and the deployment of 18 mobile vaccination units to help reach 
traditionally underserved and more remote communities. With the help of 
our partners, FEMA exceeded the goal of 100 million vaccinations in 100 
days by putting 213 million shots in arms.
    In February 2021, the President directed 100 percent federal cost 
share for eligible emergency protective expenses incurred by SLTT 
partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through July 1, 2022. 
This included reimbursement for costs for emergency work, such as 
vaccination efforts, COVID-19 screening, and personal protective 
equipment. FEMA also expanded the activities eligible for reimbursement 
to support the safe opening and operation of schools, child-care 
facilities, health care facilities, non-congregate shelters, domestic 
violence shelters, and transit systems impacted by COVID-19. These 
changes were critical to protecting the health of communities so we 
could safely transition out of this challenging chapter in our nation's 
history.
    Simply put, the decision to cover 100 percent of costs, including 
the vaccination campaign, saved countless lives. During most of the 
pandemic, including during the darkest days in early 2020, I was the 
Commissioner of the New York City Emergency Management Department. New 
York City, ordinarily a well-funded, bustling city suffered--like many 
places in America--from plummeting revenue and increasing demands 
because of the pandemic. As vaccines became available, my team and I 
were involved in planning the historic vaccination effort--it was going 
to be intense, needed to happen quickly and effectively, and was going 
to be expensive. Staff needed to be hired, contracts needed to be 
issued, equipment needed to be purchased in order to safely receive, 
transport, store, and administer the vaccine. These massive expenses 
would not have been endurable without the federal government's 
financial commitment.
    The COVID-19 disaster declaration period ended on May 11, 2023, and 
FEMA is working to complete reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred 
by SLTT partners and other stakeholders. As of January 24, 2024, FEMA 
has provided more than $75 billion through its Public Assistance 
program. With the recent deadline for applications, we assessed the 
total number of healthcare specific claims and doubled the number of 
staff hired to help process our healthcare claims so we can accelerate 
reimbursements while also safeguarding taxpayer dollars against fraud.
    The scale of this historic event required FEMA to adapt to the 
unique challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic while simultaneously 
maintaining mission readiness for other natural disasters like 
hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or wildfires. For example, in 2021, 
even as FEMA focused on supporting vaccination distribution efforts, 
the agency responded to Hurricane Ida, the fifth strongest landfalling 
hurricane to impact the continental United States. FEMA also responded 
to severe winter storms across the central United States, which caused 
prolonged power outages for nearly 10 million people. This is a 
testament to the unwavering dedication of our FEMA workforce. The 
lessons we learned as an agency during the pandemic have made us even 
stronger and better prepared for the next emergency.
    I mentioned that FEMA's work on the COVID-19 pandemic began during 
the previous Administration, and the same is true of FEMA's grant work 
relating to assistance to migrants. As you know, FEMA is not an 
immigration or law enforcement agency. However, FEMA has a recognized 
expertise in executing grant programs and providing incident management 
coordination for both federal partners and SLTT stakeholders.
    Through the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian 
Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act of 2019, Congress 
directed FEMA to use the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) to 
provide financial support to organizations providing assistance to 
migrants encountered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the 
Department) at the border. FEMA designated this assistance as Emergency 
Food and Shelter Program-Humanitarian (EFSP-H). Congress made 
additional appropriations for this purpose in Fiscal Years 2021, 2022, 
and 2023. In all, $715 million was provided for humanitarian assistance 
through the EFSP-H program.
    Through the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations Act, Congress directed the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to transfer $800 million to 
FEMA and transition humanitarian assistance from EFSP to a new Shelter 
and Services Program, in collaboration with the CBP. FEMA has executed 
this Congressional direction, and to date has provided almost $364 
million to states, localities, and non-profit organizations for this 
purpose.
    A limited number of FEMA personnel have intermittently supported 
the coordination of efforts by the Department at the southern border 
since 2014 (including under the previous Administration in 2019). In 
2021, FEMA assisted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) in the setup of logistical operations to process the surge in 
unaccompanied migrant children. In 2022, FEMA also supported the 
Southwest Border Coordination Center, which provided incident 
management technical assistance and other support to CBP. Finally, 
along with staff from other DHS components, FEMA staff have 
participated in the DHS Volunteer Force at the southern border, in non-
law-enforcement humanitarian roles. At its peak in 2022, these efforts 
involved fewer than 250 FEMA personnel combined. These border missions 
were important, but they did not undermine FEMA's ability to respond to 
the COVID-19 pandemic or multiple natural disasters. The cost of FEMA's 
assistance was reimbursed to the agency under the Economy Act, which 
authorizes Federal agencies to provide goods and services, on a 
reimbursable basis, to each other. As of this month, there are only 
around 50 FEMA personnel supporting the southwest border mission.
    Regardless of the challenges that FEMA confronts, we will always 
prioritize the wellbeing, recruitment, and retention of a well-trained 
workforce ready to deploy at a moment's notice. We have both national 
and regional personnel at the ready to support lifesaving and life-
sustaining response operations, including five National and 13 Regional 
Incident Management Assistance Teams; 28 Urban Search and Rescue Teams; 
and 36 Emergency Communications Teams. But the vast majority of our 
23,600-person workforce consists of reservists. And I would like to 
again thank this Committee and Congress for taking a huge step in 
helping us recruit and retain reservists by passing the Civilian 
Reservist Emergency Workforce (CREW) Act, which extends to our 
reservists the job protections of the Uniformed Services Employment and 
Reemployment Rights Act.
    FEMA is well prepared to execute its powerful mission statement: 
helping people before, during, and after disasters. And we continue to 
adapt to the changing face of disaster management to meet the needs of 
the moment. I would like to quickly touch on two initiatives that are 
helping us evolve.
    The first is our recent announcement of revised regulations for our 
Individual Assistance Program, which will streamline assistance, cut 
red tape, and make it easier for survivors to access the assistance for 
which they qualify. These changes draw on lessons learned over the past 
20 years and hundreds of public comments that we received in preparing 
these regulations.
    The second is what we are calling the Year of Resilience. This is a 
first-of-its-kind campaign that will help our agency build resilience 
at all levels--federal to individual. While traditionally thought of as 
a response and recovery agency, we want people to think of FEMA as a 
resilience agency and to understand that we have the tools communities 
need to be more resilient, prepared, and ready before a disaster 
strikes.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward 
to your questions.

    Mr. Perry. Thank you for your testimony.
    Ms. Bernard, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.

 TESTIMONY OF KRISTEN D. BERNARD, DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR 
    AUDITS, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
                       HOMELAND SECURITY

    Ms. Bernard. Thank you, Chairman Perry, and members of the 
subcommittee.
    Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the Office 
of the Inspector General's oversight of FEMA's nonnatural 
disaster programs.
    As of September 2021, FEMA received approximately $98 
billion to assist the Nation with the challenges of the 
pandemic. The sense of urgency, amount of funding, and high 
volume of disbursements posed unprecedented challenges and 
risks for FEMA.
    DHS OIG responded to these challenges and risks with 
focused oversight, which revealed that FEMA's controls were not 
sufficient to prevent or deter fraudsters from exploiting 
FEMA's pandemic relief programs.
    From fiscal year 2020 to date, we've issued 18 reports on 
FEMA's nonnatural disaster management.
    In total, we found nearly $4 billion in unallowable or 
unsupported costs.
    We also identified $45 million that are funds that could 
have been put to better use. Our audits have consistently 
identified the need for FEMA to strengthen internal controls 
over its programs.
    Specifically, we've identified four key areas where 
additional controls are needed to promote efficiency and 
protect the integrity of FEMA's programs.
    First is ensuring eligibility for Federal assistance. Our 
audit work has demonstrated that FEMA did not implement or 
enforce front-end controls to ensure eligibility of recipients, 
which is a necessary means to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse 
in disbursement of COVID-19 relief funds.
    For example, we found that FEMA implemented the Lost Wages 
Assistance Program without sufficient controls to counter the 
risk imposed by allowing self-certifications for claimants' 
eligibility.
    This led to nearly $4 billion in potentially fraudulent 
payments, over $21 billion in overpayments, and even $400 
million in payments made without obtaining the required self-
certifications.
    Second is insuring allowability of costs reimbursed. Our 
audits have repeatedly disclosed that FEMA reimbursed 
recipients for unallowable costs. For example, during our audit 
of the COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program, we found that FEMA 
improperly reimbursed over $27 million in unallowable costs.
    Additionally, we questioned over $7 million in funds 
reimbursed by FEMA for the Humanitarian Assistance Program that 
were unallowable or unsupported.
    Third is program oversight. Our audits have disclosed that 
FEMA did not provide sufficient oversight of its programs to 
ensure they were meeting their intended mission.
    For example, we identified over $45 million in funds that 
could have been put to better use. This stemmed from grant 
funds for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program that were not 
spent and were never reallocated to ensure that they were 
timely used to provide assistance for those in need.
    And finally, the fourth challenge is ensuring consistent 
data practices. FEMA's inability to provide consistent, 
reliable data hinders oversight of its programs and operations.
    In one example, FEMA could not provide us with detailed, 
comparable data across its programs and regional offices, which 
we needed to support our review of COVID-19 funds that had been 
allocated across six geographic regions.
    Our audits of FEMA's nonnatural disaster management during 
this time have resulted in 56 recommendations that are intended 
to strengthen FEMA's management of its programs and operations 
when implemented.
    However, FEMA has not yet fully implemented our 
recommendations and, in fact, as of today, 20 percent of our 
recommendations remain unresolved because FEMA either disagreed 
or hasn't developed an adequate corrective action plan to 
address them.
    In addition to our audits aimed at improving FEMA's 
programs and operations, we also investigate allegations of 
criminal misconduct.
    In 2020, in response to the billions of dollars 
appropriated to DHS for pandemic relief, Inspector General 
Cuffari established a dedicated unit to investigate COVID-19 
fraud.
    To date, our COVID-19 investigations have resulted in 87 
convictions and more than $21 million in recoveries. These 
criminal actions underscore the urgent need for FEMA to improve 
the way it administers its programs to ensure the appropriate 
use of taxpayer funds.
    This concludes my testimony. I would be happy to answer any 
questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Kristen D. Bernard, Deputy Inspector General for 
   Audits, Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Homeland 
                                Security
    Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of the 
Subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department 
of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General's oversight of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including its non-natural 
disaster programs and operations.
    DHS OIG's body of work specific to FEMA's use of resources for non-
natural disasters has revealed that FEMA does not have sufficient 
controls in place to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. We have conducted 
18 audits over the past 4 years that identified overpayments, 
ineligible payments, and unsupported or unallowable costs totaling 
approximately $3.9 billion in improper payments. We also identified an 
additional $45.4 million in funds that could be put to better use.
    We have issued 56 recommendations designed to address FEMA's 
challenges specific to its management of non-natural disaster 
resources. FEMA's challenges to ensure financial accountability and 
safeguarding of taxpayer dollars were highlighted in our fiscal year 
2023 and FY 2024 reports on Major Management Performance Challenges 
Facing the Department of Homeland Security.\1\

    DHS OIG Oversight of FEMA's Management of Non-Natural Disaster 
                               Resources
    Historically, our disaster management oversight has focused on 
FEMA's response and preparedness activities for traditional natural 
disasters. However, in recent years, the increasing frequency and costs 
of disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events, have placed 
additional demands on FEMA. As of September 2021, FEMA had received 
approximately $98 billion to assist the Nation in addressing the 
challenges of the pandemic. The size of these appropriations, coupled 
with the need to quickly distribute funds, signaled an environment ripe 
for fraud. We increased our oversight of FEMA's non-natural disaster 
programs during FY 2020, to include COVID-19 relief and humanitarian 
relief efforts.
    Congress holds FEMA accountable for effective and efficient 
management of the funds it appropriates to ensure timely assistance is 
provided to eligible entities and individuals, in accordance with 
applicable laws and guidance.\2\ Our oversight of FEMA's non-natural 
disaster programs and activities demonstrated FEMA lacked sufficient 
controls to ensure eligibility for federal assistance and allowability 
of costs reimbursed. FEMA also lacked reliable data. The following 
selection of DHS OIG work demonstrated recurring challenges in FEMA's 
management of non-natural disasters, as reported by six audits on 
COVID-19 funds and humanitarian efforts.

    Lost Wages Assistance Program: In response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, in August 2020, the President directed FEMA to provide up to 
$44 billion in Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) from FEMA's Disaster Relief 
Fund to individuals unemployed/partially unemployed due to the 
pandemic. FEMA delivered these payments in conjunction with States' 
existing Unemployment Insurance Systems.
    We conducted two audits \3\ to determine to what extent FEMA 
ensured states and territories distributed LWA to eligible recipients, 
including DHS employees. As part of these audits, we reviewed payments 
distributed by 21 States, which represented 80 percent of the LWA 
expenditures. We concluded that FEMA did not implement controls that 
may have prevented the 21 States from distributing more than $3.7 
billion in improper payments. The improper payments identified 
included:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ (OIG-22-69) FEMA Did Not Implement Controls to Prevent More 
than $3.7 Billion in Improper Payments from the Lost Wages Assistance 
Program, September 16, 2022 and (OIG-22-73) More than $2.6 Million in 
Potentially Fraudulent LWA Payments Were Linked to DHS Employees' 
Identities, September 27, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet>  $3.3 billion in potential fraudulent payments,
    <bullet>  $21.6 million in overpayments to recipients, and
    <bullet>  $403 million in payments that lacked the required self-
certification.

    Additionally, we identified weaknesses in FEMA and the Department's 
controls to prevent the payment of $2.6 million in LWA for potentially 
fraudulent claims made by DHS employees or claimants who fraudulently 
used the identities of DHS employees to obtain LWA benefits. This 
included payments linked to 1,809 DHS employees who were ineligible or 
potentially ineligible for LWA benefits because they were actively 
working. In addition, we identified 167 employees who were eligible but 
at high or medium risk of fraudulent activity including identify theft. 
We referred employees with a high likelihood of fraud to the DHS OIG 
Office of Investigations for potential criminal action.
    These improper payments occurred because FEMA launched the LWA 
program in 11 days without clear guidance, fraud mitigation controls, 
and other measures to address weak underlying Unemployment Insurance 
(UI) program controls, such as self-certification, to determine 
eligibility and prevent fraud. We determined none of the 21 States had 
sufficient controls to prevent fraudulent activities or overpayments, 
primarily because they relied on self-certifications from recipients to 
determine eligibility. The Department also did not have the necessary 
controls in its Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program 
to ensure it had accurate information to determine DHS employees' 
eligibility.
    FEMA's practice of self-certification poses inherent risk for 
fraudulent claims. Without additional requirements or controls to 
corroborate and validate that recipients were eligible, these programs 
are vulnerable to a high risk of fraud. We had previously warned FEMA 
of our concerns with two prior audits related to Individual and 
Household Programs, OIG-20-23 and OIG-20-60, namely, FEMA Has Made More 
than $3 Billion in Improper and Potentially Fraudulent Payments for 
Home Repair Assistance since 2003, and FEMA Has Paid Billions in 
Improper Payments for SBA Dependent Other Needs Assistance since 
2003.\4\ Collectively, these two reports totaled more than $6.3 billion 
in improper payments. In these reports, we found applicants may have 
inaccurately reported no homeowner's insurance or incorrectly reported 
their income and dependent information despite penalty of perjury. As a 
result, we recommended FEMA establish and implement preventive controls 
to mitigate the risk of improper payments. The Pandemic Response 
Accountability Committee (PRAC), the U.S. Government Accountability 
Office, and the Department of Labor OIG also reported self-
certification as a top fraud vulnerability in administering 
unemployment benefits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ These two reports related to FEMA's oversight of disaster 
response and are therefore not included in the 18 reports since FY 2020 
that we identify as related to FEMA's oversight of non-natural 
disasters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite our warnings about the high risk of fraud, FEMA has not 
implemented preventive controls such as a system to test applicant data 
or require applicants to sign an Internal Revenue Service release for a 
copy of tax information to support individual assistance programs. On 
the contrary, on January 22, 2024, FEMA issued an interim final rule 
\5\ for its Individual Assistance program that will provide greater 
flexibility and expand the use of self-certifications, referred to now 
as self-declarations, for applicants to obtain funding in a more direct 
and expedited manner.

        Ineffective Controls to Ensure Allowable COVID-19 Costs
    COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program: In December 2020, Congress 
appropriated $52 billion to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to provide 
funeral assistance at 100 percent Federal cost share. In August 2023, 
DHS OIG reported \6\ FEMA had not administered the program adequately 
to protect funds from waste and abuse, as it distributed $24.4 million 
in ineligible expenses for this program. We determined:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ (OIG-23-42) Ineffective Controls Over COVID-19 Funeral 
Assistance Leave the Program Susceptible to Waste and Abuse, August 22, 
2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet>  FEMA expanded the universe of reimbursable expenses for 
deaths related to COVID-19 without providing guardrails to ensure 
relief was limited to necessary expenses and serious needs, as required 
by statute.

    <bullet>  FEMA issued an estimated $24.4 million in COVID-19 
Funeral Assistance funds from April 12, 2021, through September 21, 
2021, for expenses identified as ineligible under established FEMA 
policy. Examples of these questionable reimbursements include$2,800 for 
a horse and carriage, $727 for flowers, and $790 for a limousine.

    <bullet>  Each of the expenses we questioned are not allowable for 
deaths related to other disasters. FEMA did not provide justification 
for why certain expenditures were considered allowable for deaths 
related to COVID-19, but unallowable for deaths related to other 
disasters.

    <bullet>  We questioned an additional $2.5 million in costs as 
unallowable. Of this, we identified $1.3 million in assistance payments 
to multiple parties applying for the same decedent; $759,026 in 
payments more than the allowable maximum award of $9,000; and $591,805 
in unallowable costs due to inconsistent application of program 
guidance.

    Due to the unprecedented size of this program and the uncertainty 
surrounding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, DHS OIG issued a 
management alert \7\ during our review to FEMA leadership to encourage 
FEMA to take action that would prevent further reimbursement of 
ineligible expenses which wasted and abused taxpayer dollars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ (OIG-22-36) Management Alert--FEMA's COVID-19 Funeral 
Assistance Operating Procedures Are Inconsistent with Previous 
Interpretation of Long-Standing Regulations for Eligible Funeral 
Expenses, April 13, 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In our audit report, we issued five recommendations for FEMA to 
improve oversight of COVID-19 Funeral Assistance by strengthening its 
guidance and training provided to the caseworkers tasked with 
processing program applications; aligning future funeral assistance 
policy and procedures with statutory requirements; and resolving 
questioned costs. In its response to both our Management Alert and full 
audit report, FEMA asserted that it has broad authority to determine 
eligible costs for funeral assistance. FEMA did not agree with DHS 
OIG's conclusions and stated that OIG's recommendation would slow its 
review of applications and limit the funds FEMA could provide to 
applicants. FEMA also maintained that the costs questions by DHS OIG 
were in fact eligible and should not be considered debts owed by the 
recipients for erroneous payments.
       FEMA Lacked Reliable Data for COVID-19 Response and Relief
    DHS OIG conducted a study in 2022 \8\ as part of a broader review 
by the PRAC to determine the sources and intended purposes of Federal 
pandemic program funds, approximately $49.3 million, that FEMA provided 
to six selected geographic locations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ (OIG-22-72) A Review of FEMA Funding for Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) Response and Relief, September 16, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We determined FEMA provided data for each of its funding 
initiatives as requested, but in some instances, FEMA could not provide 
detailed data and/or supporting documentation. This was because FEMA 
does not always maintain data at the local level, some FEMA systems 
cannot provide program data as of a specific date, and FEMA did not 
follow a standardized process to obtain and generate program data. 
While this phase of the PRAC study was not designed to identify 
misspent funds, these data weaknesses prevented us from comparing 
program data across geographic locations and limited our ability to 
validate the accuracy of FEMA's systems.
    DHS OIG is currently supporting phase 2 of the PRAC study in 
reviewing FEMA's oversight of Federal funds for COVID-19 Emergency 
Protective Measures and recipient and subrecipient compliance with 
Federal reporting requirements.
   Insufficient Oversight of Emergency Food and Shelter Program Funds
    In March 2021, FEMA awarded $110 million in humanitarian relief 
funds to the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) as part of the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to provide services to families and 
individuals encountered by DHS in communities most impacted by the 
humanitarian crisis at the Southwest border.
    We conducted an audit in 2022 \9\ which found unsupported costs of 
$7.4 million in claimed expenses that were missing required supporting 
documentation. This included a local grant recipient not adequately 
supporting charges paid to a contractor conducting COVID-19 tests and 
other grant recipients claiming expenses without documenting the 
migrant families and individuals they assisted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ (OIG-23-20) FEMA Should Increase Oversight to Prevent Potential 
Misuse of Humanitarian Relief Funds, March 28, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Without additional oversight and enforcement from FEMA and the 
National Board which governs the EFSP, local grant recipients may 
continue to use the funds for services without providing the required 
supporting documentation for reimbursement, increasing the risk of 
misuse of funds and fraud.
    In an earlier audit of FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter 
program,\10\ we reported on other weaknesses in FEMA's management of 
the program. Specifically, we questioned $45.2 million in funds that 
could have been put to better use. This finding stems from the $58 
million in grant funds that were not spent from FY 2017 to FY 2020. In 
other words, when subrecipients were unable to spend their allocated 
funding, the Program's National Board was not reallocating funds in a 
timely manner to other recipients who had the ability to use the funds. 
We made 10 recommendations to reallocate unclaimed funds and improve 
coordination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ (OIG-22-56) FEMA's Oversight of the Emergency Food and Shelter 
Program, August 10, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      DHS OIG COVID-19 Fraud Unit
    In 2020, DHS Inspector General Cuffari established a dedicated 
COVID-19 Fraud Unit (CFU) to focus solely on identifying and 
investigating fraud related to COVID-19. The findings from the audits 
above were turned over to the COVID-19 Fraud Unit for further 
investigation to determine whether criminal charges were warranted.
    Due to the large scope of the potential fraud, DHS OIG used data 
analytics to identify large, organized fraud schemes--some of which 
resulted in millions of dollars being distributed to fraudsters. DHS 
OIG also used the Reemployed Annuitant authority provided by the Office 
of Personnel Management to hire retired criminal investigators to staff 
the CFU, ensuring we had experienced agents who were able to begin 
investigations as quickly as possible.
    Our investigations have identified instances in which recipients, 
by committing fraud, received payments that they were not eligible for 
under the Disaster Relief Fund. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
DHS OIG has received over 8,525 complaints and opened over 550 
investigations into COVID-19 fraud. To date, our investigations have 
resulted in more than 125 indictments, 30 criminal informations, 87 
convictions, and more than $21.5 million in recoveries.
    A sample of our significant cases in this area include:
    <bullet>  A Virginia-based supply company made fraudulent claims 
and was awarded a FEMA contract to deliver 6 million N95 masks totaling 
$38.5 million to protect employees and patients at various Veterans 
Administration facilities at the height of the pandemic. The company 
failed to deliver because they were never in possession of the masks, 
which resulted in felony charges for false statements, wire fraud, and 
theft of government funds.

    <bullet>  A New Jersey man was sentenced to 6.75 years in prison 
for schemes to steal California UI benefits and economic injury 
disaster loans. The fraudster filed for over 180 California Economic 
Development Department (EDD) UI applications in which he sought 
$7,500,000 in UI benefits; the EDD ultimately funded at least 
$3,403,656 of the total. The defendant collected personally 
identifiable information of numerous individuals from the dark web--
including names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers--and used 
their identities to file fraudulent UI claims.

    <bullet>  An employee of the Arizona Department of Economic 
Security, the state agency responsible for adjudicating COVID-19 
unemployment benefit claims, filed 66 fraudulent UI benefits claims 
while employed by the agency. This resulted in fraudulent payments 
totaling $32,580. The defendant pled guilty to a theft charge and 
received a sentence of 24 months of supervised release and restitution 
in the amount of $32,580.

    <bullet>  Multiple subjects in Virginia fraudulently filed 
unemployment insurance claims for 31 prison inmates totaling over 
$430,000. The investigation resulted in multiple felony theft-related 
charges and sentences ranging from 78 to 115 months incarceration, as 
well as restitution in the amount of $290,000.

    Many of the audits and investigations addressed in this testimony 
reflect collaboration with our external partners. For example, DHS OIG 
teams worked extensively with data scientists from Department of Labor 
OIG to obtain fraud indicators. DHS OIG participates on numerous task 
forces, and we are a member of the Attorney General's COVID-19 Fraud 
Enforcement Strike Force. We currently have special agents assigned to 
all three strike force teams in California, Florida, and Maryland, and 
we are assigning agents to the newest teams being developed in Colorado 
and New York. DHS OIG is also one of nine statutory members of the PRAC 
where we share information and model practices to help identify COVID-
19 fraud.
                               Conclusion
    DHS OIG's oversight of FEMA's use of resources for non-natural 
disasters has identified overpayments, ineligible payments, and 
unsupported or unallowable costs totaling approximately $3.9 billion in 
improper payments. We also identified an additional $45.4 million in 
funds that could be put to better use.
    Our audits have consistently identified the need for FEMA to 
strengthen internal controls over its programs. Specifically, we have 
identified four key areas where additional controls are needed to 
protect the integrity of FEMA's programs and prevent fraud, waste, and 
abuse. These include controls for:
    1.  Ensuring eligibility for federal assistance;
    2.  Ensuring allowability of costs reimbursed;
    3.  Program oversight; and
    4.  Ensuring consistent data collection, reliability, tracking, and 
reporting practices.

    The six audits highlighted in this testimony resulted in 31 
recommendations, or approximately 55 percent of the 56 recommendations 
pertaining to FEMA's management of non-natural disasters over the last 
4 years. The recommendations are intended to strengthen FEMA's 
management of its programs and operations. Many of the recommendations 
are aimed to help FEMA bolster its program controls, procedures, 
guidance, and training to prevent continued misuse of funds, including 
fraud, waste, and abuse. DHS OIG also has two ongoing audits and one 
planned audit that will continue our oversight of FEMA's expanded use 
of its resources on non-natural disasters. These relate to FEMA's:
    <bullet>  COVID-19 funding for emergency protective measures,
    <bullet>  Administration of the Port Security Grant Program, and
    <bullet>  Oversight of the new Shelter and Services Program.

    FEMA has taken action to fully address 23 (41 percent) of the 56 
recommendations. These actions address some of FEMA's risks by 
strengthening certain policies, procedures, and controls related to 
non-natural disaster related programs. However, far more remains to be 
done. As of today, FEMA has not completed action on 22 (39 percent) 
recommendations. Finally, 11 (20 percent) of our recommendations remain 
unresolved because FEMA disagrees or has not developed responsive 
action plans. In fact, over one-third of DHS OIG's recommendations from 
the reports mentioned above remain unresolved. DHS OIG, along with 
other oversight entities, remains deeply concerned with FEMA's long-
standing practice of self-certification of applicants. We continue to 
work with FEMA to emphasize the need to require additional 
documentation to corroborate that applicants are eligible, or to audit 
a sample of applicant data for accuracy.
    We appreciate the ongoing support of Congress and acknowledgment of 
our objective, independent oversight. Thank you for the opportunity to 
discuss DHS OIG's critical work.

    Mr. Perry. Ms. Bernard, thank you for your testimony.
    Mr. Currie, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your 
testimony.

  TESTIMONY OF CHRIS CURRIE, DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY AND 
      JUSTICE TEAM, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

    Mr. Currie. Thank you, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member 
Davids, Ranking Member Larsen, and other members of the 
committee.
    I appreciate the chance to be here today to talk about 
GAO's work at FEMA. I like to start these conversations always 
by recognizing the men and women at FEMA and the work they do 
every day.
    We get to work with them all the time; they're very 
dedicated public servants. I also respect that they're also 
always willing to improve. And before I talk about some of 
these challenges, I think that's an important point.
    FEMA is under increasing pressure every day to do more and 
more. States and locals are as well. It's not just the Federal 
level. The reason FEMA is often asked to do these additional 
things is because they have the funding, flexibility, and the 
capability to do them often when other Federal agencies don't.
    The bad news about this, though, is that it takes a huge 
toll on the Agency. And I just want to throw out some numbers 
just to illustrate this.
    In 2016, at the height of hurricane season, FEMA was 
actively managing 30 disasters. In 2023 last year, it was 
actively managing 71 during hurricane season.
    Staff deployments have doubled, too. Before 2017, they 
deployed about 3,300 staff a day. After 2017, that's doubled to 
about 7,000 staff per day. And so, this has a huge impact on 
the workforce.
    In COVID alone, FEMA had 59 separate disaster declarations 
across the country. So far, they've spent $123 billion total on 
COVID, and they expect to spend $144 billion by the end of 
September, the end of the fiscal year.
    So, that's more than Hurricane Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria so far combined. It's a huge number. And what's 
happened is this led to a shortage in the Disaster Relief Fund.
    Last year, as the committee knows, FEMA actually had to put 
many recovery projects on hold because the Disaster Relief Fund 
was running short on money. Congress then appropriated the 
money, but now they're in the same position as they were 
before.
    They now estimate there's going to be a $7 billion shortage 
at the end of this fiscal year. And I expect this to continue, 
mainly driven by the higher than expected costs of COVID.
    While it's hard to exactly quantify the operational impact 
this has, it has a huge impact on the workforce. As folks noted 
on the panel, last year, we found that FEMA was about 6,000 
people short of its staffing goal. That's about 65 percent 
operational capacity it was operating at.
    And while FEMA is always going to prioritize response 
efforts and lifesaving efforts, the impact that this has is 
really on the long tail and recovery projects that FEMA 
manages.
    Most people may not realize that FEMA is managing 500 open 
disaster declarations going back to sometimes 20 years to 
Hurricane Katrina still. So, it has a huge impact on the 
processing and efficiency of those operations.
    According to FEMA itself, it recognizes these challenges. 
These shortages have led to burnout and attrition issues. And 
part of this, according to them, was COVID-19 and the never-
ending disaster season that they now face.
    The last point I want to make is the impact these things 
have on other parts of FEMA's mission. One consistent theme 
we've been trying to drive home in the last few years is the 
need for FEMA to streamline its disaster recovery programs.
    We hear over and over again from State and locals that we 
visit that these programs are complicated, they're lengthy, 
they're very hard to navigate, survivors are often--they're not 
incentivized to pursue assistance because it's very difficult 
to get.
    And this is something we've been driving home for a few 
years now. And it's very difficult to focus on these additional 
challenges and improving when you're having to constantly react 
to additional responsibilities on top of additional 
responsibilities.
    And some of these efforts are going to require years and 
years of reform work across the entire country, and it's going 
to be very difficult. So, we think that's a very important goal 
of FEMA that they need to continue to focus on.
    That's my opening statement. I look forward to the 
conversation today. Thank you.

  Prepared Statement of Chris Currie, Director, Homeland Security and 
          Justice Team, U.S. Government Accountability Office
 FEMA: Opportunities Exist To Address Mission Challenges and Increased 
                                Workload
                               Highlights
Why GAO Did This Study
    FEMA leads the nation's efforts to prepare for, respond to, and 
recover from disasters. In recent years, the increasing frequency and 
costs of disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other responsibilities 
have placed additional pressures on FEMA.
    This statement discusses GAO's prior work and recommendations 
related to FEMA's (1) roles and responsibilities outside of natural 
disasters and (2) workforce challenges.
    This statement is based on products GAO issued from May 2020 
through May 2023, along with selected updates to address GAO 
recommendations, and updates from FEMA. For those products, GAO 
reviewed and analyzed federal laws, agency guidance, and other agency 
documents. GAO also analyzed data on FEMA's workforce, and disaster 
assistance, among others. GAO interviewed knowledgeable officials from 
FEMA; other selected federal agencies; and state, local, and 
territorial officials impacted by disasters.
What GAO Recommends
    GAO has made 24 recommendations in prior reports designed to 
address the various mission and management challenges discussed in this 
statement. FEMA has taken steps to address these recommendations. GAO 
will continue to monitor FEMA's efforts to determine if they fully 
address the challenges GAO has identified.
What GAO Found
    The increasing frequency of disasters overall and the additional 
responsibilities for responding to other events have stretched the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) workforce in unprecedented 
ways. GAO's work has identified various challenges FEMA has faced in 
its efforts to respond to these additional events.
    The scale and scope of federal efforts and funding required to 
address the COVID-19 pandemic tested FEMA's and other federal agencies' 
capacity to mount an equitable and effective nationwide response. 
FEMA's role included lost wages assistance; COVID-19 funeral 
assistance; public assistance to state, tribal, and territorial 
governments; mission assignments to other federal agencies; and mobile 
vaccination units. For example, GAO reported in April 2022 that FEMA 
had received and was processing more than 444,000 applications for 
COVID-19 funeral assistance since April 2021--when it began accepting 
applications--compared to the approximately 6,000 cases of funeral 
assistance the agency had processed over the decade prior to the 
pandemic. FEMA reported that as of December 2023 it has obligated $123 
billion in response to the pandemic and projected that it will obligate 
a total of $144 billion by the end of fiscal year 2024. In addition to 
the 59 major disaster declarations for COVID-19, as of July 2022, FEMA 
had about 500 non-COVID-19 active major disaster declarations in 
various states of response and recovery. At the same time, FEMA 
recently reported a projected deficit of nearly $6.4 billion in the 
fund by September 2024.
    GAO has also identified several gaps in FEMA's internal controls 
meant to prevent improper or potentially fraudulent payments in funeral 
assistance. In April 2022, GAO recommended that FEMA implement 
additional control activities to ensure that consistent and accurate 
data are available to prevent and detect improper payments and 
potential fraud. FEMA has fully addressed this recommendation 
implementing additional controls but as of April 2023 has only 
partially addressed the recommendation on data consistency and 
accuracy. Until FEMA fully addresses this recommendation, they will 
continue limited ability oversee and prevent and detect fraud.
    GAO's past work has identified longstanding challenges facing the 
FEMA workforce, which have been exacerbated given FEMA's additional 
responsibilities. Specifically, in May 2023, GAO reported that FEMA had 
a disaster workforce strength of approximately 11,400 employees at the 
beginning of fiscal year 2022, a gap of 35 percent between the actual 
number of staff and the staffing target of 17,670. FEMA officials 
stated that they faced additional responsibilities due to COVID-19, 
while also managing the traditional seasonal peaks of disaster activity 
during the year. This created burnout for many employees and increased 
employee attrition. GAO recommended that FEMA document plans to monitor 
and evaluate the agency's hiring efforts to address staffing gaps, 
among other recommendations. As of January 2024, FEMA has taken some 
steps to address these recommendations, including developing yearly 
hiring targets to ensure they are on pace to meet overall hiring goals. 
To fully address the recommendation, FEMA should finalize its staffing 
plans.

                               __________
                               
    Chairman Graves, Chairman Perry, Ranking Members Larsen and Titus, 
and Members of the Subcommittee:
    Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) mission challenges and the 
increasing workload and expectations on the agency.
    FEMA, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), leads our 
nation's efforts to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover 
from, and mitigate the risk of disasters. Under the Robert T. Stafford 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), the 
President's declaration of a major disaster or emergency is the key 
mechanism by which FEMA gets involved in coordinating and funding 
disaster response and recovery activities.\1\ The Disaster Relief Fund 
is a primary source of federal disaster assistance. In addition to 
providing assistance after natural disasters, the Disaster Relief Fund 
can be used to assist in response and recovery from other disasters 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  5170, 5191.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In recent years, FEMA has faced an unprecedented demand for its 
services and played a significant role in various disasters and 
emergencies. For example, FEMA played a key role in the federal 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic and responded to other emergencies 
such as the condominium collapse in Surfside, Florida in June 2021. 
FEMA also assisted with the February 2023 Norfolk Southern train 
derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, Afghan refugee resettlement efforts 
and at the southwest border as directed by the President and Secretary 
of Homeland Security.
    In August 2023, funding requirements threatened to exceed available 
resources in the Disaster Relief Fund. In response FEMA implemented 
measures to prioritize response and immediate recovery efforts, and to 
pause new obligations that were not essential for lifesaving and life-
sustaining activities. Such steps may be necessary again in fiscal year 
2024. Specifically, FEMA recently reported a projected deficit of 
nearly $6.4 billion by September 2024.\2\

additional responsibilities for responding to other events have 
stretched FEMA's workforce in unprecedented ways. For example, the 
number of disasters FEMA reported managing at the peak of the hurricane 
season more than doubled in the last seven years, from 30 disasters in 
2016 to 71 disasters in 2023. Similarly, the average daily deployments 
increased from 3,331 employees before 2017, to 7,113 after 2017.
    FEMA's role during COVID-19 and other events has raised questions 
about its capacity to handle additional responsibilities on top of its 
normal natural disaster workload. My statement today discusses our 
prior work on FEMA's: 1) roles and responsibilities outside of natural 
disasters; and 2) workforce challenges.
    My statement today is based on products we issued from May 2020 to 
May 2023, along with selected updates from FEMA's January 2024 Disaster 
Relief Fund Monthly Statement and FEMA's COVID-19 funeral assistance 
website.\3\ To perform our prior work, we reviewed and analyzed federal 
law, agency guidance, and other agency documentation. We also analyzed 
data on FEMA's workforce, and disaster assistance programs, among 
others. We interviewed officials from FEMA, and selected federal 
agencies, as well as officials from states, local jurisdictions, and 
territories impacted by disasters. More detailed information on the 
scope and methodology of our prior work can be found in each of the 
issued reports cited throughout this statement.

    We conducted the work on which this statement is based in 
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our 
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that 
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and 
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
  FEMA's Roles and Responsibilities Outside of Natural Disasters Have 
                               Increased
COVID-19 Pandemic
    We have previously noted that the scale and scope of federal 
efforts and funding required to address the COVID-19 pandemic tested 
FEMA's and other federal agencies' capacity to mount an equitable and 
effective nationwide response. We continue to be concerned about 
challenges FEMA faces managing a significant number of concurrent 
disaster operations--including for remaining COVID-19 assistance--and 
the demands on the Disaster Relief Fund. Our concerns about the ability 
of the Disaster Assistance Fund to meet demands continue. In addition 
to the 59 major disaster declarations for COVID-19, as of July 2022, 
the agency had 494 open non-COVID-19 active major disaster declarations 
in various states of response and recovery. We previously reported that 
the number of concurrent demands on the Disaster Relief Fund and the 
unpredictability of future response needs raised questions about its 
availability for the significant number of active disasters in 
different stages of recovery, including the ongoing recovery in Puerto 
Rico--one of the largest recovery efforts in FEMA history and other 
events.\4\ As of December 2023, FEMA reported $123 billion in 
obligations for COVID-19 and projected obligations to increase to $144 
billion by the end of fiscal year 2024.\5\ FEMA's COVID-19 pandemic 
response efforts are discussed below.

    Individual Assistance. FEMA provides Individual Assistance to 
eligible individuals and households who have sustained losses as a 
direct result of a disaster. For weather- and climate-related and 
earthquake disasters, many of these needs consist of sheltering and 
housing, and assistance includes repairing damaged dwellings and 
providing immediate and interim shelter for individuals whose homes 
were damaged. For COVID-19, Individual Assistance consisted primarily 
of Lost Wages Assistance and COVID-19 funeral assistance.

      Lost Wages Assistance. In response to COVID-19, the President 
issued a presidential memorandum that directed that up to $44 billion 
be made available from the Disaster Relief Fund to provide Lost Wages 
Assistance to supplement unemployment insurance programs.\6\ FEMA 
approved Lost Wages Assistance grant applications totaling more than 
$37.3 billion in grant obligations for 49 states, four territories, and 
the District of Columbia. As of April 2022, $36.5 billion had been 
expended by the state workforce agencies. This program resulted in 
particularly rapid expenditures from the Disaster Relief Fund. In order 
to administer supplemental payments for lost wages FEMA leveraged 
existing state unemployment insurance systems or agencies.\7\

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Aug. 8, 2020).
    \7\ A state's or territory's delivery of supplemental payments for 
lost wages was contingent upon an approval of a state's administrative 
plan, which describes the partnership between FEMA and the state or 
territory for delivering assistance. We have reported on unemployment 
insurance programs and their programs' susceptibility to fraud. See 
GAO, Unemployment Insurance: Data Indicate Substantial Levels of Fraud 
during the Pandemic; DOL Should Implement an Antifraud Strategy, GAO-
23-105523 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 22, 2022). For example, in December 
2022, we reported that measures and estimates indicate substantial 
levels of fraud and potential fraud in unemployment insurance programs 
during the pandemic. We found that based on formal determinations of 
fraud by states and territories, unemployment insurance fraud during 
the pandemic is at least $4.3 billion. However, this does not account 
for potential fraud that has not been formally determined as such.

      COVID-19 Funeral Assistance. We previously reported that from 
April 2021--when it began accepting applications--through February 
2022, FEMA received and was processing more than 444,000 applications 
for COVID-19 funeral assistance and had awarded more than $1.92 billion 
for more than 296,000 approved applications, as shown in the figure 
below.\8\ According to FEMA, as of January 1, 2024, there were more 
than 488,338 applications totaling more than $3.15 billion for 499,096 
decedents.\9\ Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, FEMA had processed 
approximately 6,000 cases of funeral assistance over the past decade. 
FEMA announced that it will continue to provide funeral assistance 
until September 30, 2025, to those who have lost loved ones due to the 
pandemic.

Agency, COVID-19 Funeral Assistance, accessed on Feb. 1, 2024, COVID-19 
Funeral Assistance. FEMA.gov

    In April 2022, we identified several gaps in FEMA's internal 
controls meant to prevent improper or potentially fraudulent payments 
in funeral assistance. We recommended that the FEMA Administrator 
implement additional control activities, where needed, and ensure that 
consistent and accurate data are available to prevent and detect 
improper payments and potential fraud. FEMA has fully addressed our 
recommendation on implementing additional control activities. In April 
2022, we also recommended that FEMA address deficiencies in the COVID-
19 Funeral Assistance data by updating data records as data are 
verified, and adding data fields where necessary, to ensure that 
consistent and accurate data are available for monitoring of potential 
fraud trends and identifying control deficiencies. However, as of April 
2023, the agency had only partially addressed this recommendation. FEMA 
officials noted that it has established a new payment integrity and 
fraud prevention section tasked with the review and analysis of 
potentially fraudulent funeral assistance cases. Additionally, agency 
officials stated that they were performing an audit of a random sample 
of applications intended to assess the agency's controls more broadly. 
While these efforts could help identify inconsistent data elements and 
lead to improvements, we continue to believe that the agency should 
make targeted efforts to improve the consistency and accuracy of the 
COVID-19 funeral assistance data to facilitate oversight and prevent 
and detect fraud.
    Public Assistance. FEMA provides disaster assistance through its 
Public Assistance program to state, local, tribal, and territorial 
governments, and certain types of private nonprofit organizations so 
that communities can quickly respond to, and recover from, major 
disasters or emergencies. After natural disasters, Public Assistance 
tends to be used for emergency cleanup and for permanent reconstruction 
projects--for example, to rebuild damaged public infrastructure. For 
all 59 major disaster declarations for COVID-19, FEMA authorized Public 
Assistance for emergency protective measures only. This included 
eligible medical care, purchase and distribution of food, non-
congregate medical sheltering, operation of Emergency Operations 
Centers, and the purchase and distribution of personal protective 
equipment. As of December 2023, FEMA has reported obligating a total of 
approximately $74.3 billion for thousands of COVID-19 Public Assistance 
projects.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In October 2021, we found that FEMA inconsistently interpreted and 
applied its policies for expenses eligible for COVID-19 Public 
Assistance within and across its 10 regions.\11\ These inconsistencies 
were due to, among other things, changes in policies as FEMA used the 
Public Assistance program for the first time to respond to a nationwide 
public health emergency. FEMA officials stated that it was difficult to 
ensure consistency in policies as different states and regions were not 
experiencing the same things at the same time. We recommended that FEMA 
ensure consistency of the agency's interpretation and application of 
the COVID-19 Public Assistance policy and require training to ensure 
policies are applied consistently nationwide. FEMA has implemented both 
recommendations. For example, to ensure consistency of COVID-19 
guidance, as of November 2023, FEMA has conducted continued outreach to 
all FEMA regions to further clarify and communicate Public Assistance 
eligibility requirements nationwide. FEMA also conducted trainings with 
staff to help ensure staff interpret and apply COVID-19 policies 
consistently.

offices located across the United States as follows: Region I: 
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, 
Vermont; Region II: New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands; Region III: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mission Assignments. FEMA issues mission assignments--work orders 
directing other federal agencies to provide direct assistance to state, 
local, tribal, and territorial governments--to support disaster 
response and recovery, which FEMA may reimburse through the Disaster 
Relief Fund. FEMA issued mission assignments to multiple federal 
agencies--the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor, 
Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Defense, among 
others--to assist in the COVID-19 response. For example, FEMA issued 
mission assignments to the National Guard to help set up public 
vaccination sites in some U.S. territories.\12\ As we reported in April 
2022, according to FEMA, the estimated cost for National Guard 
assistance totaled nearly $6.6 billion as of February 28, 2022.\13\

    Mobile Vaccination Units. FEMA personnel along with other federal 
personnel also ran mobile vaccination units that offered primary 
vaccinations, booster shots, and pediatric vaccines for children ages 5 
and above. All states, tribes, and territories could request mobile 
vaccination units. FEMA started 10 mobile vaccination units between 
December 15, 2021, and January 18, 2022; two in Washington, four in New 
Mexico, three in Oregon, and one in Pennsylvania. FEMA reported that as 
of March 4, 2022, the 10 mobile vaccination units had administered 
136,770 vaccinations.
FEMA Assistance in Sheltering at U.S. Southern Border
    Outside of declared disasters, FEMA has taken on additional 
responsibilities to help local communities around the country better 
manage the costs of noncitizen arrivals in their communities. FEMA's 
Emergency Food and Shelter Program has provided funding to 
organizations assisting individuals and families encountered by the 
Department of Homeland Security.\14\ In fiscal years 2019-2023, FEMA 
provided $715 million in humanitarian relief grants to nonprofit and 
governmental organizations that provided services to noncitizens.\15\

million for a new Shelter and Services Program that is to be 
administered by FEMA. Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 Stat. 4459, 4730 (2022). 
The Shelter and Services Program is to replace the humanitarian relief 
funding provided as part of FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program, 
which has provided funding to organizations assisting individuals and 
families encountered by the Department of Homeland Security. A portion 
of the appropriation for the Shelter and Services Program for fiscal 
year 2023 was awarded through the Humanitarian Emergency Food and 
Shelter Program while FEMA establishes the new program.

  Humanitarian Relief Funding, Nonprofit Spending by Service Category
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

  Note: Emergency Food and Shelter Program Humanitarian Relief Funding 
is provided as advanced funding and reimbursements. Advanced funding is 
 for designated nonprofits or governmental organizations that further 
  disburse the funds to local service providers in their area and may 
 also use the funds for services they provide directly. Reimbursements 
are payments made to nonprofits to reimburse them for expenses incurred 
  when providing services to noncitizens. In fiscal year 2021, of the 
   nearly $123 million distributed, about $113 million was advanced 
funding and about $10 million was reimbursement funding. Figure 1 shows 
the nonprofit spending of reimbursement funding on different categories 
   of services. Per capita represents a set reimbursement rate that 
 nonprofits can receive for each noncitizen they serve. Nonprofits can 
    choose to request reimbursement at a per capita rate instead of 
 requesting reimbursement for their actual expenditure amounts in the 
           food and shelter and medical and other categories.

    FEMA also assists in other DHS efforts at the border. For example, 
in February 2022, DHS launched the Southwest Border Coordination 
Center--comprised of officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and FEMA, among others--to 
establish a unified approach to the increased number of noncitizens 
encountered at the southwest border. According to responsible 
officials, the Southwest Border Coordination Center works with DHS 
field locations and nonprofits located along the southwest border to 
increase the efficiency of that coordination. The Center also works to 
build a network of nonprofits, cities, and counties located in the 
interior of the U.S. to further support noncitizens traveling to their 
communities.
  Increasing Workload Contributes To Continuing Workforce Management 
                               Challenges
    Our past work has identified longstanding challenges facing the 
FEMA workforce which have been exacerbated under FEMA's additional 
responsibilities. Specifically, we reported on issues related to: (1) 
staffing shortages; (2) workforce qualifications; (3) staff 
development; and (4) workplace morale. We have made recommendations to 
address challenges we have identified, and FEMA has taken steps to 
address our recommendations. We will continue to monitor staffing 
shortages and other workplace challenges as they affect staff's morale 
and FEMA's ability to deliver required assistance.
    Staffing shortages. Increasingly complex and severe natural 
disasters coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and responsibilities at 
the southern border have created an unprecedented demand for FEMA's 
disaster workforce. In May 2023, we reported that as of the beginning 
of fiscal year 2022, FEMA had approximately 11,400 disaster employees 
on board and a staffing goal of 17,670, creating an overall staffing 
gap of approximately 6,200 staff (35 percent) across different 
positions.\16\ This means that FEMA's disaster workforce was operating 
at 65 percent force capacity during the pandemic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ GAO, FEMA Disaster Workforce: Actions Needed to Improve Hiring 
Data and Address Staffing Gaps, GAO-23-105663 (Washington, D.C.: May 2, 
2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Figure 2: Staffing Gaps for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
      (FEMA's) Disaster Workforce, Fiscal Years 2019 through 2022
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    FEMA officials attributed these staffing gaps to the loss of staff 
due to the year-round pace caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
increasing number of disasters, a combination which officials said 
caused burnout for many employees and increased employee attrition. 
During fiscal year 2020, which included the beginning of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the disaster workforce lost 20 percent of its staff (over 
2,600 employees). These losses resulted in staffing gaps in certain 
positions, and an overall decline in force strength.
    Specifically, the Public Assistance cadre lost over 400 staff 
(approximately 16 percent) in fiscal year 2020.\17\ With the increase 
in staffing targets and reduction in staff, the Public Assistance 
cadre's force capacity decreased from over 100 percent to about 55 
percent during the pandemic. This cadre serves important functions 
including administering assistance to state, territorial, and local 
governments, a responsibility that greatly increased during the COVID-
19 pandemic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ Cadres are groups of FEMA employees organized by type of work 
(organizational or programmatic function). These groups are based on 
skills and experience and generally deploy to an incident at varying 
points in the response and recovery phases, depending on their 
functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We recommended that FEMA document plans to monitor and evaluate the 
agency's hiring efforts to address staffing gaps, among other 
recommendations. Such plans would help FEMA determine how effective 
hiring efforts are at closing staffing gaps and prioritize these 
efforts accordingly. FEMA has taken steps to address these 
recommendations, including developing yearly hiring targets to ensure 
they are on pace to meet overall hiring goals. We will continue to 
monitor FEMA's implementation of its efforts to determine if they 
address the challenges we identified.
    Workforce qualifications. In May 2020, we also reported that FEMA 
faced challenges deploying staff with the right qualifications and 
skills at the right times to meet disaster needs.\18\ Qualification 
status in the qualification and deployment systems FEMA uses to 
identify staff qualification status and skillsets, was not a reliable 
indicator of staff's ability to perform in the field. For example, in 
14 of the focus groups we held with FEMA staff, participants said that 
staff who were designated as qualified in FEMA's system did not always 
have the necessary skills for their position. We recommended that FEMA 
develop a plan to address challenges in providing quality information 
to field leaders about staff qualifications. In June 2022, FEMA 
developed plans to inform field leadership about staff skills and 
abilities, among other things. We also recommended that FEMA develop 
mechanisms to assess deployment outcomes. FEMA said it is modifying its 
force structure targets, with input from field leadership, and has 
implemented continuous data collection efforts. FEMA has fully 
addressed these recommendations as we believe these actions could 
better enable the agency to use its disaster workforce as flexibly and 
effectively as possible to meet mission needs in the field.

Deployment and Staff Development Challenges, GAO-20-360, (Washington 
D.C.; May 4, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Staff development. In May 2020, we also found shortcomings in 
FEMA's ability to ensure staff training and development for the skills 
needed in the field.\19\ For example, Reservists--often comprising the 
greatest proportion of FEMA staff in the field during a disaster--faced 
barriers to staff development and inconsistently received performance 
evaluations.\20\ We recommended that FEMA create a staff development 
program that addresses access to training, development, and feedback. 
FEMA has fully addressed this recommendation by, for example including 
process improvements for development opportunities, and creating a plan 
to consistently conduct performance reviews.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ GAO-20-360.
    \20\ Reservists are on-call FEMA employees that work intermittently 
as required during a disaster or emergency incident.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Workplace morale. We have reported multiple times that workforce 
challenges can affect FEMA staff's morale.\21\ For example, in May 2020 
we reported that planning managers in a joint field office we visited 
said that staff inaccurately designated as qualified in FEMA's 
qualification system were sometimes only able to complete half of the 
tasks expected of them, which hindered the cadre's ability to support 
mission needs. They noted that this affected morale, added to others' 
workload, and could turn a 12-hour day into a 14-hour day.\22\ 
Additionally, in September 2020, we reported that for several years 
leading up to our reporting, FEMA's call center workforce faced 
challenges using program guidance to assist survivors and struggled 
with low morale.\23\ In that report, we also found that opportunities 
existed to improve employee engagement and morale among these staff. 
Staff we spoke to consistently cited engagement challenges that 
undermined morale in all four call center locations. According to staff 
at all four locations, poor employee engagement from their management 
and supervisors resulted in pressures related to productivity, among 
other challenges, particularly since the 2017 hurricane season 
generated a high work volume for certain call center staff. Staff in 
all four locations stated they felt pressured to meet productivity 
standards, which conflicted with providing quality service to the 
survivor.

    We recommended FEMA use desirable characteristics of employee 
engagement--including performance feedback, career development, 
communication, and attention to work-life balance--while completing 
planned activities for improving morale. FEMA has since fully addressed 
this recommendation by implementing a Wellness and Morale program and 
providing additional resources, such as peer support and professional 
support through its Employee Health and Wellness Hub.
    Thank you, Chairman Graves, Chairman Perry, Ranking Members Larsen 
and Titus, and Members of the Subcommittee. This concludes my prepared 
statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have at 
this time.

    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Currie, for your testimony. We 
will now turn to questions, and the Chair will recognize 
himself for 5 minutes of questions.
    We already kind of have briefly discussed the ever-
expanding role of FEMA to include what I refer to as non-
Stafford Act disasters.
    And as I highlighted in my opening statement, they seem to 
be increasing every single year.
    Now, Administrator Criswell, I think that you are dedicated 
to your mission. I think your staff, your employees are as 
well, and I think that in many cases, you've got this huge 
responsibility that's almost untamable under your purview, and 
the people, like I said, are good people that are trying to get 
the job done. You don't have the resources. And quite honestly, 
I don't think Congress has helped you very much by throwing 
more at you, but you've taken the job, so, you're going to have 
to take the tough questions.
    One of the disasters we're talking about is the Nation's 
southwest border. The Biden administration and the DHS 
Secretary claim there's not a crisis, but, obviously, it's at 
least invoked some kind of disaster response, right? I mean, 
that's what we're talking about here.
    Can you tell us how much money FEMA has spent to address 
the illegal foreign national crisis on the border?
    Ms. Criswell. Chairman Perry, thank you for the question. 
FEMA's role in supporting the border operations has been 
limited to the grant programs that Congress has directed us to 
administer.
    As I stated in my opening statement, it started with the 
EFSP Humanitarian Program and now has moved into the Shelter 
and Services Program. That is the money that we have committed, 
is what has been appropriated for us by Congress.
    Mr. Perry. So, how much is that?
    Ms. Criswell. I can get you the numbers, and I'll have the 
staff get you the exact year over year. I know that's available 
on public record. I just don't have it right now.
    Mr. Perry. I mean, I'm seeing the Emergency Food and 
Shelter Humanitarian is $900 million; Shelter and Services 
Program is $425 million; the Emergency Food and Shelter itself 
I think is $775 million or something like that.
    The money that has been spent here, particularly by the 
charities that make up the board of the Emergency Food and 
Shelter Program, would you say it encourages--I mean, maybe not 
by design, but some people believe it is by design--do you 
think it encourages illegal crossings at the border by foreign 
nationals?
    Ms. Criswell. Well, what I can tell you, Chairman Perry, is 
that we are facing a broken immigration system, and----
    Mr. Perry [interposing]. I understand that.
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. This program that Congress has 
directed us to administer is providing relief to those border 
agencies, border communities, nonprofit organizations, small 
communities to help them with the cost that they are incurring.
    Mr. Perry. I understand that, but what I am saying is if 
you are on the other side of the border, and you know that when 
you come to this side of the border, you are going to receive, 
at a minimum, shelter, food, transportation, acute medical 
care, personal hygiene supplies, and everything necessary to 
manage that, does that encourage people to stay on the other 
side of the border where they have none of that, or does that 
encourage them to come to this side of the border where they 
get all that?
    Ms. Criswell. Chairman Perry, I am not an immigration 
expert on what the causes of people coming across the border 
are, but we will continue to support Congress' direction to 
help support those communities that are experiencing costs.
    Mr. Perry. All right. Well, I am going to tell you that it 
does encourage them to come. And, like I said, you are forced 
to, I guess, manage this program, so to speak.
    If FEMA was its own agency, outside of the Department of 
Homeland Security, do you think that it would still repeatedly 
be called on to respond to the disaster at the southwest 
border?
    Ms. Criswell. The role of emergency managers continues to 
get more well understood. And I would say the role of FEMA and 
our technical ability to provide coordination and 
collaboration, we provide that level of support to many 
different Federal agencies, not just the Department.
    Mr. Perry. No, I get it, but do you have a direct line to 
the President in times of disaster?
    Mr. Perry. Correct.
    Ms. Criswell. Right? You have direct, otherwise, you 
generally work through the Secretary. Have you had a 
conversation with the President regarding your work on the 
southwest border and the funds that are being expended there?
    Ms. Criswell. My conversations with the President have 
focused around the responses that we have been doing for 
natural disasters.
    Mr. Perry. Does it include the border?
    Ms. Criswell. Just natural disasters.
    Mr. Perry. Did you say just natural disasters?
    Ms. Criswell. Those are the things that I work with the 
President on----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. OK. So, you haven't had a 
conversation with the President regarding your role as the 
Administrator of FEMA and the money being spent at the 
southwest border?
    Ms. Criswell. I work through the Department of Homeland 
Security and the Secretary.
    Mr. Perry. But you have or have not had a conversation with 
the President? It should be easy.
    Ms. Criswell. No, I have not had a conversation with the 
President regarding the border. We are just administering the 
grant dollars that have been directed by Congress.
    Mr. Perry. All right. Thank you. My time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Larsen, for his 
questions.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    So, a report for the FY 2022 House Homeland Security 
appropriations bill directed the OIG to review FEMA's 
Individual Assistance Program and identify whether 
recommendations from oversight entities, including OIG, may 
have inadvertently led FEMA to develop policies and procedures 
that are overly restrictive and prevent disaster survivors from 
accessing aid.
    Ms. Bernard, can you summarize the IG's findings and 
explain how the IG considers the hardships that disaster 
survivors are experiencing and the need for quick assistance 
when issuing recommendations to minimize waste, fraud, and 
abuse?
    Ms. Bernard. Certainly. Thank you for that question. I'd be 
happy to.
    The work that we've done on Individual Assistance has been 
primarily focused on FEMA's administration of the Individual 
Assistance Programs in terms of its management and oversight.
    We have not done specific work to look at whether the 
administration was equitable or streamlined, but what we have 
found is FEMA should make improvements to be sure that 
applicants are eligible for the benefits that they're receiving 
and that costs are allowable.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Were the findings from your 
review incorporated into recent reports, including the 2023 
report on FEMA's COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program delivery?
    Ms. Bernard. I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Were the findings from the review 
incorporated into recent IG reports, including the 2023, then 
2022, report on FEMA's COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program 
delivery?
    Ms. Bernard. Yes, we did release, I believe you're asking 
if we released a report on FEMA's oversight of the Funeral 
Assistance programming. Yes, we did issue findings.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And were the findings from the 
2022 review that the Homeland Security appropriations bill 
asked for, were the results from those findings incorporated 
into your report?
    Ms. Bernard. I would have to check to make sure.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Great, thanks. I will say, 
reading your testimony just made me think that we have a pre-
COVID-19 set of policies and procedures that we're applying to 
a global pandemic response and perhaps they don't fit.
    But those are the rules and procedures that you have to 
apply when in fact, maybe they weren't the best things to apply 
to a situation where we're all scrambling to a randomness that 
came with COVID-19.
    Not that you didn't find legitimate fraud, waste, and 
abuse, but some of your testimony, though, talks about things 
that maybe in your judgment weren't allowable, but it's not 
really firm that it wasn't allowable.
    It's just that you or the OIG made a judgment about things 
as opposed to put it up against a hard metric.
    Ms. Bernard. I will say in conducting our audit work, using 
the Funeral Assistance Program as an example, we do use our 
criteria--the criteria is the Stafford Act and whether the 
expenses are necessary or allowable.
    So, we do have a very specific set of criteria that we're 
testing against, so, I don't believe the findings are open for 
interpretation, but FEMA does certainly have the latitude to 
issue waivers or to interpret its policies.
    I believe our findings--the key message was that FEMA was 
interpreting the Stafford Act requirements differently for 
COVID-19 deaths than it had for deaths from other disasters.
    So, we just asked FEMA to be consistent in its application 
of the Stafford Act.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. I try not to be too flippant 
around here, but to the family that spent $727 in flowers for 
their loved one's funeral, I'm glad they spent it on that.
    Administrator Criswell, in 2023, NOAA reported the damages, 
and I covered this, the damages from disasters totaled $92.9 
billion and 28 separate climate disasters. Can you give us some 
guidance on pre- and post-disaster mitigation resources and how 
you would better use them in order to deal with this increasing 
frequency of extreme weather events and climate change-based 
disasters?
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, Ranking Member Larsen.
    We are seeing an increase in the number and the severity of 
the severe weather events that we are responding to, which are 
creating more complex and complicated and costly recoveries.
    Our focus this year has really been to lift up the part of 
our Agency that does the work before disasters, the ``before'' 
part of our mission statement, investing in our mitigation 
programs like the Building Resilient Infrastructure and 
Communities, as well as our Flood Mitigation Assistance, and 
our post-disaster mitigation through the Hazard Mitigation 
Grant Program.
    These are three programs that can really help communities 
build to a level of resilience that they can reduce the impact 
that they can expect to see in the next 5 or 10 years, even 20 
years, from these severe weather events that are happening.
    But we also focus on individual resilience and helping 
communities become better prepared, so individuals know the 
steps that they need to take to protect themselves and their 
families in the event that they are in the path of one of these 
storms.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes Chairman Graves from Louisiana.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator, thank you very much for being here, and I 
want to echo the comments of the chairman. A job where all you 
do is deal with disasters is certainly a challenging one, and I 
question you and other people's judgment of taking that job, 
but thanks for your service anyway.
    I first want to see if I can dispense with two quick 
questions. Number one, you and I have had numerous 
conversations on Risk Rating 2.0. I wanted to ask if you would 
commit to give this committee access to the methodology for 
Risk Rating 2.0, as well as how levees and other protection 
systems are treated in determining rates?
    Ms. Criswell. Representative Graves, we will be happy to 
continue to provide briefings on the methodology that we are 
using for Risk Rating 2.0. I know that we have provided several 
briefings so far, but I am committed to continuing that 
process.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, briefings but not the actual 
methodology? FEMA is going to continue to not provide us access 
to that information?
    Ms. Criswell. I believe that we have shared all of the 
methodology and the techniques in how we are implementing Risk 
Rating 2.0, but I am committed to----
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. In addition to how 
protection systems are treated, things like levees are treated, 
in calculating the methodology?
    Ms. Criswell. Can you repeat that, sir?
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Including how levees are treated 
in regard to how they provide protection or lower rates?
    Ms. Criswell. They are definitely a factor in the risk 
rating calculation to determine what the premium is. Again, 
we'll be happy to continue to have these conversations on how 
the different factors are incorporated into an individual's 
premium.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I would very much appreciate that. 
Second one, look, the purpose of this hearing is to discuss, I 
guess, FEMA's sort of expanded role in getting involved in 
areas like dealing with illegal immigrants coming into the 
country and the shelter and housing programs.
    At home, we represent 750,000 Americans, and as you know, 
we have dealt with devastating consequences of hurricanes, and 
I want to thank you for coming down and touring the community 
with us after Hurricane Ida.
    We still have parishes that still have PWs outstanding for 
schools. We have parishes that have PWs outstanding for other 
public needs or I should say school boards, for the schools, 
particularly in Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes. We have 
Ochsner Hospital System that I think still has like a couple 
hundred million dollars in outstanding reimbursements under 
their PWs. They even went back and worked with RAND Corporation 
to use their methodology for duplication of benefits, 
resubmitted, still don't have anything.
    We have Thibodaux Regional Hospital, which was the only 
hospital system that was fully operating in that region during 
the disaster, that still has at least $10 million in 
outstanding PWs in category D and E, as I recall.
    Can I get a commitment that you will please prioritize the 
work on actually American citizens and outstanding debts there? 
This has a profound impact on their ability to provide 
services, whether it's teaching our kids if they're operating 
in substandard facilities or broken or shared facilities, as 
well as our hospital systems.
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman Graves, that is our priority. The 
priority of our Agency is to assist these communities that have 
been impacted by the severe weather events as a result of 
climate change.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Administrator, that----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. So, we will continue to 
prioritize that work.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Administrator, I would rather if 
you didn't say ``continue to'' because I feel like it hasn't 
been dealt with the urgency that it needs to be dealt with. 
And, just going back to the comments that the chairman made, as 
I recall, the Agency's been operating with about 65 percent of 
its staffing needs, and so, if you're being pulled into 
directions that do not prioritize Americans, then that clearly 
deprioritizes or it jeopardizes how our own citizens are being 
treated, and so, it does raise very significant concerns.
    Look, I am going to say it over and over again. I think as 
an agency of the United States Government, we need to 
prioritize United States citizens and their needs. If our 
hospital systems are waiting years for reimbursement, if our 
school systems are waiting years for reimbursement, I don't 
think I can go back to people at home and say, yes, they're 
properly triaging the needs of our own citizens.
    I can't do that, and so, I would just rather if you didn't 
say you will ``continue to.'' I just want to ask you to please 
redouble efforts to address the needs of our own citizens.
    Ms. Criswell. I will go back with my team and see if 
there's anything we can do to expedite some of the projects 
that you have mentioned, but that is our priority.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. Director Currie, I am 
out of time, but I do want to follow up with you on better 
synchronizing HUD and FEMA and other resources from disasters, 
and I will do that on the record. Thank you.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman from Louisiana 
and recognizes the other gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Carter.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank 
you to all of our witnesses who are joining us today.
    The ability for FEMA to adequately respond to all types of 
disasters is a major concern in my home district in southeast 
Louisiana.
    The threats to my district and our Nation are increasing 
each year as impacts from the climate crisis worsen, making 
storms more deadly and weather more unpredictable.
    Louisiana has witnessed major hurricanes, record heat 
waves, droughts, wildfires, and Mississippi River level so low 
that it threatened the drinking water in New Orleans and the 
metropolitan area that I proudly represent.
    Another looming disaster for Louisiana is Risk Rating 2.0 
and the rising cost of insurance, particularly flood insurance.
    Administrator Criswell, increased rates from the National 
Flood Insurance Program's Risk Rating 2.0 are exacerbating 
housing affordability issues in my district and may cause 
homeowners to opt out of the program altogether.
    In the past, Secretary Mayorkas has admitted that Risk 
Rating 2.0 is, in fact, flawed and needs some tweaking. What 
steps have been taken, if any, to fix these flaws and provide 
affordable flood insurance for all Americans?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman Carter, I appreciate our 
continued conversation regarding the policyholders in Louisiana 
regarding Risk Rating 2.0.
    I think the most important fact that I will continue to 
talk about is that Risk Rating 2.0 now bases your flood 
insurance premium on your actual risk. And so, while this does 
mean an increase for some homeowners, it also means a decrease.
    In fact, 20 percent of our policyholders have seen a 
decrease.
    However, as you and I have discussed, there is a certain 
group of individuals that are caught in this ``I don't have an 
expensive home, but I live in this high-risk area and cannot 
afford the flood insurance.''
    And we are committed to continuing to work with Congress on 
the affordability proposal that we have put forth as part of 
the NFIP reauthorization.
    We believe this is the best way for people to truly 
understand their risk, but also have the ability to purchase 
the insurance to protect their families.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Twenty-percent decrease----
    Ms. Criswell [interposing]. Across the Nation.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana [continuing]. Eighty-percent 
increase. I don't like those odds. I'm only talking about 
Louisiana, and I appreciate your mentioning a broader swath. 
But for me and Congressman Graves and the Louisiana delegation, 
other Members that represent areas throughout this country that 
are impacted, those aren't good odds for us.
    And so, I appreciate that. We are going to keep hammering 
home the danger and the catastrophe that it's causing the 
people of Louisiana.
    FEMA released a mitigation discount visualization tool for 
Risk Rating 2.0, but it does not show in actual dollars how 
this affects your premium. Can FEMA create a more comprehensive 
public-facing premium calculator so policyholders can see their 
rating factors and how rating factors affect their annual 
premiums?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman Carter, I'll certainly take that 
back to my team and have a conversation with them. I do believe 
that one of the benefits of Risk Rating 2.0 now is that a 
policyholder can sit with their insurance agent and put in 
different scenarios to determine what the impact will be on 
their insurance premium.
    But I'll certainly take that back and see what we can 
continue to do to increase that awareness for individuals to 
know what will impact their premiums.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. And I am going to come and further 
question as Congressman Graves just did relative to the 
algorithm, the methodology.
    I think everyone deserves to be able to evaluate and 
explore how you arrive at these numbers. And I get it. You've 
tried to work with us, and I appreciate that.
    I know you've got a very difficult job, but we do, too. And 
so, it's very difficult for us to stand before audiences and 
constituents and not be able to explain what methodology is 
being used to arrive at these numbers, many of which make no 
sense to us.
    So, and I know that it's been asked multiple times, and I 
know it may be--obviously, it's difficult to get to us, but I'd 
ask you to redouble your efforts on finding a way that we can 
better explain to our constituencies how you arrive at these 
numbers.
    And I've got just a few seconds. So, I want to, after a 
storm, getting people back into their homes is one of your 
Agency's most important priorities. Sometimes, but not always.
    FEMA can make repairs to somebody's house to get them back 
in quickly. However, this was often limited to prohibitions of 
making permanent repairs. How is this addressed in your new 
Individual Assistance Program through its regulations?
    Ms. Criswell. So, through the new interim final rule, we do 
have some expanded ability to do some repairs to homes. But the 
Disaster Survivors Fairness Act, which Congress is moving 
forward on a bipartisan level, will actually give us greater 
capability to do direct repairs to homes, as well as provide 
grants to States to help us along the way.
    I think the combination of both the Disaster Survivors 
Fairness Act, as well as our interim final rule, are going to 
really help individuals jump start their road to recovery in a 
more commonsense approach, for us to be able to use our funding 
more efficiently and more effectively.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. And so, the prohibition where a 
person can fix their home and make it even better, but they've 
been prohibited from doing so because it's deemed a permanent 
fix. Is that something that's addressed in these regulation 
changes?
    Ms. Criswell. We have expanded slightly the ability to do 
some of those repairs within the regulation. It will be 
addressed more fully if the Disaster Survivors Fairness Act 
passes.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, 
Representative Van Orden.
    Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Criswell, you mentioned in your testimony that you had 
several of your FEMA folks working on the southern border, 
helping with the illegal immigrants. And you've said that at 
one point you had 250; is that right?
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, sir. At our peak, we did not have more 
than 250 people engaged.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. You didn't have more than 250. OK. 
Great. So, what's the pay grade of those 250 people?
    Ms. Criswell. I would have to have my staff get back to 
you.
    Mr. Van Orden. Let's have a look at that please. So, let's 
just say they are 13's, you've got 250, that's $33.5 million. 
Did you calculate that into your cost of what you expended for 
the--I don't even know what program that would be.
    Is that out of the $715 million provided for humanitarian 
assistance? Did you count the salaries of these people?
    Ms. Criswell. The majority of the people that we have sent 
to support the southern border have been reimbursed to us 
through the Economy Act by the Department.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. So, they are being paid by taxpayers' 
dollars?
    Ms. Criswell. Correct.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. How many of these people were working on 
the southern border, immediately following the fires in Maui?
    Ms. Criswell. Immediately following what? Sorry, I didn't 
hear you.
    Mr. Van Orden. The wildfires in Maui, the most devastating 
wildfire in the history of the United States and the most 
horrendous tragedy that has ever happened to the State of 
Hawaii?
    Ms. Criswell. I would have to get back to you as to exactly 
how many were there at that particular time, but I can tell you 
that currently today we have less than 50 people out of our 
workforce of nearly 24,000----
    Mr. Van Orden [interrupting]. I got you. My point is this: 
if there is one single member of FEMA working on the border 
processing illegal aliens coming into the country when our 
Hawaiian brothers and sisters are without homes, that's one too 
many, and I think that you have lost your way. Are you familiar 
with the term ``mission creep''?
    Ms. Criswell. I am.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. Although, as you know, FEMA is not an 
immigration or law enforcement agency; however, FEMA has 
recognized expertise in executing grant programs. So, you are 
good at giving away taxpayers' dollars?
    Ms. Criswell. The expertise that we have, sir, is to bring 
collaboration and----
    Mr. Van Orden [interrupting]. Ma'am, this is your 
testimony. You are recognized experts in executing grant 
programs. OK? So, you are good at giving away other people's 
money. And I believe that if I read this stuff and I see how 
your Agency's been working in particular at the southern 
border, you are confusing emotion with progress.
    Ms. Bernard, I am looking at this stuff, and I see there 
are billions and billions of dollars that were fraudulently 
expended, right? And you say repeatedly, FEMA has interpreted 
these things. FEMA made these decisions. FEMA decided to do 
these additional duties.
    FEMA is not a person. FEMA is an agency. Do you have the 
names of the individual people that made these, I think, very 
poor decisions to expend billions of taxpayers' dollars 
fraudulently?
    Do you have anybody's names attached to these expenditures?
    Ms. Bernard. So, if I'm understanding your question, you're 
asking if we have the names of the fraudsters?
    We do have a very robust COVID Fraud Unit that's conducting 
over 500 investigations.
    Mr. Van Orden. Yes. I see that. I mean, the names of the 
people at FEMA that made these incredibly poor decisions. 
Because FEMA is--that's an agency, it's not a person.
    An agency is made up of people that make bad decisions. Do 
you have their names?
    Ms. Bernard. We do not have their names. No. But we have, 
generally, across the board, made several recommendations for 
FEMA to improve its ability to get money into the right hands 
and keep money from the wrong hands.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. So, you make recommendations to an 
agency, not individual people, so, the individual person is 
not--they don't even know if they made a good decision or bad? 
Is that right?
    Ms. Bernard. That's correct in this context, yes.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. Has anyone been fired for the misuse of 
billions of taxpayers' dollars, to your awareness?
    Ms. Bernard. I wouldn't want to speak to the outcome of 
investigations because we do have so many investigations 
underway.
    Mr. Van Orden. You can say no. To the best of your 
knowledge, has anyone been fired for misusing billions of 
taxpayers' dollars?
    Ms. Bernard. I wouldn't want to speculate. No.
    Mr. Van Orden. I'm going to take that as a no. Has anyone 
been disciplined?
    Ms. Bernard. Again, I would point to our investigative 
work.
    Mr. Van Orden. Has anyone been retrained? OK. Hold on a 
sec.
    Ms. Criswell, has anyone been fired, disciplined, or 
retrained for the misuse of billions of taxpayers' dollars, 
from your Agency?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, as it relates to the findings in 
the OIG reports and those, especially, that we have disagreed 
with, no.
    Mr. Van Orden. OK. All right. Then how do we learn? We keep 
doing the same thing.
    You people are spending billions and billions of American 
taxpayers' dollars fraudulently. And if I don't know who did 
it, we can't hold them accountable, and we are going to keep 
doing the same thing over and over again.
    This is why people hate Washington, DC. You people are 
giving billions of dollars that you throw willy-nilly around 
because you can, Mr. Currie, and you keep doing it over and 
over again. And we don't learn. That's why people hate 
bureaucracies.
    Ms. Bernard, you need to be empowered. You need to be 
empowered to recognize individuals, not an agency. And you need 
to be empowered to recommend them being fired and held 
financially accountable and put into prison for fraud.
    Ms. Criswell, you are the leader. You are the captain of 
this ship. And if you are not cleaning house right now, you are 
not doing your job, ma'am. Because you've been put--you are 
responsible for billions of taxpayers' dollars and thousands of 
people's jobs and tens of thousands of Americans' well-being 
and tragedy, and if you have leakers on your team, it is not 
going to work out.
    Sorry for----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    Mr. Van Orden. I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    Administrator Criswell, you mentioned the Economy Act that 
was used to reimburse. Is there an interagency agreement that 
we can see regarding the use of those funds? Is there 
documentation regarding that that the committee can have?
    Ms. Criswell. For anything that we would be reimbursed for 
the Economy Act on, there should be paperwork. We'll be happy 
to follow up with you.
    Mr. Perry. All right. We're going to formally request that 
at this time.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, 
Representative Stanton.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for 
allowing me to waive onto the subcommittee to discuss critical 
issues to my home State of Arizona.
    Administrator Criswell, when you were before this 
subcommittee last September, I raised concerns with the 
implementation of FEMA's Shelter and Services Program or SSP.
    As you know, Congress designed the SSP program to reimburse 
local governments and nonprofits that provide essential 
services to migrants after processing by border patrol.
    But inexplicably, FEMA hasn't prioritized border 
communities while allocating this funding. The southern Arizona 
coalition, a network of local governments and nonprofits, was 
only eligible to apply for a total of $12 million under this 
program, a fraction of the total funds available, while New 
York received 10 times that.
    It makes no sense. Arizona is on the front lines of the 
border crisis. In just the first 4 months of this fiscal year, 
border patrol in the Tucson sector apprehended more than 
250,000 migrants, the highest number on record, and now Arizona 
nonprofits are about to run out of their tiny slice of funding.
    Last month, I visited Casa Alitas, a nonprofit in Tucson 
that works with Federal law enforcement to support asylum 
seekers and prevent street releases. They do incredible work, 
taking in as many as 1,000 migrants a day and providing 
casework services that help asylum seekers find sponsors, 
reducing the flow of people seeking services from interior 
locations like New York.
    But without additional Federal funding, they will be forced 
to close their doors. A Pima County executive described what 
they are about to experience as, ``homeless on steroids.''
    I have been calling on House leadership for months to pass 
additional funds for this program.
    Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to add a letter 
from the Arizona Border Counties Coalition requesting 
additional SSP funding to the record.
    Mr. Perry. Without objection.
    [The information follows:]

    Honorable Members of Arizona's Congressional Delegation:
    Since early 2021, our border Counties have seen steady increases in 
the number of migrants crossing the border with Mexico seeking asylum 
in the United States. The past six months alone the numbers have been 
unprecedented, 271,000 border encounters in our four counties. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) reported more than 87,000 encounters in 
December 2023 alone.
    Under current provisions, CBP releases Legally Processed Asylum 
Seekers (LPAS) into our communities within 24 hours of their completion 
of the asylum screening process. Before 2019, the number of LPAS 
releases into our communities were minimal, perhaps a few dozen a week.
    Several charitable organizations, including some critical partners 
from faith-based organizations, provided shelter and transportation 
assistance to ensure a humanitarian treatment while the LPAS arranged 
for transportation to other parts of the country while they wait for 
the adjudication of their application.
    The attached report from Pima County shows how the LPAS releases 
have increased, month over month to unprecedented levels. To keep up, a 
coalition of nearly 30 organizations--federal, state, county and local 
governments, and numerous non-governmental organizations--contracted 
with dozens of private sector contractors to provide migrants with 
temporary shelter and travel assistance. Since 2019, more than 400,000 
people have been released in the Tucson Sector by the Border Patrol, 
with more than half of that number occurring in 2023. As of the date of 
this letter an average of 1,000 LPAS are being released per day in 
Pima, Cochise, and Santa Cruz counties.
    In the Yuma Sector, the state and Phoenix-area charities assisted 
Somerton and Yuma County mitigate the effects of releases there by 
transporting the releases to shelters in Maricopa County in addition to 
assistance by local NGOs.
    The efforts of this complex coalition have been entirely paid for 
with federal funds. To put it simply, since 2019, the federal 
government, through its immigration enforcement policies, has been 
creating daily humanitarian catastrophes in our communities. We have 
mitigated those daily occurrences through a cobbled coalition relying 
greatly on federal funds, but the situation has been tremendously 
taxing on our limited resources at the county and local level.
    As you know, federal funding will run out on March 31, 2024. We 
don't have the resources to continue this effort without federal 
funding.
    Without the funding there will not be any shelter from the extreme 
weather in our region, there will not be any food or other basic 
humanitarian services.
    By now, the nation has recognized that this is not a border problem 
or an Arizona problem, this is a national crisis that requires and 
deserves your immediate attention.
    We ask that you work with your colleagues in Congress to secure the 
necessary funding before the end of March so that we can continue to 
fulfill the tasks that are clearly a federal responsibility. Action is 
needed now or a thousand people per day will be released into our 
streets which will stress our assistance resources, tax our first 
responder agencies, limit our ability to provide services and programs 
to legal residents and citizens, harm tourism industries, and degrade 
quality of life across the state but especially in our four border 
counties.

Attachment

            Respectfully,
                              The Honorable Dr. Sylvia Lee,
                                        Pima County Representative.
                                 The Honorable Ann English,
                                     Cochise County Representative.
                               The Honorable Bruce Bracker,
                                  Santa Cruz County Representative.
                     The Honorable Marco A. ``Tony'' Reyes,
                                        Yuma County Representative.

                               [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
                               
                              Highlights:
    This reporting period the Tucson Sector Border Patrol (BP) 
continued Community Safe Releases of Legally Processed Asylum Seekers 
(LPAS) in Tucson (referred to as Tucson Soft-Sided), Nogales, and 
Douglas throughout the day. CBP Nogales Port of Entry (POE) also 
processed and released. BP Tucson Soft-Sided releases were transported 
by BP directly to Casas Alitas Welcome Center (CAWC) Drexel. BP Nogales 
Station and CBP Nogales POE were transported to CAWC Drexel by 
transportation coordinated by Arizona Department of Emergency and 
Military Affairs (DEMA) and Pima County transportation focused 
resources to support local needs. Due to the size of the BP Tucson 
Sector, this is a regional support operation covering three counties.
    CAWC received from BP and CBP a daily average of 955 arrivals and 
6,686 total arrivals for the week, a 255 LPAS decrease from previous 
period. There were over 1933 more family members released than single 
adults. County, CAWC, and City are monitoring the situation daily and 
will surge support as needed. Federal (FEMA/CBP Shelter and Services 
Program) funding continues to cover cost of the response. Operations 
are optimized to reduce the potential of street releases and there were 
no street releases in Tucson. When federal funding runs out, operations 
will be drastically reduced. The additional funding of EFSP will 
support operations and partners are working with GMI (fiscal agent) to 
determine parameters.
    <bullet>  BP Safe Community Release: Term used for BP released LPAS 
at a public location with access to transportation services (i.e. bus 
station, transportation hub) during daylight hours and BP communicates 
the release to stakeholders. For releases in border towns like Nogales 
and Douglas, Pima County and/or DEMA transport LPAS directly to a CAWC 
or other humanitarian partner to prevent overwhelming border 
communities with limited resources.

    <bullet>  BP Station: Nine Stations are located within the Tucson 
Sector and the Tucson and Nogales Stations currently process and 
release LPAS into the local community. In the past Douglas and Naco 
have processed and released. The vast majority of LPAS released daily 
are from BP Stations.

    <bullet>  CBP Port of Entry (POE): There are five POE in Arizona 
and four within Pima, Santa Cruz, and Cochise counties. CBP Nogales POE 
currently processes and releases approximately 100 LPAS per day. During 
normal operations there is a transition of the LPAS to the humanitarian 
network.

    <bullet>  Legally Processed Asylum Seeker (LPAS): A reference for 
those that BP have qualified and gained legal status into the United 
States. It has been stated that to gain that status, BP interviews, 
collects biometric and biographic information, and completes a 
background check before individual is released. During normal 
operations there is a transition of LPAS to the humanitarian network.

    <bullet>  Street Release: Term used when BP initiates a release 
other than to a humanitarian or other partner and LPAS are released 
into the local community with little to no support resources and LPAS 
will navigate their own way. Can occur when CAWC is at over-capacity 
with no shelter space available, when transportation support is not 
available to move LPAS to a humanitarian partner, federal funding no 
longer support operations, and BP can no longer detain. The release 
location has been coordinated between BP and the local government. When 
street release occurs Pima County will work with CAWC, the City of 
Tucson, Santa Cruz, and Cochise County to prioritize who will enter 
shelter as shelter space is available.
     Weekly Arrivals received by CAWC after release by BP and CBP:
    CCS/CAWC received from BP and CBP a daily average of 919 arrivals 
and 6,431 total arrivals for the week.

<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

                             Transportation
    BP can transport LPAS only as far as the closest safe community 
location. BP Tucson Soft-Sided transports directly to CAWC. BP Nogales 
Stations will transport to the Nogales Reception Center and BP Douglas 
Station to a local church when required. In Nogales and Douglas, BP 
works with Santa Cruz and Cochise OEM. Santa Cruz OEM reports that from 
9/13/23 to 1/31/24 when BP shifted to current release pattern, 56,804 
single adults and family members were released in Nogales. Cochise 
County OEM reports that 5927 LPAS were released in the same time-frame 
in Douglas and includes a short period in Naco. DEMA after receiving 
additional state level funds is back to support operations. DEMA and 
Pima County both have the ability to utilize buses to transport LPAS 
from Nogales and Douglas to CAWC and from CAWC to other humanitarian 
partners to decompress CAWC operations. Other transportation options 
are considered as needed. DEMA also has the ability to transport from 
Nogales and Douglas directly to Phoenix humanitarian partners and to 
humanitarian partners in New Mexico during critical need. The 
flexibility of transportation enables the shelter community to support 
each other and maximize available space. County utilizes vans and cabs 
to move LPAS between CAWC shelter network and to airport or bus 
station. The County has contracts with four long distance vendors and 
one short-distance vendor. The City utilizes SunTran for the local 
operation.

                 Congregate and Non-Congregate Shelters
    Congregate Shelters are CAWC Ajo and CAWC Drexel. CAWC Ajo provides 
support and shelter to LPAS that require specialized assistance and 
include vulnerable families. CAWC Ajo is uniquely suited with 
individual rooms and common spaces. CAWC Drexel is a large communal 
facility where one demographic of LPAS can be served and currently 
family units are sheltered at Drexel. This facility can transition 
easily to serve single adults depending on release demographics or 
operational changes. CAWC Drexel serves as the Intake Center when LPAS 
are released by BP and CBP. During Intake, LPAS are processed, and it 
is determined if LPAS can travel immediately or require respite, 
shelter, and supportive assistance. Non-Congregate locations are the 
hotels needed to support surge beyond the congregate locations and 
reduce the chance of a street release. These locations provide ``rooms 
as needed'' and are flexible because they can support both family units 
and single adults. It is at the shelter location where staff provide 
quality of life support like showers, acquire a change of clothes, 
diapers, care kits, etc. and work with LPAS family or sponsor on their 
forward travel arrangements. LPAS stay on average 1-3 days. County 
manages contracts with two hotel properties (Comfort Inn Suites and Red 
Roof Inn) and City with four hotel properties (La Palma formally known 
as Ramada, two Quality Inns, and a Best Western). Comfort Inn Suites 
contract was revised from whole hotel to a block of rooms needed to 
provide medical isolation plus additional rooms for CAWC. Humanitarian 
partners that provide additional Shelter support when available include 
Phoenix based International Rescue Committee (IRC), Helping With All My 
Heart, Monte Vista Cultural Church, and Tongan United Methodist. Those 
shelters are now reporting decreased to no capacity due to lack of 
federal funding. A shelter in New Mexico and a church in Douglas have 
also provided critical support when available.

<bullet> Total LPAS Served: The cumulative total of LPAS who have received services at a shelter, encompassing
  both daytime and nighttime use.
<bullet> Total LPAS Sheltered: The cumulative total of LPAS who stayed one or more nights.
<bullet> Total Overnight Rooms Used: The cumulative total of rooms that were used for an overnight stay.
<bullet> Available: The number of cots (Drexel) and rooms (CAWC, Comfort Inn Suites Airport) allocated for use.

             Public Health / Infectious Disease Prevention
    All LPAS undergo medical screening by federal paramedical staff 
prior to release. LPAS are assessed again when they arrive at CAWC 
during the Intake process. Trained staff ask all single adults and 
heads of family a series of medical questions and the staff visually 
assess all individuals for signs of sickness. If there is a positive 
response to the screening questions or if there is suspicion based on 
the assessment, the individual is tested for COVID and undergoes a 
clinical evaluation. Individuals (and their contacts) testing positive 
for COVID or suspected of other communicable illness are provided 
isolation and medical care in a hotel room setting until cleared for 
travel. Additional medical evaluation and care may be provided as 
needed by El Rio and coordinated by Southeast Arizona Health Education 
Center.
    From 1/1/23 to the 1/12/24 almost all LPAS underwent medical 
screening; 66,217 LPAS were identified as at risk for COVID and 
subsequently tested for COVID. 7316 tested positive and followed the 
PCHD COVID positive LPAS protocol including isolation until medically 
cleared for travel. Public Health identified 74 cases of Varicella 
(Chicken Pox) and <10 cases each of Malaria, Tuberculosis, and Scabies 
infestation.
    In general, LPAS are healthy and have low levels of disease.

    Mr. Stanton. Administrator Criswell, if and when Congress 
does appropriate additional funding for SSP, does FEMA have a 
plan to adjust the allocation formula to better prioritize 
border communities?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, we recognize the incredible 
amount of value that the SSP program has brought to our border 
communities. And in the first iteration of that, because of the 
limitation on time, we did determine to do a direct allocation 
based on some previous requests.
    If appropriated by Congress, our plan is to go forward with 
a competitive program so we can take in current data and 
current needs within different communities to help determine 
the appropriate amount to go to each of the different 
jurisdictions.
    Mr. Stanton. OK, I appreciate you saying that, although I 
think Arizona has dealt with the disproportionate burden and 
should be in front of the line, if you will, for the next round 
of funding when Congress does pass additional SSP support.
    I want to switch gears now to the ongoing effort of the 
city of Maricopa to develop a regional flood control solution 
to address the flooding of the Lower Santa Cruz River.
    In December 2021, the city submitted a Conditional Letter 
of Map Revision, a CLOMR, for its flood channelization project 
at the time. FEMA estimated that it would be completed within 
12 months.
    That was 26 months ago. CLOMR is still pending with FEMA. I 
am extraordinarily frustrated that the significant delay in 
advancing this project is causing harm to the community.
    So, the city of Maricopa, as every day goes by, the city 
remains vulnerable to flooding. Last week, the city met FEMA 
representatives here in Washington and with region 9, and I 
understand they committed to reducing the response time to 45 
days and adding consultations to the city to improve 
communication.
    I further understand that FEMA acknowledged that delays on 
the Agency's behalf in 2022 contributed to the current 
situation and indicated the CLOMR should be completed by the 
end of July this year.
    The city values its partnership with FEMA, understands that 
this is a complicated issue, but it is important to know that 
an estimated $1 billion in property tax revenue and $50 million 
in flood control solution cannot be realized until this CLOMR 
is completed.
    Administrator Criswell, can you provide me assurance here 
today that this CLOMR will be completed within this recently 
agreed to time plan?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I know that our teams have been 
working with your staff as well as the city of Maricopa. I am 
committed to making sure that we can continue this on time, 
that we can complete it on time.
    If we run into any roadblocks with that, I'll be certain to 
reach out with you so I can have the conversation with you 
personally.
    Mr. Stanton. I appreciate you doing that. Lack of 
communication has been a significant issue. The delay is a 
significant issue, and it is a project not just important to 
the city of Maricopa, but really the entire Maricopa County 
because flooding in that area would be devastating.
    I appreciate your leadership in getting this done. Thank 
you so much. I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    The Chair now welcomes--her first hearing--the gentlelady 
from Utah, Ms. Maloy.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Bernard, Mr. Currie, thank you for the work you are 
doing to increase accountability and transparency. That is 
really important work.
    The taxpayers deserve to know how these funds are being 
spent, and so, I appreciate what you are doing.
    Administrator Criswell, I share the concerns that have 
already been expressed about mission creep and focus on non-
Stafford Act disasters. And in the meantime, I am hearing from 
constituents in Utah that they have concerns with FEMA that are 
clearly within FEMA's authority and FEMA's mission.
    We have flood plain maps that aren't being updated, and 
locals who are reaching out to FEMA about updating flood plain 
maps, and they are having a hard time getting answers. People 
aren't being responsive.
    Is this something you can help us with? Will your staff 
work with us on making sure we can get responses?
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, Congresswoman, I am not familiar with 
the specific flood maps, but I will certainly take that back 
personally and talk to my team about the status and what we can 
do to help them.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you. And then I also have concerns that 
are being shared with me by my constituents about Risk Rating 
2.0, including that we have homeowners who aren't in the flood 
plain, but are adjacent to the flood plain and their insurance 
rates are going up so that they are dropping their flood 
insurance.
    It seems like that's counterproductive to the mission. So, 
I just want to echo, Utah is very different from Louisiana, but 
I want to echo the concerns by my colleagues from Louisiana 
that we need to understand the methodologies.
    We probably need to address the methodologies because if 
people are dropping their flood insurance, it's not serving the 
purpose. So, will you work with us on that as well?
    Ms. Criswell. Absolutely.
    Ms. Maloy. OK. Then I have no further questions.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from the Nation's 
capital, Ms. Norton.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Criswell, I understand that it is GSA's 
intention to modernize the Federal building at 7th and D 
Streets Northwest here in the District of Columbia, known as 
the regional office building, to house FEMA's headquarters.
    How did FEMA and GSA determine that the renovation of the 
regional office building to house FEMA's headquarters is the 
most effective option?
    Ms. Criswell. Congresswoman Norton, as you know, our lease 
is coming up in 2027, and we have been working closely with the 
Department, as well as GSA, to identify the most suitable 
building for us to move into.
    I believe that the building at 7 and D is going to make the 
most cost-effective use of Federal funding by using an existing 
Federal facility. It also provides improved security features 
to support our staff and our interagency that come together 
when we activate our National Response Coordination Center.
    It's also co-located with one of our DHS partners. And so, 
we'll continue to work with the Department and GSA as they move 
forward with this move.
    Ms. Norton. What is the timeline for completion of each 
phase of the regional office building construction, and when do 
you expect to request funding for phase 2?
    Ms. Criswell. I don't have the specifics on the timeline or 
additional funding. I know we've already been appropriated 
funding for this move, but we'll be happy to get back with you 
with those details.
    Ms. Norton. I would appreciate that.
    Administrator Criswell, please provide to the committee in 
writing within 7 days of today's hearing: the cost-benefit 
analysis conducted of FEMA continuing operations in its 
existing headquarters location under its current lease, through 
purchase of the leased building, and for the renovation of the 
regional office building, if you will.
    Ms. Criswell. Yes, ma'am. We'll be happy to provide that 
for the record.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you.
    Mr. Currie, climate change has fueled an alarming rise in 
natural disasters with once in a century storms becoming a 
matter of course.
    It is critical to invest in our emergency management 
workforce to respond to these continuing emergencies and to 
help rebuild affected communities.
    Yet, the Government Accountability Office found that in 
recent years, FEMA is significantly understaffed, falling 6,200 
employees short of staffing goals in 2022.
    Director Currie, what are your recommendations for 
improving the hiring and retention of FEMA staff?
    Mr. Currie. Thank you, ma'am. This has been a historical 
problem. For over a decade, we've been looking at this, and 
it's been the case over and over again.
    Ms. Norton. Why is that a problem?
    Mr. Currie. Attrition. It's tough at FEMA because a lot of 
these are part-time positions, a lot of these are intermittent 
positions, so, you can only recruit certain types of people 
that are willing to fill those.
    Also, FEMA has told us that there's definitely been a 
burnout factor in recent years because of COVID-19 and the 
nonstop disaster season.
    It used to be that someone would deploy for a number of 
months, take a break, and maybe deploy months later. With back-
to-back-to-back-to-back disasters, a lot of times they're asked 
to deploy sequentially, especially people that have specialized 
skills, and they don't have a lot of them.
    I think a number of things need to happen. One, some steps 
have been taken through the CREW Act to give FEMA reservists 
and employees similar protections to, like, the military 
reserve would have, where their jobs are secure.
    I think those things need to go further. I think there 
needs to be almost like the National Guard, the military 
reserve, there needs to be a training component of that when 
they're not deployed to disasters, a development component of 
that, a hierarchy structure, a transition structure into full-
time positions. So, there's more of a pipeline starting early 
all the way through to the end of a career, to where you're not 
just able to recruit people, frankly, that don't have full-time 
jobs or have other part-time jobs.
    Ms. Norton. Administrator Criswell, in the past year, this 
year, since the release of the GAO report, what steps has FEMA 
taken to improve staff hiring and retention?
    Ms. Criswell. Ma'am, I really appreciate that question 
because I just had the opportunity to visit our Center for 
Domestic Preparedness yesterday. And what I saw there was I had 
the opportunity to swear in 78 of our new reservists.
    They come in every 2 weeks to go through training. And I 
asked them, how many of them have benefited from some of the 
new programs that we have put in place to include the CREW Act, 
which we really appreciate Congress' passing of that 
legislation, as well as some of the incentives for bonuses.
    And more than half of the individuals in that room have 
benefited from those programs. Every 2 weeks, we're continuing 
to see this, and so, those types of legislation and new program 
changes that we have made will increase the most important part 
of our workforce, which is our reservist workforce.
    They are the ones that go out to each of these disasters to 
support them. We'll continue to look for additional ways that 
we can enhance that level of recruitment, as well as retention.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, 
Mr. Ezell.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all 
three of you for being here today.
    You have a monumental task, and I have been a recipient of 
your assistance. But like everything else, there's always room 
for improvement.
    Ms. Criswell, it's good to see you again. I appreciate you 
being here. As you know, South Mississippi is uniquely 
threatened by major natural disasters, and your Agency is 
responsible for completing many of the recovery projects.
    One of the projects that I have focused on since my first 
day in office is addressing the flood insurance crisis.
    My constituents on the Mississippi gulf coast are being 
hammered by the unaffordable flood insurance premiums under 
Risk Rating 2.0. On top of this, many families in my district 
are inaccurately included in a high-risk flood zone due to the 
outdated flood maps.
    Combining the high risk and flood insurance prices with 
outdated maps, people in my communities are being forced to 
move. My hometown of Pascagoula has been completely changed 
because of this.
    It's frustrating to watch, and it's beyond time that we get 
this fixed. I'm glad that the Mississippi State Legislature 
fully funded a project to update the flood maps in partnership 
with the Southern Mississippi Planning and Development 
District.
    This project has partnered with experts in the field to 
create more reliable flood maps. I understand the group has 
submitted to FEMA their findings and the data required to 
revise the flood map for the Mississippi coast.
    As you can see, this is a very important issue to me and my 
constituents. You and I both know that the success of these 
projects relies on good communications between FEMA, the review 
team, and the local stakeholders.
    Will you commit to making sure that all the groups working 
on this project are communicating properly?
    Ms. Criswell. Congressman, I will personally go back and 
check in on the flood maps that you just mentioned to ensure 
that they are being included appropriately into the risk rating 
calculations for premiums. And I would be happy to continue 
working with you and other Members of Congress as we work on an 
affordability framework so everybody that needs flood insurance 
can afford flood insurance.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
    My district is still dealing with projects dating back to 
Hurricane Katrina. And so, I am glad we are talking about why 
FEMA must effectively use its resources.
    This becomes more challenging when FEMA employees are 
forced to work on nondisaster emergencies such as the border 
crisis.
    What is FEMA doing to ensure the Agency's mission is not 
causing further project delays, especially as the Agency works 
to address staffing issues?
    Ms. Criswell. FEMA has been continuously called on for the 
last several decades in supporting some of the non-Stafford Act 
events. Back as far as 2014 and again in 2019, and we are still 
being called on to support some of the non-Stafford events 
because of our ability to provide technical assistance and 
technical expertise in establishing a coordination and a 
collaboration function.
    That is the expertise and the skillset that our emergency 
managers across the Nation bring to the table. That's what FEMA 
brings to our Federal partners to help them with some of these 
challenging issues that we are facing today.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Several cities have also complained 
to me about the long wait times between their request for 
reimbursement and the time they finally receive the Federal 
relief money under the FEMA PA Program.
    These loans can often be outstanding for years, collecting 
interest the entire time. In a high interest rate environment, 
this is very costly to the taxpayer. If this reimbursement 
money gets out faster, I believe it would help FEMA and the 
community save money by ultimately reducing the cost of these 
loans.
    Do you think improving and clarifying the interest 
reimbursement process would help FEMA and communities better 
utilize resources?
    Ms. Criswell. We do continue to hear frustration with the 
length of time for reimbursement. And one of the changes that 
we recently made last year was simplifying procedures by 
increasing the dollar amount for the small project threshold to 
$1 million.
    That is up significantly from, it was just under $200,000 
before, which is the majority of the projects that people are 
waiting for reimbursement on. Through these new procedures, we 
feel that we are going to be able to get the reimbursements out 
into the hands of these communities faster.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    Ms. Bernard and Mr. Currie, can you speak about this a 
little bit?
    Mr. Currie. I can take that, sir.
    In our work over the years, we've been to every State and 
Territory in the country, and a consistent theme is complexity 
of FEMA grant programs.
    You mentioned it. I know you probably still have open 
projects in the Mississippi gulf coast and Gulfport and Long 
Beach. And it's a consistent theme, and I think while there 
have been some steps taken to reduce some complexity in some of 
the steps, I think an overhaul of the system needs to happen in 
order to sort of relook at how we apply Public Assistance 
projects.
    I mean, the way it is now is that you do a damage 
assessment, and then for years and years later, you're 
basically going back and forth, back and forth between the 
Federal Government and the State and the locality for small 
changes.
    That's going to have to change. The structure of that is 
going to have to change if this is ever going to get more 
efficient. And so, I think that's what needs to be focused on.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
    Thank you all again for your help and support. We really 
want to work together to get this done because, ultimately, our 
people are suffering. And so, thank you for what you have done 
and what you are going to do.
    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    We are going to have another round of questioning with the 
Members that are present or still may be present.
    I am going to start. This Chair is going to start with 
himself.
    Administrator, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, as I 
understand it, is essentially the money that is allocated is 
then distributed or decided to be distributed by the National 
Board; is that correct?
    Ms. Criswell. The legacy program, EFSP Humanitarian 
Program, yes. It was an existing program that we had that we 
adapted to meet the original or the initial direction by 
Congress to administer funding. The SSP Program that it has now 
evolved into will not be.
    Mr. Perry. That's a grant program, but I want to focus on 
the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which does have a 
board. How many FEMA individuals oversee their work?
    Ms. Criswell. I would have to get back to you on the 
number. I know that we have a member of FEMA that sits on the 
board. Again, this was an existing program that does need----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I am not blaming you for it, 
ma'am. I am just trying to get clarification. Just to get clear 
here, but----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. Yes, I don't know how many, 
but I'd be happy----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. And our understanding, just to 
let you know, it's one person, and you say that one person does 
sit on the board. This is an enormous amount of money.
    Since the members of the board also have affiliate 
organizations in the States and in the various communities 
within those States, does it seem to you to be a good idea to 
have this board then decide where the money is going and who is 
getting it, knowing that, in many cases, they are picking their 
own affiliate organizations in the members' States, cities, and 
political subdivisions.
    Does that seem to be--does that at all seem incestuous to 
you from a relationship of spending money, and the fact that 
the organizations, the members of that board, exclusively 
decide where that money is being spent?
    Ms. Criswell. The legacy or the initial Emergency Food and 
Shelter Program that we have is one that, again, we adapted to 
meet the needs of the direction back in 2019. It was an ill-
suited program to meet the needs and the scale of the support 
that we were providing under the humanitarian side of that 
program.
    That's why we were grateful for Congress to direct the SSP 
program as the board no longer has a role in making these 
decisions.
    Mr. Perry. I understand, but this program still exists----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. It does not exist.
    Mr. Perry. It does not exist?
    Ms. Criswell. It has been sun-setted and is now being 
replaced by the SSP program. We are still closing out----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. How much money is left in the 
program?
    Ms. Criswell. I would have to get back with the specifics.
    Mr. Perry. All right. I would like to know how much money 
is left in that program, and when is the timeline for that to 
expire?
    Ms. Criswell. We will not be doing any new obligations 
under that program. Everything will fall under the SSP program.
    Mr. Perry. And when is that going to happen? I understand--
--
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. The SSP program started last 
fiscal year, and, if appropriated, it will continue into this 
fiscal year.
    Mr. Perry. OK.
    The inspector general reviewed 18 audits that they 
conducted related to FEMA's involvement in nonnatural 
disasters. These 18 audits took place over the past 4 years, 
and Ms. Bernard, I have $3.8 billion in fraud, but I think you 
cited a different number.
    Can you clarify that?
    Ms. Bernard. 3.8 is the correct number.
    Mr. Perry. 3.8? OK.
    So, Administrator Criswell, I mean, apparently, like, my 
question kind of was, does FEMA have sufficient controls in 
place to prevent fraud? But obviously they don't.
    What I mean, I am sure you are taking the recommendations, 
or at least you are hearing the recommendations of Ms. Bernard, 
but what are you offering in regard to changing that 
circumstance so we don't see that level?
    I mean, $3.8 billion might not seem much in the face of 
$7.2 trillion, but still a lot of money where I come from, and 
it's still a lot money to taxpayers of America. What are you 
recommending be done?
    Ms. Criswell. Chairman Perry, we take all concerns about 
fraud against our programs very seriously, and we appreciate 
the continued partnership and cooperation with the IG.
    Again, many of these recommendations we have already closed 
out, but there are some that we did not agree with the data 
that they used to provide that. We don't necessarily agree with 
the dollar amount cited by the IG, but we'd be happy to have a 
session with you in a closed session about our fraud controls--
--
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I would like to you know your----
    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. I would prefer not to talk about 
that in public.
    Mr. Perry. I understand Ms. Bernard's doing it, but you 
don't agree, that's fine. But what do you, you know, you are 
the guy, you are the captain of the ship, as one of my 
colleagues said.
    Let me ask you this about these self-certifications and the 
potential for using that in the Lost Wages Assistance Program. 
To me, that is rife with fraud and self-certification is one of 
the roots of that.
    Are you literally considering self-certification regarding 
the cash assistance, the changes to the Individual Assistance 
Program, which would see $750 in cash assistance prior to, for 
upfront housing?
    Are you still considering self-certification for that in 
light of what you have seen in the other programs?
    Ms. Criswell. So, as it relates to the Lost Wages 
Assistance Program that was administered by the previous 
administration, and I was of course very concerned when I came 
into this role to learn about the potential fraud.
    This was a program that was the responsibility for 
executing between the State workforce agencies, and we continue 
to work with them to repay us for any of the amounts of money 
that was fraud.
    And to date, we have over $165 million that has been 
returned to FEMA. As it relates to our new program for serious 
needs assistance, it's an expansion upon an existing program 
that we have. Self-certification is just one of many steps that 
we use to make determinations on whether to issue that money.
    Mr. Perry. So, you are going to use self-certification?
    Ms. Criswell. It will be one of the steps that we use. Yes.
    Mr. Perry. Well, if you are self-certifying, what other 
steps would you use that would negate self-certification?
    Ms. Criswell. We also use identity verification and a 
number of other things that we'd be happy to provide a full 
briefing on----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. So, I just want to make sure I 
understand. So, FEMA is saying we are going to make sure that 
you are who you say you are, that's identification, but still 
allow you to self-certify in the face of what you just rightly 
criticized as the previous administration's fraud based on 
self-certification, but you are still going to use it in this 
instance, even though, essentially what you are saying, we are 
just going to make sure you are who you say you are?
    Ms. Criswell. Chairman Perry, we believe that the processes 
that we are using are sufficient to make sure that we are 
determining that we are giving money appropriately. We put 
fraud controls in place, and I would be happy to have a 
separate session with you, not on public camera, about our 
fraud controls that we have in place.
    Mr. Perry. All right, well, I will tell you, and my time is 
way overdue for this round, but the self-certification process 
is very concerning to me and the fact that we just identify the 
individual, that might be great after the fact to try and go 
collect that money that is fraudulently taken from the American 
people.
    But I think the self-certification process, even by your 
own admission--not that you handled it, that was another 
administration--is a problem, and I am concerned that you would 
consider that as some kind of reasonable methodology to 
disburse money prior to, as a matter of fact, in advance.
    In any case, I would yield now to the gentlelady from 
Washington, DC, Ms. Norton.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Criswell, you will recall that, in my round 
of questions, I asked you about your recommendations for hiring 
and retention. Let me ask you further, has FEMA done outreach 
on college campuses, and what are your thoughts on establishing 
a training program for recent graduates?
    Ms. Criswell. Congresswoman Norton, we do outreach to 
college campuses. We have intern programs. In fact, during this 
administration, we have instituted an HBCU and MSI intern 
program, which we've had several individuals participate across 
FEMA.
    We have a number of ways that we try to create that 
pipeline for future employees. Part of it can be our FEMA Corps 
Program, which is our youth that are out there supporting us 
through a partnership within Triple C, as well as through our 
existing reservists, as you heard from my previous answer, have 
been great recruiters for us.
    I would be happy to work with you on what type of training 
program would be beneficial to our employees to retain them and 
to make sure that they have a career pathway that allows them 
to be able to succeed within this field.
    Ms. Norton. That would be very helpful. I would be happy to 
work with you.
    Administrator Criswell and Director Currie, this is a 
question for both of you. What action should Congress take to 
increase the emergency management workforce?
    Ms. Criswell [to Mr. Currie]. Do you want to start?
    Mr. Currie. I'll start. A couple things, I think. We talked 
about how important legislation is because so much of how we 
recruit, train, and deploy our workforce is tied up in the 
Stafford Act and how that money can and can't be used.
    A lot of the Stafford Act dollars and Disaster Relief Fund 
dollars have to be used for a specific disaster. I think there 
possibly needs to be more flexibility in how some of those 
moneys can be used on blue sky days when there's not a disaster 
to make sure that we have a constant recruitment, training, 
exercising, and retention program for our intermittent disaster 
workforce.
    I think there's always going to need to be an intermittent 
part of the workforce because you have to scale up and down 
with the disaster, but the extent to which we can make that 
more consistent all the time would be better.
    Similar to how we do it with the National Guard, and the 
military reserves.
    Ms. Norton. That's an interesting idea.
    Do you have any ideas, Ms. Criswell?
    Ms. Criswell. Congresswoman Norton, first off, we are very 
appreciative of Congress passing the CREW Act, which provides 
the USERRA-level protection for our reservists, and it has had 
a tremendous impact on our ability to recruit and retain a 
larger number of reservists across the country.
    I do agree with something that Mr. Currie said earlier. I 
believe, having been a National Guard member myself, having a 
training academy, training program that is well suited to help 
individuals enter in and go through the appropriate level of 
training and having annualized training that gives them the 
opportunity, if they aren't deployed, that they can maintain 
their skill proficiency is a way that we can retain and 
continue to promote the individuals across the workforce.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, and I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman, Mr. 
Larsen.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I am going to kind of go around the panel here. 
Administrator Criswell, just to clarify, does the board exist 
at all anymore?
    Ms. Criswell. The board for EFSP?
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes.
    Ms. Criswell. The board exists for the Pre-Humanitarian 
Program. It was the same board that was being used to adapt and 
deliver the humanitarian side of EFSP.
    The original EFSP program still exists, and the board is 
still there. But they are also closing out the original EFSP 
allocations.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And so, then----
    Ms. Criswell [clarifying]. Humanitarian allocations.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. So, the oversight for the 
SSP, Shelter and Services Program, grant then rests with you or 
rests with FEMA as an agency now?
    Ms. Criswell. Our Grant Programs Directorate will 
administer it on behalf of the Department, and yes, it falls 
within the Grant Programs Directorate now.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Just to clarify that. Yes, 
thanks.
    Inspector General Bernard, on the self-certification, you 
mentioned in your statement, $403 million in payments lacked 
the required self-certification.
    Is the IG making any judgment about the process of self-
certification, generally?
    Ms. Bernard. Yes sir. Yes sir, we do. And we have issued 
several recommendations for FEMA to just consider how it can 
better mitigate the risk when it does rely on self-
certification.
    And as you noted, we did find $403 million in costs that 
had been distributed for applicants without a self-
certification as a form of documentation.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. In COVID-19--in the Lost Wages 
Assistance Program?
    Ms. Bernard. In the Lost Wages Assistance, yes.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Generally, self-certification, 
have you looked at self-certification FEMA programs generally 
as in----
    Ms. Bernard [interrupting]. Yes. Yes, sir, we have. So, 
we've conducted four audits over the last few years of FEMA's 
programs that rely on self-certification. And across those four 
audits, we found $10 billion in potentially fraudulent and 
improper payments.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. Yes. And then as a use of 
self-certification, are there uses for it that the IG says, 
yes, that it should be used?
    Ms. Bernard. That's a great question. And I don't think our 
position is one where we're asking FEMA to overhaul its process 
or replace self-certification. We're just asking for risk 
mitigating steps to consider what else can be done when it's 
relying on self-certification.
    And I think the key there is to consider preventative 
controls, and there are a number of very timely and free 
options to help FEMA put in place preventative controls.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Mr. Currie, what policy changes 
did FEMA and Congress prioritize to ensure mitigation dollars, 
getting back to the mitigation side of things, are disbursed 
fairly and to reduce demand for post-disaster FEMA resources?
    Mr. Currie. Oh, I'm glad you made that comparison, because 
I think mitigation is one of the only options we have to reduce 
the post-disaster costs. Because we're going to continue to 
have disasters, and the Federal Government's going to continue 
to pay for them.
    I think some of the things that are being done right now 
are helpful through like the BRIC Program. So, over the years, 
we've talked about how little funding actually came in on the 
predisaster side versus the post-disaster side.
    Now with BRIC, you have a lot more available funding. 
However, when you spread it across the country and all the 
Territories, it's still hard--it's not that much money per 
State.
    So, I think being able to allocate that to the most 
effective and most impactful resilience projects is key. And I 
think these should be the ones that we see the most damage and 
the most cost on the back end.
    So, for example, in every disaster, the electric grid, 
wastewater treatment facilities, public buildings, those are 
the big costs. Those are probably 90 percent of Federal 
disaster, FEMA disaster costs.
    The extent of which we can mitigate the huge expensive 
pieces of infrastructure, we're going to save money on the back 
end.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. Thanks. And then, 
Administrator Criswell, Ranking Member Titus couldn't be with 
us today, which is unfortunate because she's long advocated for 
improving post-disaster housing outcomes for disaster 
survivors, and she has the Disaster Survivors Fairness Act to 
fill in additional assistance gaps for families.
    And this is on both supporting and perhaps expanding the 
interim rule that you all have on Individual Assistance. So, 
this is kind of the softball question first, like, isn't the 
Disaster Survivors Fairness Act the best piece of legislation 
ever? Right?
    Ms. Criswell. I would think so.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, exactly. That's kind of the 
gist of the question, but I mean, is it your assessment that 
those reforms would make an additional difference, a 
significant difference, beyond the interim rule that you 
currently have on IA?
    Ms. Criswell. It will continue to expand on the interim 
rule that we put in place, and it will have a tremendous impact 
on our ability to actually use Federal dollars in a way that 
makes sense, instead of having them build back to a temporary 
place, only to have to replace it with permanent dollars and 
permanent structures later.
    It just makes sense to be able to help people on their road 
to recovery. Gets them back in their homes sooner. Gets them 
out of shelters, out of hotels sooner.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. So, does your interim rule then, 
in your view, push--are you allowed to push only as far as you 
believe you legally can and to have the authority to push for 
the interim rule and Representative Titus' bill is necessary to 
provide you additional authorities to go farther than the 
interim rules?
    Ms. Criswell. The interim rule focuses, I would say the 
majority of it focuses on authorities we have to provide 
funding for different areas, like helping to cover uninsured 
costs to be able to support rental assistance in a different 
way.
    It has some clarification on how we can build back to a 
habitable level. But the permanent construction pieces that 
we're talking about really would take hold with the Disaster 
Survivors Fairness Act.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. OK.
    Thanks, Mr. Chair. Appreciate that. I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    Just because of your questioning, Administrator, I just 
need further clarification.
    I understand the Emergency Food and Shelter Humanitarian 
Program is being moved, or the functions of that, over to the 
Shelter and Services Program under the grant format for driving 
those resources out, but the original legacy Emergency Food and 
Shelter Program, which has a board, will remain. Is that my 
understanding or am I missing something?
    Ms. Criswell. So, I know it can sound confusing. There was 
an existing program, Emergency Food and Shelter Program, that 
supported communities across the U.S. with some of their 
homeless populations.
    Mr. Perry. Right.
    Ms. Criswell. That program will continue.
    Mr. Perry. OK.
    Ms. Criswell. The adaption to that program for EFSP 
Humanitarian has sun-setted, and it has been replaced with the 
Shelter and Services Program.
    Mr. Perry. So, just for further clarification, for the 
legacy program that exists and has a board, is there anything 
to preclude those funds that will come or that remain in that 
program from--anything that will preclude that money to be 
spent on people existing and residing in the United States who 
are illegal foreign nationals?
    Ms. Criswell. So, we have eligible expenses within that 
program, and we reimburse jurisdictions, organizations for the 
list of eligible expenses that have been identified. I'd be 
happy to get you the list of what those eligible expenses are.
    Mr. Perry. So, if you know, and if you don't know, it's OK 
to say so, but that list, would it include--because these are 
homeless people in America living in some city or some town in 
America--does it preclude money from being spent on people 
residing illegally that are illegal foreign nationals in this 
country who are also homeless?
    Ms. Criswell. So, you're talking about, I just want to make 
sure I'm clear, you're talking about the original program?
    Mr. Perry. Yes. That has----
    Ms. Criswell [interrupting]. I do not know that 
specifically. I'd have to get back to you on that.
    Mr. Perry. I would appreciate it if you would.
    With that, I want to thank, let's see, OK, I want to thank 
our witnesses and the members of the committee for their 
participation.
    I don't think there are any other further questions, so, 
seeing none, that concludes this hearing for today. I would 
like to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony and for 
taking the hard shots.
    This committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:39 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]


                                Appendix

                              ----------                              


  Question to Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. Lori 
                             Chavez-DeRemer

    Question 1. I have a question related to wildfires that have 
plagued the western states and communities, and most recently, Texas. 
What steps are FEMA taking to ensure States, Territories and Tribes 
have access through FEMA grant programs to advancing technologies 
related to predicting and reducing or eliminating the threat of 
wildfires, particularly as part of the Hazard Mitigation Assistance 
Grants? \<dagger>\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \<dagger>\ Representative Celeste Maloy of Utah submitted the same 
question to Ms. Criswell. To avoid duplication, it is not included 
here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. Wildfire mitigation measures are eligible under the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) 
grant programs, including the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), 
HMGP Post Fire, Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation 
Revolving Loan Fund (Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund), and 
Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC). The most 
common wildfire mitigation measures funded by HMA grant programs are 
hazardous fuels reduction, defensible space, and ignition-resistant 
construction. Other eligible wildfire mitigation measures include post-
fire soil stabilization, post-fire flood risk reduction, and early 
warning systems. Additional information regarding wildfire mitigation 
under HMA grant programs is available at Part 12.B.9. Wildfire 
Mitigation and Part 12.B.12. Warning Systems of the 2023 HMA Program 
and Policy Guide.
    FEMA continues to work toward improving access to grant funding 
opportunities for state, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) 
communities. For example, FEMA developed a number of application 
support materials for the most common mitigation project types to help 
streamline the application development process. These materials include 
application templates specific to various mitigation project types, 
along with instructions and job aids for technical and environmental 
and historic preservation (EHP) reviews.
    FEMA also administers the Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) Grant 
program as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG), 
focusing on enhancing safety of the public and firefighters with 
respect to fire and related hazards. The Research and Development (R&D) 
Activity is aimed at improving firefighter safety, health, or well-
being through R&D that reduces firefighter fatalities and injuries. In 
2005, Congress reauthorized funding for FP&S and expanded the eligible 
uses of funds to include Firefighter Safety R&D.
    In addition, FEMA implements the Building Science Disaster Support 
Program (BSDS) to assess the performance of buildings and other 
structures affected by natural hazard events. BSDS has deployed 
Mitigation Assessment Teams (MATs) to Colorado for the Marshall Fire 
[https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_marshall-fire-
mat-decreasing-structure-fire-spread.pdf] and Maui for the Lahaina Fire 
to assess the performance of buildings in areas destroyed by wildfire. 
The MATs produce actionable recommendations and best practices such as 
Recovery Advisories and Fact Sheets to aid the community its recovery. 
This information is critical in identifying Hazard Mitigation 
Activities and resources like grants to implement solutions that will 
expedite recovery, reduce future losses, and save lives by 
strengthening a community's capability for superior building 
performance.

  Questions to Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. Rick 
                                 Larsen

    Question 1. The Government Accountability Office published a report 
February 2024 titled ``Puerto Rico Disasters: Progress Made, But the 
Recovery Continues to Face Challenges'', which stated that ``certain 
permanent recovery work projects face challenges due to cost 
increases.'' In past conversations, FEMA has advised the Committee that 
the Agency is reviewing permanent work projects in Puerto Rico 
obligated under the Accelerated Awards Strategy (FAASt) to determine 
whether cost overruns for projects with fixed cost estimates are 
anticipated due to inflation. Please provide an update on FEMA's review 
of possible cost overruns for projects with fixed cost estimates.
    Answer. While FEMA already includes an inflation adjustment factor 
in all fixed cost offers, and fixed cost offers are generally not 
adjusted after award, FEMA is working closely with Puerto Rico's 
Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency (COR3) to 
compare recent actual costs of project implementation to the awarded 
fixed cost estimates (FCEs). In March 2024, FEMA held several meetings 
with COR3 leadership to provide the background, methodology, and 
results of the Future Price Forecast (FPF) allowance and cost 
escalation factors used for the FCEs in DR-4339 and DR-4473.
    In addition to working with COR3, FEMA engaged with the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) as part of the development of the February 
2024 report titled ``Puerto Rico Disasters: Progress Made, But the 
Recovery Continues to Face Challenges.'' While the GAO identified 
inflation as a potential risk, it also found that ``it is too early to 
determine the full effect of the increased project costs on the 
recovery of Accelerated Award Strategy subrecipients' facilities.'' 
This determination aligns with FEMA's own findings; comparisons of 
recent actual costs of project implementation to the awarded FCEs have 
not found widespread instances of actual costs coming in higher than 
the fixed cost estimate because of inflation.
    FEMA has identified that improved projects, which are cases where 
an applicant is expanding the Scope of Work (SOW) beyond the FEMA 
approved SOW at their own cost, are likely to require additional 
funding beyond the original awards. For example, for the Vieques Health 
Center, the applicant deviated from the FEMA approved original SOW. 
Prior to Hurricane Maria, Vieques Health Center was approximately 
33,000 sq ft, FEMA's original approval for a replacement of the 
facility includes a number of upgrades to bring the facility to the 
latest building codes and industry standards, increasing the size of 
the replacement facility to 38,613 sq ft, in addition to adjustments 
for inflation and the FPF factors. After approval of the project, the 
applicant then elected to go out to bid for a new Vieques Health Center 
of 59,210 sq ft which was an increase of 65 percent over the original 
FEMA approved SOW, and 79 percent over the pre-disaster size of the 
facility. FEMA carefully reviewed the bids on the contract to the 
original estimate, and the final bided costs for this project are 
proportional to the increased scope of the improved project. While it 
not possible to determine what the exact effect inflation would have 
had on the original version of the project, the analysis indicates that 
the included inflation adjustment would have been sufficient for the 
original approved SOW, and that the increased costs are primarily 
attributable to the applicant expanding the SOW at their own cost.
    FEMA remains committed to meeting with the Recipient to discuss any 
concerns raised about inflation costs and the potential impact on the 
recovery projects in Puerto Rico. As of March 12, 2024, COR3 still has 
over $8.9 billion in funding remaining under the collective FEMA 
Accelerated Awards Strategy, and FEMA is closely monitoring the 
available funding with COR3 to ensure they have sufficient resources to 
complete their recovery. As recommended by the GAO, FEMA will continue 
to identify, assess, and manage risks in coordination with Puerto Rico.

    Question 2. Public Assistance is a complex and lengthy grant 
program that has long been a source of frustration for state and local 
officials. Complicating this is the fear that if rules are not followed 
or changed later, certain funding may be recouped years down the road.
    Question 2.a. Can you please tell us what steps, in your view, are 
needed to streamline public assistance to speed up recovery?
    Answer. FEMA has been innovating the PA Program for efficiency and 
effectiveness since creating the National Delivery Model in 2016. This 
model allows for greater transparency of the PA grant delivery process 
as well as more comprehensive documentation retention through the web-
based Grants Portal/Grants Manager system. Furthermore, PA has 
implemented the following changes based on recommendations from the 
Public Assistance Steering Committee (PASC), which is comprised of FEMA 
regional staff and representatives from SLTT governments:
    <bullet>  Simplified documentation requirements for unobligated 
projects.
    <bullet>  Waived the requirement that unobligated projects with 
completed small projects must be prepared based on actual costs.
    <bullet>  Adjusted the deadline for projects with work already 
completed.
    <bullet>  Began deploying technical experts from FEMA Consolidated 
Resource Centers to aid project scoping and development for complex 
operations and projects.
    <bullet>  Released the ``Public Assistance Sampling Procedure'' to 
reduce documentation level requirements.
    <bullet>  Provided examples allowing a FEMA Regional Administrator 
to approve time extensions for project closeout.

    FEMA has also taken the following steps to streamline the PA 
Program:
    <bullet>  Raised the simplified procedures threshold to $1 million. 
Annual inflation adjustments will continue each fiscal year pursuant to 
the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act.
    <bullet>  Allowed additional flexibility in costs claimed for power 
restoration work.
    <bullet>  Eliminated size requirements for the eligibility of the 
removal of hazardous trees, limbs, branches, and stumps for debris 
removal projects.
    <bullet>  Allowed applicants to develop cost estimates faster 
without using consensus-based codes in 50 percent rule calculations.
    <bullet>  Not requiring separate cost analysis from work performed 
through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC).
    <bullet>  Simplified documentation requirements for Management 
Costs for force account labor by accepting a summary of force account 
labor and equipment costs.

    Additionally, the PA Program is in the process of updating its 
cornerstone document, the Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide. 
The updated version emphasizes the importance of equitable application 
of the program and is written to be more accessible to Recipients and 
Subrecipients by using more plain language. FEMA PA meets monthly with 
the PASC to discuss continued program improvement and simplification 
recommendations.

    Question 2.b. Are changes to the Stafford Act needed to address 
this issue?
    Answer. At this time, no changes are recommended.

    Question 3. Federally-recognized Tribes have struggled to build and 
maintain emergency management capacity to manage grants and other 
assistance in the wake of a disaster. What is FEMA doing to help Tribes 
build and maintain capacity?
    Answer. Tribal Nations have worked to build and maintain emergency 
management capacity within the confines of limited access to many of 
the preparedness grants and resources that build state capacity. For 
example, due to statutory constraints, Tribal Nations do not have 
direct access to the Emergency Management Performance Grant and cannot 
participate in the EMAC. To support Tribal Nations, FEMA's Recovery 
Directorate focuses on providing program flexibility when possible and 
technical assistance through FEMA regional offices. FEMA provides 
Tribal Nations as much self-determination in the disaster assistance 
process as is allowable under the Stafford Act. This means they can 
pick the path that best suits their unique emergency management 
capabilities and resource needs.
    Tribal Nations can request their own disaster declarations, they 
can be subrecipients under a state declaration, they can be recipients 
under a state declaration (with a direct relationship with FEMA), or 
any combination of these options that does not result in a duplication 
of benefits. Currently, FEMA is in the process of updating its Tribal 
Declarations Pilot Guidance. This document provides guidance on 
evaluating whether a Tribal Nation has been overwhelmed by a disaster 
and the process to request a disaster declaration. After consultation 
with over 120 Tribal Nations, FEMA will make updates to the Guidance to 
streamline the assistance process for Tribal Nations and eliminate 
unnecessary administrative barriers when appropriate.
    At any point, before, during, or after disasters, Tribal Nations 
can request technical assistance from FEMA through their Regional 
Administrator to support their needs navigating any number of steps in 
the assistance process. Each region has Regional Tribal Liaisons that 
can connect Tribal Nations with the appropriate FEMA program support 
staff, who in turn can provide hands on guidance on the identified 
need. Examples of provided guidance include how to develop a Tribal 
Mitigation Plan, conduct preliminary damage assessments, request a 
disaster declaration, or create an administrative plan.
    Additionally, the annual Tribal Nations Training Week, hosted by 
the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, plays a 
pivotal role in enhancing emergency preparedness capabilities and 
fostering relationships among Tribal Nations and their partners. 
Aligned with FEMA's overarching goal of instilling a culture of 
preparedness across all communities, this event serves as a crucial 
platform for non-federal employees engaged in emergency management and 
affiliated with Tribal Nations or the Indian Health Service, as well as 
those directly involved with Tribal Nations.
    The 2024 Tribal Nations Training Week, which occurred from March 
9th to March 16th was hosted by the FEMA Center for Domestic 
Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama. These sessions include various 
workshops and discussions focusing on continuity of government 
operations planning, the National Incident Management System overview, 
disaster declaration processes, and all-hazards preparedness.
    The importance of the Tribal Nations Training Week is emphasized 
through several executive orders that recognize and affirm the Federal 
government's commitment to engaging in meaningful consultation and 
coordination with Indian Tribal Governments. Executive Orders such as 
13175, 13647, and 14112 emphasize the principles of Tribal sovereignty, 
self-determination, and trust responsibilities:
    <bullet>  Executive Order 13175 Consultation and Coordination with 
Indian Tribal Governments (2000) recognizes tribal rights of self-
government and tribal sovereignty, and affirmed and committed the 
Federal government to a work with Native American tribal governments on 
a government-to-government basis.

    <bullet>  Executive Order 13647 Establishing the White House 
Council on Native American Affairs (2013) establishes a national policy 
to ensure that the Federal Government engages in a true and lasting 
government-to-government relationship with Federally recognized tribes 
in a more coordinated and effective manner, including by better 
carrying out its trust responsibilities.

    <bullet>  Executive Order 14112 Reforming Federal Funding and 
Support for Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities 
and Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination (2023) highlights 
the federal government's obligation to reform federal funding and 
support for Tribal Nations, ensuring accessibility, flexibility, and 
equity in funding allocation. It establishes mechanisms to streamline 
access to federal funding, better embrace trust responsibilities, and 
assess unmet obligations to support Tribal Nations.

    FEMA is committed to engaging in government-to-government listening 
sessions and tribal consultations to better understand the needs of 
Tribal Nations to meet them where they are and create unique solutions 
to support them before, during, and after disasters.

  Questions to Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. Mike 
                                 Ezell

    Question 1. Homeowners, homebuilders, and floodplain managers in my 
district have expressed their concerns that mitigation measures, such 
as elevating a home, are not significantly reducing National Flood 
Insurance Program premiums. Specifically, how does FEMA consider 
mitigation measures that either local governments or individual 
homeowners take to lower their flood risk profile? Will FEMA provide 
greater transparency into how those measures factor into the algorithm 
and reduce premiums?
    Answer. Specific to property owner mitigation efforts, the National 
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides premium discounts based on a 
building's first floor height (elevation above the ground), foundation 
type, flood openings, flood proofing, and location of machinery and 
equipment (referred to as mitigation discounts). In contrast to NFIP 
legacy rating, the updated rating approach, which FEMA implemented in 
phases from October 1, 2021, through April 1, 2022, provides mitigation 
discounts to all properties regardless of the building's flood zone. 
For detailed information on how individual policyholder mitigation 
credits are applied, please see the Discount Explanation Guide and the 
Appendix D Rating Factors online at https://www.fema.gov/flood-
insurance/risk-rating. In the Appendix D Rating Factors file, the tabs 
for Foundation Type, First Floor Height, and Machinery and Equipment 
elevation above First Floor contain the specific rating factors used 
for each category or value for each of these three variables. FEMA 
encourages property owners to discuss mitigation options with their 
insurer and community officials. FEMA has also published a Flood 
Insurance Mitigation Discount tool to floodsmart.gov. This estimator 
provides discount information on certain rating variables that are 
generally applied to the building and contents premium. The tool can be 
publicly accessed at https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-
mitigation-discount-tool.
    Specific to community mitigation efforts, NFIP rate setting 
includes the impact of levee systems on flood risk reduction. FEMA 
partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to identify and 
use credible and consistently available information and methods to 
account for the level of risk reduction that levees provide to the 
buildings located behind them. The National Levee Database (NLD), 
developed and maintained by USACE, is the primary source for 
comprehensive information about all the nation's levees, as authorized 
by Congress. The NLD is a dynamic database that is continually updated 
to add or refine levee data from federal agencies, states, tribes, 
territories, and local sources. As levee systems are added to the NLD, 
the risk reduction they provide will be accounted for in subsequent 
rate updates. Community mitigation actions may also be incorporated 
into premiums through underlying datasets. The updated rating approach 
relies on the United States Geological Survey National Hydrography 
Dataset for delineation and classification of individual hydrographic 
features such as lakes and rivers.
    Stormwater management features, such as ditches, detention ponds, 
and weirs, may be reflected in both the elevation data from the United 
States Geological Survey and third-party catastrophe models. To the 
extent that these features are present in the elevation data and the 
flood models, they would implicitly be incorporated into rates for a 
local area. In addition, Risk MAP regulatory and non-regulatory 
products are used in the development of rates. As these products are 
updated to reflect local mitigation projects, these data will continue 
to inform the rates when rates are updated.

    Question 2. Per the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) 
authorizing statute, NFIP has the ``objective of making flood insurance 
available where necessary at reasonable rates as to encourage 
prospective insureds to purchase such insurance.'' However, since the 
implementation of Risk Rating 2.0., NFIP has lost 215,000 
policyholders, or 4.39% of all policyholders.
    Question 2.a. Why is NFIP seeing such a large reduction in 
policyholders?
    Answer. There are many reasons behind a property owner's decision 
to buy or not buy flood or other catastrophic insurance, including 
recent large scale flood events, inflation, and ``optimist bias'' 
(i.e., ``It has not flooded here in many years.''). At this time, there 
is no evidence to suggest the decline in NFIP policy count is solely 
connected to the new rating approach. By statute, FEMA is required to 
estimate and charge actuarially sound rates for most properties. The 
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA) requires FEMA to estimate 
actuarial premiums for all policyholders. 42 U.S.C. 4014(a)(1). 
Additionally, FEMA is required to charge most policyholders an 
actuarial premium, unless the statute requires FEMA to offer discounted 
premiums, such as the annual premium increase caps and properties newly 
mapped into special flood hazard areas. 42 U.S.C. 4015(c),(e) and (i). 
For a limited class of properties, certain primary residential homes 
built before FEMA published a flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for the 
community in which the home is located, (Pre-FIRM properties), FEMA has 
the authority to offer less than actuarial rates ``which would be 
reasonable, would encourage prospective insureds to purchase flood 
insurance . . .'' 42 U.S.C. 4014(a)(2); 4015(c). However, amendments to 
the NFIA in 2012 and 2014, have reduced the types of properties 
eligible for less than actuarial rates and mandated FEMA to increase 
premiums on these remaining properties by no less than 5 percent a year 
until the property reaches its actuarial rate. 42 U.S.C. 4014(e)(2).
    FEMA began using the updated rating approach in October 2021. Prior 
to the implementation of the updated approach, the NFIP policy count 
decreased at rates higher than those experienced post-updated rating 
approach implementation. While there was modest policy growth in the 
years after Hurricane Harvey (2017), the NFIP continued to see declines 
leading up to the implementation of the updated rating approach.
    After implementation of the updated rating approach in April 2022, 
the declining policy count began to level off. As of April 2024, the 
NFIP saw only a 1.8 percent decrease in policies (reflects the year 
over year average from April 2022 through April 2024), and the NFIP is 
seeing growth in some areas. For example, Florida has seen considerable 
growth over this same period (+2.2 percent or 37,000+ policies). While 
some policyholders experienced an increase in premiums under the 
updated rating approach, nearly 90 percent of all policyholders 
experienced premium adjustments in line with annual increases under the 
NFIP Legacy Rating System and approximately one million policyholders 
saw lower premiums under updated rating approach.
    Finally, to address policyholder affordability concerns, the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted to the 118th Congress 
seventeen (17) legislative proposals to reform the NFIP in April 2023. 
The proposals include legislative language for instituting a sound and 
transparent financial framework that allows the NFIP to balance 
affordability and fiscal soundness to ensure that more Americans are 
covered by flood insurance. Specifically, the legislative package 
includes a means-tested affordability program which will make insurance 
more affordable to low-and-moderate income policyholders. Further, the 
NFIP accrues $1.7 million in interest per day in debt incurred from 
previous catastrophic flood disasters post-Hurricane Katrina. 
Currently, the agency is paying $619 million annually on interest 
payments. Canceling the NFIP's debt creates a more fiscally sound 
framework that improves the NFIP's ability to pay claims for the 
program's 22,648 communities that rely upon the NFIP for financial 
protection against flooding.

    Question 2.b. How will this drop in policyholders affect NFIP's 
ability to cover their policyholders' claims?
    Answer. The NFIP is dedicated to helping people withstand the 
financial impact of flood risk and recover faster through flood 
insurance coverage. FEMA is statutorily mandated to charge actuarially 
sound rates for properties. This means that premium rates are 
calculated to pay for expected losses and the cost of an individual 
risk transfer. At actuarial rates, a hypothetical decrease in NFIP 
policyholders would not impact the ability for the NFIP to pay claims. 
The new rating approach is intended to address the NFIP legacy rates 
and augment the NFIP's financial position and ability to pay claims. 
Under the legacy approach, the NFIP borrowed from Treasury and paid 
interest on the loans to cover claims when premium reserves were 
insufficient. Currently, the NFIP pays approximately $619 million 
annually in interest on its Treasury loans and has paid over $6 billion 
in interest since it began to borrow after Hurricane Katrina. Once all 
policyholders are paying their full risk rate, under the updated 
pricing approach, premiums and reinsurance are estimated to be 
sufficient to cover all claims based on expected average annual losses 
up to a 1 in 20-year event.

    Question 3. FEMA has released a ``mitigation discount tool'' to 
help property owners assess their risk and provide insight into how 
certain mitigation measures can reduce their premiums. However, it does 
not show in actual dollars how this affects your premium. Does FEMA 
plan to create a more comprehensive, public-facing premium calculator, 
so that policyholders can see their rating factors and see how their 
rating factors affect their annual premium?
    Answer. Yes, FEMA is currently developing a direct-to-customer 
flood insurance quoting and sales tool. The tool will be rolled out in 
phases. During the first phase, customers will be able to generate a 
quote and locate an insurance agent to assist with purchasing a policy. 
This tool will enable property owners to discuss mitigation measures 
and their potential premium impacts with agents and community 
officials. Phase two will enable customers to purchase flood insurance 
entirely online. The goal of the tool is to eliminate the barriers some 
face accessing flood insurance, educate the public on the coverages and 
benefits of a flood insurance policy, and help property owners better 
assess their flood risks.

    Question 4. In the ``Risk Rating 2.0 Methodology and Data Sources'' 
document, FEMA's contractor (Milliman) said regarding their data 
reliability, ``In performing the services, we relied on data and other 
information provided to us by FEMA and other sources. We did not audit, 
verify, or review the data and other information for reasonableness and 
consistency. Such a review is beyond the scope of our assignment. If 
the underlying data or information is inaccurate or incomplete, the 
results of our analysis may likewise be inaccurate or incomplete. In 
that event, the results of our analysis may not be suitable for the 
intended purpose.'' If Risk Rating 2.0 seeks to assess the flood risk 
of each property individually, it is imperative the underlying data is 
accurate and complete. Unfortunately, there have been reports to the 
contrary. For example, the Office of the Flood Insurance Advocate has 
reported cases where Risk Rating 2.0 incorrectly identifies latitude 
and longitude for a structure.
    Would FEMA support a peer review for Risk Rating 2.0, to ensure 
that mitigation, other rating factors, and all data sources are 
accurate and as granular as possible?
    Answer. FEMA is using the best available data sources to support 
the development of rates. FEMA is pairing state-of-the-art industry 
technology (for example, catastrophe models) with the NFIP's mapping 
data to establish a new flood risk-informed rating approach. 
Catastrophe models have been used by private insurance companies to 
generate rates for over a decade. This work provides a comprehensive 
understanding of flood risk at both the national and local levels. Data 
sources being used include:
    <bullet>  FEMA sourced: Existing mapping data, NFIP policy and 
claims data.
    <bullet>  Other Federal Government sourced: Publicly available U.S. 
Geological Survey data, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Sea, Lake, and Overhead Surges from Hurricanes data, 
and USACE data sets.
    <bullet>  Third-party sourced: Commercially available structural 
and replacement cost data and catastrophe flood models.

    Since April 2021, the Methodology Data Source, Premium Calculation 
Worksheet Examples and Appendix D Rating Factors have been publicly 
available online at https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating.
    Stakeholders and the public have the ability today to review 
details about Risk Rating. For anyone interested in looking deeper into 
the making of the approach, the Methodology Data Source, Premium 
Calculation Worksheet Examples and Appendix D Rating Factors have been 
publicly available since April 2021 on NFIP's Pricing Approach at 
FEMA.gov [https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating]. A 2023 
Report by the Government Accountability Office which conducted an in-
depth review of the approach found that ``The new methodology 
substantially improves ratemaking by aligning premiums with the flood 
risk of individual properties''. The language referenced from Milliman 
is standard practice to include such contracts and required according 
to Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP), ASOP 23-Data Quality and 
ASOP-41 Actuarial Communications. The statement after the one quoted in 
question 4 describes Milliman's review of the data for reasonableness 
and consistency. Milliman's data was used for larger rate-setting that 
doesn't apply to the accuracy of latitude and longitudinal inputs for 
an individual structure.

    Question 5. Typically, an overhaul of the size of Risk Rating 2.0 
to NFIP would warrant a rulemaking process, which would give the public 
the opportunity to submit additional information and comments. The 
absence of this rulemaking process concerns me and my constituents that 
the agency did not consider all the stakeholders impacted by this 
decision. Can you please explain why FEMA believes it had the 
administrative authority to implement Risk Rating 2.0--the largest 
change to NFIP in its 56-year history--without a rulemaking process?
    Answer. This question is one of the issues that is currently the 
subject of litigation in State of Louisiana, et al., v. FEMA (ED LA 
Case No.23-1839). In response to Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary 
injunction [ECF 14), the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of FEMA, 
filed an opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction 
(Opposition, [ECF 47) and explained why rulemaking was not required for 
Risk Rating 2.0. The NFIP conducted extensive stakeholder engagement in 
advance of implementation of the pricing approach.

    Question 6. The Global Catastrophic Risk Management Act (GCRMA, 6 
U.S.C. Sec. 821-Sec. 825) requires updates to the Federal Interagency 
Operational Plans at the core of FEMA's strategic plans to respond to 
global catastrophes. Has FEMA started updating these plans and has the 
agency been coordinating with the state, local, tribal, and territorial 
governments in doing so? When can the Committee expect to get an update 
on this completion?
    Answer. The Federal Interagency Operational Plans (FIOPs) describe 
how the federal government aligns resources and delivers core 
capabilities to implement the five National Planning Frameworks. The 
FIOPs provide a federal concept of operations, integrating and 
synchronizing national-level capabilities, for prevention, protection, 
mitigation, response, and recovery to support all levels of government. 
These plans also help federal departments and agencies develop and 
maintain department-level operational plans. The Response and Recovery 
FIOP guides federal departments and agencies in executing response and 
recovery operations following a disaster or incident for which an 
interagency response is required. The FIOP is reviewed and updated 
periodically by an interagency collaborative planning team including 
SLTT governments.
    This team, led by FEMA, ensures consistency with both new and 
existing policies, addresses emerging threats, and hazards, and 
incorporates experience gained from interagency partners. In March 
2023, FEMA revised and published the Response and Recovery FIOP to meet 
the goals of its strategic plan, including highlighting the importance 
of response and recovery to catastrophic disasters. The new Response 
and Recovery FIOP is the first national-level plan to combine the 
response and recovery mission areas and connect the stabilization of 
lifelines with outcome driven recovery. It establishes the foundational 
plan that guides federal agencies and departments' response and 
recovery operations, replacing both the Response FIOP and the Recovery 
FIOP. It provides all-hazards strategic guidance to integrate and 
deliver response and recovery functions and core capabilities.

    Question 7. It has been shown that FEMA's administrative costs 
during disaster recovery stabilize during the first two years after 
they have occurred. However, actual administrative costs are not 
realized until a disaster is closed, and all financial transactions are 
complete. FEMA doesn't have a grasp on their true administrative costs 
until closeout, and closeout for some disasters isn't until almost 20 
years or later. What can FEMA do to speed up these closeouts and get 
the FEMA workforce back in the office and off these deployments?
    Answer. FEMA is implementing ways to speed up the processing time 
for closeouts including the Validate-As-You-Go Closeout Benefit (VCB), 
increasing the Small Project Threshold to $1M, and development of an 
administrative project closeout process. These efforts help to speed up 
and streamline the closeout of projects and disasters, which also 
reduces administrative costs. The VCB allows qualified Recipients to 
close large projects by submitting a certification, instead of 
submitting all the supporting documentation that is normally required 
for closeout. Small projects also are closed with a certification of 
review, thus increasing the Small Project threshold to $1M 
significantly increases the number of projects that will be closed as 
small projects. As part of an initiative to reduce the closeout 
backlog, FEMA is implementing an administrative project closeout 
process for Public Assistance grants. This will have a significant 
impact on reducing the backlog of open grants, the average time that 
grants stay open beyond their period of performance, and the associated 
administrative cost.

    Question 8. As originally introduced, the Disaster Recovery Reform 
Act (DRRA) proposed that FEMA would incentivize communities to take 
proactive steps before a disaster by increasing federal recovery 
assistance available after a disaster. Can you please provide an update 
on the status of the delayed implementation of these provisions?
    Answer. Since the President signed Disaster Recovery Reform Act 
(DRRA) into law, the following actions or initiatives have taken place 
in the Public Assistance (PA) program:
    <bullet>  Section 1206 authorizes FEMA to provide assistance to 
state and local governments for building code and floodplain management 
ordinance administration and enforcement. This resource provides 
communities with support to effectively administer and enforce building 
codes and floodplain management ordinances for a period of no longer 
than 180 days after the date of the major disaster declaration. The 
final policy was published Oct. 19, 2020, following a 45-day public 
comment period. To support the implementation of Section 1206, the PA 
program partnered with other areas within FEMA to draft the Public 
Assistance Companion Guide, Disaster Recovery Reform Act Section 1206. 
The PA program also developed a Building Code and Floodplain Management 
Administration and Enforcement Project Application which was approved 
by the Office of Management and Budget on Aug. 17, 2023. The project 
application provides help text and resources to guide applicants and 
recipients that may be unfamiliar with the provision.

    <bullet>  Section 1208 requires FEMA to develop guidance and annual 
training for state, local, tribal and territorial governments, first 
responders and utility companies. The Healthcare Facilities and Power 
Outages Guidance for State, Local, Tribal, Territorial, and Private 
Sector Partners [https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/
fema_DRRA-1208-healthcare-facilities-power-outages_guide.pdf] was 
released on August 22, 2019. It highlights the prioritization of power 
restoration for hospitals and nursing homes and the need to coordinate 
response plans before power outages occur.

    <bullet>  Section 1215 expanded the definition of management costs 
to include both direct and indirect administrative expenses by the SLTT 
government. It also allows FEMA to reimburse PA management costs up to 
12 percent of the total award amount (up to 7 percent for the recipient 
and 5 percent for the subrecipient). In November 2018, FEMA issued the 
Public Assistance Management Costs Interim Policy to implement the new 
management costs authority. In March 2023, PA simplified documentation 
and information requirements to streamline the program. This change 
significantly reduces detailed documentation as a starting point for 
applicants to demonstrate their actual costs incurred, and only request 
detailed documentation if additional review is necessary to clarify 
costs.

    <bullet>  Section 1219 provides for arbitration of disputes from 
the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) in lieu of a second 
appeal, under the PA program. The CBCA arbitrates at no cost to the 
parties. However, each party is directly responsible for all other 
expenses it incurs in the arbitration process. FEMA published a Fact 
Sheet providing additional guidance to help applicants understand their 
options and rights.

    <bullet>  Section 1228 requires FEMA, in coordination with the 
Federal Highway Administration, to issue guidance regarding the 
eligibility of inundated and submerged roads under the PA program. In 
April 2021, FEMA published the Public Assistance Guidance on Inundated 
and Submerged Roads policy. The policy will be incorporated into the 
Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide v5 to be published later 
this year.

    <bullet>  Section 1233 authorizes funding for earthquake risk 
reduction activities under the HMGP and BRIC. Specifically, DRRA 
Section 1233 revised the Stafford Act by adding a new Section 404(g) to 
allow recipients of hazard mitigation assistance to leverage such 
funding to support building capability for earthquake early warning 
(EEW) systems. EEW systems use seismic instrumentation to monitor 
seismic activity in real time to detect significant earthquakes near 
the source and transmit those signals to a seismic monitoring network 
that can quickly send out a warning to alert people within the region 
before shaking arrives. Section 404(g) lists three categories of 
activities that support building capability for EEW: 1) regional 
seismic networks; 2) geodetic networks; and 3) seismometers, Global 
Positioning System receivers, and associated infrastructure. The FEMA 
Fact Sheet [https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/fema_drra-
earthquake-early-warning-systems_fact-sheet_September-2020.pdf] 
published on September 30, 2020 explains how Section 1233 is 
implemented under the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs.

    <bullet>  Section 1235(b) authorized the Consensus-based Codes, 
Specifications, and Standards Policy for consistent and appropriate 
implementation of the consensus-based design, construction and 
maintenance codes, specifications, and standards for PA to promote 
resiliency and achieve risk reduction. FEMA's policy implementing this 
provision was issued for PA on December 20, 2019. An update to the 
policy is currently open for public review and comment.

    <bullet>  Section 1237 prohibits FEMA from recovering funds from a 
local government that received PA if the DHS Office of Inspector 
General finds that the local government relied on inaccurate 
information provided by a FEMA Technical Assistance Contractor. To 
address the identified deficiency, FEMA issued a memo to Region VI on 
February 15, 2019, and relevant project worksheets were reinstated. In 
this instance, FEMA interpreted DRRA Section 1237 to apply solely to a 
specific recoupment. FEMA acknowledges that in future instances where 
DRRA 1237 may apply, evaluation may be made on a case-by-case basis.

    <bullet>  Section 1238(b) supports the addition of center-based 
childcare to the definition of eligible Private Non-Profit facilities. 
A Fact Sheet describing this change was published in July 2019.

    <bullet>  Section 1241 directs FEMA to develop guidance, including 
best practices, for post-disaster evaluation of buildings by licensed 
architects and engineers to ensure that design professionals properly 
analyze the structural integrity and livability of buildings and 
structures after an array of natural hazard events, including: 
earthquakes; hurricanes; floods; tornadoes; tsunamis; landslides and 
other land instabilities; volcanoes; snow, hail, and ice storms; and 
fire; as well as damage from explosions. FEMA P-2055, Post-disaster 
Building Safety Evaluation Guidance [https://www.fema.gov/sites/
default/files/2020-07/fema_p-2055_post-
disaster_buildingsafety_evaluation_2019.pdf] was published in November 
2019.

    Question 9. Recent reports suggest that there's been a competition 
issue across the country, and in Mississippi, in FEMA's Building 
Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. For example, FEMA, in 
its recent updates to policies, such as the Interim Policy on 
Consensus-Based Codes and the Public Assistance Program and Policy 
Guide, has faced criticism for omitting major plumbing, mechanical, and 
electrical codes approved by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI). While FEMA has clarified that funding is not contingent on 
specific code adoption, concerns persist about the exclusion of 
important hazard-resistant design criteria. Can FEMA confirm its 
commitment to include all consensus-based codes, including those 
approved by ANSI, in its current policy review and future marketing 
materials? Additionally, can FEMA provide a timeline for the release of 
its upcoming Interim Policy on Consensus-Based Codes and the Public 
Assistance Program and Policy Guide?
    Answer. The adoption and enforcement of building codes, 
specifications, and standards is an important mitigation activity that 
provides significant resilience benefits. The importance of these 
activities is explicitly highlighted as one of the four intended BRIC 
program priorities, as referenced in the BRIC Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 
Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO): ``For FY 2023, the priorities for 
the program are to incentivize natural hazard risk reduction activities 
to include those that . . . increase funding to applicants that 
facilitate the adoption and enforcement of the latest published 
editions of building codes.'' For BRIC scoring in the National 
Competition, there are a maximum of 20 points (out of a possible 200) 
for building code criterion under the FY 2023 funding cycle. The BRIC 
program is currently in the process of developing the FY 2024 NOFO.

    Question 10. The State of Mississippi, in conjunction with the 
Southern Mississippi Planning and Development District and the coastal 
communities, have completed the MS Coastal Map Revision Project. A 
total of fifteen (15) Letter of Map Change applications were submitted 
through FEMA's Letter of Map Change portal on Monday March 11, 2024, 
representing each of the counties along the MS Gulf Coast and the 
comprising communities. This project has been closely coordinated with 
region 4 over the last 6+ years. At a recent Transportation and 
Infrastructure Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency 
Management Subcommittee hearing, you committed to ensuring these 
updates are included appropriately in the Risk Rating 2.0 calculations.
    Question 10.a. Can FEMA confirm funds have been allocated for the 
review of this project?
    Answer. Yes, FY 2024 funding is available for this project, and 
FEMA's Region 4 office has re-allocated funds so work can begin 
immediately.

    Question 10.b. What is the anticipated timeline for the Mississippi 
Coastal Map Revision Project from application submission through 
production of the Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps?
    Answer. Preliminary products are expected to be released in 
Calendar Year 2025 based on the schedule provided by the Cooperating 
Technical Partner who will be managing the map issuance. Prior to 
preliminary product issuance, the submittal requires a review and 
digital FIRM production work that will extend into 2025.

 Question to Kristen D. Bernard, Deputy Inspector General for Audits, 
Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from 
                            Hon. Rick Larsen

    Question 1. The report for the House Department of Homeland 
Security Appropriations Bill, 2022 included language directing OIG to 
consider inequities in the delivery of disaster assistance to disaster 
survivors. On page 23-24, the report states:

        ``The Committee is aware of concerns raised about inequities in 
        the delivery of disaster assistance to disaster survivors, 
        especially through FEMA's Individual and Household Program 
        (IHP), including concerns expressed by constituents, media 
        reports and a recent GAO Report, Disaster Assistance Additional 
        Actions Needed to Strengthen FEMA's Individuals and Households 
        Program GAO-20-503. Among these concerns are that FEMA's 
        programs provide disproportionately less assistance to minority 
        communities and those in urban and rural disadvantaged 
        communities; and that FEMA's application process and procedures 
        are too complicated, causing many to discontinue their 
        applications or forego appeals due to a mistaken belief that 
        they are not eligible. In addition, FEMA's attempts to prevent 
        fraudulent applications may be so restrictive as to 
        inadvertently screen out many who may appropriately qualify for 
        assistance. The OIG is directed to review FEMA's application 
        process and procedures for IHP, including its methods to 
        prevent fraudulent applications, and to brief the Committee on 
        its findings within 120 days of the date of enactment of this 
        Act. The briefing shall detail whether recommendations from 
        oversight entities, including the OIG, may have inadvertently 
        led FEMA to develop policies and procedures that are overly 
        restrictive and, as a result, may be preventing disaster 
        survivors who need IHP from receiving that assistance.''

    Please provide a summary of the briefing provided to the 
Appropriations Committee that was requested in the House Department of 
Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2022 report language. If no 
briefing was provided, provide a written response to the requests 
outlined in the report language.
    Answer:
                               Background
    On July 15, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office 
of Inspector General (OIG) provided written correspondence to the 
Senate Appropriations Committee and House Appropriations Committee, 
Homeland Security Subcommittees (SAC-HS and HAC-HS, respectively), 
serving to satisfy the mandated reporting included in the Joint 
Explanatory Statement [https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20220307/
BILLS-117RCP35-JES-DIVISION-F.pdf] for the Omnibus Appropriations bill 
for Fiscal Year 2022 (H.R. 2471, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2022).
    Our correspondence provided links to three audit reports that 
addressed certain aspects of FEMA's applicating process and procedures 
for the Individuals and Household Program (IHP):
    <bullet>  FEMA Did Not Sufficiently Safeguard Use of Transportation 
Assistance Funds, OIG-19-66 (September 30, 2019)
    <bullet>  FEMA Has Made More than $3 Billion in Improper and 
Potentially Fraudulent Payments for Home Repair Assistance since 2003, 
OIG-20-23 (April 6, 2020)
    <bullet>  FEMA Has Paid Billions in Improper Payments for SBA 
Dependent Other Needs Assistance since 2003, OIG-20-60 (August 12, 
2020)

    Our correspondence explained that of the eight recommendations we 
issued to FEMA, seven were open and unresolved (meaning FEMA did not 
concur with and did not implement seven of the eight recommendations). 
These recommendations related to documentation and verification to 
discern eligibility, and performance of risk assessments. As of April 
1, 2024, the seven recommendations remain unresolved and unimplemented. 
Because FEMA never implemented these seven recommendations, it is 
reasonable to conclude that FEMA was not influenced by the 
recommendations. The Department/FEMA, not DHS OIG, is responsible for, 
and has statutory authority for, all operational and programmatic 
decisions related to its programs, including IHP assistance.
                             Staff Briefing
    On August 29, 2022, DHS OIG also conducted a staff-level briefing 
for SAC-HS and HAC-HS. DHS OIG provided an overview of IHP and 
explained that it is one of several assistance programs designed to 
support disaster survivors. Through IHP, FEMA provides assistance in 
the form of rent, home repair or replacement, transportation repair or 
replacement, funeral expenses, personal property, medical, dental, or 
other miscellaneous expenses. Each type of assistance may have distinct 
eligibility requirements that vary by disaster and can vary by state.
    We also briefed SAC-HS and HAC-HS about the three completed audits 
referenced above. We reiterated that seven of the eight recommendations 
remained open and unresolved and provided information about three 
ongoing audits. We again stated that FEMA did not agree with and did 
not implement those seven of the eight recommendations that we issued, 
and therefore it was inappropriate to conclude that FEMA was influenced 
by our recommendations.
                             Ongoing Audits
    The three ongoing audits addressed during the August 29, 2022 
briefing have been completed. The reports disclose similar findings and 
recommendations:
    <bullet>  FEMA Did Not Prevent More than $3.7 Billion in Improper 
Payments from the Lost Wages Assistance Program, OIG-22-69 (September 
16, 2022) [https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-09/
OIG-22-69-Sep22.pdf]
    <bullet>  The Identities of DHS Employees Were Linked to More than 
$2.6 Million in Potentially Fraudulent Lost Wages Assistance, OIG-22-73 
(September 27, 2022) [https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/
assets/2022-09/OIG-22-73-Sep22.pdf]
    <bullet>  Ineffective Controls Over COVID-19 Funeral Assistance 
Leave the Program Susceptible to Waste and Abuse, OIG-23-42 (August 22, 
2023) [https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-08/OIG-
23-42-Aug23.pdf]

    As of April 1, 2024, these three reports also have eight 
recommendations that remain unresolved. Here is a summary of the more 
recent unresolved recommendations:
    <bullet>  6 unresolved recommendations for OIG-22-69: FEMA does not 
agree with our report message or recommendations because the agency 
believes it will never execute another Lost Wages Assistance type 
program in the future. FEMA's belief is unresponsive to the 
recommendations which are aimed to improve processes for when FEMA 
faces a new challenge in the future and must build another program from 
the ground up.

    <bullet>  1 unresolved recommendation for OIG-22-73: FEMA did not 
agree with our recommendation that it develop and implement a process 
to review state administrative plans for consistency and ensure they 
include fraud prevention and mitigation strategies.

    <bullet>  1 unresolved recommendation for OIG-23-42: FEMA continues 
to disagree with our recommendation to resolve questioned costs 
totaling $24.4 million for expenses deemed ineligible by FEMA's 
Individual Assistance Program and Policy Guide and determine the amount 
of debt owed by recipients for erroneous payments. FEMA argues the 
costs we questioned were eligible because it had broad authority to 
determine eligible costs for funeral assistance.
                               GAO Audit
    In a related audit issued in September 2022, FEMA Made Efforts to 
Address Inequities in Disadvantaged Communities Related to COVID 19 
Community Vaccination Center Locations and Also Plans to Address 
Inequity in Future Operations, OIG-22-74 [https://www.oig.dhs.gov/
sites/default/files/assets/2022-09/OIG-22-74-Sep22.pdf], we made two 
recommendations. One recommendation addressed collecting demographic 
data of applicants for FEMA assistance, recipients, and subrecipients. 
In response, FEMA began collecting certain demographic information from 
applicants on a voluntary basis during the IHP registration process. At 
the time we closed the recommendation, 88.65 percent of the applicants 
provided demographic data. According to FEMA officials, this data will 
enable FEMA to respond to a recommendation from the Government 
Accountability Office to ``help ensure the availability and use of 
quality information that includes (1) information requirements, (2) 
data sources and methods, and (3) strategies for overcoming information 
challenges--to support federal agencies involved in disaster recovery 
in identifying access barriers or disparate outcomes'' (GAO-22-10439)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            FEMA Rulemaking
    Finally, on January 2024, FEMA announced significant changes 
through an Interim Final Rule for Individual Assistance with a goal to 
reach more survivors and deliver assistance faster and to reduce equity 
issues. According to FEMA, with these updates, survivors of disasters 
declared on or after March 22 will have access to a wider range of 
assistance that is easier to understand and tailored to their unique 
needs.\2\ We will consider a review of the implementation of this new 
regulation as we plan future work.
