                                                    Washington, DC.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND

    The Chairman. This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee will come to order.
    Our hearing today is on anti-NGO laws and other tools of 
democratic repression, and we thank our witnesses for being 
here to share their expertise and knowledge and to help us deal 
with this extremely important subject, a trend that we have 
seen growing that is adding to the concerns of the backsliding 
of democratic states.
    The use of defamation laws, foreign agent registration 
laws, and anti-NGO laws to silence free speech is nothing new.
    We see it in Russia, in Nicaragua, and Uganda, whose 
leaders have long used these tools to target journalists, 
judges, civil society activists, and opposition political 
figures to consolidate power and silence dissenting voices and 
views.
    Ethiopia has shuttered over 1,500 civil society 
organizations for failing to submit their annual reports. 
Uganda's horrific new law targeting LGBTQI+ individuals has 
resulted in mass evictions, violence, and arrests.
    India, over the years, has weaponized this Foreign 
Contribution Regulation Act to suspend several American and 
international NGOs' operations in the country including 
respected human rights organizations like Amnesty 
International.
    And Hungary launched an investigation into Transparency 
International, a nongovernmental organization that takes on 
corruption worldwide.
    Of course, the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing is an 
expert as using so called legal mechanisms to silence citizens 
and critics alike.
    Nowhere has this been more on display than what has 
occurred in Hong Kong in recent years as the passage of the 
National Security Law and entry into force of Article 23 
destroyed what remains of Hong Kong's democracy.
    But in recent years we have also seen more and more nations 
that we would consider mostly democratic or partially free 
turning to these laws as tools of repression.
    It is deeply concerning that democracies from Georgia to 
India to Turkey have used their legal systems against 
journalists, opposition politicians, human rights defenders, 
and civil societies.
    So I want to thank our witnesses for appearing before us 
today to discuss this important topic. You have all done 
impressive work in this space.
    I want to acknowledge that many of these laws are totally 
legitimate. There are reasons to register foreign agents, to 
protect individuals from defamatory attacks, to require NGOs to 
pay fees or taxes one time, to use Interpol red notices to 
track down fugitives and criminals.
    And you might hear some of these actors claim we are not 
anti-civil society; you have a registration of the 501(c)(3) 
laws in the United States.
    Yes, but of course, the problem is when these laws are 
turned into tools of repression and intimidation. Those in 
power know the effects of these tactics.
    They have led to draw on expensive procedures. The heavy 
financial and psychological cost of these legal measures on 
their targets creates a chilling effect, silencing government 
critics and stifling democratic dissent.
    That is why as chairman of this committee I have made it a 
concerted effort to counter these trends: the Human Rights 
Defenders Act, which I introduced this year, the Transnational 
Repression and Accountability and Prevention Act, which was 
enacted last year, the International Freedom Protection Act, 
which the committee has reported out, and of course, the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.
    Since the Global Magnitsky sanctions program went into 
effect in 2017 the United States has sanctioned over 650 
foreign persons and entities. Congress, acting on a bipartisan 
basis, has made huge impacts in supporting and defending human 
rights.
    The United States and the international community have 
certainly taken important steps to address these challenges. I 
am very supportive of programs like Reporter Shield, 
Journalists in Distress Network, Scholars at Risk, and the 
lifeline embattled CSO assistance funds.
    These are all critically important. But we need to do more, 
and time is of the essence.
    For so many years the Republic of Georgia has been a bright 
spot in the former Soviet Union. But just this April, despite 
massive street demonstrations, the government passed a foreign 
influence registration law that goes into effect this fall. 
Amazingly, this law is modeled after a Russian law, and 
considering what Russia has done to Georgia, that is 
unbelievable that they would follow that path that allows the 
government to target nonprofits and activists.
    It intends to intimidate and ultimately force the closure 
of civil society voices that are out of step with the 
government.
    The sponsors of the law and the governing Georgia Dream 
political party have been very clear about their intentions and 
about which civil society actors they perceive as enemies.
    The poster behind me shows a bank of posters hung in front 
of one of our witnesses' home, Eka Gigauri. She has to face 
that every morning when she walks out of her house. Similar 
posters have been placed in front of Transparency International 
offices.
    These posters say, ``Our homeland is not for sale,'' 
calling in question the loyalty of the people that are 
advocating against these repressive laws, a statement intended 
to impugn and label NGO leaders as foreign agents.
    Congress and this committee in particular has a 
responsibility to take bold legislative action to confront the 
use of these laws head on and to support the bold activists 
that are determined to hold on to democracy.
    Today in my office I am releasing a video showcasing the 
incredible stories and work of human rights defenders, 
courageous people from Uganda, Venezuela, Burma, and Colombia 
who are speaking out in order to hold their governments 
accountable.
    I encourage you to visit the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee website and our Twitter account at SFRC--Dems to 
watch the video.
    I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work 
to protect the essential elements of liberal democracies: 
Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, media freedom, and 
religious freedom.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, their 
assessment of our efforts in this regard so far, and 
suggestions on how we can be more effective in the years to 
come.
    It is now my pleasure to turn to the distinguished ranking 
member, Senator Risch, for his opening comments.

               STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Risch. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for 
that, and certainly your work in this field is to be recognized 
and appreciated.
    First and foremost, I think we should all agree and 
recognize this is not a partisan issue. This is a bipartisan 
issue, and it is an American issue and something we all need to 
work on together.
    Unfortunately, it is a fact that autocrats and their 
governments will do whatever it takes to stay in power. They 
survive and in some cases reemerge, using creative methods to 
repress their political opposition and silence human rights 
advocates and others who seek to shine a light on their 
actions.
    The tool of choice for authoritarians these days is anti-
nongovernmental organization laws, also referred to as foreign 
agent laws. These laws claim to stop foreign influence but in 
reality are used to close the space for civil society and 
opposition.
    Autocrats fear the loss of control, and this ensures 
opposing ideas are neither seen nor heard. It should not 
surprise anyone that the model anti-NGO law was first designed 
by Vladimir Putin.
    Russia's anti-NGO law has been used as a model since then 
across the world in repressive places. In nations like 
Azerbaijan and Belarus dictators have used lawfare to 
consolidate control and close the space that once existed for 
small amounts of free speech.
    Laws that criminalize government watchdogs and champions of 
democracy are used to crush dissent and shield corrupt 
officials from scrutiny.
    In places like Sudan and Syria both formal and informal 
restrictions are used by malign actors to control what, when, 
where, and to whom life saving aid can be delivered.
    This weaponization of restrictions against legitimate NGOs 
undermines U.S. values and interests. I am particularly 
concerned about our friends in Georgia. Despite clear 
statements from the EU, the passing laws to restrict NGO 
activities will halt EU membership.
    Georgia's government has persisted. I am glad the U.S. has 
undertaken a review of our policies toward Georgia and am 
supportive of the current pause in assistance.
    Senator Shaheen and I were pleased to go to Georgia in 2012 
as we watched the first real free and fair election. I think 
both of us were very pleased at what happened and the way it 
was initially received.
    Since then, our confidence and our view, at least mine, and 
I think, having conversations with Senator Shaheen, have been 
disappointed, and I think that is probably an understatement, 
at the movement back toward what the Georgian people had been 
blessed with, and that was freedom from the Russian bear.
    So we hope as we go forward that things turn around in 
Georgia. Hungary has also made several attempts to advance 
anti-NGO legislation, and Slovakia has an active proposal that 
would require NGOs that receive funding from abroad to label 
themselves organizations with foreign support.
    The EU has warned that it will take legal action and launch 
infringement procedures against Slovakia if it does so.
    In China it is no surprise the government views foreign 
NGOs as threats to its national security. Its anti-NGO law 
drastically reduced the ability of both foreign and domestic 
civil society actors to work in China.
    China is locking up human rights advocates and torturing 
them, and it is pursuing them abroad through transnational 
repression.
    We must remember these victims and advocate for them. I am 
submitting a list of their names for the record. Beijing's 
actions do not occur in a vacuum. When it prosecutes human 
rights advocates other authoritarian actors take note.
    In 2020 Beijing unilaterally imposed a national security 
law on Hong Kong ending the city's fragile autonomy. Since then 
the Hong Kong government has weaponized this law and other 
colonial era laws to criminalize political dissent.
    I think we are all aware of the terrible case of Jimmy Lai. 
His trial has been delayed repeatedly and is a mockery of the 
rule of law. Hundreds of other political prisoners have been 
jailed alongside Mr. Lai in Hong Kong, and the government has 
even pursued dissidents who fled by issuing extraterritorial 
arrest warrants.
    In Africa many governments use anti-NGO laws to restrict 
civil society activities, limit funding from international 
donors, and control the operations of local and international 
partners, including USAID.
    This is happening in countries like Tunisia, Tanzania, 
Sudan, Chad, Zimbabwe, and Rwanda. These examples I have just 
cited are just a few of the many that occur all around the 
world.
    This problem is only growing as technology changes and 
those in power find new ways to hold on to control. The United 
States must do more to combat this trend.
    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today what 
they are doing and what more can be done on this important 
issue.
    With that, I yield back to you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Let me thank Senator Risch for his opening 
comments, and as you pointed out in the beginning, I could have 
given your opening statement, you could have given my opening 
statement, because I think we both agree on the challenges that 
we have to democratic states and other oppressive states on the 
use of these tools.
    So today we are honored to have three distinguished 
witnesses. I am going to introduce each of you. Your full 
statements will be made part of the record. We will ask that 
you proceed to try to summarize your comments in about 5 
minutes, leaving time for questions.
    We are honored to welcome Mr. Douglas Rutzen, the president 
and CEO of the International Center for Nonprofit Law, where he 
has worked to improve the legal environment for civil societies 
and public participation worldwide.
    Mr. Rutzen also serves on the OECD Civic Space Observatory 
Advisory Group and previously served on the advisory board of 
the U.N. Democracy Fund. He has also served on USAID 
Administrators Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid and 
co-chaired the State Department's Global Philanthropy Working 
Group.
    I am also honored to welcome Ms. Eka Gigauri, a Georgian 
public figure and civil activist who has been the executive 
director of Transparency International Georgia since 2010, one 
of the leading organizations in the fight against corruption.
    She has bravely led efforts to counter Georgia's anti-civil 
society legislation. She has also deep government experience, 
firmly serving as the deputy head of the Border Police of 
Georgia where she successfully moved forward anti-corruption 
reforms and within the ministry of foreign affairs.
    And last, I am pleased to welcome Yaqiu Wang, the research 
director for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House. Ms. 
Wang has an extensive history of working on human rights issues 
in the region.
    Previously served as a senior China researcher at Human 
Rights Watch. She has also worked on press freedom issues with 
the Committee to Protect Journalists focusing on China and 
other Asian countries.
    With that, we will start with Mr. Rutzen.

  STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS RUTZEN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
     OFFICER, INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT LAW, 
                         WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Rutzen. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member 
Risch, distinguished members of the committee. It is an honor 
to testify today.
    First, the data. In the last 5 years, 72 countries have 
introduced 270 measures restricting civil society. Governments 
are converting the rule of law into the rule by law to control 
civil society and constrain civic freedom.
    Disaggregating the data, 33 percent of the measures 
restrict the ability to form or operate a nonprofit. Last month 
in Venezuela the National Assembly passed a law that would give 
Maduro's regime unbridled discretion to determine which 
nonprofits can exist.
    At the same time, as Chairman Cardin referenced, Nicaragua 
closed down 1,500 nonprofits including religious organizations, 
human rights groups, and the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Nicaragua. In Afghanistan the government issued an order 
banning women from working in a nonprofit.
    So the first trend from the data: Barriers to participate 
in civil society. Second, governments are restricting the 
ability of civil society to access resources.
    Consider Niger, where a nonprofit requires governmental 
approval to receive donations even from local businesses or 
citizens. Other countries, including Egypt, require 
governmental approval to receive international philanthropy or 
bilateral assistance.
    We are also finding, as Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member 
Risch articulated, the rise of these anti-foreign influence 
laws, which are overbroad and intended to defund, delegitimize, 
and intimidate defenders of democracy.
    And this brings me to the third and final trend from the 
data. Fifty percent of the restrictions sweep across society. 
Examples include the national security law in Hong Kong, 
Burma's counterterrorism law, and Belarus's law on extremism.
    Governments are using these laws to target defenders 
regardless of the sector they are in, whether civil society, 
business, the media, or otherwise. They also couple this with 
other tools including surveillance, harassment of the defenders 
and their families, imprisonment, or worse.
    As a result, we are seeing a holistic compression of civic 
space. Some say that the world is witnessing a democratic 
recession, but many countries have already entered a new phase: 
The great repression.
    But progress is possible thanks to courageous colleagues on 
the front lines in the defense of democracy. And how can this 
committee support those efforts? As detailed in my written 
testimony, there are three Ps: Programs, personnel, and policy.
    First, programs. The U.S. Government should create a global 
program to serve as an early warning system and to preemptively 
address anti-NGO laws.
    In terms of mitigation programs, let us ramp up initiatives 
that help defenders operate in restrictive environments. A good 
example is the Surge and Sustain Fund which helps defenders 
access the internet. And let us expand protection programs to 
cover the full range of defenders under threat.
    Second, personnel. Let us ensure there is sufficient 
personnel at both State and AID to address the defense of 
democracy including transnational repression.
    Finally, policy. Senator Cardin, I thank you for your 
leadership in championing the Global Magnitsky Act. However, in 
recent years there has been a slowdown in the use of sanctions. 
Perhaps the committee could exercise oversight authority to 
promote the more effective use of these authorities.
    Finally, as bills advance through the Senate, please help 
ensure that they safeguard civil society, not only 
internationally but also here at home.
    In closing, thank you for holding this hearing and inviting 
me to testify. I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Rutzen follows:]

                Prepared Statement of Mr. Douglas Rutzen

    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, distinguished members of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee: thank you for inviting me to 
testify. I appreciate your interest in the legal environment for civil 
society around the world.
                         democratic repression
    According to Freedom House, global freedom has declined for 18 
consecutive years. Seventy-one percent of the world's population--5.7 
billion people--live in autocracies. Some say the world is witnessing a 
``democratic recession,'' but many countries have already entered a new 
phase: the Great Repression.
    As a tool of repression, governments are enacting legislation to 
restrict civil society, including human rights groups, development 
organizations, religious organizations, and chambers of commerce. In 
doing so, governments undermine freedom, peace, and prosperity.
    According to ICNL data, 72 countries have introduced more than 270 
legal initiatives restricting civil society over the past 5 years. 
Governments are converting the rule of law into the rule by law. They 
are using legislation to consolidate power, control civil society, and 
constrain civic freedom.
                             global trends
Lifecycle Legislation
    Thirty-three percent of recent restrictions undermine the right of 
people to form and operate a civil society organization (``CSO''). 
Combined with preexisting laws, governments have erected significant 
legal barriers to enter civic space. For example:

    <bullet> In Belarus, organizing or participating in the activities 
of an unregistered association is a criminal offense subject to 
imprisonment.

    <bullet> In Eritrea, a citizen seeking to establish a relief 
organization must have access to $1 million, which is more than the 
average Eritrean will earn in her entire lifetime.

    <bullet> In Afghanistan, the Ministry of Economy issued a ban on 
female employees of domestic and international CSOs.

    <bullet> Last month, the National Assembly of Venezuela passed a 
law that gives the government almost unbridled discretion over which 
CSOs can register and subjects registered organizations to strict 
government control.

    <bullet> At the same time, the Nicaraguan government revoked the 
legal status of more than 1,500 nonprofits, including hundreds of 
religious organizations, the American Chamber of Commerce of Nicaragua, 
and human rights groups.
Access to International Solidarity and Support
    Governments are restricting the right of civil society to receive 
funding from domestic and international sources. Instead of defending 
civil society, they are defunding civil society, undermining 
fundamental freedoms and property rights. For example:

    <bullet> In Niger, development CSOs must obtain government approval 
to receive donations, including from local citizens and businesses.

    <bullet> In Saudi Arabia, a CSO must have the government's 
permission to organize domestic fundraising events, even a gala dinner.

    <bullet> In Egypt and many other countries, the government has 
broad discretion to determine whether a CSO can receive international 
funding.

    <bullet> Eighteen countries, including Georgia, have introduced 
foreign influence registration laws. Many of these laws have overbroad 
and vague provisions, enabling governments to stigmatize, burden, and 
isolate civil society.
The Evolution of Legal Restrictions
    Years ago, scholars wrote about closing space and focused on laws 
targeting CSOs. Today, we are seeing the rise of restrictive laws that 
apply to all sectors of society. These whole-of-society laws account 
for 50 percent of the legal restrictions tracked by ICNL over the past 
5 years.
    These laws enable governments to target democracy defenders in 
civil society, the political opposition, business, the media, or 
otherwise. For example:

    <bullet> This year, the National Security Law in Hong Kong was used 
to convict dozens of democracy defenders of subversion.

    <bullet> Indonesia's Criminal Code outlaws statements that 
undermine the ``honor'' or ``dignity'' of the President or Vice 
President. It also prohibits verbal and written insults against the 
government or state institutions.

    <bullet> Tanzania's Online Content Regulations prohibit the 
publication of any online content about the weather, droughts, or 
``natural calamities'' without approval from the authorities.

    <bullet> Last month, a military court sentenced a local journalist 
to life in prison under Burma's overbroad counterterrorism law.

    <bullet> Belarus is misusing counterterrorism and anti-extremism 
legislation to stifle dissent.

    <bullet> In Venezuela, Maduro's regime arrested over 2,400 people 
connected to post-election protests.

    At the same time, many governments target defenders by utilizing 
surveillance, online harassment, Interpol red notices, imprisonment, or 
worse. Governments have an extensive toolkit to compress civic space 
and repress democracy.
               progress is possible with local leadership
    Countries as diverse as Nigeria, Moldova, and Morocco have adopted 
more enabling legislation affecting civil society, though continued 
vigilance is necessary. In many other countries, restrictive laws have 
been rejected. In addition, courageous individuals around the world are 
undertaking heroic efforts to advance democracy and rights in 
restrictive environments--often at great risk to themselves.
    Democracy and rights cannot be imposed from outside. Fortunately, 
in every country, there are people whose skill and dedication inspire 
confidence that progress is possible.
                 illustrative international initiatives
    While reform must come from within, the international community can 
assist by helping to safeguard defenders and civic space. There are 
scores of initiatives; the following are a few illustrative examples:

    <bullet> The Lifeline Embattled CSO Assistance Fund, which provides 
small, short-term emergency grants to CSOs threatened because of their 
human rights work.

    <bullet> Reporter's Shield, a USAID-funded program that defends 
investigative reporting around the world from legal threats meant to 
silence critical voices.

    <bullet> The Surge and Sustain Fund, a program run by the 
Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The 
fund supports user costs for open-source VPN and circumvention 
solutions serving users in highly restrictive censorship environments.

    <bullet> Scholars at Risk and the Journalists in Distress Network, 
which provide support for academics and journalists under threat.

    <bullet> The Open Government Partnership, where civil society and 
governments co-create commitments to enhance civic space and to promote 
participatory, accountable governance.

    Foundations, international organizations, and the private sector 
play a critically important role in this ecosystem of support. In 
addition, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United 
Kingdom are among the governments that have strategically engaged to 
protect and promote civic space.
                            recommendations
    Based on the input of our partners around the world and the current 
ecosystem of support, I respectfully suggest three lines of effort for 
the Committee's consideration: Programs, Personnel, and Policy:

    1. Programs. Programs should prioritize prevention, mitigation, and 
protection.
    In terms of prevention, the US Government should create a stand-
alone global program that proactively and preemptively addresses anti-
NGO laws and related legal threats to civil society. This is a top 
priority.
    In terms of mitigation, let's ramp up programs that help defenders 
operate in restrictive environments, such as the Surge and Sustain 
Fund.
    In terms of protection, there are already a number of programs. 
Let's review their scope to see if they should be expanded to cover new 
categories of defenders. In addition, let's be sure they offer 
comprehensive services, including risk assessments, digital security, 
physical security, legal assistance, and psychosocial support.

    2. Personnel. The US Government should ensure there are sufficient 
personnel dedicated to addressing threats to defenders, including 
transnational repression. This should include trained officials in the 
Department of State's regional bureaus and additional staff in USAID's 
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance and the Department of 
State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. In addition, 
regional bureaus and embassies should be required to have specific 
plans in place on the protection of defenders and to report regularly 
on the sufficiency and implementation of those plans.

    3. Policy. I thank Senator Cardin for his leadership in championing 
the Global Magnitsky Act. The Act has significantly advanced 
accountability for human rights violations around the world, and it 
serves as a model for other countries establishing similar mechanisms.
    That said, as colleagues at Human Rights First have documented, 
there has been a significant slowdown in the use of Global Magnitsky 
sanctions in recent years. Perhaps the Committee could exercise its 
oversight role to promote more and effective use of these authorities. 
We would also welcome legislative language encouraging the 
Administration to consider transnational repression, and the 
undermining of democratic institutions, when determining whether to 
impose sanctions.
    In addition, at the Summit for Democracy, 13 countries committed to 
supporting civil society in exile. The US should engage with these 
countries to ensure there is a safe place for human rights and 
democracy defenders to continue their courageous work.
    As a final policy ask, a number of bills affecting civil society 
are working their way through Congress. When you consider these bills, 
please ensure that they safeguard civil society and philanthropy, both 
internationally and at home. If helpful, ICNL is prepared to provide 
nonpartisan analysis, and please be assured of ICNL's continued 
collegial and constructive engagement as bills arise.
    In closing, I thank Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Risch for 
inviting me to testify at today's hearing. I appreciate the opportunity 
to share ICNL's perspectives with the Committee, and I look forward to 
your questions.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much for your comments.
    We will now go to Ms. Gigauri.

  STATEMENT OF EKA GIGAURI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TRANSPARENCY 
            INTERNATIONAL GEORGIA, TBILISI, GEORGIA

    Ms. Gigauri. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member 
Risch, distinguished Senators. Thank you for the opportunity to 
speak at this hearing. I am thankful for the long standing 
bipartisan support toward Georgia by this committee.
    I am here to share a local perspective on resisting anti-
NGO laws in Georgia as well as my personal experience of being 
targeted as a human rights defender.
    The introduction of anti-NGO laws in different parts of the 
world is an alarming and growing trend. Anti-NGO laws first 
championed by Putin's regime in Russia enabled a smooth shift 
toward the consolidated autocracy.
    In countries like Georgia, when such laws are introduced, 
autocrats amplify Russian anti-Western disinformation, 
cultivate social division, and undermine partnership with the 
U.S. and the EU, all against the will of the majority of 
citizens.
    Prevailing in this struggle requires two key elements: 
Unity among proactive citizens who have chosen freedom, valuing 
it enough to defend it, and consistently strong support from 
the international democratic community for the vibrant civil 
societies they help develop and grow.
    In Georgia this means the United States speaking and acting 
with a legitimate moral authority assertively and convincingly 
as it has done for nearly three decades when it helped 
Georgians protect their sovereignty, independence, and 
democratic aspirations.
    This is not to suggest that America should do the job for 
citizens who choose freedom over authoritarian rule. A free 
country is never granted, even by the greatest allies. It is 
earned by its citizens for whom America has always been an 
inspiration.
    The key point is that in places where the pro-democracy 
movements are strong and America's well established 
partnerships are challenged by actors like Russia, as in 
Georgia maintaining a high level of support in backing 
democratic aspirations of nations can tip the balance.
    In Georgia the introduction of anti-NGO laws, commonly 
referred to as the Russian law, sparked massive resistance.
    Yet, the authorities continue to push the red lines to 
establish a Russian style system of governance. For every 
citizen of Georgia the upcoming elections on October 26 are 
essentially a referendum on a clear choice between a 
democratic, prosperous European future and the misery of being 
a Russian satellite.
    If Georgian democracy is defeated and the country pledged 
into the Russian orbit again, this would mean an evaporation of 
the chances for the further democratic development of any 
country eastwards and southwards from Georgia.
    Geopolitically, this would mean Russia once again marking 
its backyard, claiming Georgia as a part of its sphere of 
influence.
    As per Russian playbook autocrat objectives are simple--
silencing critical voices, closing civic space, and 
neutralizing free media. Anti-NGO legislation is a convenient 
tool for these goals, providing a facade of legality.
    In Georgia, the process proceeded in three phases. The 
first one was preparing the ground for legalizing repressions. 
In this phase a massive coordinated smear campaign was launched 
against the civil society, USAID, and U.S. based democratic 
promoting organizations.
    Among others, my family members and I have been subject to 
verbal attack and intimidation by high level public officials 
as well.
    Phase two, passing the law despite the public opposition. 
So the law was passed. Mirroring Russian disinformation, 
authorities amplified coordinated disinformation, portraying 
civil society and their international supporters as a global 
war party destabilizing Georgia.
    The government adopted an openly anti-American stance and 
announced a shift away from the strategic partnership with the 
West.
    The phase three, enforcement of the law. It includes 
labeling NGOs' members and activists as foreign agents, a term 
deeply stigmatized in Georgia due its Soviet era connotations, 
imposing heavy fines and seizuring assets of those who refuse 
to register, requiring NGOs to disclose sensitive personal data 
with refusal leading to the penalties and asset freezes.
    The situation in Georgia is dramatic, but I am not here to 
seek sympathy. In Georgia we are engaged in a generational and 
existential struggle defending sovereignty, independence, and 
the dream of a democratic future.
    We are determined to stand our ground. We are not alone. 
American and European allies support the Georgian people by 
delivering clear message to autocrats, reassuring pro-democracy 
actors, sanctioning those who undermine democracy, and 
initiating the MEGOBARI Act and the Georgian Peoples Act.
    This support is deeply appreciated by every Georgian who 
chooses freedom over oppression. Georgians understand that 
freedom is never granted but always earned, as it has been 
throughout our history.
    With the support of America and its allies we once built an 
emerging democracy that has been an inspiration in our part of 
the world, and I believe that with your help we will prevail 
once again.
    Thank you, and I am ready to answer any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Gigauri follows:]

                 Prepared Statement of Ms. Eka Gigauri

    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, Distinguished Senators, 
thank you for the opportunity to speak at this hearing. I am thankful 
for the long standing bipartisan support toward Georgia by this 
Committee, the very professional staff and your continued attention 
toward Georgia in times of crises.
    My name is Eka Gigauri, I am the executive director of Transparency 
International Georgia, the largest Civil Society Organization working 
on good governance and corruption in the country. I am here to share a 
local perspective on resisting anti-NGO laws in Georgia, as well as my 
personal experience of being targeted as a human rights defender, and 
to present the views shared by a broader civil society of Georgia.
    The introduction of anti-NGO laws in different parts of the world 
is an alarming and growing trend. Anti-NGO laws, first championed by 
Putin's regime in Russia, enable a smooth, swift, and decisive shift 
toward consolidated autocracy. In countries like Georgia, when such 
laws are introduced, autocrats amplify Russian anti-Western 
disinformation, cultivate social division, and undermine partnerships 
with the U.S. and the EU--all against the will of the majority of 
citizens.
    In many countries affected by this challenge, including Georgia, 
resisting oppressive anti-NGO legislation has become a key battleground 
for defending freedom and democracy. These battlegrounds are local, but 
each struggle is being fought at the International geopolitical level 
as well.
    Prevailing in this struggle requires two key elements:

    <bullet> Unity among proactive citizens who have chosen freedom, 
valuing it enough to defend it; and

    <bullet> Consistently strong support from the international 
democratic community for the vibrant civil societies they helped 
develop and grow. In Georgia, this means the United States speaking and 
acting with legitimate moral authority, assertively and convincingly, 
as it has done for nearly three decades when it helped Georgians 
protect their sovereignty, independence, and democratic aspirations.

    This is not to suggest that America should do the job for citizens 
who choose freedom over authoritarian rule. A free country is never 
granted, even by the greatest allies; it is earned by its citizens, for 
whom America has always been an inspiration.
    The key point is that in places where pro-democracy movements are 
strong and America's well-established partnerships are challenged by 
actors like Russia, as in Georgia, maintaining a high level of support 
in backing democratic aspirations of nations--can tip the balance.
    From our perspective, maintaining this support while drawing clear 
red lines in U.S. foreign policy could be decisive. This is crucial, as 
American foreign policy in action can deter those who attempt to steal 
freedom from millions and encourage those who choose freedom over 
autocracy.
    Authoritarians who challenge American interests and undermine 
democracy respond to red lines and perceive any reduction in U.S. 
support--whether in communication or policy--as a green light to push 
these boundaries. The same perception demotivates pro-democracy 
activists and citizens who often risk their lives defending democracy.
    I believe that hearings like this one by the Foreign Relations 
Committee are essential to ensuring that American foreign policy 
decisionmaking is informed by local perspectives. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share what we have learned in Georgia in resisting 
repressive legislation and Russia-inspired authoritarian drive behind 
it.
    In Georgia, the introduction of the anti-NGO law, commonly referred 
to as the ``Russian Law,'' sparked massive resistance, energizing and 
uniting previously fragmented pro-democracy actors. This led to 
unprecedented civil solidarity, nationwide protests, the consolidation 
of civil society and cooperation among pro-democracy political parties. 
Yet, the authorities continue to push the red line as they proceed to 
enforce the repressive legislation to establish a Russian-style system 
of governance. For every citizen of Georgia, the upcoming elections on 
October 26 are essentially a referendum on a clear choice between a 
democratic, prosperous European future and the misery of being a 
Russian satellite. Fair elections would be the way to materialize the 
obvious choice of Georgian people.
    However, the Georgian case, does have another, a geopolitical 
dimension, which has even a bigger impact on the fate of democracy far 
beyond our borders. If Georgian democracy is defeated and the country 
plunges into the Russian orbit, again, this would mean an evaporation 
of chances for further democratic development of any country Eastwards 
or Southwards from Georgia. Geopolitically, this would mean the 
erection of a new iron curtain in our region, with Russia once again 
marking its backyard, claiming Georgia as part of its sphere of 
influence.
    Incumbent authoritarians follow a common Russian playbook when 
introducing and enforcing anti-CSO legislation. Their goals, methods, 
practices, and tactics toward local pro-democracy actors and their 
supporters, including those in the U.S., are the same.
    Their autocratic objectives are simple: consolidating power 
requires silencing critical voices, closing civic space, and 
neutralizing free media. Anti-NGO legislation is a convenient tool for 
these goals, providing a facade of legality.
    The process proceeds in Three Phases.
        phase 1: preparing the ground for legalizing repression
    In this phase, a massive coordinated smear campaign was launched 
against civil society, USAID, and U.S.-based democracy-promoting 
organizations. Local civil society activists were portrayed as enemies 
of the state. The campaign included intimidation, defamation, threats, 
and violence targeting activists and their families (myself included). 
My family members and I have been subject to verbal attacks and 
intimidation by high level public officials, my portraits were placed 
on the ``public enemies'' posters placed by the ruling party activists 
in every town nationwide, my property and vehicle was vandalized by 
insulting graffiti. My fellow civil society activists have been 
targeted in the same way. International donors, including USAID, faced 
harassment from government officials and false criminal investigations 
have been launched.
    The reason why international donors and CSOs including TI has been 
target is obvious. As an example, since 2011 TI Georgia provided legal 
support to 22,401 citizens; won 880 cases in the court that implied 
monetary compensations and included the cases 89 free media 
journalists; and published annually around 25 reports and 157 policy 
documents that exposed corruption and abuse of power.
           phase 2: passing the law despite public opposition
    Despite mass protests and clear advice from U.S. and European 
allies, the law was passed. Authorities amplified coordinated 
disinformation, portraying civil society and their international 
supporters as a ``Global War Party'' destabilizing Georgia. This 
narrative mirrors Russian disinformation. The government adopted an 
openly anti-American stance and announced a shift away from strategic 
partnership with the West while government-supported intimidation and 
violence--continued.
                    phase 3: enforcement of the law
    Phase 3 which is unfolding as we speak, involves the enforcement of 
the law. The repressive measures embedded in this law include:

    <bullet> Stigmatizing NGO members and activists as Foreign Agents, 
which for Georgians carries a deep historical and emotional weight. 
There are practically no families in Georgia without at least one 
ancestor persecuted in the early Soviet era, accused of being an 
`Agent' or a `Spy' of a foreign power. These labels are not just 
derogatory and insulting--they are a betrayal of our ancestors' memory, 
carrying with them the unmistakable mark of Russian repression.

    <bullet> A series of heavy financial fines followed by the seizure 
of organizational assets of representatives who refuse to register as 
Agents of Foreign Powers or fail to provide any information requested 
at the discretion of the authorities.

    <bullet> A mandatory legal obligation for NGO representatives and 
affiliated persons or entities to provide any information, including 
records, communications, personal data, data on mental health and 
sexual life, information protected by non-disclosure agreements with 
third parties, finances, and more--all subject to disclosure. Refusal 
to comply can result in penalties or the freezing of financial assets.

    The ruling party's major electoral promise is the legal prosecution 
of the ``collective opposition'' to the regime, including pro-
democratic civil society.
    Throughout all three phases, the authorities have waged a massive 
and coordinated disinformation campaign using government-controlled 
media, the public broadcaster, trolls, bots, fake social media 
accounts, and commentators on the party payroll.
    The situation in Georgia is dramatic, but I am not here to seek 
sympathy. In Georgia, we are engaged in a generational and existential 
struggle, defending sovereignty, independence, and the dream of a 
democratic future. We are determined to stand our ground.
    We are not alone. American and European allies support the Georgian 
people by delivering clear messages to autocrats, reassuring pro-
democracy actors, sanctioning those who undermine democracy, and 
initiating the MEGOBARI Act and Georgian People's Act. This support is 
deeply appreciated by every Georgian who chooses freedom over 
oppression.
               what can make your support most effective
    <bullet> We are in a new stage of the global struggle for 
democracy. Each country is unique, but a more uniform U.S. foreign 
policy that draws clear red lines for autocrats would better reassure 
millions who look to America for inspiration.

    <bullet> Expanding direct communication between U.S. policymakers 
and local pro-democracy players--an ``early warning system''--can 
improve situational awareness and policy response.

    <bullet> International donor support is vital. U.S. Government 
backing the donors pressed by authoritarians is critically important.

    <bullet> Civil societies function in emergency mode. Swift support 
is needed to secure top priorities. In Georgia, top priorities include 
election monitoring, countering disinformation.

    <bullet> Progressing with the MEGOBARI Act and the Georgian 
People's Act could have a strong positive impact.

    <bullet> U.S. sanctions should target individuals undermining 
democracy and serving Russian interests, not the people of Georgia, 
whom America supports.

    Georgians understand that freedom is never granted but always 
earned, as it has been throughout our history. With the support of 
America and its allies, we once built an emerging democracy that has 
been an inspiration in our part of the world, and I believe that, with 
your help, we will prevail once again.

    The Chairman. Well, thank you very much for your testimony 
and for your courage.
    Ms. Wang.

  STATEMENT OF YAQIU WANG, RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR CHINA, HONG 
        KONG, AND TAIWAN, FREEDOM HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Wang. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, and 
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on the Chinese government's tactics to 
suppress political dissent.
    China's authoritarian regime poses one of the biggest 
threats to American democracy and security. It is in the 
fundamental interest of the United States to support Chinese 
people's fight for democracy.
    Globally, Freedom House has tracked 18 consecutive years of 
decline in rights and freedoms, driven by worsening repression 
in autocracies and also backsliding in democracies, as my co-
panelists spoken about.
    China ranks among the least free countries in the world and 
has declined significantly since Xi Jinping assumed power in 
2012. Following a multiyear crackdown, China's civil society 
now has been largely decimated.
    Increasingly, authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong are 
deploying national security laws to criminalize independent 
human rights activism and journalism. Numerous human rights 
activists in mainland China and Hong Kong are languishing in 
jail on bogus national security charges as we speak.
    These courageous individuals have made extraordinary 
sacrifices for standing up to the Chinese Communist Party. It 
is imperative that the U.S. Government stand by them.
    The CCP's long arm of repression also stretches abroad, 
including on U.S. soil. China conducts the world's most 
sophisticated and comprehensive campaign of transnational 
repression.
    Beijing's tactics span the full spectrum from harassment 
and assaults, to co-opting other countries to render exiles, to 
mobility controls, to cyber attacks, and coercion by proxy.
    Last November, Chinese diplomats and hundreds of people 
belonging to pro-CCP diaspora groups organized demonstrations 
in San Francisco during President Xi's visit.
    The pro-Beijing groups harassed and intimidated and in some 
cases violently assaulted Chinese, Hong Kong, and Tibetan 
activists who came to protest Xi.
    On American campuses, some Chinese students have reported 
that they were intimidated by fellow students for speaking 
critically of the Chinese government.
    Beijing's digital surveillance has also made organizing 
pro-democracy activities very difficult in the U.S. in the 
first place. Chinese social media and messaging apps such as 
WeChat, which are heavily used among first generation Chinese 
diaspora, are also heavily censored by the Chinese government.
    In recent years the U.S. Government has stepped up its 
response to CCP influence operations. The Department of Justice 
has issued a number of indictments in cases linked to the CCP.
    The growing focus on the threat is a positive development, 
but U.S. officials face the challenge of maintaining a 
targeted, proportionate, and rights respecting approach while 
also intensifying their overall efforts.
    Walking this line will require thoughtful policies and 
careful execution. In this context Freedom House urges Congress 
to continue to call public attention to political prisoners in 
China and Hong Kong and urge their immediate and unconditional 
release, meet regularly with their families, and provide 
funding to support them and their lawyers.
    We also call Members of Congress to work together to pass 
legislations that support and protect activists and hold 
perpetrators of CCP abuses accountable, including establishing 
a limited visa category to provide at risk human rights 
defenders with a multiple entry multiyear nonimmigrant visa and 
providing relevant officials the necessary training to respond 
to transnational repression.
    Last, we call on the U.S. Government to impose targeted 
sanctions of Chinese tech companies complicit in human rights 
abuses. For example, companies that sell surveillance equipment 
in Xinjiang should face economic penalties.
    Congress should also hold hearings to better understand the 
censorship and surveillance mechanisms of Chinese social media 
messaging apps widely used in the United States and pressure 
the companies to uphold users' rights to free expression and 
privacy.
    In late 2022, protests over deadly fire in northwest China 
grew into one of the most open challenges to the CCP since the 
1989 Tiananmen democracy movement. These white paper protests 
brought out hundreds of thousands of people in China as well as 
many in the diaspora, claiming their rights and demanding 
freedom.
    As Washington and Beijing engage more and more overtly in 
geopolitical competition we should not lose sight of the 
passionate longing for freedom that Chinese people still hold. 
We should support their aspirations at every opportunity.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Wang follows:]

                  Prepared Statement of Ms. Yaqiu Wang

    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, and distinguished members of 
the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Chinese 
government's tactics to suppress political dissent. I ask that my full 
written statement be entered for the record. China's authoritarian 
regime poses one of the biggest threats to American democracy and 
security. It is in the fundamental interest of the United States to 
support Chinese people's fight for democracy.
    This testimony draws on Freedom House's years of research and 
advocacy work on political prisoners, transnational repression, and 
internet freedom in relation to China.
    Globally, Freedom House has tracked 18 consecutive years of decline 
in rights and freedoms, driven by worsening repression in autocracies 
and backsliding in democracies, including efforts to undermine 
electoral processes, armed conflicts, threats of authoritarian 
aggression, and attacks on pluralism--the peaceful coexistence of 
people with different political ideas, religions, or ethnic identities.
    A growing trend is when states manipulate their own laws to crack 
down on dissent and criticism, whether it is by recognized 
organizations or individuals. Last year, people in 55 of the 70 
countries surveyed in our Freedom on the Net report faced legal 
repercussions for expressing themselves online.
    Democracies are not immune to these trends, and a growing number 
are imposing burdens on freedoms of assembly, association, and 
expression through legal mechanisms. These restrictions affect the 
rights of citizens in those countries, and have ripple effects around 
the world, as authoritarian regimes cynically use poor behavior by 
democracies to justify their own repressive rule.
    China, which ranks among the least free countries in the world, has 
declined significantly since Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012. \1\ 
President Xi has consolidated personal power to a degree not seen in 
the country for decades. Following a multiyear crackdown on all aspects 
of life and governance, China's civil society now has been largely 
decimated. Increasingly, the government is deploying national security 
laws--including National Security Law (2015), Foreign NGO Law (2017), 
Counterterrorism Law (2018), and Counterespionage Law (2023)--to 
criminalize independent human rights activism and journalism.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Freedom House, ``Freedom in the World 2024: China,'' https://
freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Numerous human rights activists are languishing in jail on bogus 
national security-related charges as we speak, such as prodemocracy 
movement pioneer Wang Bingzhang, who has been serving a life sentence 
for espionage since 2002; human rights lawyer Xu Zhiyong, who is 
serving a 14-year sentence for subversion of state power; and 
journalist Huang Xueqin, who is serving a 5-year sentence for inciting 
subversion of state power. Others have been forcibly disappeared on 
unclear charges. Respected human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng has not 
been heard from in 7 years.
    China's ethnic minorities are facing even worse conditions. Rahile 
Dawut, a Uyghur scholar, has been serving a life sentence since 2018 
for separatism. Another Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti is serving a life 
sentence under the same charge. His family has not heard from him since 
2017. Go Sherab Gyatso, a Tibetan monk and writer, is serving a 10-year 
sentence for inciting separatism.
    Similarly, in Hong Kong, over a thousand people have been 
imprisoned for exercising their right to freedom of assembly and 
expression, many on national security grounds. In 2020, Beijing imposed 
the draconian National Security Law (NSL) on the city, with broad 
provisions that criminalize an enormous range of activity both inside 
and outside Hong Kong. This March, Hong Kong's legislature passed the 
Basic Law Article 23, the city's homegrown national security law. 
Prominent political prisoners in Hong Kong include journalist and 
publisher Jimmy Lai, who is facing up to life imprisonment for sedition 
and collusion with foreign forces; human rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung, 
arrested for inciting subversion; and activist Joshua Wong, convicted 
of conspiracy to commit subversion.
    These courageous individuals and many others in mainland China and 
Hong Kong have made extraordinary sacrifices for standing up to the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is imperative that the US government 
stand by them.
    The CCP's long arm of repression also stretches abroad, including 
on US soil. China conducts the world's most comprehensive and 
sophisticated campaign of transnational repression, and is responsible 
for 25 percent of the cases Freedom House has documented in our data 
base. The sheer breadth and global scale of the campaign is 
unparalleled. \2\ Beijing's tactics span the full spectrum: from 
harassment and assaults, to co-opting other countries to detain and 
render exiles, to mobility controls, to cyberattacks, and to coercion 
by proxy.

Governments Engage in Transnational Repression,'' February 16, 2024, 
https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-data-more-20-percent-worlds-
governments-engage-transnational-repression.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    China's transnational repression activities are embedded in a broad 
framework of influence that encompasses cultural and professional 
associations, regional groups, and in some cases, organized crime 
networks, which places it in contact with a huge population of Chinese 
citizens, Chinese diaspora members, and minority populations from China 
who reside around the world. Last November, Chinese diplomats and 
hundreds of people belonging to pro-CCP diaspora groups organized 
demonstrations in San Francisco during President Xi Jinping's visit 
that harassed and intimidated--and in some cases, violently assaulted--
Chinese, Hong Kong, and Tibetan activists who came to protest Xi.
    The CCP also poses the biggest transnational repression threat on 
American campuses. Some Chinese students studying here reported that 
they were intimidated by fellow students for speaking critically about 
the Chinese government, or that their families back in China were 
harassed by Chinese authorities. \3\ Beijing's digital surveillance has 
also made organizing prodemocracy activities and recruiting like-minded 
students difficult in the first place. Chinese social media and 
messaging apps such as WeChat, which are heavily used among first-
generation Chinese diaspora, are also heavily censored by the Chinese 
government. \4\

    Indeed, one of the biggest challenges facing Chinese activists as 
well as ordinary people who care about human rights and democracy both 
inside and outside China is the CCP's sophisticated censorship and 
surveillance apparatus. Freedom House's Freedom on the Net report has 
consistently ranked China's regime as the world's worst abuser of 
internet freedom. \5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In recent years, the US government has stepped up its response to 
CCP influence operations that undermine human rights and democracy 
within the United States. The Department of Justice has issued a number 
of indictments in cases linked to the CCP, most recently this month 
when Linda Sun, a former top aide to New York Governor Kathy Hochul and 
former Governor Andrew Cuomo, was charged with acting as an agent of 
the Chinese government. A few weeks earlier, in two separate cases, US 
authorities convicted Chinese dissident Wang Shujun and charged 
another, Tang Yuanjun, for spying on the overseas Chinese prodemocracy 
community on behalf of the CCP.
    The growing focus on the threat is certainly needed and a positive 
development, but US officials face the challenge of maintaining a 
targeted, proportionate, and rights-respecting approach while also 
intensifying their overall efforts. Walking this line will require 
thoughtful policies, updated laws, and careful execution.
    Despite intense repression, Chinese people everywhere continue to 
show inspiring resilience. In late 2022, protests over a deadly fire in 
Urumqi grew into one of the most open challenges to the CCP since the 
1989 Tiananmen democracy movement. The protests, dubbed the White Paper 
protests, also drew widespread support from the Chinese diaspora, as 
hundreds staged rallies in cities from Paris to Sydney, from Washington 
DC to Raleigh, North Carolina.
    As Washington and Beijing engage more and more overtly in 
geopolitical competition, we should not lose sight of the passionate 
longing for freedom that people in China are trying to express. We 
should support their aspirations at every opportunity.
    In this context, Freedom House calls on Congress to:

    <bullet> Continue to call public attention to political prisoners 
in China and urge their release. Meet regularly with family members of 
prisoners and advocacy groups, both in public and in private. When 
calling for the release of political prisoners, emphasize that releases 
should be unconditional. All charges should be dropped and expunged 
from the prisoner's record. There should be no bail conditions, travel 
restrictions, asset freezes, or other measures that restrict their 
ability to work and live. In private, executive and legislative 
officials and staff should meet with families to show support, share 
updates on their loved one's case, and gather information relevant to 
advancing their release. Private meetings with advocacy groups and 
others are also important for information gathering and message 
coordination. Public appearances by government officials on behalf of 
the imprisoned individual, when appropriate and condoned by the 
prisoner or family, demonstrate support for the prisoner and signal to 
perpetrating governments that they should expect a sustained campaign 
to free them. Many political prisoners and their families fear they 
will be forgotten. Efforts to secure the release of political prisoners 
should go beyond the most high-profile imprisonments and include 
advocacy on behalf of lesser-known individuals, as giving political 
prisoners a higher profile through advocacy work can improve their 
treatment in prison and prompt governments to expedite cases.

    <bullet> Continue to provide funding to support political 
prisoners, their families, and their lawyers, including adequate 
support after release.

    <bullet> Establish a limited visa category to provide precleared 
at-risk human rights defenders and democracy activists with a multiple-
entry, multiyear nonimmigrant visa. This would allow those facing 
unjust imprisonment or physical threats due to the nature of their work 
to continue their work from the safety of the United States, before 
they are able to safely return home. Vulnerable human rights defenders 
could be nominated by US embassy personnel in close consultation with 
civil society partners and likeminded democratic governments. Freedom 
House is pleased to support the Human Rights Defenders Protection Act, 
led by Chairman Cardin and supported by a number of members on this 
committee, which, among other things, creates a temporary visa for 
human rights defenders under threat.

    <bullet> Pass legislation to address gaps in the US government's 
response to transnational repression. This includes codifying a 
definition of transnational repression, ensuring government officials 
who may encounter perpetrators or victims of transnational repression 
receive the training necessary to recognize and respond to the problem, 
and strengthening sanctions authorities to make it easier to hold 
perpetrators accountable. The Transnational Repression Policy Act, 
which was introduced by Senators Merkley, Rubio, Cardin, and Hagerty, 
includes provisions in all these areas. We urge its passage.

    <bullet> Impose targeted sanctions on or add to the Bureau of 
Industry and Security's Entity List Chinese tech companies responsible 
for or complicit in human rights abuses. For example, companies that 
knowingly provide surveillance systems used for repressive crackdowns 
in places like Xinjiang should face economic penalties. In the United 
States, the Global Magnitsky Act allows for targeted sanctions on 
private companies.

    <bullet> Provide funding to support the development and 
dissemination of open-source, user-friendly, and privacy-protecting 
anticensorship technologies. Anti-censorship technology, such as 
virtual private networks, are critical for people in China to 
circumvent state censorship and protect themselves against surveillance 
and other forms of repression. Relevant programming should prioritize 
supporting tools that are open-source, align with the highest standards 
of privacy and security, and are user-friendly and localized to the 
targeted communities to increase their uptake in use.

    <bullet> Scrutinize international censorship and surveillance by 
Chinese companies. Congress should hold hearings to better understand 
the scope, nature, and impact of politicized censorship and 
surveillance on Tencent's WeChat platform and other Chinese social 
media and messaging apps, then explore avenues for pressuring the 
companies to uphold users' rights to free expression and privacy. 
Politicians who choose to use Chinese platforms to communicate with 
constituents should monitor messaging closely to detect any 
manipulation, register their accounts with international phone numbers 
when possible, and republish messages on parallel international social 
media platforms.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

    The Chairman. Let me thank you for your testimony as well.
    We will now have rounds of 5 minute questions from the 
members of the committee.
    I want to first start by inviting you all to always share 
information with us in regards to individuals or sectors that 
you believe we can be more aggressive in using our sanction 
regime. We take that information very seriously.
    In regards to individual sanctions, as I am sure you all 
are aware, there is a standard that needs to be met, 
particularly in regards to dealing with the banking 
restrictions that are included in that because it does deal 
with individual rights, and we have protection in our system.
    But we will always take the information you supply us, and 
we are aggressive, and we do thank both this Administration and 
previous Administrations for using the sanction regimes that we 
have created here in Congress.
    We are the initiators of it, to use that to deal with the 
issues we are talking about today. But we can be better at 
that, and we welcome your input.
    One of the hats I wear is I have been a member of the 
Helsinki Commission since I have been in the U.S. Senate and 
before in the House of Representatives. I have chaired the 
Helsinki Commission.
    One of the guiding principles of the OSCE is to protect the 
rights of NGOs. I mean, that is one of the basic foundations of 
the Helsinki principles.
    So when we see NGOs denied the opportunity to operate 
because of these repressive laws, that is contrary to the 
commitments that were made with the OSCE participating states, 
and China is not a member of that but certainly that applies to 
Georgia.
    I also want to just start with a question. Let me start 
with Mr. Rutzen, if I might.
    We have seen the use of traditional repressive tools such 
as physical assaults, disappearances, and even murders of the 
people who disagree with their governments.
    But now we see these countries using so called legal means, 
passing laws, and as Ms. Wang pointed out using social media, 
the freedom of expression, the freedom of access, to use that 
against and try to bring down our democratic systems of 
government.
    So tell me the calculations that are being made by what 
type of countries that are now trying to mask their repressive 
policies through the use of these methods rather than the 
direct--we see, for example, in Venezuela Mr. Maduro is very 
clear about physical assaults and disappearances.
    What goes into that calculation, and how effective is it, 
and what can we do about it?
    Mr. Rutzen. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, for your thoughtful 
question.
    What we are seeing, in some sense, is the rise of 
authoritarian legalism where governments realize that the law 
cannot only protect rights, but it can just as easily undermine 
rights. And we see this throughout history.
    I think about the apartheid era laws or the Nuremberg laws, 
how the laws can be used to undercut human rights. And so this 
has always been a tool in the authoritarian toolbox, but now it 
is being amplified and replicated around the world.
    You heard about the example of the Russian version of the 
Foreign Agents Law then spreading to Georgia, and now a number 
of other countries as well.
    For many governments in their calculations they think that 
they have some patina of political legitimacy if they can wrap 
their restrictions under the cover of law. And that is why we 
are seeing this rapid ascent of anti-NGO laws and other 
restrictions on democracy defenders around the world.
    The Chairman. What impact is Russia having on these 
decisionmakings, for example, in Georgia? Is Russia--we know 
that they get engaged in the internal affairs of other 
countries. Are they actively encouraging these types of 
activities?
    Ms. Gigauri. Yes. I would say that they apprised our 
government when the government has initiated this law and also 
when looking at their stories what they were sharing in their 
internal audience.
    So you could see that they were very glad that it is 
happening in Georgia. So just recently Meta has deleted around 
60 fake accounts which were ruled and managed from the 
territory of Russia but was attacking--they were attacking 
those who were participating in the demonstrations against this 
law and undermining their reputation.
    And at the same time they were promoting the decisions of 
the Georgian government. So I think that definitely these two--
I think that this is really linked with the interest of Russia, 
and the interest of Russia is not to have democracy in Georgia. 
This is for sure.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Risch.
    Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    First of all, Ms. Gigauri, I have got a number of questions 
for you since we have been watching this since 2012 from afar 
and shaking our heads on it because we are seeing this 
backslide, and we do not really understand it.
    I mean, you are a country of a little under 4 million 
people, and it seems like there is at least a significant 
movement toward embracing the Russian former government and the 
Russian repression.
    We just do not understand it. I mean, you got your freedom 
from Russia and why the country would be drifting back that 
way--we look at Georgia, and we compare it to the three 
Baltics, and those are small countries, too. Two of them at 1.5 
million and one at 2.5 million, and I will tell you what, those 
people, they come to see us all the time.
    They are united. They are firm. They are afraid. They want 
our help. They do not want anything to do with Russia in any 
way, shape, or form. And yet, here you have Georgia who were 
visited by an invasion from Russia which took two of its 
territories and promised to leave and still are not. They are 
occupying the territories.
    Why in the world is there--I mean, you are always going to 
get a handful of nuts, but why would you have these significant 
numbers of people who seem to want to drift back to the 
communist and socialist way of life that Russia had?
    Help us understand this.
    Ms. Gigauri. Thank you for the question.
    So I think that in spite of this disinformation that we 
observed for years now, the majority of Georgian citizens 
support Georgia's integration in the EU and NATO and these are 
the official numbers.
    So what happens is that--we talked here about the 
particular laws, right, but before the laws are introduced 
there is this very heavy disinformation campaign, and there you 
see the messages that were invented by the Russians in 2012, 
for instance, that these liberal groups are against the, you 
know, the family values or the national interest of the 
country, that all these people who are working for the NGO 
community they hate everything national, right.
    So, I mean, that is the--the NGOs are only promoting the 
LGBT rights, and they care about the LGBT rights and all these 
kind of things. So this is very heavy. They are playing with 
the hearts and minds of Georgian people.
    At the same time you always see in the pro-government and 
anti-West media in Georgia that in the West there are problems. 
There is destabilization. People live a terrible life there.
    Like, in Russia, there are also some trends which are 
against the family values, and they do not care about their 
families, their children.
    I mean, this is everything happening all the time for 
years, and then people are raising--so it is not that the 
government tells them that the West is bad, but with 
disinformation they try to persuade them to raise the question 
so whether they want to go there or not.
    But again, this is not a big number of people. I would say 
that the majority still supports the----
    Senator Risch. I hope you are right. In today's world with 
the information available to us there is always disinformation 
out there, and we in America believe that if you put everything 
on the table, and all the facts are there, smart people, or 
even semi-smart people, will pretty quickly realize that 
democracy is a whole lot better than authoritarianism.
    So what you are talking about we see here that kind of 
disinformation, but its effect is pretty de minimis.
    Well, you give me hope when you tell me that the vast 
majority want to do the right thing. I will tell you that we 
will be watching the elections next month, and Senator Shaheen 
and I were greatly impressed with the elections that we saw.
    We were not the only observers. Obviously, there were ones 
from all over the world, a lot of them from Europe that were 
watching those elections.
    And I have to tell you, those elections were about as 
straight up as I have ever seen, and I have been in lots of 
elections. I have run 36 times myself so I know what they are 
like, and I was impressed. I really was impressed with the way 
they were held.
    If what you say is true about the Georgian people and what 
they want, they are going to get an opportunity in October to 
throw the rascals out and take a hold of their own future, and 
we will be watching closely, praying for you. Hope it works.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen [presiding]. Thank you, Chairman Cardin and 
Ranking Member Risch, for your strong comments, and thank you 
to each of you for being here and for the work that you do 
every day.
    Ms. Gigauri, it is nice to see you again. We had the 
opportunity to be part of a conversation early in August when 
Congressman Turner and I visited Georgia to try and address 
what was happening there and to make clear that we support the 
aspirations of the Georgian people and to make that point to 
the government as well.
    I applaud you and all of the civil society community for 
your bravery in holding the Georgian government to account, and 
for your willingness to participate in trying to ensure that 
there is a free and fair election on October 26.
    In the meeting that we had with the prime minister we 
raised the recent setback in U.S.-Georgia relations that are 
reflected by the passage of the Foreign Agents Law, and we 
urged him to think about ways in which we could address 
Georgia's relationship with the United States, moving forward, 
that would support the aspirations of the Georgian people and 
ensure a free and fair election.
    And I am really sad to say that the only request that he 
had of us was that the United States stop funding NGOs which 
are critical of the Georgian government, and as Congressman 
Turner explained in a democracy we all recognize that you can 
be critical if you disagree with the policies.
    Now, I understand that the prime minister has questioned 
our account of that meeting, but I was not the only person in 
the room.
    We all heard what he had to say, and I am further 
disappointed that the Georgian Dream Party has taken the 
position that they will not acknowledge parties, opposition 
parties that disagree with them, going forward.
    So, as Senator Risch said, the United States has been a 
partner of Georgia for 30 years now, supporting its democracy, 
its self-determination, its security, and it is a relationship 
that has been based on shared values, and the fact that the 
Georgian Dream government is willing to throw that away to 
continue to curry favor with Russia is really hard to 
understand, especially given that 20 percent of the Georgian 
territory is still occupied by the country of Russia.
    But I wonder if you could give us a little update on what 
is happening with the Foreign Agents Law. My understanding is 
that very few civil society groups have registered because it 
is a very onerous, very difficult process.
    And have you also seen the government go after those 
organizations, and are you anticipating that that will happen 
for those groups that do not register?
    Ms. Gigauri. Thank you for the question.
    So in Georgia, as you have mentioned, many civil society 
organizations have not complied with the law.
    So we do not use this as it happened in many other 
countries like the badge of honor. We think that this should 
not be used like this. We think that we are not the agents or 
spy undermining the interests of Georgia.
    We are the patriots of our country, and whatever we do this 
is for the better future of our country and the people of our 
country.
    So that is why majority--I would say 95 percent, have not 
registered, and the government has several weeks now to start 
the monitoring, and then we expect the heavy fines like it is 
in the law.
    However, we are ready to resist. So many organizations who 
have not registered, they are also involved in monitoring of 
the elections. We have different backup plans. We are 
mobilizing. We are uniting our resources by saying this is the 
civic activist groups at the NGOs.
    So just recently we have created huge coalition of NGOs 
which will be monitoring the elections in Georgia, and we will 
make sure that the votes of Georgian voters will be safe, and 
we will defend their votes during the elections. This is for 
sure.
    Senator Shaheen. And do you think the majority of the 
Georgian people believe that that will happen? That it will be 
a free and fair election and that they will participate?
    Ms. Gigauri. I think, of course, there are many questions 
about the fairness of the upcoming elections because now even 
we already observed the abuse of administrative resources, 
attacks on the opposition.
    And yes, definitely this law creates the obstacles for the 
observer organizations to monitor the elections, right.
    But at the same time I think that for majority of Georgians 
these are very crucial elections, and this is, as I said, the 
referendum between the membership of the EU and to become the 
country which is under the influence of Russia.
    So I think that many people will participate in the 
elections. They know that there might be some obstacles, but 
what we do at this moment is that we try to inform them how to 
vote, how to avoid the violations, how to react on the 
violations.
    And the most important thing here is how to believe in the 
victory. They should participate in the elections because every 
vote matters, and I think that this is the common understanding 
amongst the Georgians now.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. That is an important 
message for us in the United States and for everywhere that 
there are elections between now and the end of the year.
    Senator Coons.
    Senator Coons. Thank you so much, Senator Shaheen, Ranking 
Member Risch. Thank you for your work together and with 
Chairman Cardin to promote democracy and free elections, to 
protect NGOs and civil society and those who are advocates for 
free speech, for freedom, for organizing, and for the rights of 
individuals around the world.
    As the founder and co-chair of the Human Rights Caucus in 
the Senate I have been engaged in these issues a long time and 
gravely concerned to continue to hear about the steady loss of 
freedom around the world.
    Freedom House has been year after year documenting broader, 
deeper attacks on civil society, increased restrictions on your 
ability to receive funding and to operate, that I think all 
Senators of both parties should be more engaged in and 
concerned about, and I am grateful that this is a bipartisan 
hearing today.
    And as the chair of the committee that funds State 
Department and USAID, Mr. Rutzen, I take directly your 
suggestions that we need to provide more support for personnel, 
for operations, for outreach to support the Human Rights 
Defenders Fund, to provide cybersecurity support for targeted 
individuals, to condition assistance in countries like Georgia 
where there is legitimate concern about their drift toward 
authoritarianism.
    Ms. Gigauri, thank you for your testimony today and for 
your courage. I am grateful that Senators Shaheen and Risch are 
leading on the Georgia legislation that I hope we will move 
forward soon, and I would be interested in your view of what 
Russia's aggression in Ukraine does to send a broader signal.
    You said one of your core challenges is to convince people 
that free and fair elections are still possible, that free 
speech is still valuable.
    My concern is that when we fail to defend democracy and 
elections in our own country or in other countries when there 
are acts of open aggression in the region, in Georgia, in 
Moldova, in Ukraine, that it sends a chilling signal that 
strongmen and authoritarian regimes are on the march.
    What more can we do together to make sure that there is a 
broader global push to fight corruption and to promote 
democracy?
    Ms. Gigauri. Thank you for the question.
    So the short answer is for our part of the world is to make 
Russia small and weak, and I really mean it. It is very 
difficult for a country to build a democracy if you are 
neighboring Russia, and it was extremely hard for us to do 
this, but still years ago we showed the good example to 
everyone that it is possible.
    Even being neighbor of Russia it is possible to build a 
state and to fight corruption and to implement democratic 
reforms in the country.
    I think that the war in Ukraine, of course, affected us. 
And I think that the whole international community should do 
everything to help Ukraine to win this war, and I am sure they 
will do this, and this will have the impact on Georgia as well.
    In our case this was trigger for our government to take all 
masks off. We would never expect the Georgian citizens that 
they would not support Ukraine, that they would be involved in 
the anti-Ukraine propaganda, and they will be attacking them.
    So this is something that was not acceptable for us and at 
that time had the--also the demonstrations in support of 
Ukraine and all this. I think that this is very important.
    The second one is, of course, sanctions. But please 
introduce the sanction regime which is targeting individuals, 
not the people of Georgia, because people of Georgia they 
fought for democracy, and they proved that they are very 
effective in that.
    And the third one, I understand that many countries are 
unique, but it is very important to have early warning system. 
It is very important to cooperate and to listen to these two 
different pro-democratic groups on the ground to know where the 
situation is going, because sometimes reactions on time might 
bring bigger results. So and, yes, so this is the--yes.
    Senator Coons. Thank you.
    If I might, Ms. Wang, you mentioned a special visa for 
human rights defenders and those who are civil society leaders 
who are under pressure.
    Mr. Rutzen, you mentioned the early warning system. Could 
the two of you briefly focus on what exactly you think we could 
do to strengthen and expand visa options for those who are 
under pressure who are human rights activists or civil society 
activists, and what more we could or should do around an early 
warning system and how it could improve its function?
    Ms. Wang. Thank you for the question.
    Freedom House has supported the passage of the Human Rights 
Defenders Protection Act. We think the provisions in the act 
are great, and we urge its passage.
    For example, the multiyear and the multi-entry visa for 
human rights defenders who are at risk inside the country is 
very important, because oftentimes police who came to your 
house to raid you or take you to the detention center come 
very, very abruptly, and for Chinese citizens you cannot just 
come to the U.S.--you know, board on a plane. You cannot do 
that.
    So our suggestion is for the U.S. embassy in China to 
identify those human rights defenders first, and so they have 
the visa first. So when they have to leave they can leave 
immediately.
    Also, when they are in the U.S. they can continue to work 
here before they can return safely to China. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Rutzen.
    Mr. Rutzen. Thank you, Senator Coons.
    Briefly, if we engage once the laws are already on the 
docket it is very hard to do anything about them, and so what 
we need to do is identify a list of countries where we think 
there might be legal threats against defenders and put in place 
some preemptive and proactive support to courageous individuals 
in country.
    This is sort of the AID approach, a developmental approach, 
where you invest early so you build resilience in the society, 
and you prevent and preempt these initiatives from arising.
    There will also be a category of countries where something 
is just going to spark, and there is going to be a need for 
rapid response. So we need to complement the early warning 
system with a broader, global rapid response system to address 
threats as they arise.
    Senator Coons. Thank you.
    Thank you all for your testimony.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.
    Senator Helmy.
    Senator Helmy. Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
    And I just want to applaud the bipartisan leadership that 
was mentioned at the beginning of this issue. As an Egyptian 
American, as an American, as a Coptic American, these issues 
are incredibly important to me.
    They have had an impact on my family, and I just appreciate 
the leadership and the bipartisanship on this and would mention 
Chairman Cardin's long lasting legacy on this issue.
    Mr. Rutzen, you briefly mentioned Egypt in your testimony 
and their anti-NGO policies which discourage a free and open 
society.
    In your view how can this Congress and future Congresses 
hold the current and future Administration responsible to hold 
Egypt accountable for its poor track record of human and 
religious rights and freedom of liberties, particularly in 
relation to Copts and other religious minorities while 
supporting its capacity to nurture a public forum for religious 
freedom and civil participation?
    Mr. Rutzen. Thank you for your question, Senator Helmy.
    I think what is important is we have engagement with local 
Egyptian civil society and religious leaders to see what are 
some of the needs they have in terms of support and defense of 
their rights to advocate.
    The change will have to come from within, as we know, so 
our role is to help defend those defenders and help protect 
civic space. In a public forum I probably would not get into 
too many details, but if helpful I would be happy to meet with 
your staff in private to discuss some specific ideas.
    Senator Helmy. Yes, I would welcome that with the team and 
me personally. It is a very important issue, and as I think 
this Congress takes up aid for Egypt down the road it is an 
important issue that should be deliberated.
    And staying in that vein, if I may, Mr. Rutzen, what 
strategy or framework would it be useful for us to examine and 
address this challenge within the scope of U.S. strategy toward 
Egypt and our regional partners?
    Mr. Rutzen. Thank you.
    Let me introduce one argument that often is not on the 
table.
    I am a human rights lawyer. I love human rights, but 
sometimes we have got to focus on other arguments as well. And 
one of the tools I think that is underutilized is trade 
agreements, including bilateral investment treaties.
    It is really interesting. If we look around the world 
countries warmly welcome foreign investment, and in fact, we 
hold companies that receive foreign direct investment as being 
these glorious multinational companies.
    We do not call some of our biggest companies foreign agents 
just because they receive investments from people in other 
countries. But yet, when it is civil society governments 
restrict the free flow of capital across borders.
    So one of the ideas, I think, that we might advance is 
looking more closely at existing trade agreements to see the 
extent it might help cover the free flow of resources and 
capital across borders not only for the for profit sector but 
also the nonprofit sector.
    Senator Helmy. Thank you, Mr. Rutzen.
    Ms. Wang, if I may. Understanding the PRC's growing and 
pervasive state sponsored surveillance regime, I welcome the 
opportunity to learn more about your view on the importance of 
considering a reformed sanctions regime on the PRC and its 
state owned enterprises and how we hold them accountable for 
their unfettered access to civil society and dissidents at home 
and abroad.
    In your view, do you believe the current U.S. policy 
overlooks key elements of the long term strategy to hold the 
PRC accountable in the midst of its growing influence in the 
tech space and its growing global reach?
    Thank you.
    Ms. Wang. I think the U.S. Government is doing better, and 
there needs to be more actions and more forceful enforcement of 
existing laws in terms of surveillance.
    I mean, there are Chinese companies who are complicit in 
China's human rights violations in Xinjiang being sanctioned by 
the U.S. Government, and some are on the Entity List.
    And then there are U.S. companies who the U.S. Government 
has banned them from selling, you know, equipment that can be 
used in human rights violations in China.
    So both sides are necessary, but we--you know, as we all 
heard from the news, companies are very smart in evading 
sanctions. So we need to do more research and have more 
personnel in the U.S. Government to crack down on companies who 
are evading sanctions and punish them for doing that.
    The other day I met a Uyghur activist, and she just 
presented me with a bag of dates, and there were two big 
Chinese characters there that say Xinjiang. Those products 
should be banned by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.
    But they are everywhere in the U.S. If you go to a Chinese 
supermarket--I mean, I read Chinese, and I can see, you know, 
the word Xinjiang there. So why they are still there? So that 
means the law is not really being enforced.
    Senator Helmy. Thank you.
    I close again with a deep appreciation to this committee 
for its bipartisan work in this space, and once again recognize 
the chairman's long lasting legacy on this issue. Thank you.
    The Chairman [presiding]. Thank you.
    Senator Kaine.
    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you to our witnesses for your work and your 
testimony.
    Sometimes we think this challenge is really limited to the 
authoritarian nations of the world, but sadly, we see in 
democracies with whom we ally, a significant effort to crack 
down on NGOs or at least make it harder for NGOs to do their 
work, and I want to just use the example of India.
    India has a law called the Foreign Contribution Regulation 
Act that was amended in 2010, has been amended again in 2020, 
that makes it very difficult for NGOs operating in India to 
receive donations from people around the world.
    Organizations like Amnesty International and others have 
had to dramatically limit or shutter operations in India 
because they do rely on fundraising.
    But India has chosen through this act to significantly 
restrict the ability of organizations to operate and receive 
foreign funding. The law allows the freezing of bank accounts, 
investigations, et cetera.
    And it is one thing, and it is an important thing, when 
human rights activists and NGOs feel intimidated and cannot do 
their work. But the bottom line is the real victims are those 
who are the beneficiaries of the work.
    There is an organization called the Sambhali Trust, which 
is based in Rajasthan, whose goal is to empower women in this 
part of the country, and particularly disempowered or oppressed 
women.
    Very much a service provision organization, very much 
focused on a mission that would seem not only anodyne but 
completely desirable, and yet a constituent reached out to us 
because the Sambhali U.S. was having a difficult time 
soliciting donations and then being able to transfer those 
donations to their purpose, which was empowering women in the 
Rajasthan part of India.
    These statutes--and they are similar around the world but I 
just want to focus on this financing--are a form of harassment 
to choke off the work that is being done, and if you choke off 
the work that is being done sometimes you are not only hurting 
the human rights promoters and those who work with the NGO, but 
you are really hurting those who could benefit from the work.
    And this is really important. The U.S. is involved in some 
parts of the world where, frankly, the governments are not that 
necessarily a reliable partner in providing services or 
development, but NGOs are.
    I was a missionary in Honduras. We want to do things in the 
Northern Triangle, but we have had the experience of we want to 
invest, but the government is really not the partner to invest 
with.
    But the NGO community often has very strong NGOs that are 
exactly the partners you can invest with. But if they are 
choked off from receiving funds then you essentially disempower 
the important causes that they represent.
    So I am really interested in this, and I do want to raise, 
you know, India is a great ally of ours. We often say we are 
the oldest democracy in the world, and they are the largest 
democracy in the world, and others may contest us in those 
titles, but we view the U.S.-India relationship as a very 
important one.
    But when organizations on the ground who are doing good 
work find their financing sources restricted or cut off, we 
have to pay attention to that.
    And so I just wanted to put this one on the table and 
reference the Sambhali U.S. and their challenges. I believe 
eventually we worked with them, State Department and others, 
and were able to work through the maze to enable them to, 
again, begin to forward donations to the important work that 
they do.
    But I think there is other NGOs including some known very 
well by members of this committee that still have not been able 
to find a way forward to offer the services they provide.
    So this is a global problem, not just with authoritarians.
    You used the phrase, Mr. Rutzen, sort of authoritarian 
legalism. It is an act of parliament.
    The other thing about these financial restriction laws is 
they pose a grave risk of bribery and abuse because if you are 
a government official and you say to this NGO, well, there is a 
whole lot of money in a bank account abroad that you could get 
if I give you approval, but I have the ability to turn you down 
and not allow those foreign funds to come to you, these laws 
often are an invitation to bribery and corruption.
    So I think this is something we need to be paying more 
attention to, and it is one of the reasons I was really glad 
this hearing was noticed today, and I encourage you in the work 
that you are doing.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kaine. I appreciate those 
comments.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all 
of you for your testimony here today and for your ongoing work.
    Ms. Gigauri, thank you for your ongoing efforts. I have 
been following the testimony on C-SPAN and want to salute you 
for your determination to keep civic space open in Georgia, and 
I applaud the efforts of my colleagues Senator Shaheen, Senator 
Risch, and others with respect to legislation. I just wanted to 
associate myself with those remarks.
    Ms. Wang, I wanted to ask you a couple questions about Hong 
Kong, because one area where you have anti-NGO laws and many 
other forms of repression against civil society has been Hong 
Kong. It has gone into overdrive.
    A number of years ago I teamed up with former Senator Pat 
Toomey, and we passed bipartisan legislation entitled the Hong 
Kong Autonomy Act, which provides the executive branch the 
authority to sanction individuals and officials, whether in 
Hong Kong or in China, who are who are cracking down on that 
repression.
    And it is a tool that has been used but, clearly we need to 
either expand the use of that tool or look for other methods 
because we know that in March of this year the Hong Kong 
legislature passed a new ordinance known as Article 23 that 
greatly expands the definition of national security offenses as 
any offense that, quote, ``endangers national security under 
the law.''
    So these very sweeping powers that then are abused by the 
governments, and they have cut Hong Kong's democratic 
institutions and eroded civil society.
    So my question is in addition to the sort of targeted 
sanctions against individuals and officials, are there other 
tools that you think we should be using, or also do you just 
think we should be making greater use of those existing 
authorities with respect to sanctions, or both?
    Ms. Wang. I think you can expand the list of the people who 
should be subjected to sanctions, and sanctions do work, 
especially for officials in Hong Kong. They usually have 
foreign bank accounts. So it does make a difference.
    And also it sends a message to people who are fighting for 
freedom. You know, the U.S. Government is taking actions. It 
inspires them to keep going.
    Also, I think, you know, there are new laws that should be 
enacted that--as I mentioned, Freedom House supports the 
passage of the Human Rights Defenders Protection Act, which 
will provide additional support and protection of activists.
    Then we are also endorsing the Transnational Repression 
Policy Act which will provide support to activists who are 
being subjected to transnational repression in the U.S.
    Just recently, a group of Hong Kong activists--Chinese and 
Tibetan activists--were violently assaulted in San Francisco 
because they were protesting President Xi's visit.
    There were hundreds of pro-CCP groups that were there, you 
know, harassing them. I know that to the U.S. Government is 
investing this case and I knew there are many more similar 
cases.
    So we do urge the U.S. Government to strengthen the 
investment in cracking down on transnational repression in the 
U.S. We also urge the U.S. Government to engage more with the 
Chinese diaspora community because as, you know, as a Chinese 
person living in the U.S.
    I do worry about the spill effect of that kind of rooting 
out Chinese spies, rooting out CCP interference, the effect on 
the Chinese diaspora overall.
    So the U.S. Government needs to do it in a very careful way 
so not to have an adverse effect on a diaspora. So how to do 
that?
    I think it is very important to engage with the community--
you know, actually have a dialogue to build trust with them 
rather than just go there and ask do you know there are Chinese 
spies in the community?
    You know, go there and ask what are your worries, what are 
your concerns, how can we help you?
    So there are a lot of details that need to be ironed out so 
the U.S. Government can crackdown on CCP interference in the 
right way.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that, and I agree with all 
your suggestions. My time is almost out so I am going to ask if 
you could submit an answer for the record on the issue of 
China's export of surveillance technologies.
    We have seen this through Huawei. We have seen this through 
ZTE. We even see it deployed here in the United States. China 
is, obviously, using that surveillance technology for 
repressive reasons--for repressive purposes in China.
    But I would like in your--maybe your written response, to 
comment a little bit more on what we can do to counter the use 
of those surveillance technologies in many other countries, 
authoritarian countries and democratic countries.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Let me thank all three of our witnesses, not just for your 
testimonies but for what you do--front line on these issues.
    This is a challenge, a challenge on how we are going to be 
able to protect our democratic institutions, but to make it 
clear that they cannot be utilized to undermine the rule of law 
in our democracies, and we have foreign actors that are 
interfering in our own country, and then we have backsliding 
regimes that are using the so called legal procedures to move 
their country away from democracy and the protection of human 
rights.
    So we have to be more strategic on how we go about this, 
and I appreciate, Ms. Wang, your support of the legislation 
that we have authored. I think Congress can do more in this 
area.
    I think we can do more in enforcement on our sanctions. I 
think there are areas that we--and I think we can do more in 
our priorities in our foreign policies and the relationships--
bilateral, multilateral relations we have with other countries.
    To make it clear, we will not tolerate the type of action 
we have seen in Georgia. We have made that pretty clear. I 
think they understand that, and we are going to make it even 
clearer when we pass legislation that Senator Risch has 
authored with Senator Shaheen.
    So we are going to take steps. We are going to be actively 
engaged, and that is one of the reasons we look forward to this 
hearing.
    The record of the committee will remain open through the 
close of business on Friday. If there is questions submitted by 
members, we would ask that you would try to reply to those 
questions as quickly as possible.
    And Senator Risch, anything further?
    Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. With that, the committee will stand 
adjourned. Thank you very much.
    [Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                              ----------                              


              Additional Material Submitted for the Record


               Ms. Wang's Response to Senator Van Hollen 
         Regarding China's Export of Surveillance Technologies

    The United States has a range of tools through which it can better 
address the problem of the global spread of surveillance technologies, 
including those exported by PRC entities. This includes sanctions on 
entities and individuals, as well as steps to strengthen the regime of 
export controls and multilateral coordination, as described in more 
detail below. In addition to these steps, the US should continue to 
support local civil society organizations and independent media that 
investigate and report on human rights issues, including how Chinese 
companies facilitate them. Finally, the US should continue to invest in 
building up capacity to ensure there are alternatives to Chinese-made 
technologies for states seeking to upgrade or expand in areas like 
telecommunications infrastructure.
    Regarding export controls, the US government should continue to 
restrict the export of technologies of concern, including by Chinese 
companies, and solicit input from civil society when considering how to 
strengthen export controls to protect human rights. It should also 
ensure that exported US components are not being used for prohibited 
applications or by prohibited end users. The US Commerce Department's 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has taken several important steps 
to these ends, including proposing a new control for facial recognition 
technology (FRT) used for mass surveillance and crowd scanning. Freedom 
House is supportive of this proposed rule because this particular use 
of the technology negatively impacts the rights to privacy, free 
expression, association, assembly, and non-discrimination. FRT produced 
by Chinese entities is increasingly used around the world and this 
regulation can help curb its spread.
    In addition, Freedom House has urged BIS to also create a control 
for ``remote biometric identification'' technologies, such as iris 
scanning, that are also used by government actors in the facilitation 
of human rights violations. BIS should also improve its ``Annual 
Country Licensing and Trade Analysis'' reports by making certain data 
available every 6 months. This report should further provide a more 
nuanced presentation of information regarding the export of key 
technologies, like facial recognition. If BIS reporting is strengthened 
in these ways, it will be easier for civil society, media, academia, 
and other actors to track where and to whom US items are exported, 
which can inform research and advocacy efforts.
    Finally, Congress should work with the executive branch to ensure 
the US government continues to lead the international community in its 
efforts to combat the abuse of digital technology. As it relates to 
commercial spyware specifically, the US government should encourage 
signatories to the Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the 
Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware and the Export Controls 
and Human Rights Initiative to follow through on their commitments. 
Congress should urge like-minded democracies in Europe and elsewhere to 
follow suit, including through the Pall Mall Process led by the United 
Kingdom and France, among other forums. Bold action from these 
democracies would be an important step in combating surveillance 
technologies used in the facilitation of human rights violations and/or 
abuses by the Chinese and other authoritarian governments.
