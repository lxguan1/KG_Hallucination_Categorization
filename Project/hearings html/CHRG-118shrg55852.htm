                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 p.m., in 
room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. John 
Hickenlooper, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding.

    Present: Senators Hickenlooper [presiding], Kaine, and 
Braun.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HICKENLOOPER

    Senator Hickenlooper. The Subcommittee on Employment and 
Workplace Safety will come to order.

    Today, we are here for a hearing on youth apprenticeships, 
building partnerships, strengthening career pathways. 
Apprenticeships were one time a staple of America's workforce 
training. In many communities, they have become more of a well-
kept secret. This is doubly true of youth apprenticeships.

    What is not a secret is that employers are looking for 
quality candidates to fill their talent pipelines and that 
relying on college talent alone is not going to do the job. Not 
every students will or wants to attend a 4-year or a 2-year 
college.

    The reality is that 52 percent of the people who recently 
graduated didn't complete--even if they attended, they didn't 
complete college. How can we make sure that our workplace 
solutions are meeting these students where they are, ensuring 
that they have skills that they need to succeed?

    Apprenticeships, especially for those starting in high 
school, are a strong pathway for students to create a career. 
And they are a great way to help businesses form more 
sustainable workforce pipelines, which benefits employers and 
workers a lot. It can cost an employer close to $5,000 to fill 
a job each time they have an opening if the recruits aren't 
trained.

    Youth apprenticeships are a readily available pipeline of 
young, diverse talent, providing a positive return on 
investment for all manner of employers. In 2021, only 2.7 
percent of youth apprentices were under the age of 18. All the 
rest were older.

    This is a missed opportunity. It means that students are 
forced to wait until after high school to start building the 
skills they will need to compete in what is already a 
challenging job market. But why should they wait?

    We can bring high school students those opportunities right 
now. We have done this in Colorado, where we brought industry 
partners and education providers together to launch CareerWise.

    Since that program start, CareerWise has seen more than 
1,400 apprentices hired by more than 120 partnering employers 
in Colorado, India--Colorado, Indiana, Washington D.C., New 
York City, and others.

    These programs serve as an important recruitment tool for 
employers, while also placing youth in quality, work based 
training opportunities that lead to career success and economic 
mobility.

    The average hourly wage for youth apprenticeship graduates 
is nearly twice the national average hourly wage rate for 
youth--of the ages 16 to 24. These are good programs, ones we 
should be investing in.

    I am proud to lead the Youth Apprenticeship Advancement 
Act, with Senator Braun here, that is going to do just that. 
The bill will provide competitive grant funding for youth 
apprenticeship programs across the country.

    Even better, it is fully paid for. We believe that lifting 
up effective youth apprenticeship programs will also help to 
uplift the apprenticeship system as a whole for a whole new 
generation of workers. It is a rising tide that does indeed 
raise all boats.

    In truth, the fact--the truth of the matter is we will need 
everyone to get this across the finish line, from employers, to 
schools, to intermediaries, to unions, to states, everyone. I 
think what we are going to do is make youth apprenticeships 
cool. They already are cool, but we are going to amplify that 
and shout it from the rooftops if we have to.

    We hope that we can get moving on workforce development 
legislation this Congress. I think it is too important to wait. 
This hearing is an opportunity to hear from those in the field 
working on youth apprenticeships about how we can best support 
those efforts.

    Today, we are going to hear from a dynamic witness panel 
that includes several of those youth apprenticeship partners. 
And with that, I am excited to introduce and welcome each of 
the witnesses we are joining--that are joining us today.

    Steve Day is the Principal at the Cherry Creek Innovation 
Campus based in Centennial, Colorado. Steve brings with him 
more than 30 years of educational experience, having worked 
more than 13 years in the classroom and 17 years as a school 
administrator. And having toured that facility, I can say--I 
can attest to its excellence.

    Wesley Patch is a Process Excellence Specialist for Vestas 
Americas in Windsor, Colorado. As a 16 year employee with the 
party--with the company, Mr. Patch has held many roles and he 
has also spearheaded designing and implementing the company's 
youth apprenticeship program, which we appreciate having that 
European influence.

    Denise Tugade previously served as a member of California's 
Youth Apprenticeship Council in her former capacity as 
Government relations advocate for SEUI, the United Healthcare 
Workers. In that role, Denise advised the Committee on best 
practices to advance youth apprenticeship in the health care 
sector.

    Now, I am going to recognize Ranking Member Braun for his 
opening statement and to introduce our final witness, Brad 
Rhorer.

                   OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BRAUN

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to go 
right into the introduction just to keep that flow going.

    Mr. Brad Rhorer, who is a long time industry professional 
recognized in both the public sector and the manufacturing 
industry for his expertise in workforce development. And I have 
just got to tell the public that Indiana is a No. 1 
manufacturing state per capita in the country.

    It means a lot what you do. He recently joined Ascend 
Indiana in January 2024. We are happy to have him representing 
the Hoosier State here today. Thank you for being here. I ran a 
business for 37 years prior to coming here and come from one of 
the lowest unemployment counties and towns in our State of 
Indiana.

    Happened to serve on our school board for 10 years, and 
apprenticeships, career and technical education, was very 
disappointed that when I looked into our own school system, it 
was definitely getting a second fiddle attention and approach.

    In a place that had so much trouble hiring people, the 
system was actually not stigmatizing against it, but just 
wasn't working for it to give the full spectrum back then to 
parents and kids of what might be available.

    Expanding opportunities and access to apprenticeships and 
other skills and training programs are important because in 
Indiana, back when I was in the Legislature for 3 years, we 
gave it a lot of different disaggregated approaches, spending 
almost with apprenticeships and career and technical education 
$1 billion in a state like ours and not hitting the mark.

    It is interesting how this has now come full circle where 
you are getting support from manufacturers, unions, across the 
board, and you can take some hint from what other successful 
countries are doing as well. Last year, Chairman Hickenlooper 
and I introduced legislation to promote and expand youth 
apprenticeships.

    This bill, which specifically defines and targets youth 
apprenticeships for individuals between 16 and 22 years of age, 
is an important step to provide eligible employees entities the 
support they need to give critical career pathways for aspiring 
young workers.

    Unlike other initiatives that address apprenticeships, this 
does not discriminate against industry recognized 
apprenticeship programs. So, we shouldn't have issues there. 
Which are just as effective in providing opportunities as 
registered apprenticeships are.

    The bill also maintains a level playing field by not giving 
labor unions prioritization over other entities. And 
importantly, during these dire economic times, the bill is 
fiscally responsible, that hardly ever happens in this place, 
containing a paid for to support the competitive grant program 
that it authorizes and sunsets after a 5-year window.

    We should be doing the rest of Government like that. We 
wouldn't be in the deep hole we are in currently. This 
legislation is only part of the hearing. We also want to hear 
from all of you in terms of what is working in and around the 
youth apprenticeship bill, and your suggestions for what 
lawmakers can do to better support the goals.

    Today, we will hear about the value that youth 
apprenticeships have to both young workers seeking 
opportunities that can lead to rewarding lifelong careers, and 
employees seeking hard working, talented professionals that can 
help their businesses grow and prosper. I would like to make 
sure that it is an open conversation.

    We are looking forward to hearing what you guys think. 
Thank you for being here. I yield back.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you, Senator Braun. 
Senator Kaine, I see you arrived. I don't know what your 
schedule is like.

    Senator Kaine. I am not rushing.

    Senator Hickenlooper. You are not rushing? All right. Then 
I will do my--I will do questions first, and we will go to 
Senator Braun and then Senator, to you. Oh, yes, first--what am 
I saying about questioning.

    We will start, will give your--have your statements and 
then we will do all the questions. So, I apologize for that. 
Thank you. Mr. Day, why don't you start?

       STATEMENT OF STEVE DAY, PRINCIPAL, CHERRY CREEK 
             INNOVATION CAMPUS, CENTENNIAL, CO

    Mr. Day. Thank you. Senator. Good afternoon, Chair 
Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and Members of the 
Subcommittee.

    My name is Steve Day, and I am the Principal of the Cherry 
Creek Innovation Campus, a part of the Cherry Creek School 
District, the fourth largest school district in the State of 
Colorado. It is an honor to be here today to provide support 
for this critically important legislation.

    Senator Hickenlooper, as you alluded to, it was a privilege 
to give you a tour of the Innovation Campus at the start of our 
school year and to hear firsthand yours and Senator Braun's 
vision for apprenticeships and what they can mean for our 
communities and for our students.

    At the Cherry Creek Innovation Campus, also known as the 
CCIC, we have the privilege of working with high school 
students at a critical time and juncture in their formation as 
young adults.

    At a time in their lives when the present and the future 
feels uncertain, we get to be a part of putting the tools, 
knowledge, and skills in their hands to prepare them for a 
lifetime of success.

    The CCIC is a unique high school setting, to say the least. 
Like many career technical education centers, students get to 
experience multiple different career pathways on our campus, 
earning high school credit, college credit, and industry 
certifications along the way.

    While the mechanisms of that work are project based 
authentic learning, the pinnacle of the work is a moment when 
students can move from the classroom space and into the 
workplace through an apprenticeship.

    That opportunity to formally step into the workplace as 
both a learner and an employee allows our students to build 
their identity as a successful machinist, a successful 
electrician, or a successful classroom teacher, just to name 
some examples.

    However, for many students, the artificial barrier of age 
is significant, excluding them from the opportunities an 
apprenticeship brings for all of junior year and most of senior 
year of high school. What we see is the critical nature of this 
legislation is that it encourages and funds the partnerships 
where students can participate in an apprenticeship as soon as 
16 years of age, a time when they are fully supported by their 
high school network of teachers and staff.

    This legislation provides opportunities and the critically 
needed funding for school districts and employers to work 
together to build those apprenticeships, while high school 
support is at its strongest, creating a bridge to the workplace 
and to a career which can be forged into a lifelong and strong 
pathway or purpose for our youth.

    Allow me to share some examples of current apprentices and 
students to highlight the positive impact this legislation can 
have on many others. Logan apprentices with Micron, an 
international company with strong local presence in Denver. 
Micron creates high performance production systems, assembly 
lines of high complexity and precision.

    Logan has done so well with Micron already that he is a 
part of their offsite delivery and installation team of these 
high precision production lines, both locally and nationally. 
He is actually doing that work in Pennsylvania as I speak.

    Jayden's story is one of a first year apprentice in a local 
union shop, Sturgeon Electric. Jayden used his strong high 
school foundation to launch his career and is now already 
reaching back to the high school students as mentor, and event 
judge, and a recruiter for future apprentices.

    Ty is an apprentice with the Blind Institute, and in fact, 
is the first student in the Nation who is blind to go through 
their apprenticeship program. As a result of his work, Ty is 
now also industry certified with Salesforce.

    This legislation gives us the important leverage we need to 
provide these kinds of opportunities, and many more, for all 
students, starting while they are still in high school, in an 
effort to set them up for a lifetime of high wage, high skill, 
and high demand employment. Most significantly, this 
legislation has the potential to create generational change, 
lifting students and families from poverty for this generation, 
the next, and possibly for good.

    To quote our Director of Apprenticeship Success, Ashlin 
Montgomery, school staff support allows for a tremendous amount 
of social growth inside and outside of work. As students learn 
to socialize with workers of other generations, we support them 
in navigating those spaces until they understand how to 
navigate them on their own.

    As a part of our work to expand the CCIC campus within the 
next 2 years, I have had the good fortune of traveling the 
country, visiting campuses just like the CCIC. As a part of 
that journey, I have been impressed with the students of 
Arizona, Ohio, Florida, and Washington. Each and every one of 
them are ready for this kind of work.

    Each and every one of them bring an impressive amount of 
dedication, determination, and talent to what they do. These 
students are ready to get into the workplace, to prove who they 
are to their community, to their families, and to themselves.

    Again, on behalf of the Cherry Creek School District and 
the Cherry Creek Innovation Campus, I am honored to support 
this legislation and look forward to working with Members of 
the Subcommittee to bring these opportunities to more students 
and future apprentices across our entire great nation. Thank 
you.

           STATEMENT OF JAMES WESLEY PATCH, PROCESS 
          EXCELLENCE SPECIALIST, VESTAS, WINDSOR, CO

    Mr. Patch. Yes. Good afternoon, Chair Hickenlooper, Ranking 
Member Braun, and Members of the Subcommittee on Employment and 
Workplace Safety. Thank you for inviting me to testify and 
discuss with you about our apprenticeship program. My name is 
Wesley Patch.

    I am currently the Process Excellence Specialist for Vestas 
America, a renewable wind generator manufacturing company 
located in Windsor, Colorado. I was fortunate to be on the team 
designing and implementing our youth apprenticeship program, 
which is one of the things I am most proud of.

    The youth apprenticeship program was realized and began 
talks in the design in 2017. We saw an opportunity of an 
untouched pool of candidates in high school students. That is 
the start of discussions with Greeley Central High School, 
which is part of the Greeley Evan School District 6.

    This was a perfect match for Vestas, and really central to 
provide students an opportunity to join the workforce through 
an apprenticeship program where they can learn the skills 
needed in advanced manufacturing on the job while earning a 
good wage. Advanced manufacturing companies in Northern 
Colorado are struggling to find enough skilled workers to hire 
in this competitive job market today.

    In fact, there are two job openings for every currently 
available worker in Colorado. This is where the youth 
apprenticeship program becomes a valuable asset to train a 
skilled worker. The apprenticeship program, registered with the 
U.S. Department of Labor, is designed to support juniors in the 
summer before their senior year.

    The apprenticeships are anywhere from 17 to 19 years old. 
This new apprentice works 40 hours a week during the summer, 
and this is the most critical time, as the best learning is 
done with repetition and consistency.

    During their senior year, we allow up to 20 hours a week. 
They pick their own schedule based on the course load and their 
extracurricular activities. Our first apprenticeship cohort 
class started in June 2018.

    We have had 4 cohorts, which involved around 50 students, 
in this apprenticeship program over the 4 years. Since then, 
Vestas has partnered with CareerWise, which acts as an 
intermediary between the systems of education and industry, 
developing occupations and competencies, providing training 
frameworks, training staff in best practices for working with 
students and apprentices, and workplace preparedness.

    To further expand the program, including hiring high school 
seniors in these programs, the apprentices must complete a 
total of 144 hours classroom training and 2,000 hours of on the 
job training. We anticipate hiring another 40 apprentices this 
spring semester.

    Vestas, as part of the renewable energy space, has a bright 
future in the American market today, thanks to the bipartisan 
investments made during the recent clean energy transition. The 
act of supporting our growth and our investments in the 
communities we operate in now and ensure we will continue 
growing for a foreseeable future.

    With this and the competitive job market in Colorado, youth 
apprenticeship programs become an essential talent strategy to 
tap into the labor pool that is underutilized today. Our first 
apprentice to complete all of the requirements for the 
apprenticeship program was a student named Raquel. She started 
the program as a junior in high school, worked through her 
senior year, and then was hired on full time with Vestas after 
graduation.

    Rachelle--Raquel, sorry, finished her 2,000th working hour 
in Denmark on a temporary 8 week assignment, assisting another 
factory in training new employees. Upon her return to Vestas--
upon her return to Windsor, Raquel took advantage of our 
tuition reimbursement program and is currently finishing her 
second year of college to gain her engineering degree.

    Vestas's registered youth apprenticeship program has been a 
great change to our business. These young apprentices bring 
fresh ideas, energy, and willingness to learn everything they 
can. They have helped us start a mentorship program, streamline 
processes, improve productivity, and even come up with 
innovative solutions to challenges. It has been incredibly 
fulfilling to see them grow and develop their skills.

    Overall, youth apprenticeships has a huge impact on Vestas 
and the surrounding community. If the Youth Apprenticeship 
Advancement Act is passed, it will allow more businesses to 
give opportunities to our youth to be paid to learn and gain 
knowledge for better, stronger skilled workforce in the future.

    Youth apprenticeships is an investment in the company's 
workforce and one of--that has a guaranteed return, if you 
structure your program well and commit the resources. The cost 
comes from training, added headcount for mentors and trainers, 
and overhead of the new program.

    You could continue investing your youth apprenticeships and 
youth apprenticeship intermediaries, make reporting and 
registration processes simpler for employers and schools, and 
make high schools more flexible to allow more students to fit 
apprentices in their school schedules.

    Vestas chose to start this program, as we could see the 
benefit in hiring a new, diverse, and talented youth of today. 
It has shown us that the potential of a skilled workforce if 
you give the youth of today a chance to become successful. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to 
answering your questions.

    Good afternoon, Chair Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and 
Members of the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety. Thank 
you for inviting me to testify and discuss with you about our youth 
apprenticeship program. My name is Wesley Patch, I am currently the 
process excellence specialist for Vestas Americas, a renewable wind 
generator manufacturing company located in Windsor, Colorado. In my 16 
years with Vestas, I have been fortunate to hold many different roles 
as well as be on the team designing and implementing our youth 
apprenticeship program, which is one of the things I'm most proud of.

    The youth apprenticeship program was realized and began talks of 
design in 2017 as we were introducing a new product into the factory 
and were starting to hire for a production ramp. We saw an opportunity 
of an untouched pool of candidates in high school students that were 
not headed to college and their options were military or join the 
workforce. These students were attempting to gain employment with very 
little work experience or knowledge.

    Vestas started discussions with Greeley Central High School from 
Greeley Evans School District 6. There was big push at that time by the 
local school district to get their students career and/or college 
ready. This was a perfect match for Vestas and Greeley Central to 
provide students with an opportunity to joining the workforce through 
an apprenticeship program where they can learn the skills needed in 
advanced manufacturing on the job, while earning a good wage.

    Advanced Manufacturing companies in Northern Colorado are 
struggling to find enough skilled workers to hire in this competitive 
job market today. In fact, there are two job openings for every 
currently available worker in Colorado. This is where the youth 
apprenticeship program becomes a valuable asset for providing training, 
mentoring and allowing the youth of today's world an opportunity to 
gain business knowledge, earn a good wage and become good members of 
our community, starting in high school. 

                       Our Apprenticeship Program
    
    The Apprenticeship Program registered, with the U.S. department of 
labor, is designed to support juniors in the summer before their senior 
year. The apprenticeship opportunity is for 17 years, or older young 
people and we have them treat this as if they are applying for a job, 
with resume, interview, and feedback. We bring the team in as a cohort, 
put them through our new employee orientation, and assign them a 
mentor. Their mentor is with them throughout their initial 12-month 
journey. The new apprentice works 40 hours a week during the summer, 
and this is the most critical time as the best learning is done with 
repetition and consistency. Once the summer is over and they are back 
to attending school for their senior year we will allow up to 20 hours 
a week, they pick their schedule based on their course load and 
extracurriculars. Attending and completing school with a diploma or 
equivalent is part of our apprenticeship requirements for them to 
continue working with us after their apprenticeship program.

    Our first apprenticeship cohort class started in June 2018 we have 
had four cohorts which involved 50 students in the apprenticeship 
program over the 4-years. Since then, Vestas has partnered with 
CareerWise which acts as an intermediary between the systems of 
education and industry, developing occupations and competencies, 
providing training frameworks, training staff in best-practices for 
working with students and apprentices in workplace preparedness, to 
further expand the program including hiring high school Seniors. In 
these programs, the apprentices must complete a total of 144 hours of 
classroom training and 2000 hours of on-the-job training. We anticipate 
hiring another 40 apprentices this Spring semester.

    Vestas, as part of the renewable energy space, has a bright future 
in the American market thanks to the bipartisan investments made during 
the recent clean energy transition. This act is supporting our growth 
and our investments in the communities we operate in now and ensures we 
will continue growing for the foreseeable future. With this and the 
competitive job market in Colorado, youth apprenticeship programs 
become an essential talent strategy to tap into a labor pool that is 
underutilized today.

    Vestas has many career paths for the apprentices, paths into 
leadership, maintenance, quality and technical support engineers and 
logistics. Vestas has a tuition reimbursement program for all 
employees, and this works well for the apprentices as once they are 
hired on full time with Vestas, they can take advantage of this 
benefit. Not only does the apprentice gain the knowledge and skills 
needed in the advanced manufacturing industry, but they can also earn a 
degree on whichever path they choose, this is not only an alternative 
to college, but can be an alternative path through college.

    Our first apprentice to complete all the requirements for the 
apprenticeship program, was a student name Raquel. She started the 
program as a junior in high school, worked throughout her senior year 
and was hired on full time with Vestas after graduation. Raquel 
finished her 2000th working hour in Nakskov, Denmark, on a temporary 8-
week assignment assisting another factory in training new employees. 
Upon her return to Windsor, Raquel took advantage of our tuition 
reimbursement program and is currently finishing her second year of 
college to gain her engineering degree. Raquel currently is a trainer 
on the night shift and is putting her apprenticeship skills she learned 
with her mentor to work by mentoring newly hired employees.

    Vestas's registered youth apprenticeship program has been a great 
change to our business. These young apprentices bring fresh ideas, 
energy, and a willingness to learn everything they can. They've helped 
us start a mentorship program, streamline processes, improve 
productivity, and even come up with innovative solutions to challenges. 
It has been incredibly fulfilling to see them grow and develop their 
skills. Overall, youth apprenticeship has had a huge impact on Vestas 
and the surrounding community.

    Vestas saw an opportunity to tap into a labor pool that was being 
unnoticed at the time. It took around a year to get the apprenticeship 
program designed and rolled out in both the factory and school 
district. If The Youth Apprenticeship Advancement Act is passed it will 
allow more businesses to give opportunities for our youth to be paid to 
learn and gain knowledge for a better stronger skilled workforce in the 
future.

    I attend roundtable meetings with other advance manufacturing 
businesses in Northern Colorado to discuss apprenticeship programs and 
the need for these. Their tentativeness of starting an apprenticeship 
program is due to cost and effort to putting a program together. The 
cost is real, but it is an investment in the company's workforce and 
one that has a guaranteed return if you structure your program well and 
commit the resources. The cost comes from training, added headcount for 
mentors and trainers, and overhead of a new program. If you could 
continue investing in youth apprenticeships and youth apprenticeship 
intermediaries, make reporting and registration processes simpler for 
employers and schools, and make high school more flexible to allow more 
students to fit apprentices in their school schedules, this would help 
more employers take advantage of this great talent strategy and ensure 
more young people have access to great jobs.

    Vestas chose to start the program as we could see the benefit in 
hiring a new diverse and talented youth of today. It has shown us the 
potential of a skilled workforce if you give the youth of today a 
chance to become successful. Thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today, and I look forward to answering your questions.

       STATEMENT OF BRAD RHORER, PRESIDENT, CEO, ASCEND
                   INDIANA, INDIANAPOLIS, IN

    Mr. Rhorer. Good afternoon. Chairman Hickenlooper, Senator, 
Ranking Member Braun, and Committee Members. I am Brad Rhorer. 
I am the President and CEO of Ascend Indiana, a statewide 
initiative focused on ensuring Indiana employers have the 
talent needed to thrive and every Indiana citizen has the 
opportunity to pursue a meaningful career.

    Talent development is personal to me not only as a 
representative of Ascend, Indiana, but as a 25 year automotive 
manufacturing professional who spent a good portion of my 
career creating talent pathways from one of Indiana's largest 
manufacturers. Indiana is not unlike any other state in the 
Nation facing a persistent talent shortfall.

    Hoosier leaders are all too familiar with the data, a 
concerning statewide labor participation rate hovering at 64 
percent, an alarming 75 percent of Indiana employers who cannot 
find enough qualified candidates to fill open positions, an 
aging workforce population looking for retirement, and a 
strained talent pipeline that only worsened during the 
pandemic. Indiana, however, is among a few states in the Nation 
actively scaling up a proven solution, youth apprenticeships.

    Indiana has established a coalition of stakeholders from 
philanthropic organizations, chambers, education, industry, and 
the public sector to design and implement youth apprenticeships 
across the state in order to prepare more high school students 
for in-demand careers making up today's workforce.

    Our goal is to scale apprenticeship programs statewide to 
ensure every student has access to high quality education and 
training options by 2030. Indiana leaders began learning about 
Switzerland's dual vocational education and training, or VET 
system, in 2016 through a convening led by the bipartisan 
National Conference of State Legislators and funded by the 
Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation.

    Switzerland's system is considered the gold standard for 
educating youth or young people and meeting labor market 
demand, with about 70 percent of Swiss youth participating in 3 
or 4 year paid apprenticeships spanning the entire labor 
market, totaling 180,000 people ages 16 to 19.

    Drawing from the best practices of VET system, in 2019, 
Indiana collaboratively developed and began implementing a 
youth apprenticeship system through the launch of a pilot 
program called Modern Youth Apprenticeship, the creation of a 
statewide community practice to remove barriers in implementing 
and scaling these programs.

    Indiana's youth apprenticeship programs begin in 11th grade 
and average 3 years, with students earning a high school 
diploma, college credit, and industry credentials upon 
completion.

    The 3 year--three year round paid experience spanned many 
industries including insurance, business services, life 
sciences, health care, and advanced manufacturing. Today, five 
pilot programs are operating and have placed more than 400 
students with 50 more employers--or 50 employers, with five 
more pilot programs anticipated to launch by 2025.

    Finally, the statewide COP, or community practice engaged 
125 members across 60 organizations to continue to discuss how 
to scale apprenticeships in Indiana. Through the youth 
apprenticeship pilot programs, Indiana leaders identified 
common implementation challenges. Businesses view youth 
apprenticeship as a social responsibility and not as a pipeline 
development for recruitment, development, and retention.

    Youth apprenticeships are layered into an existing school 
conference or coursework, making it difficult for students to 
have consistent, dedicated work hours at an employer site. 
Communities lack reliable transportation for solutions entering 
the workplace.

    High schools have limited career counseling capabilities, 
and there is also a lack of identified competencies through 
industry and other employers to ensure consistency and 
experiences, ultimately of the ability to scale.

    As Hoosiers, we always come together, collectively solve 
challenges, and map out the best practices for the future. This 
is how we do things in Indiana. To scale youth apprenticeship 
programs statewide, Indiana is well on its way.

    We have collectively identified short term priorities, such 
as establishing a governing committee to oversee strategic 
planning, implementation, and sustainability, and operational 
structure that delineates the roles of private, public, and 
nonprofit partners.

    Another priority is to identify policies that hamper 
scaling youth apprenticeship and to address barriers. One 
significant step that was taken in 2023 by the Indiana General 
Assembly was to--that identified modern apprenticeship in 
requiring two semesters of academic instruction, 650 hours of 
work, a paid experience, post-secondary credits, and potential 
credential attainment.

    This enables consistency of programs, and it starts to 
ensure a bar of quality. It is important that all youth 
nationwide have access to apprenticeship programs. Indiana 
Coalition has significant progress to give youth equal access 
to careers and businesses access to skilled talent, but to 
scale apprenticeship here in Indiana and nationwide, the 
Coalition believes the youth apprenticeship needs a system--
needs additional systems as a framework and definition of the 
youth apprenticeship employee-led models, and easy access for 
employers and students to find funding for wraparound services, 
including transportation.

    Thank you for the opportunity to share the journey of 
Indiana and its Coalition, and I hope the experience and our 
progress provides you with information to find ways to make 
youth apprenticeship available to students and businesses 
across the Nation. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Rhorer follows.] 
    
                   prepared statement of brad rhorer
    
    Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to you about 
youth apprenticeships today. My name is Brad Rhorer, and I am President 
and CEO of Ascend Indiana, a statewide initiative focused on ensuring 
Indiana employers have the talent needed to thrive and every Indiana 
citizen has the opportunity to pursue a meaningful career.

    Talent development is personal to me not only as a representative

pathways for one of Indiana's largest manufacturers.

    Indiana is not unlike any other state in the Nation facing a 
persistent talent shortfall. Hoosier leaders are all too familiar with 
the data: a concerning statewide labor force participation rate 
hovering at 64 percent, an alarming 75 percent of Indiana employers who 
cannot find enough qualified candidates to fill open positions, an 
aging population preparing for retirement, and a strained talent 
pipeline that only worsened during the pandemic.

Indiana collaboratively developed a plan to begin implementing a youth 
apprenticeship system through the launch of pilot modern youth 
apprenticeship programs and the creation of a statewide Community of 
Practice (COP) to remove barriers to implementing and scaling these 
programs.

    Indiana's youth apprenticeship programs begin in 11th grade and 
average 3 years with students earning a high school diploma, college 
credit and an industry credential upon completion. These year-round, 
paid employment experiences span many industries, including insurance, 
business services, life sciences, healthcare, and advanced 
manufacturing. Today, five pilot programs are operating and have placed 
more than 400 students with more than 50 employers. There are five more 
pilot programs that are currently in the planning phase with the 
support of Ascend Indiana and have plans to launch in 2025. Finally, 
the statewide COP engages 125 members across 60 organizations to 
continue to discuss how Indiana can scale youth apprenticeship 
opportunities in Indiana.

    Through the youth apprenticeship pilot programs, Indiana leaders 
have identified common implementation challenges:

        <bullet>  Businesses view youth apprenticeship as corporate 
        social responsibility instead of a core component of the 
        employer's talent recruitment, development, and retention 
        strategies,

        <bullet>  Youth apprenticeships are layered on top of existing 
        high school coursework, making it difficult for students to 
        have consistent, dedicated work hours at the employer site,

        <bullet>  Communities lack reliable transportation solutions 
        for students to travel to workplaces,

        <bullet>  High schools have limited career counseling capacity, 
        impeding awareness of the variety of career pathways available 
        in Indiana, and

        <bullet>  A lack of industry-defined competencies that are 
        developed by employers and enable consistency of experiences 
        and, ultimately, the ability to scale.

    As Hoosiers, we always come together, collectively solve challenges 
and map out the best path forward. That's just how we do things in 
Indiana. To scale youth apprenticeship programs statewide, Indiana is 
well on its way. We have collectively identified short-term priorities 
such as establishing a governing committee to oversee strategic 
planning, implementation, and sustainability and an operational 
structure that delineates the roles of private, public, and nonprofit 
partners. Another priority is to identify policies that hamper scaling 
youth apprenticeships and to address barriers.

    One significant step that was taken in 2023 by the Indiana General 
Assembly was legislation that defined Modern Youth Apprenticeship and 
requires two semesters of academic instruction, 650 work hours, paid 
experience, postsecondary credits and potential credential attainment. 
This enables consistency of program implementation, and it starts to 
ensure a bar for quality.

    It's important that all youth--nationwide--have access to 
apprenticeships. Indiana's coalition has made significant progress to 
give youth equal access to career opportunities and businesses access 
to skilled talent. But, to scale apprenticeships here in Indiana--and 
nationwide--the coalition believes the youth apprenticeship system 
needs:

        (1). A framework and definition of youth apprenticeship that is 
        output oriented. It is vital that the framework allows for 
        flexibility in program design to meet community needs.

        (2). An employer-led model. Youth apprenticeships need to be 
        defined at a high level, so employers are clear about their 
        role in the ecosystem. This allows them to best identify where 
        to invest and develop capacity. Additionally, industry 
        associations need to engage and provide input on the 
        development of an occupation. Funding from the Federal 
        Government could help states define occupation mapping at a 
        state-level.

        (3). Easy access for employers and students. This includes 
        funding that supports career advising services and the delivery 
        of those services through multiple channels, transportation, 
        wrap-around services and building capacity with intermediaries 
        to help students and employers navigate the system.

    Thank you for the opportunity to share with you the journey Indiana 
is taking with its coalition. I hope our experience--and our progress--
provides you with the information needed to find ways to make youth 
apprenticeship programs available to students and businesses across the 
Nation.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Rhorer.

      STATEMENT OF  DENISE TUGADE,  FORMER MEMBER,  CALI-
        FORNIA YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP COUNCIL, LOS ANGELES,
        CA

    Ms. Tugade. Thank you. Chair Hickenlooper, Ranking Member 
Braun, and Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Denise 
Tugade. I recently served on the California Youth 
Apprenticeship Committee, as well as on the California 
Interagency Committee on Apprenticeship Health Subcommittee.

    I previously was a Government relations advocate for SEIU 
United Healthcare Workers, although today I am speaking in my 
capacity as an individual with expertise in workforce and labor 
policy. The union apprenticeship model has long been an 
established, successful path for workers to gain skills on the 
job, allowing for workers to quickly integrate into the field, 
both connections in the industry, and allow apprentices to be 
paid while receiving their training to critical earn and learn.

    Since 1948, youth unemployment rates have averaged around 
2.7 times higher than the prime age unemployment rate. A 
Brookings memo estimated that the impact of just 6 months of 
unemployment at age 22 could reduce the individual's wages in 
the following year by 8 percent and reduce future earnings by 
about $22,000 over the following decade. Notably, this impact 
is not evenly distributed across all youth.

    The long term economic losses or scarring were more severe 
for youth from historically marginalized communities, and 
particularly from youth not pursuing post-secondary education. 
This trend of a widening opportunity gap appears to be holding 
today.

    Given the dramatic and long lasting impacts of youth 
unemployment, we must look to solutions that meet this unique 
population where they are. Senator Maria Elena Durazo of Los 
Angeles introduced Senate Bill 1351, the California Youth 
Apprenticeship Program in 2022.

    As Chair of the Senate Budget Subcommittee 5 overseeing 
California's labor and workforce development budget items, she 
established the California Youth Apprenticeship Program to 
provide grants for existing, shovel ready programs and the 
development of new apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship 
programs.

    Critically, the bill defined its target population as youth 
who are at risk of disconnection or are disconnected from the 
education system or employment, unhoused, in the child welfare, 
juvenile justice, or criminal legal systems, living in 
concentrated poverty, or are facing barriers to labor market 
participation.

    It was also inclusive of youth who are facing chronic 
opportunity educational achievement gaps, attend schools in 
communities of concentrated poverty, or attend high schools 
with a negative school climate.

    Importantly, the program will collect, analyze, and report 
data on race, gender, income, rurality ability, foster youth, 
homeless youth, and English learner language--language learner, 
excuse me, among other key characteristics, keeping programs 
accountable and giving us better insight into what is and is 
not working.

    Under the statute, the California Youth Apprenticeship 
Committee was charged with developing recommendations on the 
expansion and structure of youth apprenticeships, establishing 
definitions and guiding principles for the California 
Opportunity Youth Apprenticeship Grant.

    The committee includes representatives from youth, youth 
serving organizations, labor, employers of youth, K through 12 
schools, community colleges, and the public workforce system. 
Having each of these pieces of the puzzle all together has been 
absolutely critical to getting the program moving.

    The first round of applications for funding opened in 
February, with projects estimated to start by July of this 
year. The committee has analyzed extensive surveys of youth 
apprenticeship models, with the intention of presenting a 
report of findings in July.

    In August 2023, our Governor, Gavin Newsom, issued an 
Executive Order to improve high paying--access to high paying 
jobs and fulfilling careers, reduce barriers to employment in 
state jobs, and to launch a new master plan on career 
education.

    The championship of his administration, as well as our 
agencies, has made all the difference in keeping momentum going 
forward. In the course of surveying models across the country, 
a theme which rose to the top was that youth are at a stage of 
exploring interests. Many youth do not know what they want to 
do as a career, or their ideas may change about what they want 
to do.

    The most promising models for youth apprenticeship allowed 
them to experience work based learning, while not pigeonholing 
them into a single profession or trade, by ensuring that youth 
completed their programs not only with transferable skills, but 
with portable and stackable credentials that could propel them 
forward along branching career pathways.

    In order for this model to work, youth apprenticeship 
requires, again, extensive coordination. The 2,000 hours 
minimum requirement typical for registered apprenticeships is 
challenging to complete on top of current high school 
graduation requirements, simply due to the limits on hours in 
the day, as we have said.

    Additionally, youth face unique barriers like consistency 
of transportation and the need for supplemental trainings on 
professionalism and being worksite or office ready. In closing, 
I will say, the Committee's consideration of the Youth 
Apprenticeship Advancement Act could take the following lessons 
from our successful implementation in California.

    Having all of the stakeholders, youth serving 
organizations, labor, employers of youth, K-12, community 
colleges, and intermediaries at the table together, much like 
today, can help bring down red tape to get to creative 
solutions.

    Organized labor often is ready with the infrastructure to 
recruit from target populations and provide the critical 
wraparound services that can help apprentices complete a 
program. Working with labor ensures that we are not reinventing 
the wheel.

    Having the full voice support of both Administration and 
Legislative champions across geographies and across policy 
sectors has made it possible to jump over hurdles when they 
have come in the way.

    Finally, this is a model that can be thoughtfully tailored 
to serve a group which our institutions have long failed. The 
lives of these--this is an incredible opportunity to change the 
lives of these youth and their families, and to transform 
entire communities. Thank you.

          Youth Apprenticeship: A Worker Advocate Perspective
          
    The union apprenticeship model has long been an established 
successful path for workers to learn skills on-the-job, allowing for 
workers to quickly integrate into the field, build connections in the 
industry, and allowing the apprentice to earn money rather than go into 
debt during the training process. At a time when higher education debt 
is skyrocketing and youth unemployment rates remain stubbornly high, 
youth apprenticeship adds another tool to the toolbox of options to 
help build a more prosperous economy for all Americans.

                               Background

    The high youth unemployment rate is a longstanding issue with long 
term consequences. A 2014 Brookings memo by Isabel Sawhill and Quentin 
Karpilow took a longitudinal look in Youth Unemployment Is a Problem 
for Social Mobility. Sawhill and Karpilow found that from 1948 through 
2014 at the time of publishing, youth unemployment rates averaged 
around 2.7 times higher than the prime-age unemployment rate (25-54 
years). This ratio tended to fluctuate in tandem with business cycles, 
particularly in economic downturns. Sawhill and Karpilow estimated the 
individual impact of a 6-month period of unemployment at age 22 to 
reduce the following year's wages by 8 percent, and to reduce future 
earnings by about $22,000 over the following decade. In looking to 
explain these lost earnings, the memo pointed to ``lost work 
experience, depreciating labor market skills, and the negative signals 
that unemployment sends to employers.'' \1\ Notably, this impact is not 
evenly distributed across all youth. The long term economic losses, 
deemed ``scarring,'' were more severe for youth from what the Brookings 
memo referred to as ``disadvantaged populations'' and particularly for 
youth not pursuing post-secondary education. This trend of a widening 
opportunity gap appears to be holding.

    As of July 2023, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) numbers place 
current youth unemployment at 8.7 percent, with little change from 
2022. \2\ By comparison, the prime-age unemployment rate from 2023 
through February 2024 has hovered between 3.0 and 3.3 percent. \3\ When 
stratified by gender, the unemployment rates for young men was 9.2 
percent and women was 8.2 percent. When stratified for race/ethnicity, 
the rates broke down to White at 7.0 percent, Black at 18.0 percent, 
and Hispanic at 10.5 percent, all substantially similar to the year 
prior. The young Asian unemployment rate was the only rate which was 
lower than the previous year, at 5.6 percent, however, this data is not 
disaggregated to account for the wide variations across the ethnicities 
captured by Asian American Pacific Islander Native Hawaiian (AAPINH).

Division of Apprenticeship Standards. https://www.dir.ca.gov/DAS/DAS-
MeetingAgenda/2023/February/SB-191-Excerpts.pdf.

    The program is administered by the California Department of 
Industrial Relations Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS), with 
the charge of awarding grants for the purpose of providing funding for 
existing apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs or to develop 
new apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs to serve the target 
population and satisfy the goals and objectives of the grant program. 
Critically, the bill defined ``target population'' as individuals from 
16 to 24 years of age who are at risk of disconnection or are 
disconnected from the education system or employment, unhoused, in the 
child welfare, juvenile justice, or criminal legal systems, living in 
concentrated poverty, or are facing barriers to labor market 
participation. ``Target population'' is also inclusive of youth who 
face chronic opportunity educational achievement gaps, attend schools 
in communities of concentrated poverty, or attend high schools with a 
negative school climate. Importantly, the program will collect, 
analyze, and report data on race, gender, income, rurality, ability, 
foster youth, homeless youth, English language learner, and other key 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
characteristics.

    DAS convened the California Youth Apprenticeship Committee (CYAC) 
to develop recommendations to the division on the expansion of youth 
apprenticeships in California. The committee was charged with 
establishing definitions of youth apprenticeship and high school 
apprenticeships, guiding principles in the California Opportunity Youth 
Apprenticeship (COYA) Grant, and providing insights on the structure of 
the state's work to expand youth apprenticeship. The committee includes 
representatives from youth, youth serving organizations, labor, 
employers of youth, K-12 schools, community colleges, and the public 
workforce system. The first round of applications for funding for the 
California Opportunity Youth Apprenticeship (COYA) Grant opened in 
February, with projects estimated to start by July of this year. \6\ 
The committee has analyzed extensive surveys of youth apprenticeship 
models with the intention of presenting a report of findings by July.

                      Findings and Recommendations
                      
    In the course of surveying models across the country and 
internationally, a theme which rose to the top was that youth are at a 
stage where exploration of interests is important. Many youth do not 
know what they want to do as a career, or their ideas may change as 
they gain experience or find out about opportunities. The most 
promising models for youth apprenticeship allowed youth to experience 
the work based learning while not pigeonholing them into a single 
profession or trade by ensuring that youth completed their programs not 
only with transferable skills but with portable and stackable 
credentials that can propel youth forward along branching career 
pathways. For example, a youth apprentice may complete a program around 
community health work with the intention of following a nursing 
pathway, but may find that rather than continuing down this path, is 
better suited for a role focused on behavioral health, or may be able 
to take this biological life sciences credential and move into lab 
work. \8\

Training Programs in Allied Health Professions. California Department

    In order for this model to work, youth apprenticeship requires 
extensive coordination among educators, labor, employers, and 
intermediaries. The 2000 hour minimum requirement typical for 
registered apprenticeships is challenging to complete on top of 
additionally, youth face unique barriers like consistency of 
transportation. Current high school graduation requirements simply due 
to the limits on hours in the day. Successful examples of youth 
apprenticeship combined flexibility on the part of the employer with 
school credits and accommodations for workload, as well as union and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
intermediary supportive services and mentorship.

    As with pre-apprenticeship, it is vital that youth apprenticeships 
are connected with registered apprenticeship programs. Key performance 
indicators in the traditional pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship 
model like retention and matriculation from the program to employment 
or to apprenticeship can also be telling of the success of youth 
apprenticeship, however should be adjusted specifically for youth 
apprenticeship. For example, some models for youth apprenticeship which 
did not have formal connections to registered apprenticeship had 
outcomes where few if any who completed the program went on to a 
registered apprenticeship. The pattern of data suggested that these 
participants went on to post-secondary education. This outcome, in and 
of itself, is not negative, however, it does suggest that the 
population that was served may not have been the target population 
which could benefit most from youth apprenticeship. Organized labor 
often is ready with the infrastructure to recruit from target 
populations and provide the critical wraparound services that can help 
apprentices complete a program.

    Youth apprenticeship is not a silver bullet to workforce supply and 
unemployment issues, but in combination with the many paths to good, 
thriving wage jobs, can be a critical link for youth who may have 
otherwise fallen through the cracks.
                                 ______
                                 
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Ms. Tugade. Terrific. And 
again, I appreciate you all making the time and the effort to 
be here. Let me start, Mr. Day, with you.

    The Cherry Creek Innovation Campus has taken a--really a 
full scale approach to youth apprenticeship since 2019.

    How has this full embrace of youth apprenticeship as a 
model, co-hosted with the--within the school, benefited both 
your school and the surrounding community?

    Mr. Day. Thank you, Senator. That benefit has come in 
multiple different formats. So, I can say, in terms of 
employment, we have--you use the figure of $5,000 as cited in 
terms of cost for replacing an employee.

    We have heard from our construction partners in the 
construction trades specific to our area that we have a savings 
of $15,000 in terms of employee training when they exit our 
programs and move into their career with these employees or 
these employee partners.

    We have benefited by that in multiple different ways in 
terms of strengthening that partnership by providing these 
employees. We have the training of professional skills that we 
do at the CCIC, which also then benefits not only our students, 
obviously, but also the employer in terms of the strength of 
their employee.

    Then, those partnerships show up in multiple different 
forms of support for our campus. And I would say, one way to 
kind of tackle the structure of some of these challenges is we 
have students who will enroll with us for three full years, two 
full years of instruction in the classroom, and then we use 
their third year with us, their senior year, as the beginning 
of their apprenticeship, specifically in the construction 
trades, is just one example.

    Senator Hickenlooper. [Technical problems]--oops, thank you 
very much. Ms. Tugade, one of the main reasons we are so 
passionate about this model of advancing youth apprenticeship 
is the way that it will help bring apprenticeship opportunities 
to a whole new generation of Americans.

    Unions have a strong history of advancing apprenticeship 
and continue to be strong partners as we work toward--as we 
work to support youth apprenticeships. But the fact is that 
most, well advancing youth apprenticeships is going to require 
diverse stakeholder support across the board.

    Given your background, can you discuss a little bit about 
how we make sure to include unions in youth apprenticeship 
partnerships? Ultimately, how that strengthens the program?

    Ms. Tugade. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
And, again, I think bringing everyone to the table just like 
today is so important, regardless of we may not always agree on 
every single issue, but on this, on making sure that we are 
getting our youth into the workforce, I think this is something 
we can all agree on.

    The how, of course, is the tricky part. We found that in 
California, one of the best ways to go about it is to really 
look at where the need is. So, my previous employer was in the 
health care field, and so of course, there is always a need.

    We are in a severe shortage. In California, we were looking 
at 500,000 short, for allied health care workers. And a lot of 
those are really good paying jobs that do not require a college 
education.

    May not even require a high school education. You just need 
a certificate. And so, how do we get folks into those jobs? And 
so, really, meeting with employers and then, again, kind of 
getting to that point of how do we get to where we are both 
interested parties.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Exactly the point. Mr. Patch, 
Vestas has been an employer partner for now, what, 6 years, 
going on 6 years, and obviously clearly ramping this up. How 
would legislation like the Youth Apprenticeship Advancement Act 
help existing programs like yours to kind of grow in to serve 
more apprentices?

    Mr. Patch. Yes, it would help with really the overhead cost 
of trainers and mentors. It would help with the training 
materials. It would help with recruiting. It would help with 
the intermediary consultants helping us get students into our 
program.

    It would help schools themselves be able to recruit 
students in their school districts. It would also help us with 
understanding of projecting out to the public with advertising, 
marketing, and assisting so that people are aware of it.

    Right, I mean people understand apprenticeship programs, 
but they are not really aware of what really an apprenticeship 
program does. So, if this is passed, then it lets the whole 
world know that we are really serious here and we are going to 
go after the apprenticeships.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Certainly, that is part of the goal 
here, is to make sure that when people in America hear the word 
apprenticeship, they think, wow, opportunity rather than, well, 
maybe I should be going to college.

    The apprenticeships are their own choice. And you are 
exactly right, we are changing the way people hear just the 
word. They called a vote, so I am going to turn the Chair over 
to Senator Braun, my Co-Chair of this thing, and let him take 
it from here, and recognize Senator Kaine. And I will be back 
briefly.

    Senator Braun. Before you leave, I would like to submit for 
the record six letters from Ascend, Indiana and others in 
Indiana that have highlighted what we are doing there for 
apprenticeships. And I would like to get that into the record.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Without objection.

    [The following information can be found on page 27 in 
Additional Material:]

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have several 
questions, Mr. Rhorer, and I got another set of them. We will 
try to get them in and then Senator Kaine will be up. I know 
what it means in Indiana, in terms of that idea of aspiring to 
go to college.

    I remember too that there were cases where I think we were 
pushing kids only into that direction at the expense of--pre-
COVID, I think we had 65,000 jobs in Indiana that needed 
apprenticeships, some form of better education in high school 
toward basic skills.

    How have you seen in the past few years--are we getting 
elementary education involved at all, in the middle school and 
especially in high school, to where these options are there for 
parents and kids to look at? Has the dynamic changed?

    Mr. Rhorer. Thank you for that question, Senator Braun. The 
dynamic has continued to change. Its pivoting with each region 
as we continue to expand the opportunities for youth in 
Indiana.

    We are really making a concerted effort by changing 
legislation, grad pathways. I think you are very familiar with 
the fact that now Indiana requires each graduating high school 
senior to have a work based learning experience before 
graduation. That took place in effective of 2023, in that 
cohort.

    That really, to me, underscores how serious we are taking 
those skills, and I think that is also--the leading that 
through education is the importance of that, and how we 
continue to identify those opportunities for those students and 
show those skills that are needed.

    We talk a lot about people showing up on time and people 
really becoming team players, and a lot of that comes from 
experience. And Indiana, I think is really taking us seriously 
with our educators and our parents.

    Senator Braun. That is good. And then what about on the 
industry end? I think they have always wanted our school 
systems to kind of produce that perfect mix of future 
employees, and I think they probably have become more engaged 
as well. Are you seeing that?

    Mr. Rhorer. Absolutely. Industry is definitely coming to 
the table through partnerships with CICP and Ascend Indiana and 
others and to the state. They are coming to the regions and 
really trying to show how they are leaning into education.

    A lot of--everything we have talked about today underscores 
the importance of this being an employer led initiative. Youth 
apprenticeship is only as strong as employers develop and then 
compensates the curriculums.

    I think employers are really taking this to heart and 
looking at this as a viable pipeline for Indiana.

    Senator Braun. Then what about, because ours is really a 
rural state, we probably have 50, 55 counties that have got 
agriculture and manufacturing, a part of it. Are we seeing this 
in the rural communities and counties as well?

    Mr. Rhorer. Yes, absolutely. That is one of the things that 
we are talking through and how to scale because you have 
transportation issues, you have career counseling issues. But 
62 of our 92 counties are nearly 20 percent manufacturing 
intensity.

    We have to get rural to get this scaled at the proper end. 
We have more and more regions. As I alluded to earlier, we have 
five more partnerships that are growing by 2025 with more in 
the pipeline for development. So, it is scaling.

    Senator Braun. Then the difference between an industry 
recognized apprenticeship and registered apprenticeships, is 
that starting to diminish or is there still a distinction made 
that would be relevant to employers?

    Mr. Rhorer. It is starting to diminish. I mean, they are 
both equally important. As mentioned earlier in California 
statement about unions are incredibly important and still 
prominent in Indiana, but there is also several nonunion.

    Those industry recognized credentials, automotive space, 
particularly for me and others, it is incredibly important. And 
they have to work together, and they will, and they continue to 
in Indiana.

    Senator Braun. Very good. I want to start with Mr. Day and 
Mr. Patch and then Ms. Tugade on that issue of stigmatizing 
pathways to career and technical education versus 2 year or 4 
year pathways. Give me your take on that, and then we will move 
down the line.

    Mr. Day. That is definitely the heavy lift right there, 
sir. We have had so many years, decades, in fact, of pushing 
all students, as you mentioned earlier, toward college. And we 
are now destigmatizing the work of career preparation.

    I think we have done that in a number of different ways. 
Some as reimagining how a career center like the CCIC can 
appear to students. We do--a fair amount of our work is 
marketing the opportunities we have for our students. Like we 
bring every eighth grader through an entire district.

    We bring them all through our campus, so they get to see 
what we have available to us. And we have students who are 
currently in our program, speak on the behalf of the program, 
which is a fantastic way, again, to remove that stigma in terms 
of where those students can see themselves in a career and how 
they get there, very drastically differently from the college 
only path. That has made a tremendous difference for us.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. And Mr. Patch, my comment on the 
pay differences, if there are any, and whether you can get into 
a career with nearly the same amount of pay and no debt from 
further education?

    Mr. Patch. By coming into industry--?

    Senator Braun. Yes.

    Mr. Patch. Yes. For sure. We, our career paths that we give 
in the--our industry itself, between leadership, engineering 
quality. You can get into making a good wage, learn where you 
want to go, and then we will pay for your school.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. Ms. Tugade.

    Ms. Tugade. In response to the----

    Senator Braun. Yes. In your view, in terms of 4 year degree 
versus apprenticeship, CTE and getting directly into the 
workforce.

    Ms. Tugade. Absolutely. One of the most successful programs 
we have had at SEIU, United Healthcare Workers has been our 
Futuro Health Recruitment Program. And so, that was primarily 
focused at recruiting worker--the family and friends of our 
incumbent workers.

    They were people who already knew--they already knew what 
the health care field looked like. They already knew the 
difficulties, but they also knew what it could do for them. 
They knew how life changing that work could be.

    That was actually one of the best programs that we have had 
and has been actually so successful that we have run out of 
spots so far. And so, really, again, relying on those networks 
that are already built.

    Senator Braun. Thank you.

    Senator Kaine.

    Senator Kaine. Thanks to the witnesses. We both need to 
vote and so I am going to go quick because there is a vote on. 
I am the chairman, along with Senator Young of Indiana, of the 
Career and Technical Education Caucus here.

    The son of an ironworker and welder. Senator Braun and I 
are the co-sponsors of a bill that would allow Pell Grants to 
be used for high quality career and technical education, the 
Jobs Act, which we need to pass.

    I am really interested in this, and I am excited to see a 
real renaissance in career and technical education in our K-12 
systems all across the country, innovative programs. This is 
great. Here is a group of youngsters I am worried about. There 
is about 4.5 million people in this country, between 16 and 24, 
who are disconnected from both school and work.

    Programs that are smart programs within school systems are 
great and we need them, but we also have a group of kids who 
want to have work experiences or need to who are not working, 
and they are not at school. Can any of you share strategies 
that you have used to try to reach out to them?

    I have a bill that I am introducing this week called the 
Opening Doors for Youth Act with, Congressman Scott on the 
House side, and it is to focus on this group of what we call 
opportunity youth, but strategies that you all are using to 
deal with these kids, I would love to hear. Yes, Mr. Day, can 
we start with you?

    Mr. Day. Of course, Senator. Yes, thank you for the 
question. So, we use a number of different strategies.

    One is, again, bringing all of our eighth graders through. 
And I can give you a quick anecdote of we have eight home high 
schools that we serve, and we take students from as part of 
coming to our campus for the programs that they have there.

    We will sometimes get those calls from the home high school 
and say, look, we can see on the attendance record they are 
showing up for you. You need to tell them to come to math 
class, right.

    The engagement of CTE, that career technical education 
class, can be so high that it can be the lifeline that you are 
talking about. It is getting them into the classroom. So it is 
that marketing to them.

    It is reaching out and making sure they are aware of the 
opportunities. We provide a number of different summer 
opportunities for our most at risk youth. We do a lot of grant 
writing to be able to bring those folks in so that we can have 
the teachers and obviously the students present on campus, so 
they get those experiences. And you are exactly right, it can 
be transformational.

    One of the things we have done very early in my tenure at 
CCIC is remove all barriers for admissions. So, there is no 
minimum GPA. There is no teacher letter of recommendation. All 
those things are out the door, so we don't have to--we welcome 
and include all students who are interested. It makes a big 
difference.

    Senator Kaine. One of the things you said, and I think 
Senator Braun said it earlier too, to start earlier, start 
before a youngster becomes disconnected from school. If you can 
start late in elementary or in middle school and show people 
paths that they might not be aware of, that can actually spark 
their interest in keeping them connected and having them stay. 
How about others dealing--Mr. Rhorer, I see you are ready to 
punch the button.

    Mr. Rhorer. Yes. Yes, very interested to talk about this.

    We really have spent some time marketing, as mentioned 
before, the opportunities specifically in advanced 
manufacturing logistics in Indiana, trying to reach that 
younger group and make them understand that they do have 
opportunities coming out of high school.

    We also really pair down our career and technical education 
and aligned it with post-secondary, Ivy Tech. We are fortunate 
enough that we have one community college in the State of 
Indiana, and that community college is in lockstep with career 
and technical education. So, we are really showing that 
students can go through those pathways.

    They are meaningful, they have credentialing to those, and 
then they lead to those good and promising jobs. So much so we 
actually took career and technical education this last year and 
it is now as high--now it is housed underneath career--the 
Commissioner of Higher Education.

    Senator Kaine. Fantastic. I want to ask a slightly separate 
question on the same topic to Mr. Patch and Ms. Tugade. You 
said one of--I think Ms. Tugade, I think you said looking at 
programs and you said one of the challenges is if corporations 
just see this as a social responsibility thing rather than they 
need it as a pipeline for employees, they may be less willing 
to do it.

    Mr. Patch, you described the program as, you realize you 
are going to have a need to hire these technicians, so you kind 
of created a program. So, you are both looking at it, not just 
as a good thing to do, but as something that is necessary to 
help businesses thrive and students and young people have 
access to employment.

    Talk a little bit about that, trying to convince companies 
not this is just a good thing to do, but it is really going to 
be in their interests to creatively engage with programs like 
this.

    Mr. Patch. Yes, for sure, and thank you for the question. 
That is what we recognized back in 2017. We were bringing in a 
new process.

    We were doing a production ramp, and we knew that there was 
going to be a limited supply of hirable workers, right. And so, 
going into the high schools, we knew that there was a 
percentage of them--I can't--I don't know what the percentage 
is at this time, but there is a percentage that had a choice, 
right.

    You go into the career, you go into the military, or you go 
to school, right. And as colleges are getting more and more 
expensive, we just had to show them the pathway to the career, 
and that is what we did with District 6.

    They had an innovation of career and college ready, so we 
went with the career side of it, and we started touching young 
at 3 years--or three, grade three, through grade five. And not 
only the kids that we touched, we touched the parents as well, 
so that way the parents knew what was out there for them, 
because the more we get the parents involved, the more that 
they would push their kids toward a more career at that point.

    Having it as our industry with advanced manufacturing, we 
could show them a pathway inside of our work so they just 
wouldn't get in and be stale and work for five, 6 years as a 
worker. They could actually grow and eventually take college if 
they would like to.

    Senator Kaine. [Technical problems]--I am going to yield 
back to the Chairman and go vote, but I appreciate all of you--
[technical problems]. Thank you so much.

    Senator Braun. We are waiting on Chairman Hickenlooper to 
come back. So, I will let any one of you from the discussion 
that we have had, what would you like to add to it that we have 
missed? Mr. Day, we will start with you.

    Mr. Day. I would speak to an opportunity that we are proud 
of. One thing we implemented at the Cherry Creek Innovation 
Campus for a population that has not been discussed yet, but I 
think is just as important to include.

    We are part of a national program called a Uniquely Abled 
Academy, and we implemented the first program of such in the 
State of Colorado. And it serves a specifically unique 
population of adults with level one autism that have a set of 
characteristics and traits and abilities that are specific to 
high--they excel at high precision jobs, which makes them a 
great employer in a high precision manufacturing site.

    We train a program--we offer a training program, pardon me, 
in the evenings and in the summer for these young adults. And 
they can earn their NIMS certification, their national 
metalworking certification, as a machinist.

    We are proud to say we have taken two cohorts through the 
program already, and we are providing employment to a segment 
of our population that is classically been underemployed. And 
we think that is an exciting aspect of what we are talking 
about here. It is a small group of folks, but it is just as 
important as we would--all the others.

    Mr. Patch. Yes. For me, I attend many roundtable meetings 
in Northern Colorado with other advanced manufacturing 
businesses, and they are truly tentative to start 
apprenticeship programs due to the cost and the effort of just 
putting together, because the cost is real.

    I feel if this Youth Apprenticeship Advancement Act is 
passed, that will push some more advanced manufacturing or 
employers to take that risk and say, hey, yes, we are going to 
do this because now it will help us fund this project or 
program.

    Senator Braun. Mr. Rhorer.

    Mr. Rhorer. I say Indiana is not alone in this. We have 
roughly 25,000 kids coming out of high school every year that 
don't have a plan. They are not enrolled, enlisted, or employed 
in Indiana.

    Youth apprenticeship gives them opportunity to get some 
guidance and some direction that is very well needed for those 
youth, that 16 to 24 year old that is unemployed right now. 
Then you also look at the employers, the cost of having vacant 
jobs in Indiana.

    We did a study 2 years ago that demonstrated if we had 
85,000 opened manufacturing jobs in Indiana, it would cost our 
economy about $6.7 billion.

    We need to understand how to fulfill that, and this 
pipeline development that we are doing right now, including 
youth apprenticeship, is exactly how we do that. Thank you.

    Senator Braun. Ms. Tugade.

    Ms. Tugade. Thank you. I think most critically, these 
programs need to be youth centered. In California, we have 
actually broken out these programs into out-of-school youth and 
in-school youth in recognition of this need to particularly 
serve those disconnected youth.

    Those out-of-school youth are getting additional wraparound 
services, counselors, transportation, all sorts of additional 
wraparound services. And to the point of the other panelists, 
that is expensive.

    But we have to look at this as an investment, because the 
cost of the vacancies in these high need industries is much 
higher, especially as we go forward. And so, how do we make 
this easier, how do we create clarity with our business 
partners and with our school partners through minimum industry 
training criteria, through competency templates to make sure 
that we are able to scale easily. So, with that, I will pass it 
back----

    Senator Braun. Thank you. And I am going to forego my 
closing statement. And I would like to ask, Brad, if you want 
to, take a trip by my office on your way out. I would love to 
talk to you a little further about what is happening in 
Indiana. So, if that works, I will see you in a bit.

    Mr. Rhorer. Thank you.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Senator Braun. Appreciate 
you filling in and covering. As I said in the beginning, thank 
all of you for making the trek out here, spending the time with 
us. I think we will see additional questions come in for you 
that hopefully you can get a chance to look at and get the 
answers.

    The rule of thumb, if any Senators do want to ask 
additional questions for the record, they will be due by 5.00 
p.m., 10 business days from today. That is March 26th. So, we 
will make sure that gets circulated.

    Mr. Day, Mr. Patch, Mr. Rhorer, Ms. Tugade, thank you. 
Again, this is very instructive, and I think as we begin to 
work forward on trying to find what are the legitimate 
compromises to the obstacles we have to passing this bill, it 
is going to take perspectives from all different points of view 
and all different points of the political compass. And you guys 
represent that to a large extent.

    Hopefully we can get this ball moving to the point where we 
do function closer to the Swedish or the Swiss model of 
apprenticeships where it is accepted that this is a viable, 
valuable opportunity for any one of our youth if they are so 
inclined and this is what attracts them.

    We got a lot of work to do, but I appreciate all the work 
you have already done. This is my grandfather when we were 
kids, and he gets to go out, pick up crab apples that he used 
to make into this, basically the apple brandy in his basement. 
But at the end of a whole day, we would have all these bags of 
apples.

    He would say, look how much we have got done. And then he 
would point to the trees and say, look how much we still have 
to do. That is what I say to each of you. Thank you for all 
that you have done. Look how much we still have to do. The 
Committee now stands adjourned.

                           REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVES,
                                                    March 11, 2024.
Hon. John Hickenlooper Chairman,
U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety,
374 Russell Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.

    Dear Chairman Hickenlooper:

    Regional Opportunity Initiatives (ROI) is pleased to support and 
share the value of youth apprenticeship in Indiana. ROl's UpSkill Work 
& Learn Initiative is a high-quality work-based learning (WBL) strategy 
inspired by the modern youth apprenticeship (MYA) model. The program 
offers students a 2-year opportunity to work and learn while in high 
school with the option to continue with the employer into a third year 
after graduation. The program allows students the chance to develop 
skills they cannot achieve in the classroom and the employers the 
opportunity to grow their local workforce. The UpSkill program is in 
its third cohort and the number of student and employer partners 
continues to grow.

    UpSkill was identified early on as an essential tool for developing 
and retaining talent in the Indiana Uplands. Regional employers are 
experiencing unprecedented job growth that is outpacing that of 
communities across the country. From 2012 to 2023, Automotive and Heavy 
Vehicles jobs have grown by 212 percent, National Security and Defense 
by 16.6 percent and Biomedical by 23.2 percent. Developing both talent 
and an affinity for living and working in this region is essential. 
UpSkill accomplishes both.

    The State of Indiana is also embracing youth apprenticeship as an 
essential vehicle for building the talent we require and supporting the 
workforce needs of a growing employer base. Several members of ROl's 
team have been engaged at the state level in rethinking how we should 
be structuring learning experiences for young people through WBL 
strategies like UpSkill. We are glad to be part of the coalition of 
Indiana's leaders from sectors including employment, education, 
government, and philanthropy, working to advance MYA. Working together 
we can grow a talent pool that will make this state attractive to host 
of employers in growing sectors including advanced technologies. It 
will help the State of Indiana grow its population and per capita 
income, both priorities for our growing state.

    Support for apprenticeships at the Federal level will be critical 
as states like Indiana work to scale the opportunities for the benefit 
of young people, employers, and communities. Programming that enables, 
and even incents, employers, schools, post-secondary institutions, and 
intermediaries to accelera ea options of modern apprenticeships can be 
a game changer.
       Sincerely,
                                           Tina Peterson,
                                         President and CEO.

Hon. Mike Braun Ranking Member,
U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety,
404 Russell Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.

    Dear Senator Braun:

    My name is Marie Mackintosh, and I serve as President and CEO of 
EmployIndy, the workforce development board for Marion County, Indiana. 
EmployIndy guides the local workforce ecosystem and makes strategic 
investments to promote equity and remove barriers to quality employment 
for underserved and underrepresented residents. One of the most 
exciting and promising practices we have found to meet this need is 
through Modern Apprenticeship. I am writing today to urge your 
continued and immediate support for this model of work-based learning 
for our young people.

    The United States--and Indiana in particular--has an education 
problem. To meet the demands of our growing and changing economy, 72 
percent of jobs will require postsecondary education and/or training by 
2031. As a business owner yourself, I am sure you recognize the urgent 
need for talent in our local economy.

    However, in Indiana, fewer high school students are pursuing 
postsecondary enrollment or completing a credential or degree. Just 53 
percent of Indiana's high school graduates go on to college, down from 
65 percent in 2015. Only two thirds of those college-goers complete a 
program within 6 years. Many of those who do graduate in time are not 
earning degrees in in-demand areas. At the same time, we currently need 
215,000 people to close our skills gap in Indianapolis alone.

    In order to reverse this trend, in 2020, the Modern Apprenticeship 
Program (MAP) launched in Indianapolis--providing employers with an 
innovative approach to a time-tested model for building their talent 
pipeline. To date, MAP has placed 122 students from 14 high schools 
with 41 employers and counting. These students are taking on 
occupations in growing, high-demand industries, many of which are 
occupations registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. Students are 
getting a headstart in a promising career in in-demand fields such as 
healthcare, information technology, and advanced manufacturing. We have 
found dedicated employer partners in companies such as Eli Lilly, 
Indianapolis Airport Authority, and Roche Diagnostics.

    In order to continue to scale and sustain our success, we need your 
support in building a national framework that encourages, not stifles, 
the growth of apprenticeship as a viable and attractive career path for 
students and talent pipeline for employers.

    EmployIndy has found that letting the employers lead in alignment 
with their industry standards is proven to be most successful in 
training and retaining quality apprentices while providing a positive 
return on investment for those employers. We believe this can be 
accomplished by maintaining the following principles when developing 
law and rulemaking around apprenticeships:

        <bullet>  Ensure quality.

                Y  Apprenticeship duration needs to be a certain amount 
                of seat time in order to see the return on investment. 
                50 percent of that time onsite with the employer should 
                be on-the-job training.

                Y  Competencies, curriculum, and end of course 
                assessments should be developed by the employers in 
                alignment with industry standards.


        <bullet>  Businesses need to lead.

                Y  federally, set minimum standards for states.

                Y  Define the role businesses should play in 
                apprenticeship law at the state level.

    Thank you for your consideration. Together, we hope to grow and 
sustain Modern Apprenticeship into a career path that meets the needs 
of our students, employers, and state.
       Thank you,
                                      Marie Mackintosh,
                                         President and CEO,
                                                EmployIndy.

    Hon. John Hickenlooper and Hon. Mike Braun:

    I am writing to you in support of Ascend Indiana and their work in 
leading a statewide group of educators, community partners and indust1y 
leaders, in an effort to develop and scale quality modern youth 
apprenticeship programs across Indiana Ascend Indiana is a statewide 
initiative focused on creating opportunities for students and ensuring 
Indiana employers have the access to talent needed to grow and 
diversify our economy, while providing every Hoosier with the 
opportunity to pursue a career they are passionate about.

    As employees of the largest school corporation in Southwestern 
Indiana, we understand the need to develop quality talent in high 
demand local industries, such as healthcare and manufacturing. With the 
support of Ascend and the Modern Youth Apprenticeship initiative, we 
have been able to begin the education and connection to employers and 
post-secondary education in high school.

    Indiana is a national leader in the work of Modern Youth 
Apprenticeship. OptIN, as a program of the Evansville Vanderburgh 
School corporation, has worked to create youth apprenticeships in 
Healthcare, Manufacturing, Welding and Education. With the support of 
Ascend Indiana, OptIN has partnered with Southwest Indiana's largest 
employers to create meaningful opportunities for students while also 
creating a sustainable talent pipeline for each of the region's top 4 
industry sectors. We appreciate your continued support of Ascend and 
Modern Youth Apprenticeship.

    Chairman Hickenlooper, Ranking Member Braun, and Members of the 
Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, thank you for the 
opportunity to provide a statement for the record in support of youth 
apprenticeships.

    In less than a decade, one-third of the United States workforce 
will need to learn new skills and find work in new occupations. In 
fact, 87 percent of companies are experiencing or expect to experience 
a skills mismatch--the misalignment between the skills workers possess 
and jobs require. Youth apprenticeships, which allow youth to 
participate in paid, industry-aligned work experiences, can play a role 
in addressing this mismatch.

    JPMorgan Chase has experienced firsthand how youth apprenticeships 
can be a talent pipeline strategy to address workforce needs. In 
collaboration with CareerWise New York, JPMorgan Chase offers youth 
apprenticeships that allow high school students to develop skills 
related to business operations or software engineering through blended 
classroom training and on-the-job experience at the firm. Students in 
the program earn debt-free college credit and nationally recognized 
industry certificates, all while graduating on time.

    While JPMorgan Chase has benefited from youth apprenticeships, 
there are barriers to the growth and success of youth apprenticeships 
nationally that policy can help to address. For example, youth 
apprenticeships should be defined at the Federal level. Currently, 
there is no Federal definition for youth apprenticeships. The U.S. 
Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information 
Data base System (RAPIDS), which pulls together learner-level data from 
25 federally administered and 18 state-administered Registered 
Apprenticeships systems, does not differentiate between youth-and 
adult-focused programs, making it challenging to gauge the experiences 
and outcomes of youth apprentices.

    Additionally, many employers do not register their apprenticeship 
programs because of the administrative requirements associated with 
them or because they find that the Registered Apprenticeship program 
standards do not align with their current skilling efforts. To 
incentivize employer participation, the registration process for 
employers can be simplified and streamlined to address administrative 
barriers, such as having to re-register the same programs in multiple 
states, and standards can be modernized without sacrificing quality to 
recognize different approaches to skilling, such as competency-based 
approaches.

    JPMorgan Chase has released policy recommendations to expand and 
modernize apprenticeship programs, including youth apprenticeships.

    We thank the Members of the Subcommittee for their leadership on 
youth apprenticeships, and we encourage Congress to advance these 
important workforce policy reforms.
                                 ______

    Hon. John Hickenlooper and Hon. Mike Braun:

    I am writing to you on behalf of Ascend Indiana and its work with a 
statewide coalition of Indiana leaders dedicated to delivering and 
scaling modern youth apprenticeship programs across the Hoosier State. 
Ascend Indiana is a statewide initiative focused on ensuring Indiana 
employers have the talent needed to thrive and every Indiana citizen 
has the opportunity to pursue a meaningful career.

    Talent development is personal to me not only as a representative 
of Ascend Indiana, but as a 25-year automotive manufacturing 
professional who has spent a good portion of my career creating talent 
pathways for one of Indiana's largest manufacturers.

    Indiana is not unlike any other state in the Nation facing a 
persistent talent shortfall. Hoosier leaders are all too familiar with 
the data: a concerning statewide labor force participation rate 
hovering at 64 percent, an alarming 75 percent of Indiana employers who 
cannot find enough qualified candidates to fill open positions, an 
aging population preparing for retirement, and a strained talent 
pipeline that only worsened during the pandemic.

    Indiana, however, is among the few states in the Nation actively 
scaling up a proven solution: youth apprenticeships. Indiana has 
established a coalition of stakeholders from philanthropic 
organizations, chambers, education, industry and the public sector to 
design and implement youth apprenticeships across the state in order to 
prepare more high school students for in-demand careers making up 
today's workforce. Our goal is to scale apprenticeship programs 
statewide to ensure every student has access to high-quality education 
and training options by 2030.

    In 2016, Indiana leaders began learning about Switzerland's dual 
vocational education and training (VET) system through convenings led 
by the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures and funded 
by the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation. Discussions centered on the 
NCSL report, ``No Time to Lose: How to Build a World-Class Education 
System State by State,'' which highlighted the Swiss dual VET system. 
Switzerland's system is considered the ``gold standard'' for educating 
young people and meeting labor market demand, with about 70 percent of 
Swiss youth participating in a three-or 4-year paid apprenticeship 
spanning the entire labor market, totaling about 180,000 people ages 16 
to 19.

    These learning sessions culminated in a planning process in 2019 
led by the Partnership to Advance Youth Apprenticeship (PAYA). A 25-
person planning group took a deeper dive on the Swiss model and 
benchmarked with other states piloting youth apprenticeship. The group 
determined the CareerWise Colorado model aligned best with Indiana. 
Colorado's model has youth begin 3-year, paid apprenticeships in 11th 
grade, culminating in a high school diploma, college credit, and an 
industry credential.

    In July 2019, a subset of the Indiana planning group attended 
CEMETS Institute in Zurich to see first-hand the Swiss system and 
develop a plan for Indiana. The group decided on a two-pronged approach 
to implementing a Swiss-style youth apprenticeship system:

        (1). Launch of Swiss-style pilot programs in Indiana. The first 
        cohort of apprentices launched in Elkhart County in 2019 
        through the work of CareerWise Elkhart County. Marion County 
        launched the MAP program in 2020 through the joint efforts of 
        Ascend Indiana and EmployIndy, placing its first cohort of 
        apprentices in 2021.

        (2). Create a statewide Community of Practice (COP) to convene 
        communities across Indiana working to implement Swiss-style 
        youth apprenticeship programs. Ascend Indiana designed and 
        currently oversees the COP, which launched in March 2020. 
        Through the COP, Ascend has raised additional national and 
        state funding and provided planning grants and technical 
        assistance to support the launch of eight additional sites. As 
        of 2023, there are five sites operating and five more in the 
        planning phase.

    Indiana's youth apprenticeship programs begin in 11th grade and 
average 3 years with students earning a high school diploma, college 
credit and an industry credential upon completion. These year-round, 
paid employment experiences span many industries, including insurance, 
business services, life sciences, healthcare, and advanced 
manufacturing. Today, five pilot programs are operating and have placed 
more than 400 students with more than 50 employers. There are five more 
pilot programs that are currently in the planning phase with the 
support of Ascend Indiana and have plans to launch in 2025. Finally, 
the statewide COP engages 125 members across 60 organizations to 
continue to discuss how Indiana can scale youth apprenticeship 
opportunities in Indiana.

    Through the youth apprenticeship pilot programs, Indiana leaders 
have identified common implementation challenges:

        <bullet>  Businesses view youth apprenticeship as corporate 
        social responsibility instead of a core component of the 
        employer's talent recruitment, development, and retention 
        strategies,

        <bullet>  Youth apprenticeships are layered on top of existing 
        high school coursework, making it difficult for students to 
        have consistent, dedicated work hours at the employer site,

        <bullet>  Communities lack reliable transportation solutions 
        for students to travel to workplaces,

        <bullet>  High schools have limited career counseling capacity, 
        impeding awareness of the variety of career pathways available 
        in Indiana, and

        <bullet>  A lack of industry-defined competencies that are 
        developed by employers and enable consistency of experiences 
        and, ultimately, the ability to scale.

    As Hoosiers, we always come together, collectively solve challenges 
and map out the best path forward. That's just how we do things in 
Indiana. To scale youth apprenticeship programs statewide, Indiana is 
well on its way. We have collectively identified short-term priorities 
such as establishing a governing committee to oversee strategic 
planning, implementation, and sustainability, and an operational 
structure that delineates the roles of private, public, and nonprofit 
partners. Another priority is to identify policies that hamper scaling 
youth apprenticeships and to address barriers.

    One significant step that was taken in 2023 by the Indiana General 
Assembly was legislation that defined Modern Youth Apprenticeship and 
requires two semesters of academic instruction, 650 work hours, paid 
experience, postsecondary credits and potential credential attainment. 
This enables consistency of program implementation, and it starts to 
ensure a bar for quality.

    It's important that all youth--nationwide--have access to 
apprenticeships. Indiana's coalition has made significant progress to 
give youth equal access to career opportunities and businesses access 
to skilled talent. But, to scale apprenticeships here in Indiana--and 
nationwide--the coalition believes the youth apprenticeship system 
needs:

        (1). A framework and definition of youth apprenticeship that is 
        output oriented. It is vital that the framework allows for 
        flexibility in program design to meet community needs.

        (2). An employer-led model. Youth apprenticeships need to be 
        defined at a high level, so employers are clear about their 
        role in the ecosystem. This allows them to best identify where 
        to invest and develop capacity. Additionally, industry 
        associations need to engage and provide input on the 
        development of an occupation. Funding from the Federal 
        Government could help states define occupation mapping at a 
        state-level.

        (3). Easy access for employers and students. This includes 
        funding that supports career advising services and the delivery 
        of those services through multiple channels, transportation, 
        wrap-around services and building capacity with intermediaries 
        to help students and employers navigate the system.

    Thank you for the opportunity to share with you the journey Indiana 
is taking with its coalition. I hope our experience--and our progress--
provides you with the information needed to find ways to make youth 
apprenticeship programs available to students and businesses across the 
Nation.
       Sincerely,
                                       Bradley Rhorer,
                                         President and CEO,
                                            Ascend Indiana.
                                 ______
