          OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN WHITEHOUSE \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Prepared statement of Chairman Whitehouse appears in the 
appendix on page 28.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Chairman Whitehouse. This hearing of the Senate Budget 
Committee will come to order. I'm pleased that we are joined by 
Director Swagel today, to discuss the Federal Government's 
fiscal trajectory. My Republican colleagues complain that I, 
and my Democratic colleagues, aren't concerned about our 
nation's fiscal situation because they can't acknowledge the 
well documented fiscal dangers of climate havoc, and they won't 
fix our corrupted tax system to require billionaires and mega 
corporations to pay fairer taxes.
    We can at least talk about healthcare delivery system 
reform, as a remedy for our fiscal trajectory. One out of three 
ain't bad. As we've noted at prior hearings, more than $10 
trillion, about 35 percent of our national debt stems from two 
economic shocks to the economy: the 2008 financial crisis, and 
the COVID pandemic.
    As we've heard over and over again at our hearings, the 
economic shocks from climate change may well be worse. I 
suspect that Director Swagel would be the first to agree that 
his 10-year baseline projections are shot if we experience 
another massive shock to the economy.
    Ignoring looming, systemic economic shocks to the economy 
would be imprudent, even dangerous. Prior to the 2008 financial 
crisis, the Committee held no hearings on brewing trouble in 
the mortgage markets, nor did this Committee hold a single 
hearing on the economic risk from global pandemics.
    If this Committee, or any Committee had warned effectively 
of those looming shocks, and Congress had then acted to better 
regulate mortgage markets, to invest in vaccine development, 
and pandemic preparedness, lives would have been saved, and 
trillions in economic harm avoided.
    In the first hearing we held under my Chairmanship, I spoke 
about science as the headlights for humanity. A well run 
Committee can shine the headlights of knowledge, including 
knowledge about climate havoc, into the future, to head off 
dangers lurking there.
    Our national debt is not only the result of those two 
economic shocks, of course. It is also the result of repeated 
rounds of Republican tax cuts that primarily benefited giant 
corporations and very, very wealthy individuals. The Bush and 
Trump tax cuts, skewed to the wealthy and big corporations, 
have added another $10 trillion to the national debt.
    If not for those tax cuts, the debt to Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) ratio, our best fiscal safety metric, would be 
declining in perpetuity. Helping the wealthy avoid taxes is 
such an infatuation that House Republicans even brought the 
United States to the brink of default trying to prevent the IRS 
from cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.
    The third great driver of our fiscal perils is an aging 
population. As our population ages, we spend more on Social 
Security and Medicare. Add in the developed world's most 
inefficient healthcare, and you've got a huge fiscal cost. The 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has found that reforming how 
we pay for healthcare, and increasing participation in 
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), and other value-based 
care enterprises can save money without cutting benefits.
    Indeed, CBO found that actual and projected federal health 
spending over the 2010 to 2033 period was $6.3 trillion, $6.3 
trillion lower than predicted, which I attribute to improving 
quality, and moving to value-based care. I am pleased to be 
working with Ranking Member Grassley, and other Republicans on 
delivery system reform proposals to do more of that.
    Democrats have always pledged to protect and preserve 
Social Security and Medicare. For years Republicans sought to 
cut both programs. Now they say they don't. If so, that is 
wonderful news, and I applaud it. If we all agree that we're 
not cutting Social Security and Medicare, and we all agree that 
their trust funds become cash insolvent in approximately 10 
years, there's only one solution left. Raise new revenues to 
fund Social Security and Medicare.
    We can do this by de-corrupting the tax code, so that big 
corporations and billionaires don't pay less in taxes than 
nurses and firefighters. My Medicare and Social Security Fair 
Share Act will protect Social Security and Medicare forever, or 
at least for as far as actuarial science can see. Imagine if 
American families could erase from their list of worries what 
if Social Security and Medicare won't be there for me?
    What a blessing that would be. For 18 months we've heard a 
steady chorus of Republican voices expressing alarm about debt 
and deficits, and calling for this Committee to focus on its 
``real job''. It's hard to reconcile that with Republicans 
voting for the 2017 reconciliation bill, that cut taxes for the 
wealthy and large corporations and blew a $2 trillion hole in 
the deficit.
    It is hard to reconcile that with Republican plans to 
extend those cuts, and add almost $5 trillion more to the 
deficit. And it's hard to reconcile that with Republican calls 
to spend an extra $6 trillion on defense with no proposed 
offset. And what is the Republican plan for the looming 
insolvencies of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds?
    Make America Great Again (MAGA) Republicans live in a 
fantasy world of a balanced budget, with extended Trump tax 
cuts, and funded Social Security, Medicare, defense and 
veteran's programs. Can't happen. CBO says it's arithmetically 
impossible, even if Republicans cut everything else to zero in 
the entire budget.
    To get real about debt and deficits we have to avert 
climate driven shocks, and persistent climateflation, we have 
to de-corrupt the tax code, so that big corporations and 
billionaires, are no longer a favored, free-riding elite, and 
we have to bring down healthcare costs without cutting benefits 
with common sense delivery system reforms, which is why I focus 
on those things. Senator Grassley.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears in the appendix 
on page 30.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Grassley. Before I read my statement, I want to 
comment on what you said about Social Security and Medicare, 
and I'm not criticizing what you said. I'm going back to this 
comes up why can't you guys do something about saving Social 
Security and Medicare?
    And I'll use history as an example. I always start out by 
saying you know why nothing gets done in Washington, D.C. about 
Medicare and Social Security now? There's no Reagans and Tip 
O'Neill's in this town anymore. Because they found where we're 
going to be in 10 years on these two programs, they were right 
there in 1983, or '84, or whenever it was.
    And they raised taxes. They cut benefits. They changed 
formulas. They probably did a whole lot of other things that I 
don't remember. And they probably thought they were doing 
something for 20 years, I tell my constituents, but they did 
something for 50 years now if we still go to 2033.
    And they did it because they got together and said, you 
know, Social Security was so important we can't let it go 
broke. And they built up a surplus that we're still using of 
trillions and trillions of dollars, and that's going to be 
spent down by 2033, and if we don't do something, Social 
Security is going to be cut.
    It's going to be cut by I guess 23 percent or something. 
So, I guess I'm trying to if there's any comment that I'm 
trying to make to you, it is that they didn't just raise taxes. 
They got together in a program that was bipartisan and passed 
the Senate 90 to 10. I voted for it.
    Well, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for agreeing to my request 
for today's hearing, with Director Swagel. It's been nearly 4 
years since the CBO Director last testified before the Senate 
Budget Committee on the nation's budget outlook. That's far too 
long for what's traditionally been a routine occurrence in the 
Budget Committee, particularly given the budget hole we've dug 
ourselves into.
    Federal Reserve Chairman Powell stated earlier this year 
that it's, ``past time to get back to an adult conversation 
among elected officials, about getting the Federal Government 
back on a sustainable fiscal path.'' Today in the Budget 
Committee that conversation is finally taking place.
    Director Swagel, thank you for coming, and I think you're 
going to tell each of us things that we'd rather not hear, but 
that's part and parcel of having what Powell called, ``an adult 
conversation''. So, in moving beyond the partisan blame game of 
who is most at fault for our fiscal mess, President Biden tried 
to play this game at the recent Presidential debate in an 
attempt to claim the mantel of fiscal responsibility.
    The reality is that President Biden has been dragged 
kicking and screaming to agree to even modest spending 
restraints, as part of last year's Fiscal Responsibility Act. 
The fact is our nation's debt will soon top 35 trillion. Next 
year's interest payments will exceed $1 trillion, and in 10 
years Social Security will go broke, if we don't take 
bipartisan action to save it.
    I shouldn't say go broke, because you're still going to 
have the revenue coming in that will pay 77 percent of what 
benefits are today. CBO has warned Congress for decades that 
we'd face a fiscal reckoning due to ballooning mandatory 
spending. That reckoning is now at our doorstep.
    Absent action, rising debt will leave future generations 
facing higher interest rates, lower incomes, greater inflation, 
and the risk of full-blown fiscal crisis. Avoiding this 
requires a robust discussion of revenue and spending. As I've 
said in previous hearings, I have a record of going after 
genuine tax loopholes, and wasteful carveouts, and I'm open to 
reviewing tax subsidies. Now, a very good place to start is 
with those in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which CBO 
has said actually increases inflation. Ending the law's 
subsidies for luxury Electric Vehicles (EVs), and other 
regressive giveaways that have exploded in cost could net 
hundreds of billions of savings.
    Contrary to claims from the left, taxing the so-called rich 
is no silver bullet to our fiscal outlook. Even confiscating, I 
want to emphasize confiscating, not taxing, all income over $1 
million wouldn't close our $2 trillion deficit. History proves 
that high tax rates fail to raise significant revenue. So, I'm 
repeating something I've said here a couple meetings ago. 
Taxpayers and workers, and investors are smarter than we are in 
the United States Senate, because we've had 93 marginal tax 
rates.
    Then 70 percent marginal tax rates, 50 percent, 30 percent, 
back up to 40 percent, and you can go on and on. But regardless 
of the rate, we've brought in about the same amount of revenue 
as you can see from this chart.\3\ So, we ought to stop to 
think that we Senators are not smarter than the taxpayers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Chart submitted by Senator Grassley appears in the appendix on 
page 32.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Rather than punish success, tax reform should focus on 
incentivizing work, savings, and investment, and that's exactly 
what Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker advised Congress in the 
1980s at a similar time of large deficits and inflation. It was 
a recipe for success then, and it can be a recipe for success 
at this point.
    Most importantly, we must have a frank discussion about 
Washington's spending addiction. Whereas, revenues are in line 
with historical levels, federal spending relative to the size 
of our economy is at heights previously reserved for wars, and 
recessions, and still growing.
    Record spending is driving up unprecedented debt and 
deficits, which fuel more spending in the form of ballooning 
interest payments. Interest costs are rapidly become one of the 
largest line items in the federal budget. Next year, we'll see 
a new record as a share of our economy.
    No single chart can capture the size and scope of our 
fiscal mess, but the closest to it is a depiction of federal 
debt relative to the size of our economy. We're on track to set 
a new record high by 2027, exceeding the World War II era 
record.
    While debt to GDP declined quickly after World War II, 
today our debt is infinitely projected to grow faster than the 
economy, and that's the definition of unsustainable. Yet, 
President Biden continues to use his pen and phone to spend 
trillions, particularly on student loan bailouts, and in these 
unprecedented fiscal times that's the height of recklessness.
    We must stop digging ourselves into an ever deeper budget 
hole, and I think the budget agreement reached between McCarthy 
and Biden a year ago starts us down that track, maybe not as 
aggressively as we should, but it's still a start. We must find 
common fiscal goals that can serve as a catalyst for continuing 
that bipartisan action.
    Can we agree that debt to GDP can't increase forever, 
without consequences? Can we agree to a debt to GDP level that 
we mustn't cross? One last note, this week marks the 50th 
Anniversary of the Congressional Budget Act, which created CBO, 
and the Budget Committee.
    A lot has changed since 1974, from the way Congress 
operates, to the size, the scope of the federal budget. 
Updating the Budget Act for the 21st Century is a shared goal 
worth continuing to work towards. So, once again, thank you, 
Mr. Chairman, for this meeting, and welcome to you, Director 
Swagel.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley.
    Your mention of can we agree to a debt to GDP level 
provokes me to remember my work with Chairman Enzi to find a 
safe debt to GDP level, a glide slope to get there, and 
guardrails to assure that we're not cheating on it, and I think 
that that matrix still remains a smart one.
    Our witness today, to speak about his agency's latest 
economic and budgetary projections is Dr. Phillip Swagel, 
Director of the Congressional Budget Office. Prior to his 
appointment to lead CBO in 2019, Swagel was a member of the 
Council of Economic Advisers during the Bush administration, 
and served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic 
Policy from 2006 to 2009.
    Director Swagel, welcome. Please proceed with your 
statement, your entire testimony will be made a matter of 
record.

  STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE PHILLIP SWAGEL, PH.D., DIRECTOR, 
                CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Prepared statement of Hon. Swagel appears in the appendix on 
page 36.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Director Swagel. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman 
Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley, and members of the 
Committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify about the 
budget and economic outlook. In the projections we released 
last month, the projected deficit grows from nearly $2 trillion 
this year, to $2.8 trillion in 2034.
    Measured in relation to economic output, deficits during 
the coming decades are about 70 percent larger than their 
historical average over the past 50 years. We project the 
deficit this year to equal 7 percent of GDP, with deficits 
projected to remain over 6 percent into the future.
    Such large deficits are historically unusual outside of a 
war, the financial crisis, or the pandemic. Net interest costs 
are a large and growing contributor to the deficit. By the end 
of the 10-year budget window, net interest costs are roughly 
1.5 times larger than either defense or non-defense 
discretionary (NDD) spending.
    Also boosting deficits, are two underlying trends, the 
aging of the population, and growth in federal healthcare costs 
per beneficiary. Those trends both put upward pressure on 
mandatory spending. In relation to economic output, federal 
debt held by the public rises from 99 percent in 2024, to 122 
percent in 2034, and as you both said, that surpasses its 
historical peak.
    From 2024 to 2034, the 10-year budget window, the deficit 
is 11 percent larger than we projected in February, primarily 
because the appropriations enacted in March and April, 
including both the fiscal year 2024 appropriations, and the $95 
billion security supplemental, those get extended out in our 
budget projections by statute.
    The additional funding increases projected discretionary 
spending by $1.3 trillion. But of course, the actual spending 
in the future is up to the decisions of future Congresses. 
Including the added debt service, the legislative changes 
increase deficits by $1.6 trillion through 2034, and all 
changes increase projected deficits by $2.1 trillion.
    In our projections, a larger labor force stemming from the 
surge of immigration that began in 2021, reduces deficits by 
about $900 billion over the 2024 to 2034 period. Revenues are 
about $1.2 trillion greater, than they otherwise would be 
because of higher individual income and payroll taxes paid by 
the larger labor force.
    Outlays would be $278 billion greater, of which $194 
billion is greater spending, mostly for benefit programs, and 
$84 billion is higher interest payments. We estimate that the 
larger labor force from the immigration surge will lead GDP to 
be nearly $9 trillion greater than it would otherwise be.
    Now, these effects of the immigration surge on the federal 
deficit do not include effects on discretionary spending. Those 
effects depend on the decisions that will be made by Congress 
in the future. We're working to provide additional information 
on the potential impacts of the immigration surge on 
discretionary appropriations.
    And the surge in immigration will also effect the budgets 
of state and local governments, and we are currently examining 
those effects, and those are not included in the budget update. 
Let me finish by just going back to the beginning to say that 
the fiscal outlook is daunting.
    The United States faces a budget trajectory with deficits 
of more than 6 percent of GDP into the future. Our projections 
suggest that changes in fiscal policy must be made to mitigate 
adverse consequences of high and rising debt. Let me stop 
there, and I'm happy to take your questions.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much, Director. The CBO 
about 2 months ago released new estimates that project that an 
extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts would add $4.6 trillion to 
the debt over 10 years. Is that correct?
    Director Swagel. Yes, that's correct.
    Chairman Whitehouse. And, does CBO believe that the 
original 2017 Trump tax cuts paid for themselves, and does any 
CBO data support that extension of these tax cuts would pay for 
themselves?
    Director Swagel. No. There was an effect to the tax cuts on 
the economy and back to revenues, but by far it did not pay for 
itself, and the same would apply for the extension of the 2017 
Act.
    Chairman Whitehouse. CBO's long-term budget projections 
back in 2012 were the last time that CBO showed debt declining 
as a share of GDP. Since then Congress has cut taxes numerous 
times, including extending most of the Bush tax cuts, and then 
piling on the 2017 Trump tax cuts.
    Is it a fact, Director Swagel, that projected primary 
spending, that is federal non-interest spending, is now lower 
than it was projected to be in 2012?
    Director Swagel. That's correct, and the interest payments 
have gone up, but as you said the non-interest payments have 
gone down.
    Chairman Whitehouse. So, let me just to put this into 
context, take a look at this graphic here, which shows from 
1994 to 2054, how revenue and spending have worked.\5\ Social 
Security has gone up, and is that consistent with an aging 
population?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Chart submitted by Chairman Whitehouse appears in the appendix 
on page 69.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Director Swagel. That's right. That results from the aging 
population.
    Chairman Whitehouse. And healthcare spending has gone up 
even more. Does that also relate to an aging population?
    Director Swagel. Right. It's both the aging population, and 
rapid growth in health costs.
    Chairman Whitehouse. So, other mandatory spending had a 
huge surge right here. Can you explain what that was? Was that 
COVID?
    Director Swagel. That's COVID, and you know, the spending 
because of you know, the Senate rules, the spending in the 
reconciliation bill, I'm sorry, the COVID spending, and then 
the 2021 reconciliation spending was all mandatory.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Yes. And then here's defense 
discretionary spending, and then this is non-defense 
discretionary spending, which as you can see has been fairly 
constant over all of those years. This is the place where our 
Republican friends want to focus all of their attention related 
to debt and deficits.
    But I think as we can see, even if you zeroed that out, we 
still wouldn't get out of our problems, correct?
    Director Swagel. No. That's correct. That even if 
discretionary spending was entirely eliminated, that wouldn't 
take the deficit to zero.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Great. And then as has been pointed 
out, interest costs are what are going up. That's the biggest 
number. And is it true that tax cuts have an effect on the 
interest obligations of the country?
    Director Swagel. That's right. The rising interest 
payments, as you noted, reflect both higher interest rates, and 
also more debt, and the tax cuts lead to less revenue, which 
mean more debt.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Yep. So, what I've added here, this is 
what our actual revenue has looked like if the Bush tax cuts 
had not been extended back in 2012, here's what our revenue 
would look like. We'd be darn close to operating in an 
effective way. So, you can ascribe an enormous amount of our 
problem to the extension of the Bush tax cuts, according to--
are these numbers correct? Can you vouch for the extension of 
the Bush tax cuts having that much of an effect on revenues?
    Director Swagel. You know, I'd have to look at it. I just I 
haven't, you know, from this distance I can't see it.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Okay.
    Director Swagel. But, certainly the 2012 extension of the 
2001 and 2003 Tax Acts, had an effect on revenues as you've 
said.
    Chairman Whitehouse. A pretty massive effect on debt and on 
deficits because of lost revenues, correct?
    Director Swagel. That's right, yes.
    Chairman Whitehouse. And then one other one I wanted to 
show you. If you look at what's been added to the national 
debt, this is Trump time, $3.6 trillion was added, and that was 
COVID relief, so we can understand that was a little bit of an 
emergency. But $4.8 trillion was non-COVID added to the debt.
    By contrast, there's still $2.1 trillion left under Biden, 
but $2.2 trillion in non-COVID, so does the math add up that 
under Biden the addition to the debt is less than half than 
under Trump?
    Director Swagel. I mean, you know, I would have to look at 
the numbers, but as you said the debt, dollars in debt, and the 
debt ratio went way up, especially during the pandemic, but 
even before that the debt ratio went up.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, you referred to analysis 
claiming to compare Trump and Biden fiscal records. I've 
criticized both Presidents for not doing enough to control 
spending and deficit, but I don't put much stock in a study of 
Biden's fiscal records that leaves out hundreds of billions of 
dollars of unlawful student loan giveaways, or that stubbornly 
assumes Democrat's inflation enhancing Reconciliation Act is 
going to reduce deficits despite all the evidence to the 
contrary.
    I'm glad that your party is willing to at least move away 
from the delusional claim that President Biden's agenda has 
reduced the deficit, even if the $4 trillion that they're now 
pointing to is a serious under estimate of how much Biden has 
added to the deficit.
    Mr. Swagel, as I said earlier, I'm willing to consider 
putting certain tax breaks on the chopping block, if it is part 
of a deal to reign in spending and deficits, but taxes on the 
so-called wealthy alone aren't enough to dig us out of the 
fiscal hole that we're in. Democrat proposals is to tax the 
rich, either barely, make a dent in the deficit, or they're 
designed to sneakily tax a lot more than just the rich.
    So, my question, has CBO analyzed any legislation, or 
determined it would put the debt on a sustainable course just 
by increasing taxes on those at the top 1 percent?
    Director Swagel. No. CBO has not analyzed any legislation 
that would do that.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. If you were to stabilize the debt 
solely by increasing the tax rate on incomes above $400,000, 
how high would the rate have to be?
    Director Swagel. You know, we haven't done the analysis of 
how high, but it would have to be a substantial increase on 
such a narrow base.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. And wouldn't the tax rate required 
have significant behavioral effect, and serious negative 
consequences for the economy?
    Director Swagel. Yes. You know, a much higher tax rate like 
that would have macroeconomic feedback that would effect growth 
and job creation.
    Senator Grassley. Recently the Wall Street Journal 
published an essay discussing historical examples of fiscal 
mismanaging contributing to the downfall of once great powers 
throughout history. The Historian Niall Ferguson noted how the 
general rule of history has been that, and I quote him, ``any 
great power that spends more on debt service than on defense, 
will not stay great for a long time, a very long time.''
    According to CBO, we just crossed this fiscal Rubicon, the 
U.S. will spend more on interest than on defense this year, and 
every year onward. In your view, do rising debt service costs 
pose a threat to economic stability, and what is historical 
lessons can you inform our current fiscal situation?
    Director Swagel. Yes, they do. And in a sense, that's the 
near-term fiscal risk, is the rising interest payments. That 
you know, again, it's both higher interest rates, and more 
debt, leading to those higher interest payments, and that 
affects all the other choices that U.S. policymakers want.
    If you want more spending on something, or tax relief on 
something, the rising interest payments crowd that out, and 
then have effects on the private economy, that there's less, 
you know, fewer resources available for the private sector, 
less private investment and job creation and so on.
    Senator Grassley. The Constitution gives the power of the 
purse to Congress, but the current administration has rules, 
regulations and other executive actions to make major policy 
changes with unprecedented consequences for the federal budget, 
and all of this without a single vote of Congress.
    How have executive actions changed CBO's budget projections 
since the agency's February 2021 baseline?
    Director Swagel. Yes, sir. So, we track those, and those go 
into the baseline. I'll list a couple of the largest ones. The 
executive actions, and you mentioned student loans, that's a 
total of about $560 billion, so more than $0.5 trillion, in 
additional outlays so far.
    And then there's more court cases, and more announcements, 
so that's as of say 2 weeks ago. So, that's one. The second is 
the Thrifty Food Plan that redefined the basket used in the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Program. That, 
along with higher food prices, led to about $200 to $250 
billion of higher costs.
    There are Medicaid executive actions to streamline 
enrollment, that was about $164 billion. There are others.
    The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Tailpipe Rule 
will have costs as well, since that interacts with the 
provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that subsidize 
electric vehicles (EVs).
    And the Tailpipe Rule will push consumers toward EVs.
    There's Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations, addressing 
the so-called family glitch, extending subsidies to Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, and more. I 
should mention that some of the administration's actions have 
reduced the deficit. They had a rule that changed the payments 
to Medicare Advantage plans, and that reduced the deficit.
    So, it's a bit of both, but as you've said, it's mainly on 
the outlay side.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Murray, Distinguished Chairman 
of Appropriations.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Thank you, Chair Whitehouse. I really 
appreciate you holding this hearing. Director Swagel, good to 
see you again. Thank you to you and all your staff at CBO for 
the critical work you do for our Congress. You know, Mr. 
Chairman, my dad actually ran a five and dime store, you nodded 
and just gave away your age, but he ran a five and dime store. 
And my mom worked as a bookkeeper when we were growing up.
    But you know, you don't have to run a cash register, or be 
an accountant to understand the really basic fact that when it 
comes to our national budget, spending is just half of the 
equation. There is also revenue. And I mention this because 
when our Republican colleagues talk about debt and deficits, 
they tend to discuss only that one side of the ledger, which is 
spending.
    So, I want to focus on something that goes overlooked, or 
rather goes unsaid by my Republican colleagues. Because while 
they love to talk about reigning in spending, as the Chairman 
just talked about, which in my mind actually means the 
investments that we make for families and working people, I 
don't hear the same concern regarding the huge tax breaks that 
go to mostly billionaires.
    We need to get one thing clear, despite all the bogeymen 
that Republicans like to point to, to driving the national 
debt, the reality is that the single biggest driver of our 
national debt since 2001 has been Republican tax cuts. The 
Trump and Bush tax cuts have cost our nation over $10 trillion 
and counting.
    And what do Republicans want to do if they return to power? 
What's at the top of the Trump economic agenda? Do they want to 
solve the childcare crisis? Do they want to extend healthcare 
credits that are saving millions of families thousands of 
dollars? Of course not.
    They want more tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy and biggest 
corporations. Republicans' big economic vision is to extend 
their horribly one-sided Trump tax cuts. If Republicans are so 
concerned about the national debt, why is it that every time 
they get the chance they start giving away cash, and writing 
tax loopholes for mega corporations?
    So, we've got to get real. There's no reason that investors 
on Wall Street should pay less in taxes than a firefighter in 
Spokane, Washington, or a nurse in Seattle, or that companies 
making billions in profits should pay less than mom and pop 
shops in Washington State.
    And there's every reason for us to ask the wealthiest 
people in our country to pay their fair share, so we can make 
this country stronger for everyone. So, for parents back in 
Washington State, for working families, they don't want us to 
invest in the richest people in the world, they want us to 
invest in our roads, and schools, and healthcare and security, 
and ending the childcare crisis, things that actually make 
their lives better.
    You have to be kind of out of touch to miss that. That is, 
for my colleagues to know, why Vice Chair Collins and I have 
both worked together to reach a bipartisan agreement to 
increase both defense and non-defense discretionary funding as 
part of our Fiscal Year (FY) '25 appropriations process, so we 
can invest in our security, and in our working families, and 
our communities, not just to throw money away at billionaires.
    Now, Director, I have talked at length about the hardship 
and pain capping non-defense discretionary spending puts on 
Americans, yet Republicans only insist on those caps. They also 
put outside focus on the spending as it relates to the deficit.
    Current NDD spending as a percentage of GDP has declined 
from the long-term average, and NDD spending accounts for less 
than a single percent of the increase in spending since the 
start of the pandemic in 2019, which are the spending levels 
Republicans want us to return to.
    Director Swagel, beyond emergency pandemic spending, what 
are the significant drivers behind our country's deficit over 
the last decade?
    Director Swagel. Yeah. It's, I would point to three things. 
You know, one is rising interest payments. Two is rising 
healthcare costs, and then three is rising spending on other 
benefit programs, Social Security is the largest of them. And 
so, it's the aging of the population, it's healthcare cost 
growth, and it's interest costs.
    Senator Murray. And revenue?
    Director Swagel. And revenue has not kept up, and you can 
see that in the charts put up by both the Chair and the Ranking 
Member, that legislation action has made it so that, you know, 
rather than rising, revenue as a share of GDP has remained 
flat. So, as spending has gone up, revenue has not kept up.
    Senator Murray. Okay. And there was one legislative change 
since your last projection in February, the effective revenue. 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rescission. According to 
your report, these rescissions accounted for a $32 billion 
reduction in projected revenue. The IRS and Treasury project 
six-fold returns for every dollar spent on tax informant.
    Yet we continue to hear from our Republican friends that we 
should target IRS funding as part of the increasing deficit. 
So, last question, how does the rescinding funds provided to 
the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act, impact revenue and 
deficits?
    Director Swagel. So, in our calculations, $1 that goes to 
the IRS results in an additional $2 of revenue, so for a net of 
one. So the rescissions on net increase the deficit.
    Senator Murray. Thank you, appreciate that.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Marshall is up now. Senator 
Padilla has to go and preside, so I think with Senator Lujan's 
permission, we will reverse, so the order will be Marshall 
Padilla, the next Republican, and then Senator Lujan.
    Senator Marshall. I'm happy to yield to Senator Padilla if 
he needs to scoot.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Do you want to go ahead, Alex? Don't 
worry, you'll be next. That's kind of you, thank you.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR PADILLA

    Senator Padilla. Thank you both for your accommodation, and 
your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for this opportunity. 
Mr. Director, how are you this morning?
    Director Swagel. Yeah, thank you, very well.
    Senator Padilla. Good. Thank you for being here. I'm 
pleased to have this opportunity to talk to you about a subject 
that I've been familiar with for a long, long time, and I'm 
speaking specifically to the dynamic of immigration, and its 
impact on our economy.
    Coming from the state of California, not just the most 
populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the 
nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, 
and it has the largest economy of any state in the nation, as 
well. So, we know full well that immigration, the contributions 
of immigrants, is critical to the economy, and critical to the 
growth of the United States.
    And now, thanks to the hard work of the CBO, you've all 
crunched the numbers, and now project that U.S. revenue will be 
$1.2 trillion higher over the next 10 years because of the 
impact of migrants, and migrants in the workforce, as you see 
it today.
    And I would imagine that given my Republican colleagues' 
obsession with our debt, that they would welcome the news that 
CBO also found that this increased immigration, migrants, and 
their impact on the workforce, leads to lower deficits. So, it 
seems like it's something that we ought to embrace.
    So, would you please speak to how the CBO was able to 
quantify the economic benefits of immigration, and what the 
impact would be on revenues to the federal treasury if more 
than 10 million undocumented immigrants, many of the workforce, 
were to be deported?
    Director Swagel. Ah, yes. So, we haven't analyzed the 
deportation, but there's a sense in which it would be the 
opposite of the immigration increase that you mentioned, and so 
we said there's about a $9 trillion increase in GDP from the 
immigrants coming in, they add to the labor force, they pay 
taxes, they, you know, they fill jobs.
    And the deportation would in some instances reverse that, 
that there would be a big negative hit to GDP, the labor force 
would shrink, and revenue would go down.
    Senator Padilla. That seems pretty logical to me, so thank 
you for that. I know you're from the CBO, not the Department of 
Labor, but I also think if we look at the data that is out 
there, even with the level of migration we've seen in the 
course of the last decade, we are experiencing record, 
sustained low levels of unemployment.
    And wages continue to rise. So, for those concerned, those 
who spread the false rhetoric that immigrants are taking 
American jobs, or they're a downward force on wages, that has 
proven to be false. Do you have any data that would suggest 
otherwise?
    Director Swagel. That's right. There's a sense in which the 
immigration surge explains how our economy continued to grow 
rapidly, and create jobs, even when the labor market say, 2 
years ago, looked to be tight. It's the added--the immigrants 
adding to the labor force, these are additional jobs and 
additional income.
    Senator Padilla. All right. So, I also want to ask about a 
related dynamic that is a priority concern for this Committee. 
We've--I see Senator Braun has joined us, and he's always one 
of the first, if not the first, to raise concerns about the 
debt. We're talking about the contributions of immigrants to 
the workforce, and to the economy, and the net benefit that 
there's been on revenues, debt reduction, et cetera.
    But we're also speaking in this Committee regularly about 
the solvency of our social safety net programs, particularly 
Social Security and Medicare. Between 2010 and 2020, the U.S. 
saw its lowest population growth of any decade since the 1930s, 
and it presents a huge challenge to the social safety net 
programs that rely on current workers to fund the benefits for 
America's retirees.
    And we know that immigrants help sustain the programs like 
Social Security and Medicare, even though they don't benefit 
from those programs themselves. In 2022 alone, immigrants paid 
over $570 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, so would 
you please discuss the impact on the solvency of our social 
safety net programs if due to potential change in our 
immigration policies, that we would realize a significant 
reduction in our workforce?
    Director Swagel. Yeah. And so, we looked carefully at the 
composition of the immigration surge, and they're very heavily 
skewed toward working age adults. These are immigrants that 
have a high propensity to work, and they have a strong 
incentive to work on the books once they receive authorization, 
generally within 6 months.
    You know, many of them will face, you know, a hearing in 7 
to 10 years, and working on the books will let them demonstrate 
attachment. So, all of that means more revenue for Social 
Security, it increases the financial--improves the financial 
situation of the Social Security system, and yeah, then that's 
again it's just like the overall revenue, some of it goes to 
Social Security.
    Senator Padilla. Okay. Couldn't have said it better myself. 
Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Marshall, for your 
courtesy to Senator Padilla. It is now your floor.

                 STATEMENT OF SENATOR MARSHALL

    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome Dr. 
Swagel. If there's one thing clear from this meeting it's that 
my friends across the aisle have promised that they will raise 
your taxes. That that is their solution to everything is to 
raise your taxes.
    Folks, we don't have a taxing problem in this government, 
we have a spending problem. The Trump tax cuts demonstrated 
that if you lower taxes, it grows the economy and increases the 
tax revenue. It's a rising tide, raising all boats. I think 
it's quite evident. No one could argue that. It's unarguable.
    But what's not arguable is that indeed that these tax cuts 
indeed have worked in the past. Dr. Swagel, let me ask you, do 
you ever review your work in the past? Do you go back and look 
at the last 10 years and say what percentage were we off on our 
scores?
    Director Swagel. We do. We go back for major legislation, 
and analyze what, in terms of what we got right, and what we 
got wrong.
    Senator Marshall. Over the last 10 years what does your 
score sheet look like in speaking in general?
    Director Swagel. So, we compare ourselves to other major 
forecasters, and we do pretty well. There's somethings that 
we've----
    Senator Marshall. No. You don't do well. You just missed 
the deficit this year by $0.5 trillion. That's not doing well. 
I just--I mean don't you think you're off 10, 20, 30, 40 
percent on most of the big numbers?
    Director Swagel. Right. So, from February to June the 
deficit went up by 27 percent, mainly because of actions taken 
by the administration. And so, the student loans, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), actions on Medicaid, that 
we're providing you with the current law----
    Senator Marshall. So, through executive fiat they added 
goodness, 3 or 4, oh goodness, I guess it's about $1 trillion.
    Director Swagel. That's right. Between student loans and 
the other pieces, there's several hundred billion dollars.
    Senator Marshall. Would you have the ability to score, if 
we did our job, if we followed the Budget Act of 1974, and all 
the additions where the President submitted a budget on time. 
If we did a meaningful bipartisan budget resolution, and we 
went back to regular order, and the House did their job, if we 
did a real budget, would that have impact on how much money we 
spend, and is that something you could help generate a CBO 
score for?
    Director Swagel. I mean we would certainly support the 
Congress in doing that. It's hard to say what the outcome would 
be, you know, of regular order, would certainly be a change, 
but I can't tell you, you know, what the fiscal outcome would 
be.
    Senator Marshall. It's certainly works in the private 
sector to do a meaningful budget, and then use that as a 
blueprint, and not allow an administration to tack on, like you 
just mentioned, almost $1 trillion of unsuspected spending 
through executive fiat, and which is unconstitutional the way 
they did it.
    As we've mentioned before, the 2024 budget deficit is going 
to be $2 trillion. We're going to spent 2 trillion more than we 
take in this year. The administration added $2.1 trillion with 
the American Rescue Plan, another $800 billion with the 
Inflation Simulation Act.
    People call it the Inflation Reduction Act because it's 
actually inflationary, as well as over another trillion 
unilaterally as you mentioned through executive actions. The 
student loans $400 billion. They redefined the thrifty plan 
with another $300 billion, and then they did some voodoo with 
the ACA, and another $300 billion as well. I want to talk about 
SNAP for a second. We're in the middle of trying to write a 
farm bill, and I'm concerned about the politics at play in 
scoring a piece of legislation that's extremely important to 
everybody.
    You know, a farm bill, 85 percent of farm bill is SNAP 
payments, nutritional programs. The largest part of the farm 
bill also has the highest fraud rate in the error rate. There 
has been an annual repayment rate of 10 percent. Stopping the 
error rates, stopping the fraud, stopping the overpayments that 
result in nearly $100 billion in savings to the SNAP program 
over the next 10 years.
    So, if we get rid of the fraud and the abuse and errors, it 
would save $100 billion over 10 years. Do you believe that 
fixing the error rate in SNAP would be a cut to the program?
    Director Swagel. It would make sure that the beneficiaries 
who are supposed to get the benefits are getting them, and you 
know, not other people.
    Senator Marshall. Okay. The bipartisan Farm Bill was passed 
out of the House Ag Committee, has a provision in the nutrition 
title which preserves SNAP benefits, and ensures that benefits 
can modestly increase with the cost of living. Now, my friends 
across the aisle instead are calling these provisions the 
largest cut to SNAP in history. In your opinion, do you 
consider this a cut?
    Director Swagel. So, you know, after we saw what the 
administration did with changes to the Thrifty Food Plan, we 
then had to assume that in the future there could be such large 
increases again, and I said before that was about 200 to $250 
billion of additional costs. And so that gets built into the 
baseline. What the House has done is scale that back, and so 
there's a sense in which they're preventing a future 
administration from doing the kind of increase that we've done.
    Senator Marshall. But net at the end of the day, we're 
going to be spending more money on SNAP in the future than we 
are today?
    Director Swagel. That's correct, yeah.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you again for your courtesy, 
Senator Marshall, and thank you Senator Lujan for your courtesy 
to your colleague. You are recognized.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR LUJAN

    Senator Lujan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Director, 
the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), this program 
was created to provide compensation and justice to those 
Americans who suffered devastating health impacts of nuclear 
weapon development and testing.
    Despite being treated 34 years ago, people in states like 
New Mexico, which is where the first nuclear bomb was tested 
without warning to people in these communities were left out of 
the program.
    Even the author of this legislation, may he rest in peace, 
the former Senator from Utah, Warren Hatch, he referenced this 
before he passed away about the mistakes that were made in this 
legislation, and how New Mexico is one of those mistakes not 
being included, not including post 1971 workers, which are 
uranium mine workers that worked in the mines after 1971, side 
by side with people that qualified for the program doing the 
same jobs.
    These Americans, many of whom were the unwilling and 
unknowing victims of radiation exposure have waited too long 
for justice. The Senate has now passed my bill to strengthen 
RECA with Senator Crapo and Senator Hawley twice, but we have 
yet to get a full analysis of the impact of the program.
    Meanwhile, the House has refused to act. As a result, the 
clock ticks on, and Americans continue to wait, from those from 
New Mexico to Utah, to Idaho, and many other states have fought 
cancer, too many have died, and watched family die alone, being 
ignored, all without recognition from the government that made 
them sick.
    Now, Dr. Swagel, as you worked to get that full score, I 
would like you or your analysts, and preferably all of us to 
get together in a room to meet with me and my staff, walk me 
through the state by state breakdown of who would benefit from 
this improved RECA program. Will you commit to securing that 
meeting?
    Director Swagel. Yes, sir. Because of the path that the 
legislation took to the Senate floor, as you said, you didn't 
get a full cost estimate from CBO. We've given some rough 
guidance on the cost, but you have my commitment that we'll 
come to you, and take you through the estimate. You know, a 
challenge for us is the state by state part, just because we're 
set up to do federal costs.
    And so, instead of just analyzing one state at a time is a 
challenge, but we will come and do as much as we can to make 
sure you get the information you need.
    Senator Lujan. Have you done state by state analysis 
before?
    Director Swagel. You know, not of the RECA program. We have 
of some programs, but not of this one.
    Senator Lujan. Doctor Swagel, have you conducted analysis 
for Wyoming?
    Director Swagel. For, I'm sorry, say it again?
    Senator Lujan. The state of Wyoming as it pertains to RECA?
    Director Swagel. Oh, no we haven't.
    Senator Lujan. Yes, the CBO has, and have you done it for 
New Mexico?
    Director Swagel. Not separately.
    Senator Lujan. So, I've been told because the mistake that 
was made by CBO with the initial--I wasn't planning on getting 
into this, but if I'm going to--if there's going to be 
something included in the record as to what the capabilities 
are or are not, Wyoming and New Mexico had to be reviewed 
because there was a mistake of including analysis of Wyoming, 
when Wyoming was not included in the original bill, and New 
Mexico was.
    And so CBO had to look at that initially from its initial 
score to where we are. The score the CBO came out with, with 
the initial draft was $160 billion, $150 billion. This program 
was started back in 1990. It's cost us a lot of money, $2.2 
billion.
    It's hard for me to understand without seeing disaggregated 
data how the program grows exponentially from 2.2 over a 30 
year period to 75 percent higher, so I think it's important for 
us to get there. I think the other offices would also be very 
interested in presenting the facts to the Congress, to my 
colleagues, to the American people about what this is, and what 
this is not.
    I very much appreciate what the Ranking Member shared about 
Tip O'Neill and President Reagan. That was a time when people 
in this town could still stipulate the facts, and they would 
negotiate, but they could stipulate to facts, what the receipts 
were.
    And I just want to make sure that we have the correct 
receipts in this place, so that we can have an honest 
conversation about the policy, and get help to a whole bunch of 
people across America who this country owes a liability to, 
owes an apology to, and quite honestly, cost them their lives 
in many instances, and the cancer that they're still going 
through today, so I very much look forward to that.
    And Mr. Chairman, I have other questions. I'm going to 
submit them into the record to be respectful of my colleagues 
today as well, but very much appreciate the agreement to be 
able to secure a meeting, and have a thorough conversation 
about this package, this legislation for myself, and there may 
be other offices that want to be included, so thank you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Lujan, and if we 
can help facilitate that meeting, don't hesitate to ask. 
Senator Braun.

                   STATEMENT OF SENATOR BRAUN

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
having the discussion on budget here today. Dr. Swagel, you and 
I have had many conversations since I've been here 5.5 years 
ago, and I look at your basic one pager here, and some things 
stand out to me, and that is how stubborn revenue generation 
has been.
    You compile statistics that show that revenues from '94 to 
'23 have averaged 17.2 percent of GDP, correct?
    Director Swagel. That's right.
    Senator Braun. And actually, in '23 and '24, '23 was lower, 
'24 is going to be slightly higher, but when you look at the 
stubbornness of that figure, and the fact that even in your own 
projections, you see it staying flat generally around 18 
percent, is that what you've got here in terms of basing long-
term forecasts on?
    Director Swagel. That's right, and '23 was lower because 
there was some revenue that got pushed from '23 into '24, the 
disaster declarations, especially in California, for example. 
The corporate minimum tax wasn't implemented, so that's why '23 
is a bit lower, but as you said it's----
    Senator Braun. But it's been a stubborn range of between 
17.5 and 18.5?
    Director Swagel. And 18, that's right, yes.
    Senator Braun. And most of the 18.5 is projections into the 
future, so I want to then go to outlays. And for nearly 30 
years those were average around 21 percent of GDP, and those 
culminated in recent years in the trillion dollar structural 
deficits. Is that correct, give or take?
    Director Swagel. That's right.
    Senator Braun. Yes.
    Director Swagel. Especially on the mandatory side.
    Senator Braun. And now that has doubled to about $2 
trillion, give or take, in the present?
    Director Swagel. That's right.
    Senator Braun. So it gets bleaker as you make projections 
into the future, and revenue has been stubbornly consistent 
regardless of tax rate. Is that correct?
    Director Swagel. That's right. And you know, there has been 
legislative changes as revenues have gone up that have taken 
them back down, so there is some legislation there.
    Senator Braun. But generally that would mean once you cut 
taxes you're depriving the treasury in the short run. You might 
get a little better economic growth generally as you go into 
years two, three and four. And the reverse is true, you know, 
when you raise taxes, correct?
    Director Swagel. That's right.
    Senator Braun. You're going to flush a little more into the 
treasury, and then economic growth is going to go down a little 
bit each year.
    Director Swagel. Yeah, yeah.
    Senator Braun. The fundamentals that basically drive our 
economy and our government generally?
    Director Swagel. That's essentially what we've got in our--
as well.
    Senator Braun. So, what you've got here looking at 2024, 
the snapshot of where we are currently, and you see that 
revenue is budging at most 1 point as a percentage of GDP, and 
you're taking spending up by 4 additional percentage points, 
correct? From '23, which is 23.1 to 27.3?
    Director Swagel. I'm sorry, I just wanted to make sure, 
23.1.
    Senator Braun. In '24 is what you're forecasting will be up 
on the outlay line?
    Director Swagel. I'm sorry. I wonder, you--I'm sorry since 
I'm----
    Senator Braun. I'm talking about outlays.
    Director Swagel. Yeah.
    Senator Braun. Outlays on the chart you gave me.
    Director Swagel. Yeah, 24.2 for 2024.
    Senator Braun. Yeah. And then what are you showing in 2054?
    Director Swagel. I'm sorry. I gave you--I'm sorry, I gave 
you our long-term outlook.
    Senator Braun. Yes.
    Director Swagel. And I have our short-term outlook as well.
    Senator Braun. Well, okay.
    Director Swagel. But you've got the numbers right. Yeah.
    Senator Braun. Yeah. So, in your opinion, how do we get 
things right sized? Can we do it through revenue when history 
has shown we've never been able to, and the cutting taxes 
started back many, many years ago without adjusting spending.
    And to me, it looks like the data is all there, that if we 
don't want to keep borrowing from our kids and grandkids, that 
we've got to choose and prioritize what we're spending here 
that's going to match up with what revenues have shown that we 
can generate over a long period of time. Do you agree with 
that?
    Director Swagel. Right. I mean that is the choice in front 
of policy makers, that revenues and outlays at some point have 
to come closer together. That can be done, as you said, on the 
outlay side. In principle, it could be done on the revenue side 
if you know, it's up the Congress, you give high rates.
    Senator Braun. And you always say that because yours is not 
advise on policy, it's just to tell us the figures.
    Director Swagel. The figures. That's right.
    Senator Braun. And the figures are bleak.
    Director Swagel. It is a daunting situation, rising debt.
    Senator Braun. Okay. We'll settle for daunting. And then I 
want to circle back to what the Chair said earlier. Shocks to 
our economy, which we had to navigate through in '08-'09, that 
was trivial dollarwise compared to what we spent recently on 
COVID. Maybe you can't measure the two, but that was roughly 
measured around a trillion.
    What we did was over $4 trillion, and then enterprise over 
the first 2 years of the Biden administration to add another 
roughly $4 trillion, so we're in a place where this to me looks 
like we end up with something like a Chapter 11 in the real 
world, which means sooner or later you've got to get our 
spending in line with our revenue.
    I mentioned that coming in to this hearing, a lady working 
here in the Capitol, carrying a box of files laughed out loud 
when I said that, and it was in agreement, and I think that's 
what the American public is doing. One final thing, because I 
don't see anybody else here, so I'd like to have a little 
latitude.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Go for it.
    Senator Braun. I spent so much time on it, healthcare is 
the place that we can within our own means, take a broken 
industry and system, that has no consumer involvement within 
it, no emphasis on prevention and wellness, and it's run by a 
very corporate system of healthcare that's even frustrating 
doctors and nurses to become a part of it, and that is doable.
    And unless we want government to even do more, I would ask 
that the healthcare industry embraces things like competition, 
transparency, engages every American in their own wellbeing, so 
that you don't need to use the system as much, because it is 
approaching 20 percent of our GDP, and in most other developed 
countries it's 10 to 13 percent.
    Would your opinion be that that would be the lowest hanging 
fruit of where if we put policies into place that it can 
actually weigh in on our current, chronic big deficit?
    Director Swagel. Yeah. I'm going to switch metaphors. It's 
where the dollars are. It's the rising spending, and you could 
see that in the Chairman's chart at the beginning that 
healthcare spending is rising quickly. And you know, the good 
and the bad is that there's so many distortions in healthcare 
as you said.
    It's hard to get at them, but there's so many dollars that 
even if you make kind of modest progress in percentage terms, 
the dollar change could be quite lofty.
    Senator Braun. So, thanks for the latitude on time, thanks 
for your answers. In summary, we've got to spend less than we 
take in. History shows that revenue is stubborn. History also 
shows that we used to have healthcare as a percentage of our 
GDP, closer to 10 percent, not too many decades ago, and the 
rest of the world has figured out how to do that at better 
value. We need to start doing a few things that most Americans 
believe should be done, don't spend more than you take in, and 
if something is out of line in terms of cost, reform it.
    Thank you for being here today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Senator Braun. I 
believe we're waiting on one more colleague, so I'll take just 
an additional moment while we give him a chance to walk from 
his other hearing to this one, and point out that at least in 
our view, the net effect of the 2008 mortgage meltdown, and the 
recession that followed, ran around $5 trillion.
    And the bulk of the effect was not spending, but was lost 
revenue because of the shock to the economy. People simply 
weren't paying taxes because they weren't making money because 
the economy collapsed. Is that a pretty fair overview of how 
the 2008 mortgage meltdown hit the economy? Am I roughly in the 
right neighborhood with the numbers?
    Director Swagel. Yes. Yeah, that's right. It had a big 
negative impact on activity, and then from there to revenue. 
And there was a legislative response, the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP), you know a lot of that money came back as the 
assets that were purchased by the Treasury were sold back to 
the private sector.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Yeah. And while as you pointed out in 
your exchange with Senator Braun, the growth in healthcare 
spending has been one of the primary drivers on the spending 
side. We do have the comparison with CBO's 2008 projections for 
where that spending would be, and where it actually went, and 
it's $6.3 trillion lower than projected over that intervening 
time period.
    So, while that number has gone up--never mind, so while 
that healthcare spending number has gone up, something happened 
to keep it from going way more up, and thank you, Doctor, for 
your work trying to parse through the data to figure out 
exactly what it was that helped us save those $6.3 trillion 
without cutting benefits, because if we can do more of that, 
that would be a very, very good thing.
    Senator Van Hollen, are you ready to roll?
    Senator Van Hollen. I'm ready to roll.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Great. You're up then, followed by 
Senator Kennedy.

                STATEMENT OF SENATOR VAN HOLLEN

    Senator Van Hollen. All right. Well, thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, thank you, Director Swagel. It's good to see you 
again. Let me just start on the revenue side because I'm 
looking at the CBO projections, and I see that, you know, a 
number of months ago you had projected that the Trump tax cuts 
would add--well, this is back during that time, $4.6 trillion 
to the debt over the next 10 years.
    I understand you had an earlier exchange with the Chairman, 
the Trump tax cut did not pay for themselves despite claims, 
right?
    Director Swagel. That's correct. That's what we----
    Senator Van Hollen. And your projection is that if we just 
did a straight extension of the tax cuts, those would not pay 
for themselves either, would they?
    Director Swagel. No, they wouldn't.
    Senator Van Hollen. Okay. So, one of the arguments that was 
made at the time was that the trickle down economics was going 
to work, right? I'm looking at projections that were made by 
the Trump economic team. They predicted that that tax plan 
would generate 4 to 6 percent growth in GDP.
    But then I'm looking at the seven quarters that succeeded 
that, and so this is data before the COVID pandemic hit. And 
I'm seeing that growth actually during that period of time was 
not appreciably different than the growth during the prior 
seven quarters.
    There was a small bump in Q2 of 2018 to 3.5 percent, but 
that was the same as Q4 of 2017, before enactment of the Trump 
tax cuts. So, this whole theory of trickle down economics was 
behind the claims that the tax cuts were going to pay for 
themselves, right?
    Director Swagel. That would be the way that in principle a 
tax could pay for itself if it generates so much additional 
output that that comes back as revenue. And you know, the 
analysis CBO did in 2018 was that there would be some impact. 
There would be some impact on business investment, and then 
some additional revenue. It was about an 18 percent fiscal 
feedback, so something, and the challenge was that, as you 
said, we saw a little bit of a, you know, higher growth early 
in 2018.
    And then in the middle of 2018 tariffs were raised, and 
those looked to have affected business investment. And so, in 
some sense, even before the pandemic, you know, if there were 
macro effects of the tax cut, those got in some instances, you 
know, offset or hidden by the, you know, by----
    Senator Van Hollen. And look, I looked at the CBO analysis 
and I saw some of the feedback loop, and I think you attribute 
this primarily to some of the corporate tax cuts, but let me 
ask you on the individual side, the claims that, you know, big 
tax, personal tax cuts for wealthy people is going to generate 
something like in the range of 4.6 percent. I mean that was 
just ridiculous, right?
    Director Swagel. The CBO didn't have that--those kind of 
figures.
    Senator Van Hollen. You're being diplomatic, but so, and of 
course, claims going forward that continuing the Trump tax cuts 
would pay for themselves, as you said is absurd. I will point 
out that if you look at the analyses that were done by the Tax 
Policy Center, they point out that extending the Trump tax cuts 
would provide more than twice the benefit for the top 1 
percent, then for the entire--the bottom 60 percent as a 
percentage to their income, in real dollars that translates to 
an average $48,000 tax cut for households in the top 1 percent, 
about $500 for those in the bottom 60 percent.
    So, it makes no sense to add even more to our deficits to 
disproportionately benefit those at the very top. I will point 
out that President Biden has committed to making sure that any 
tax benefits that apply to people, $400,000 and under, will be 
maintained, but it does seem a total--a stupid and backwards 
policy to extend those that provided big breaks to the wealthy, 
that did not have the so-called trickle down growth benefit, 
but did add to the deficit.
    In my remaining time, I'd just like to ask you about the 
recent cuts to the IRS. As you know, as part of the budget deal 
the last year there was a $20 billion clawback. What is your 
best estimate of how much that will add to the deficit over 
time?
    Director Swagel. So, our calculations of that $1 of 
additional resources to the IRS generates about $2 of revenue, 
so a net of 1, so you know, the rescission of funding to the 
IRS, that's why it increased the deficit in our projections.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right.
    Director Swagel. So roughly, you know 2 to 1.
    Senator Van Hollen. So, it was a $20 billion cut, so your 
estimate is that what, it will lose $40 billion?
    Director Swagel. About $40 billion.
    Senator Van Hollen. In income, yeah. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. Senator 
Kennedy of the Great State of Louisiana.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR KENNEDY

    Senator  Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Director, 
welcome. Mr. Director, what's the national debt right now?
    Director Swagel. Well, it's--we project at the end of this 
year it is going to be over $28.1 trillion.
    Senator  Kennedy. $28 trillion. What percentage of GDP is 
that?
    Director Swagel. It's just under 100 percent.
    Senator  Kennedy. Could you speak into the mic, and repeat 
that?
    Director Swagel. Yeah. It's just under 100 percent of GDP.
    Senator  Kennedy. And for this current fiscal year will we 
have spending deficits?
    Director Swagel. Yes, sir. We're looking at about a $2 
trillion deficit this year.
    Senator  Kennedy. And that means we've spent $2 trillion 
more than we took in, right?
    Director Swagel. That's right.
    Senator  Kennedy. So, we had to borrow money, right?
    Director Swagel. That's right. The debt is going up.
    Senator  Kennedy. And so that money that we borrowed 
increases the amount of national debt doesn't it?
    Director Swagel. That's right, and it means more interest 
payments, which then goes back and means more debt, so there's 
a negative cycle attached to it.
    Senator  Kennedy. Okay. So, our current national debt is 
over 100 percent of our economy, that's $28 trillion. Let's 
suppose that we think in 10-year windows, as you know. Let's 
suppose nothing changes over the next 10 years, nothing. We 
don't renew the tax cuts, nothing changes. What's the debt 
going to be 10 years from now?
    Director Swagel. All right. So our projection is then over 
$50 trillion, or over 122 percent of GDP.
    Senator  Kennedy. Well, damn looks to me like we better do 
something. I mean will you sit here and debate the tax cuts, 
and you talk about the tax cuts don't work. I don't know how 
you know that because the pandemic skewed all economic results. 
But we better do something. Do you think we can sustain the 
spending?
    Director Swagel. No. The risks are mounting with higher 
interest payments, and higher debt, and that's as you said, 
that's why action must be taken.
    Senator  Kennedy. So what should we do?
    Director Swagel. It's, you know, the sooner Congress acts, 
the easier it will be.
    Senator  Kennedy. I get that, so what should we do?
    Director Swagel. You know, I'm here to support you, but not 
to tell you what to do. I mean reduce the deficit. You have 
choices. You can look at mandatory spending on the spending 
side as the driver. You have healthcare costs and Social 
Security. On the revenue side----
    Senator  Kennedy. Well, let me stop you for a second. 
Everybody always says that. Mandatory spending is driving the 
cost, but and so we've got to do something because of Social 
Security trust fund is going to run out, and Social Security is 
going to be automatically cut.
    Look me in the eye and tell me you really think the United 
States Congress is going to allow Social Security to be cut?
    Director Swagel. I would expect some action to be taken 
before that happens.
    Senator  Kennedy. Yeah. I mean if you think the United 
States Congress is going to sit here and allow Social Security 
to be cut, even if there's not a penny left in the trust fund, 
you've been dipping in your Ketamine supply. It is not going to 
happen. We'll just go under the general fund, and take the 
money won't we?
    Director Swagel. Right. And that would add to the deficit 
as compared to current law.
    Senator  Kennedy. Yeah. So I get it, we make these 
distinctions between mandatory spending and discretionary 
spending, but it's really out of the same pot.
    Director Swagel. That's right. There's just one general 
fund of the treasury.
    Senator  Kennedy. Okay. So one option is to reduce our 
spending, correct?
    Director Swagel. That's right.
    Senator  Kennedy. What if we cut our spending 1 percent, 1 
percent? What if we turned to every single department head in 
the Federal Government, and said next year you're going to cut 
your spending 1 percent. Not 5 percent, not 4 percent, 1 
percent, something families who living under Bidenomics, which 
is defined as paying more to live worse, something families 
have to do every day. What would be the impact of a 1 percent 
cut by every budget office?
    Director Swagel. Yeah. So, outlays next year are going to 
be just under $7 trillion, so 1 percent of that is $70 billion.
    Senator  Kennedy. What if we did 2 percent? What would be 
the impact?
    Director Swagel. 140. Yep, there would be $140 billion, and 
you know that's the challenge that the deficit is so large 
that, you know, sort of what you're saying, you know, makes a 
difference, but it's pretty model relative to the size of the 
challenge.
    Senator  Kennedy. What do you think we would have to cut 
spending to get in control of our debt?
    Director Swagel. Yeah. So if you just wanted to stabilize 
the debt, you know, make it so that the debt is at 100 percent, 
and it just goes up not by too much, you would have to cut and 
do it on the spending side. You're talking about $5 trillion 
over 10 years.
    Senator  Kennedy. What percentage is that?
    Director Swagel. Right. So that's--I mean, over 10 years. 
So spending is $7 trillion, multiple that by 10, so it's about 
$70 trillion, you know, a bit more.
    Senator  Kennedy. Give me a percentage. American people 
think in terms of percentages?
    Director Swagel. No, that's right. So say you're talking 
about a roughly 7 to 8 percent reduction in spending.
    Senator  Kennedy. Overall?
    Director Swagel. Overall, just to stabilize the debt. You 
know, we'd still have a high debt.
    Senator  Kennedy. And then we could try to grow out of it?
    Director Swagel. Yeah, positive growth would improve 
revenues, and help the situation.
    Senator  Kennedy. I'm way over. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I 
enjoyed talking to you, Mr. Director.
    Director Swagel. Very good.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks, Senator Kennedy. Senator 
Johnson.

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHNSON

    Senator Johnson. Thanks, Chairman. Sorry, I was absent 
until this point in time. I just have a very specific line of 
questioning here, Director Swagel. You know, your projections 
assume obviously, the tax cuts expire, correct?
    Director Swagel. That's correct.
    Senator Johnson. I mean one of the real tragedies of that 
occurring is that we're going to have an enormous disparity 
between C corporations, which represent about 5 percent of 
American businesses in all the other pass throughs. What I want 
to know in your projections, because having been a pass through 
business myself, actually I've been part of business of every 
different type of corporate structure.
    And quite honestly, during the tax reform of 2017-2018, I 
got letters from the Association of International Certified 
Professional Accountants (AICPA) saying this is exactly what 
would happen. These are particularly large pass through 
businesses, but this might have a small pass through business 
as well. They're not going to be able to compete with that huge 
disparity between C corps and pass throughs.
    And so, a lot of them will convert, particularly the big 
ones will convert to C corp status, which is going to be a much 
larger, not only marginal, but effective tax rate. In your 
projections going out, do you take that into consideration?
    Director Swagel. It's an issue we've been struggling with 
because, you know, we model current law, our projections are 
current law, and we've been trying to think exactly about this. 
If you're an S corp, there's uncertainty about what's going to 
happen at the end of '25. To what extent will S corps make the 
switch, you know, now in advance of, you know, the expiration?
    So, we have a little bit of that switching in our revenue 
modeling, but not the kind of like, you know, full fledge 
switching that you'd expect say in early '26.
    Senator Johnson. I mean would you agree with me, I mean, 
the rational choice for a business person, if you want to 
continue to compete because let's face it, pass throughs 
compete with the corporate corporations at the entity level. I 
know everything about double taxation, that type of thing, but 
I think it's about two-thirds of C corp business income is 
never taxed, correct? Are you aware of that figure?
    Director Swagel. I don't know offhand, but there's lots of 
income that is retained.
    Senator Johnson. Well, it's retained, but also a lot of C 
corps are owned by non-taxable.
    Director Swagel. But not taxable. That's right.
    Senator Johnson. So again, it's hard to get that figure, 
but somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters of C corp 
income is never double taxed, so you're looking at an effective 
rate. We've got it from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) 
of 10 percent for large corporations, 14 percent for small C 
corps, and large pass throughs, they're going to be up over 40 
percent aren't they?
    Director Swagel. No. That's right because the lower 
corporate rates from the 2017 Act is permanent.
    Senator Johnson. So, large pass through is going to be 
paying a top marginal tax rate over 40 percent competing 
against whether it's a large or small C corp, some with an 
effective tax rate of 10 to 14 percent. So, the rational thing 
for a pass through would be I can't complete, I'm going to 
convert to a C corp status.
    Director Swagel. Yes. No. That's exactly right, and we've 
been trying to figure out when that, sort of that massive 
switch will happen, given the uncertainty about what's going to 
happen next year.
    Senator Johnson. So, one of the reasons I'm bringing this 
up is I'm trying to get a score on what I'm proposing, which 
would be to equalize the tax treatment between American 
businesses. In other words, tax all business income at the 
ownership level, that's what pass throughs do.
    Trying to get that score is going to be difficult for me 
because we're not really reflecting what's actually going to 
happen if we let those tax cuts expire. So, is there any way I 
can get some sense of what that number is going to be if 
there's a massive shift, which I believe there would be from 
large pass throughs particular switching to C corps.
    Director Swagel. Okay. I'll tell you two things. So, one is 
the formal estimate would come from JCT, you know, just because 
there would be a change in the tax code. We have an excellent 
tax analysis division, and if we could come talk to you about 
how our revenue projections would change, and we wouldn't be, 
you know, the cost estimate that JCT would do, but we could 
talk you through how we would see it, and what it would mean 
for revenue.
    Senator Johnson. Okay. Let's start with how you have 
accounted for that because you've been thinking this through. 
You made some provision for it.
    Director Swagel. Yeah.
    Senator Johnson. Let's take a look at that, and then you 
know, kind of work with me on that. I'd appreciate it.
    Director Swagel. Okay.
    Senator Johnson. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you.
    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks very much. Two things I'll 
close with as we wrap up the hearing. One is that we've 
referred several times to the risk that the economy faces from 
climate shocks. The Chief Economist of Freddie Mac broke that 
out into weather, storms, sea level rise, make insurance harder 
and harder to predict, which makes insurance first more 
expensive, and then unavailable.
    And once the insurance becomes unavailable, then you can't 
get a mortgage because mortgage holders require insurance on 
the property. And once you can't get a mortgage on a property 
your pool of buyers shrinks dramatically to those who got the 
money to simply pay cash, so supply demand drives prices down. 
It's not that complicated.
    No insurance, no mortgage. No mortgage, no buyers. No 
buyers, no good market. So, the prospect of that creating a 
shock to the economy along the lines of the 2008 shock or 
worse, have been repeatedly raised in this Committee, and I 
would just note today the New York Times has an article about 
how climate change is blowing up the property insurance 
markets.
    And it's not only happening in high risk states like 
Florida, but the companies are actually raising rates in other 
areas to try to counter balance for the risk that they're 
having to assume in these either wildfire adjacent, or coastal 
adjacent markets that are getting increasingly hard to predict.
    And the last word on this came from the expert who spoke to 
the New York Times, and he said, ``I personally think we're in 
a lot of trouble. This should be ringing alarm bells for 
housing markets all over the country.'' We have tried to ring 
those alarm bells here in the Budget Committee before this 
blows up in our faces, because of the role of the fossil fuel 
industry, and fomenting all of this through its pollution, and 
through its political mischief.
    We have a very hard time finding any bipartisanship on 
that, but the facts ought to be pretty obvious by now. So, I 
would make that point because that came up today. And then I'd 
close with this graphic, which shows the increase in non-
defense discretionary spending, which is my Republican friends 
traditional spending target, from 2019 to 2024 as a percentage 
of GDP.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Chart submitted by Chairman Whitehouse appears in the appendix 
on page 68.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So, you move from a little over 3 percent of GDP to about 
3.35 percent of GDP. So, it's an increase of 7 percent from 
here to here. You can see it's a visually, relatively small 
increase. And then when you dive into what that increase is 
made up of, 40 percent of it is made up of benefits to 
veterans.
    The Pact Act, and things were made better for veterans. Do 
they really want to get rid of that? I kind of doubt it. Health 
expenditure, up 18 percent. Well, we have ways to get after 
that by improving the reimbursement system, doing more of what 
reduced the expense by $6.3 trillion against 2008 projections. 
Community development disaster relief, most of that is Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
    Do we really want to starve FEMA while we're having 
unprecedented levels of climate driven catastrophes that 
require FEMA to come to people's rescue? I kind of doubt it. 
Ukraine, and international spending 12 percent. That's 12 
percent of the 7 percent by the way, it's not that big of a 
number, but it's 12 percent.
    Do we really want to leave Ukraine high and dry to the 
tender mercies of the pediatric hospital bombing monster Putin? 
I kind of doubt it. And then there are the income security 
pieces down here, again 12 percent.
    So, when people are talking about making very significant 
cuts to non-defense discretionary spending, they are talking 
about digging into very basic programs and services for the 
American people, and we should be aware of that. We have a 
significant revenue problem.
    We have a very significant healthcare inefficiency problem, 
and we have a very significant climate risk problem. And if we 
can address those three problems I think we'll be well on our 
way to solving the concerns that you have brought to our 
attention today, Dr. Swagel.
    So with that, I will conclude the hearing. If there are any 
further questions for the Doctor that come in as--there's some 
questions Senator Lujan said he had. If there are any others 
get them in by noon tomorrow, colleagues, staff, and we will 
ask Director Swagel to respond to those questions within seven 
days of his receipt of them, if you could do that Dr. Swagel?
    Director Swagel. We will do that, yes.
    Chairman Whitehouse. That would be great. With no further 
business before the Committee, the hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:33 a.m., Tuesday, July 9, 2024, the 
hearing was adjourned]
