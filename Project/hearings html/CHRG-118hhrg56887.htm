                      POLITICAL WARFARE, PART III

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

                     U.S. House of Representatives

               Committee on Oversight and Accountability

                                           Washington, D.C.

    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in 
room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. James Comer 
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Comer, Gosar, Foxx, Grothman, 
Cloud, Palmer, Higgins, Sessions, Biggs, Mace, Fallon, Perry, 
Timmons, Burchett, McClain, Langworthy, Burlison, Raskin, 
Norton, Connolly, Krishnamoorthi, Khanna, Brown, Stansbury, 
Garcia, Lee, Crockett, Goldman, and Moskowitz.
    Chairman Comer. The hearing of the Committee on Oversight 
and Accountability will come to order. I want to welcome 
everyone here today.
    Without objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any 
time.
    I now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening 
statement.
    This hearing is the third in the Oversight Committee's 
investigation into the Federal Government's response to the 
Chinese Communist Party's use of a strategy known as political 
warfare. The CCP employs a strategy to infiltrate and influence 
communities and critical sectors across the Nation. The CCP's 
ultimate goal is to weaken and destroy its main enemy, which 
the party has identified as America. The Committee has 
conducted oversight of 25 sectors of the Federal Government to 
understand if a whole-of-government approach to the CCP threat 
is sufficient or even in existence. Consulting with experts 
from the U.S. Government, military, and private sector, and 
holding briefings with 23 Federal agencies, the Committee has 
found that the CCP is waging a war without weapons against 
America, and the Biden-Harris Administration has no 
governmentwide strategy to combat CCP warfare.
    By any reasonable analysis, the United States faces a new 
cold war, but right now, only its opponent, the CCP, is 
committed to winning it. Unlike the first cold war, the 
adversary is already within, having entrenched itself within 
U.S. borders, institutions, businesses, universities, and 
culture centers by capturing the elites in influential circles. 
Without a cohesive government strategy, the agencies the 
Committee has surveyed have been left to formulate their own 
solutions, which are diverse and largely ineffective. Simply 
put, too many Federal agencies have failed to understand, 
acknowledge, and combat CCP's political warfare. Sometimes this 
is because the agencies themselves have succumbed to CCP 
influence operations seeking to reshape U.S. decision-making to 
the Party's benefit.
    It is essential that Federal agencies understand what the 
CCP is: a totalitarian force that enslaves its own people, 
surveils and harasses critics of the Party and people of 
Chinese descent around the world, and poisons tens of thousands 
of Americans every year with fentanyl. Under General Xi 
Jinping, this regime is waging unrestricted warfare against our 
country. Congress alerted Federal agencies of this threat 25 
years ago. Yet in 2024, the CCP's tactics still pose 
extraordinary danger to the American way of life, while the 
U.S. Government and its agencies, departments, and commissions 
have not engaged the CCP threat with urgency.
    In the Committee's previous hearings in this investigation, 
it is notable that both Republican and Democrat witnesses who 
have testified have recognized CCP political warfare as a 
serious threat to American society. Today, our witnesses will 
testify about what Federal agencies should be doing to change 
course and secure America from the CCP and its destructive 
global ambitions. The stakes are high and Federal officials 
must start listening to the message the witnesses here today 
have to deliver.
    The Federal Government has great responsibilities to 
confront Communist China. First, Federal leaders must be 
willing to talk about the CCP and the warfare it is waging 
against America. Transparent communication is critical to an 
effective deterrence strategy. Next, the strategy must be 
governmentwide. The CCP is targeting every corner of this 
country, and all Federal agencies have duties to fight back 
against it. Federal officials should reject mixed messaging and 
appeasement. That means Federal agencies must put an end to so-
called country-neutral approaches doomed to fail the American 
people. Instead, officials should employ targeted strategies to 
identify, counter, and deter the CCP's unique methods and 
strategies, such as the United Front and elite capture.
    Additionally, the intelligence community should not hide 
behind the classification system. This investigation has made 
clear that there is plenty of open-source information available 
demonstrating CCP infiltration operations. It is inexcusable 
for Federal officials to neglect their responsibilities to 
openly communicate about threats to the public. Also, Federal 
leaders must resist influence within their own ranks. The CCP 
actively wages psychological warfare to influence decision-
making and how officials carry out their responsibilities. For 
example, Federal agencies should reject the lie that it is 
racist to criticize the CCP. America's adversary is the Chinese 
Communist Party, not the Chinese people, who are victims 
themselves of this regime.
    Finally, in the face of the cold war the CCP is waging, 
Federal agencies should fulfill their responsibilities to the 
American people. Federal officials should use their platforms 
and authorities to equip America to strengthen their 
communities and create the new technologies that will secure a 
strong future for the Nation. Today, Federal agencies are ill 
prepared to face the CCP threat. A governmentwide strategy is 
decades overdue. The American people deserve better from their 
government, and I hope that Federal officials will listen to 
the constructive recommendations offered today.
    I thank the witnesses for being here today, and I look 
forward to their testimony. I now yield to Ranking Member 
Raskin for his opening remarks.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All the dictators and 
despots of the world have something in common in 2024. They are 
united in trying to subvert democracy in America, and they are 
engaged indeed in political warfare against us, as the title of 
this hearing has it. The vicious autocrats of Russia, the 
police-state theocrats of Iran, the totalitarian communist 
billionaire bureaucrats of China and North Korea, and all their 
corrupt oligarchs and plutocrats seek to destroy the very idea 
of human rights and political freedom that are the defining 
ideals of America and still the hope of a world struggling 
against their oppression. The tyrants have something else in 
common: Donald Trump. He loves them all and they love him back. 
He loves them because he envies their total control over their 
societies, and they love him because they know they can 
manipulate and control him. He praises all of them: Putin, 
Orban, Xi, Kim Jong Un. Trump exults in their friendship and 
emulates their control over what he calls ``their people.''
    When he was President, Trump said that he and Xi, the 
President of China and Chairman of the Communist Party, ``love 
each other,'' and Trump called Xi a brilliant man. He openly 
envied and marveled over Xi's total control over his people, 
saying, ``He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.'' 
And when people asked questions about Xi and the CCP's role at 
the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Trump repeatedly defended 
Xi and praised his excellent leadership, calling him a 
``brilliant man,'' ``smart,'' ``brilliant,'' ``everything 
perfect,'' ``we love each other,'' ``President Xi, who is a 
friend of mine, who is very smart,'' ``a very good man,'' 
``nobody like that,'' ``the look, the brain, the whole thing,'' 
``My feeling toward you is an incredibly warm one,'' he said.
    Trump has repeatedly praised Russia's lawless and bloody 
invasion of Ukraine as smart. At a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser in 
2022, he gushed that Putin was taking over a country, a vast, 
vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and 
just walking right in. At the Presidential debate earlier this 
month, he refused to say that he wanted Ukraine to win the war 
but said he would end the war in 24 hours, meaning he would, 
per usual, cave in to Putin's propaganda and outrageous demands 
and cede large parts of Ukraine to the Russian strongman who 
imprisons, poisons, and murders his political opponents. 
Trump's Chief of Staff, John Kelly, described his own boss as 
``a person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators, a 
person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic 
institutions, our constitution, and the rule of law.'' And to 
quote Trump's chilling 2018 comments to Fox News about Kim Jong 
Un, Trump said, ``He is the head of a country, and I mean he is 
the strong head. Don't let anyone think anything different. He 
speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to 
do the same.''
    Trump openly catered to Putin, defended the former KGB 
chief, and aggressively took his side against the NSA, the CIA, 
the Defense Intelligence Agency, the FBI, and more than a dozen 
other U.S. intelligence agencies which found that Putin was 
engaged in active political espionage, sabotage, and 
interference in the 2016 American Presidential election, a form 
of shocking appeasement that just invited further Russian 
aggression against us in 2020 and now again in the 2024 
campaign. H.R. McMaster, Trump's former national security 
advisor, recounted a meeting between Chinese President Xi and 
Donald Trump. According to McMaster, Xi ``ate our lunch'' 
because Trump madly ingratiated himself to Xi and completely 
failed to stand up for U.S. foreign policy interests. McMaster 
writes that Trump frequently revealed his affinity for 
strongmen and belief that he alone could form a good 
relationship with Putin. As President, according to his own 
national security advisor, John Bolton, Trump encouraged Xi's 
building and use of concentration camps to hold Uyghurs in 
Xinjiang province.
    In the 2024 campaign, Trump has promised to follow the lead 
of these dictators in the global axis of autocrats. A convicted 
felon and an adjudicated sexual assailant, Trump repeatedly 
says he would suspend the rule of law in our country, override 
the Constitution as dictator on day one, launch the biggest 
mass detention and internment of immigrants in American 
history, and replace tens of thousands of professional civil 
servants with political loyalists and the personal sycophants 
he craves. He has pledged to use the Department of Justice as a 
weapon to investigate and prosecute his political enemies.
    And he is not kidding. He packed and stacked the Supreme 
Court to destroy a fundamental constitutional freedom women 
enjoyed for more than a half century in America. He personally 
ordered the weaponization of the Department of Justice and the 
IRS against Hillary Clinton; his own FBI Director, James Comey; 
his own Deputy FBI Director, Andrew McCabe; his private lawyer 
for years, Michael Cohen, who was put in solitary confinement 
for 2 weeks when he refused to promise he would not write a 
book about Donald Trump, and was released by a United States 
Federal District judge who was shocked by the blatantly 
vindictive and unconstitutional persecution of an American 
citizen for exercising his First Amendment rights.
    Putin, Xi, Trump, and Hungary's tyrant, Viktor Orban, who 
had a slumber party at Mar-a-Lago when he was in town promoting 
illiberal democracy, which means mob rule without freedom, 
these are the new axis of autocrats attacking American 
democracy and freedom and human rights all over the world. This 
is the real political warfare taking place against America. 
After repeatedly caving in to China and cheerleading its 
destruction of human rights, after making sure his own daughter 
received more than 40 trademarks from China and the CCP, after 
praising Xi's great performance on COVID-19, Trump decided it 
might be to his political advantage to attack China with some 
juvenile racist slurs and nicknames. Scandalously, he has 
lumped Chinese Americans and immigrants in with the atrocities 
of the CCP when it is the Chinese diaspora in the U.S. that is 
actually most at risk for transnational repression and 
brutalization by the CCP.
    Trump's laughable decision to pose as a critic of Chinese 
Government oppression now resembles nothing so much as Orwell's 
depiction in ``1984'' of a friendly shifting competition 
between authoritarian powers--Oceania, East Asia, and Eurasia--
who pretend to be rivals but actually form an axis of 
oppression against their own peoples, who they seek to 
dominate.
    Now, contrary to this craven submission to foreign 
dictators and make-believe, the Biden-Harris Administration and 
Democrats in Congress have taken a strong stand for democracy 
and against all the autocrats and totalitarians, including the 
CCP, responding aggressively to the economic, security, and 
ideological challenges posed by China, including by investing 
in our competitiveness, our innovation, and our democracy. 
Under President Biden, the U.S. has aligned its efforts with 
those of our allies and partners around the globe, bringing 
together the democracies of the world. President Biden 
strengthened military partnerships with allies across the Indo-
Pacific and established the Australia, United Kingdom, United 
States, or AUKUS, security pact to help defend peace, 
democracy, and stability in the region.
    Today, the Democrats will explain how the Biden-Harris 
Administration has guaranteed that America can compete with and 
indeed outcompete China economically as well as geopolitically 
while we stand up for the ideals of human rights and democracy 
for all. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Ranking Member yields back. I am 
pleased to introduce our witnesses today. All witnesses are 
testifying in their personal capacities.
    First, we have Dr. Bradley Thayer. He is a founding member 
of the Committee on the Present Danger: China. Formerly, he was 
a special governmental employee in the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security, where he contributed to the January 2021 
report, ``DHS Strategic Action Plan to Combat the Threat Posed 
by the People's Republic of China.'' Dr. Thayer's research 
focuses on the existential threat the Chinese Communist Party 
poses to the United States. Dr Thayer is testifying in his 
personal capacity. Next, we have Robert Atkinson. He is the 
founder and President of the Information Technology and 
Innovation Foundation. A policy expert, Mr. Atkinson has been 
appointed by Republicans and Democrats to serve on various 
commissions and advise on issues, including competitiveness, 
innovation, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and 
competition with China.
    Next, the Honorable Joseph Cella is the founder and 
Principal of the Pontifex Group, a consulting firm. Previously, 
Ambassador Cella served as the U.S. Ambassador to Fiji from 
2019 to 2021. He is the co-founder and director of the citizen-
led Michigan China Economic Security and Review Group, which 
monitors and counters threats of subnational incursions from 
the CCP to protect the security of the state of Michigan. 
Ambassador Cella is testifying in his personal capacity. And 
finally, Jacob Stokes is a senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific 
Security Program at The Center for a New American Strategy 
[sic], focusing on U.S.-China relations, Chinese foreign and 
military policy, East Asian security affairs, and great power 
competition. Previously, Mr. Stokes served as a Senior Advisor 
to the National Security Advisor, as well as Acting Special 
Advisor for Asia Policy for then Vice President Biden. He also 
worked as a professional staff member for the U.S.-China 
Economic and Security Review Commission.

                    STATEMENT OF DR. BRADLEY THAYER

                            FOUNDING MEMBER

                 COMMITTEE ON THE PRESENT DANGER: CHINA

    Dr. Thayer. Chair Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and 
distinguished Members of this Committee, good morning, and 
thank you for the honor and privilege of permitting me to 
testify today in my personal capacity.
    The current cold war with the Chinese Communist Party is 
multifaceted and fought thus far, short of kinetic war, but in 
all other domains, including the economic, diplomatic, and 
political. Given the focus of this Committee and topic of this 
hearing, it is important to understand the similarities between 
this cold war and the one fought with the Soviet Union. The 
most salient is that the motivation for aggression remains the 
same--communist ideology of the Soviet Union in the past and of 
the CCP today.
    The impact of the ideology of communism and its role in 
driving the PRC's aggression is essential for this Committee to 
comprehend. Communism is a Western ideology imported into China 
and is not part of Chinese civilization, political culture, or 
political history, but its effect on China has been profound 
and created a swath of destruction through that country. It has 
intentionally destroyed the pillars of Chinese culture, 
society, and civilization, and killed scores of millions of 
Chinese.
    Understanding the CCP's ideology provides Congress and 
Federal departments and agencies three major insights into the 
PRC's behavior. First, it allows them to comprehend why the PRC 
is inherently aggressive. Communism seeks to force societies 
like China's into an ideological procrustean bed defined by 
Marxism/Leninism. In addition, communism requires aggression, 
including unrestricted warfare against non-communist states. 
The effect on U.S. national security interests could not be 
more significant as this explains the CCP's aggression against 
the U.S. In the CCP's worldview, the U.S. is the fundamental 
enemy to be destroyed. The second insight is, the CCP is a 
product of Soviet imperialism. The Soviets and the Communist 
International played a dominant role in organizing, 
instructing, and, in almost every sense that matters, de facto 
leading the CCP. The role of Soviet communist thought is 
essential for comprehending the actions of the CCP, and it 
provided the foundation for what is known as Maoism, or more 
recently, Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese 
characteristics for a new era.
    The third insight is that the CCP is illegitimate. It is so 
for three reasons, first, precisely because they were formed 
and nurtured by the Communist International, and the CCP 
seizure of power in 1949 was made possible by Stalin and the 
Red Army. Second, they seek to sustain the tyranny of the 
failed ideology of communism on the Chinese people, when this 
ideology should be thought of for what it is: an illegitimate 
polity for China and the last surviving form of Western 
colonialism. The CCP cannot hide the fact that it is a product 
of Soviet imperialism. Third, the CCP is illegitimate because 
of its abhorrent leadership, which has accelerated under the 
misrule of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Seventy years of the 
CCP's tyranny have led to the recognition by the Chinese people 
that the odious, corrupt, and illegitimate regime rules for 
itself, not for the Chinese people.
    I offer in my written testimony eight detailed 
recommendations for Congress. Here, I only mention their 
unifying theme, that is, given their august past, the Chinese 
people naturally possess a profound sense of pride in their 
civilization and its great accomplishments. They rightfully 
perceive themselves to occupy a unique place in the world that 
has excelled in every aspect, including literature, philosophy, 
art, religion, and technology. Accordingly, the Chinese people 
have their own ideas about how to govern China based on their 
glorious past and exalted history. Being ruled by a Soviet 
knockoff ideology is not part of the plan, nor should it be, 
and this insight introduces tremendous vulnerability for the 
Chinese Communist Party as their ideology is anchored and 
remains dependent upon that Western ideology of Marxism/
Leninism. Thus, to move to a better future for the Chinese 
people begins by recognizing that the CCP is illegitimate and 
has no right to rule them.
    In conclusion, the U.S. is now in a new cold war. The Sino-
American security competition is the great struggle of the 21st 
century and promises to resolve the century's dispositive 
question: whether the world will be free and protected by the 
United States and its allies or fall into a totalitarian abyss 
as sought by the CCP. The 20th century encountered the same 
question, and freedom defeated communism. Today, the answer to 
this question, will freedom or tyranny define the 21st century, 
will be answered by Congress, the Administration, U.S. allies 
and partners, and, ultimately, the American people. The 
leadership and focus of this Committee will contribute to 
ensuring that the answer will be the same in the 21st century 
as it was in the last: freedom will triumph over the CCP's 
tyranny.
    Thank you very much, indeed, for the great honor and 
opportunity to address this testimony. I look forward to 
addressing your questions.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you very much. Mr. Atkinson?

                    STATEMENT OF ROBERT D. ATKINSON

                         FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT

        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION (ITIF)

    Dr. Atkinson. Thank you, Chairman Comer and Ranking Member 
Raskin and Members of the Committee. In the late 50s--I do not 
remember what year it was--but there was the famous kitchen 
debate with Vice President Nixon and Khrushchev, and Khrushchev 
said, ``We will bury you,'' and what he meant by that was our 
socialist, communist economy is going to be so much stronger 
than your weak capitalist economy, and eventually we will win. 
Now, that was a joke. I mean, he was not making a joke, but it 
was a joke. There was simply no way the Russians could do that, 
just because their system was so inept and so bureaucratic and 
so controlled.
    The Chinese Government learned from that, and so what they 
have learned is, essentially, you have to have capitalism with 
Chinese characteristics, and so they are a capitalist economy 
in many, many ways. Their firms have an enormous amount of 
freedom with one exception, you cannot criticize the CCP. But 
beyond that, you can do what you want as long as you are 
pushing for global market share and dominance.
    So, I think it is really, really critical that we don't 
compare them to the Soviets when it comes to the techno-
economic threat. They are more like Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, 
Korea on massive amounts of steroids, and they make no bones 
about hiding the ball. Yi Changliang, a leading official at 
Chinese NDRC, wrote, ``At a time when this new round of techno-
scientific revolution and industrial transformation has not yet 
gained its full momentum, there are grand expectations for 
artificial intelligence, Big Data, cloud computing, and these 
areas have become the main battlefield for innovation.''
    So, that is really the key term. They are using the term 
``battlefield.'' We do not talk to our Canadian colleagues and 
say we have a battlefield for lumber. We have competition over 
these industries, but not a battlefield, and that is really the 
key point here. The Chinese see this as a global battle where 
there is a winner and a loser, and, in particular, they are not 
trying to win in the soybean market or the banking market. They 
are trying to win in a set of advanced industries that are 
critical to military capabilities as well as overall national 
power.
    They have already shown that they can do that, for example, 
in solar power, in drones, in shipbuilding, in steel, in 
telecom equipment. And now what they are doing is they are 
going after a whole set of new industries: AI, quantum 
computing. The Chinese are building more nuclear power plants, 
and they have under construction, than the rest of the world 
combined. Chinese are putting more money into quantum computing 
R&D than every other government in the world combined. The 
Chinese installed more robots last year, industrial robots, 
than the rest of the world combined. They are making enormous 
progress and their goal--they have now, by the way, the leading 
quantum communication systems in the world. So, what they are 
doing is an all-of-government approach to defeat us, to defeat 
American technology capabilities as well as allied 
capabilities.
    So, what do we need to do? I think there are several things 
we should not do, and one of the things that we should not do 
is fall for the false hope of cooperation. So, you hear this 
view all the time, well, you know, there are things that we are 
competing with China, but we have to cooperate with them, and 
my two favorites are, one is infectious diseases. So, let me 
get this right. A country that put the COVID virus in the 
world--now there is the question of did it come from a lab or 
did it come from a wet market, I am not going to take a 
position on that--but there is no question the Chinese hid the 
ball on that and made it worse. And we are supposed to 
cooperate with them? And the second is climate change. A 
country that now is leading in global emissions has no desire 
to reduce emissions, zero, unless it is in their interest.
    We do not need to cooperate with China. What we do need to 
do is figure out a way to confront them--and this part is 
critical--in ways that do not hurt us. So, if I am in a fight 
with somebody and they are fighting me, and I can punch him in 
the face and I break my hand, probably not the best thing for 
me to do. But if I can kick him in the kneecap and not hurt my 
leg, that is probably better. So, we have to figure out ways 
that can challenge them without hurting us.
    And one of the key things I think we need to do is three 
things: put in place a more robust competitiveness strategy. 
And Congressman Raskin, you rightly alluded to the many things 
that Congress and the Biden Administration have done. I 
certainly applaud that, but we ought to keep going. Second, we 
have called for the establishment of a National Competitiveness 
Council in the White House focused on China and focused on 
coordinating all the various agencies. I really commend what 
your Committee has done in terms of getting agencies to figure 
this out because they do not think about this from a China 
perspective. Each agency thinks about this from their own 
narrow perspective, which is reasonable and understandable, but 
it does not work anymore. We also have to have, essentially, a 
training program in government where we train government 
agencies and officials on what the threat is. It is striking to 
me when I talk to government agencies and officials how little 
they know about this, and I think we need to do a lot more on 
that.
    So, with that, thank you so much, and I apologize for 
running over.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. 
Cella.

                     STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH CELLA

                   FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO

                FIJI, KIRIBATI, NAURU, TONGA, AND TUVAL

                         FOUNDER AND PRINCIPAL

                             PONTIFEX GROUP

    Mr. Cella. Good morning, Chairman Comer, Ranking Member 
Raskin, and distinguished Members of this Committee. Thank you 
for inviting me to testify.
    In his February 2023 speech entitled, ``An Intelligence 
Officer's Perspective on China,'' now retired Navy Admiral, 
Mike Studeman, who, then serving as Commander of ONI, stated, 
``The China problem is more gigantic than understood or 
appreciated.'' Political warfare by the government of the 
People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, poses 
an existential threat to the United States of America. My 
testimony today, based on my experience in this cold war with 
the CCP as a U.S. diplomat, a concerned American, and a 
resident of Michigan, focuses on failures of the Federal 
Government to both understand the depth and breadth of this 
threat and to effectively counter it.
    I witnessed firsthand the CCP's impactful use of political 
and economic warfare across the Indo-Pacific. Through this, 
China has effectively bypassed our historic defensive barriers 
in the Pacific, called the First and Second Island Chains, 
endangering Hawaii, Guam, U.S. territories, and our friends and 
allies there. Despite ample warning by Pacific Island leaders, 
the Federal Government did little over the years to stop 
China's ominous advance. During my accreditation trip to 
Kiribati, I visited the Friendship Bridge connecting North and 
South Tarawa, paid for by the DoD funding and dedicated in 2010 
by my former late predecessor, Ambassador Steve McGann. It was 
built using World War II-era Bailey Bridge construction design, 
certainly far deficient for the punishing weather at the 
equator. The bridge was well past its temporary design purpose, 
patched-in diamond plate sheeting scattered on it, rusting 
apart and unsafe. I worked aggressively with INDOPACOM to 
secure the funding to replace the bridge. It was ultimately 
approved, however, it got snagged between the Pentagon and the 
state Department bureaucracies. In my understanding, it 
remained snagged. The CCP-owned China Railway Group swooped in 
and built an auxiliary cement bridge, though underwater during 
high tide. Our Friendship Bridge is in tatters, and it is my 
understanding it is now impassable.
    I have also witnessed malign influence through a 
subnational incursion and influence operation by a PRC-based 
and CCP-tied lithium-ion battery manufacturer, Gotion, in Green 
Charter Township, Michigan. And that is just one of many 
examples across the United States that threatens our national 
security and sovereignty. Roughly 70 miles from Gotion's 
proposed facility is a secure U.S. military installation known 
as Camp Grayling. It is the hub of the National All-Domain 
Warfighting Center, which trains our troops and those of our 
allies, including Taiwan, in strategic and tactical battle 
operations. Gotion submitted a voluntary declaration to the 
Committee on Foreign Investment of the United States in the 
spring of 2023, quite surprisingly declared it an ``uncovered 
real estate transaction.''
    In recent weeks, the Biden Administration proposed a rule 
that added over 50 U.S. military bases, including Camp 
Grayling, for required reviews by CFIUS when a deal involving a 
foreign company such as Gotion falls within a 100-mile radius 
of a military facility. Perplexing, while our defense officials 
likely instituted this rule on account of mission-critical 
assets at Camp Grayling there, it is not retroactive and it 
does not apply to Gotion. Through my volunteer work for the 
MCESRG, in recent days I was alarmed to discover Federal 
officials either ignored or overlooked a February 2020 U.S. 
Treasury Department CFIUS rule regarding joint-use military 
facilities that covers the Gotion transaction given the Army 
Airfield at Camp Grayling.
    I wrote to Mr. Paul Rosen, the Assistant Secretary of State 
at the Treasury for Investment Security, requesting he 
reexamine Gotion's declarations under that regulation and 
scrutinize the project accordingly. Court filings this past 
Friday revealed offers by Gotion to now recall trustees that 
seems to involve elite capture, corruption, influence peddling, 
and enrichment. These offers include all-expense-paid trips to 
China, a sweetheart real estate purchase that would have netted 
a recalled trustee $2 million, and employment in the event that 
they were recalled. Text messages between a Gotion official and 
a recalled trustee read, ``We got each other's backs'' and 
``You have my back. Now it is my turn to help,'' as well, ``You 
have been a great partner and becoming an even better friend. I 
will help however I can.'' Those were never disclosed and below 
the radar of the Federal Government.
    This is precisely why our national security intelligence 
agencies in 2022 convened and warned a bipartisan group of 
state-elected and local leaders and business officials to be 
very careful and wary about the grave risks about engaging in 
these seemingly benign business deals with companies based in 
the PRC. And instead of following the directives to conduct 
them transparently, do due diligence, perform strict scrutiny, 
ensure transparency, integrity, and accountability, the 
government and business elites with this project did exactly 
the opposite. They moved fast and in secret, binding them and 
shrouding them in 5- and 10-year nondisclosure agreements using 
secret code names. So, this ruptures the consent of the 
governed and certainly jeopardizes our national security.
    These events offer a cautionary tale on the importance of 
intergovernmental agency process that first acknowledges the 
serious threat, the political and economic warfare being waged 
by the CCP; second, it is nimble spotting these threats; and 
third, can defend, if not prevent, them within our sovereign 
Nation. Thank you for your time and attention, and I look 
forward to answering your questions.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you very much. Mr. Stokes?

                       STATEMENT OF JACOB STOKES

                    SENIOR FELLOW (FOCUSED ON CHINA)

                     INDO-PACIFIC SECURITY PROGRAM

                   CENTER FOR A NEW AMERICAN SECURITY

    Mr. Stokes. Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and 
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on this critical topic. I will 
start by assessing the challenge and then offer some thoughts 
on how to respond.
    The People's Republic of China, particularly under the rule 
of CCP General Secretary, Xi Jinping, poses the most 
consequential challenge to American interests and values over 
the coming decades. How the United States wages strategic 
competition with China will determine the course of world 
affairs in this century. The challenge from Beijing is most 
acute in East Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region, but 
China's reach is increasingly global, to include the United 
States. Specifically, regarding China's political warfare, the 
CCP's foundational goal is to combat threats to its hold on 
power domestically in China and generally make the world safe 
for authoritarianism. As part of that campaign, Beijing seeks 
to paint democracies as corrupt, internally divided, 
tumultuous, and incapable of tackling big problems facing 
society.
    So, what should we, the United States, do about it? A 
comprehensive U.S. strategy to compete with China should have 
several pillars. First, the United States needs a credible 
military deterrent to guard against PRC aggression. Second, we 
should forge an economic, financial, and trade strategy that 
ensures U.S. companies and workers compete in the global 
economy on a level playing field. Third, we must continue to 
innovate cutting-edge civilian and military technologies, like 
artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and actively 
work to increase their uptake across both the private and 
public sectors. Fourth, our diplomacy should sustain and expand 
coalitions of allies, partners, and like-minded countries to 
magnify the impact of our activities across the other pillars.
    U.S.-China competition is too often portrayed as a contest 
between two countries when it is actually a contest of 
coalitions. Coalition building is painstaking and sometimes 
requires frustrating compromises, but it is worth the effort 
because it allows the United States to effectively 
counterbalance Beijing's actions that violate international 
rules and norms, and even engage China diplomatically on a 
selective basis from a position of strength. As for responding 
to the PRC's political warfare specifically, the United States 
should assist vulnerable countries in exposing and punishing 
inappropriate PRC influence, whether in the form of political 
interference, transnational repression, or economic or security 
espionage. Washington can do so by sharing intelligence on how 
China operates, supporting fact-based investigations by civil 
society and independent media outlets, and bolstering strong 
institutions and the rule of law around the world. The good 
news is that strengthening the foundations of democracies 
overseas, a worthy objective in its own right, helps counter 
PRC influence, too.
    Meanwhile, we face similar challenges from the CCP here at 
home, as we have heard. The United States must also protect 
against efforts by the PRC party-state to interfere with and 
weaken our democracy and sow division and discord. Front and 
center in that fight, of course, are law enforcement and 
counterintelligence activities that are both vigorous and 
vigilant. They should deny and impose costs on China for 
efforts to influence the sovereign affairs of the United States 
or to steal our technology or other secrets. Equally essential 
are transparent and accountable institutions and processes 
which can help inoculate us against the tools of CCP influence. 
The actions we take to defend ourselves, however, will be both 
ineffective and self-defeating unless they accord with American 
values. The United States is engaged in an intense strategic 
competition with China. That is a geopolitical fact.
    Additionally, PRC intelligence draws on a wide range of 
intelligence collectors. Those facts could tempt the United 
States to go beyond targeted commonsense controls in key 
sectors and instead cast all people of Chinese or even Asian 
descent as suspect. We could even be tempted to turn away from 
our country's historical role as a place where people seeking a 
better life yearn to live. We must resist those temptations 
because they would play right into the CCP's hands. America's 
ability to attract the best and brightest from around the world 
to come to our country and adopt our way of life, indeed, our 
political ideology is an asymmetric geopolitical advantage that 
we squander at our peril. It is the reason why our economy is 
growing when China's is not, why our innovation ecosystem leads 
the world. In other words, we cannot effectively protect 
America by becoming more like China.
    Finally, in addition to disrupting the tools the CCP uses 
to influence and interfere, we should refute Beijing's 
underlying argument by demonstrating that democracy can deliver 
freedom, prosperity, and security for its citizens in America 
and around the world. To put it in political warfare terms, 
delivering on the promise of democracy will act as a potent 
counteroffensive to China's efforts.
    I will conclude my remarks there. Thank you again for the 
opportunity to speak, and I look forward to your questions.
    Chairman Comer. Thank you all very much for your opening 
statements. We will now begin the questions. The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Gosar, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Gosar. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Thayer, 
the United States is kind of responsible for China, right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Gosar. And that would be the Carter Doctrine, right?
    Dr. Thayer. Well, it would be an aspect of a longer 
tradition of that, although President Carter, of course, did 
illuminate that issue.
    Mr. Gosar. Right. So, what we actually did, we thought that 
we can make China like us, and we just gave them our 
technology, right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir. We let them into our economic 
ecosystem, and they have thrived, obviously, within that 
ecosystem.
    Mr. Gosar. And I think, Mr. Atkinson, you talked about 
CFIUS. CFIUS is a poor constraint here because we saw that in 
Uranium One. That has long gone past this point. So, I guess my 
point is, if we are going to have some kind of a jurisdictional 
boundary over China, don't you think it would be better to say, 
instead of picking individual businesses, to say that no 
foreign national can sit on any operating or oversight board of 
any company in the United States? Wouldn't that be something of 
better value than trying to target one business after another?
    Mr. Cella. I think that would be a start. I think another 
alternative would be to perhaps consider passing an updated 
version of the National Security Act of 1947 where the whole of 
government would have to abide by such rules that you point to.
    Mr. Gosar. Yes. You know, in fact, Mr. Stokes, you talked 
about the rule of law, pretty much so, and if I was talking 
about an operating partner or an oversight partner and they had 
to be U.S. citizens', violation of that is treason, right?
    Mr. Stokes. I do not know the legal definition, sir.
    Mr. Gosar. Well, I mean, they are a violation of other 
country, all these would be a national defense item, OK? Let us 
talk about intellectual property. When I first came here in 
2010, we were No. 1 in the world. We are not even in the top 10 
right now. You know, can you address that and China, Dr. 
Thayer?
    Dr. Thayer. Well, indeed, what we have seen, of course, is 
a shift in relative power from the United States to the 
People's Republic of China. That has been conducted willingly 
by many American firms who have shared their technology with 
the People's Republic of China. China also has, through legal 
and illegal means, acquired our technology. And so, what we 
have seen, in essence, is really the greatest transfer of 
technology, of intellectual acumen, of knowledge about 
processes with respect to production, with respect to 
marketing, with respect to execution in history.
    Mr. Gosar. Ambassador Cella, so really, the first to file 
violated the whole premise of our Constitution instead of first 
to discover, right?
    Mr. Cella. Pardon me?
    Mr. Gosar. So, the whole premise of first to file instead 
of first to discover, like what we were told would change the 
whole concept of intellectual property, was a violation of our 
Constitution, right? Would you say that?
    Mr. Cella. I am not a constitutional scholar, sir.
    Mr. Gosar. Well, we gained the protections, too. Mr. 
Stokes, would you agree with that?
    Mr. Stokes. I also do not know the law there.
    Mr. Gosar. OK. Well, what we did is we said first to file, 
and we allowed these trolls, whether the foreign nationals or 
some of these big companies here, we allowed them to file, and 
then we said we are going to give you this little appeasement 
for the guy who actually found that to challenge that. It never 
works that way. Our intellectual property has been sold out. We 
are now not even in the top 10, and that really plays a big 
difference in our aspects. Ambassador Cella, if you were to 
prioritize which parts of business you would like to look at 
very carefully, how would you prioritize those?
    Mr. Cella. Congressman, I would say a very finely focused 
laser should be targeted to any sector that involves critical 
technologies, particularly those that entangle military 
technologies and space technologies and certainly critical 
minerals, and there are gaping holes in that throughout the 
private sector and even the university sector. And there are 
citizens, civilians that are engaged on this and tracking and 
filing lawsuits, whistleblowing, where we are particularly 
vulnerable in this.
    Mr. Gosar. Would you agree that if we had NGO's out there, 
nongovernment entities, if they were to take one penny, full 
disclosure should become about however they get their funding? 
Would you agree with that?
    Mr. Cella. Yes.
    Mr. Gosar. How about you, Dr. Thayer? Would you agree with 
that?
    Dr. Thayer. Absolutely. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Gosar. How about you, Mr. Atkinson? Would you agree 
with that?
    Dr. Atkinson. Sure.
    Mr. Gosar. How about you, Mr. Stokes?
    Mr. Stokes. Absolutely.
    Mr. Gosar. God love you. I yield back.
    Ms. Mace. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Ms. Mace.
    Ms. Mace. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record 
an article from March that says that, ``Biden Praises Xi as a 
`Smart, Smart Guy,' Promises to `Hold China Accountable'.''
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Ms. Mace. And if the Ranking Member is going to harp on 
President Trump's comments about President Xi, he should note 
that President Biden praised Xi as a smart, smart guy. Good 
morning.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking 
Member.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to Ms. 
Mace. Thank you to all the witnesses for your excellent 
testimony.
    Mr. Stokes, you said it is a mistake to characterize what 
is going on as a competition just between two countries. You 
are saying it is a contest between coalitions. Would you just 
briefly tell us who are the main actors or great powers within 
each coalition?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes, absolutely, Ranking Member. So, certainly, 
I would say on the one side we have the United States and our 
democratic allies and partners, both in Europe and the Indo-
Pacific. And I would say on the other side you have China in an 
increasingly close connection with Russia, working at a 
strategic level, and then paired in with their partners in 
North Korea and Iran, leading more of an authoritarian bloc. 
And I would say there is a group of countries in between that 
you can think of as sort of swing states that we should be kind 
of focusing on how do we bring them into our coalition?
    Mr. Raskin. But what is the role that political propaganda 
and disinformation play in this struggle today?
    Mr. Stokes. In my view, the role that those things play is 
to make authoritarianism seem like it works better than it 
does, and to make an argument for that among people who are, 
you know, casting about for what system is going to give them 
the best way of life going forward. And so, I think we both 
have to be on the defensive, but also go out and make the case 
for democracy in an affirmative way.
    Mr. Raskin. I wonder what the panelists think about the 
importance of the struggle in Ukraine today against Putin's 
filthy imperialist invasion of Ukraine, what would a victory 
for the people of Ukraine against Russian aggression mean for 
our struggle against China, and what would a loss to Russia 
mean for the struggle against China. Dr. Thayer, what are your 
thoughts on that?
    Dr. Thayer. Ranking Member Raskin, thank you for the 
question. It is a critically important issue. A loss to Russia, 
of course, would be a tremendous blow to Xi Jinping, who has 
made Putin his meridian, right? Putin is a soldier executing 
the tasks assigned to him by Xi Jinping, in essence. We can 
recall, of course, the meeting that they had before the 
invasion in February 2022, where Xi Jinping gave him the green 
light. So, Ukrainian defeat of Russia is a tremendous blow to 
Communist China.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you. Mr. Atkinson, do you agree with 
that?
    Dr. Atkinson. I am not a military expert. I do not do 
foreign policy, so I am afraid I cannot answer that.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you. Mr. Cella, do you agree that a 
victory for Ukraine against Putin's invasion is critical to our 
ability to stand up to the tyrants and autocrats in China?
    Mr. Cella. I would say what has befallen Ukraine is a 
tragedy, and I would say through what has happened via Russia, 
China is pressure testing us. They are watching how we engage. 
And I am not a military expert, certainly, nor am I a foreign 
policy expert in that realm, but it has to be handled with all 
due care----
    Mr. Raskin. Great. And Mr. Stokes?
    Mr. Cella [continuing]. To ensure freedom.
    Mr. Stokes. Yes. I think one lesson that Xi Jinping could 
draw from that would be that in a war of aggression, you only 
have to wait the United States and its allies and partners out, 
you know, 2, 2 1/2 years, and then you can get away with the, 
you know, grabbing the territory that you want.
    Mr. Raskin. So, what would that mean in the case of Taiwan, 
for example?
    Mr. Stokes. I think, you know, it would make it more likely 
that Xi Jinping would, you know, make an attempt on Taiwan, and 
I think one of the ways you can, you know, analytical ways you 
can draw from that is just see China's support for Russia. It 
is both its tangible support, but also it is political and 
diplomatic support, ``legitimate security interests'' is the 
term that China uses. And so, it is an issue of principle in 
addition to an issue of military power.
    Mr. Raskin. OK. And what do you think is the importance of 
strengthening American political institutions against 
subversion and attack from those who would try to challenge our 
basic constitutional structure?
    Mr. Stokes. Well, I think, you know, making them stronger 
and more resilient is a strategy of denial for those who would 
try to interfere in American democracy, so just make it harder 
to be successful in so that we can have a strategy of denial. 
And then add to that a strategy of punishment in those 
instances where we see China, Russia, other hostile nations 
trying to interfere directly in our system.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Cloud.
    Mr. Cloud. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being 
here. This is certainly one of the most urgent matters that we 
are dealing with. I find it odd that as we watch the news, very 
often, it is not that they are lying, although sometimes that 
is the case. It is just we are not talking about things that 
are essentially important and things that are going to matter 
20, 30 years from now. Well, this topic certainly will and how 
we address it, so thank you for being here. Thank you, Chair, 
for hosting this.
    Dr. Thayer, I think it was you who talked about ``this is 
the greatest shift in American power that we have seen 
transferring to the east.'' This was predicted. Actually, U.S. 
National Intelligence Council in November 2008 released a 
report, and they do this periodically, as I am sure you all 
know. But they said the unprecedented shift in relative wealth 
and economic power roughly from West to East is now underway 
and will continue. They said the United States in relative 
strength, even in military realm, will decline and that U.S. 
leverage will become more and more constrained in terms of 
size, speed, and directional flow. The transfer of global 
wealth and economic power now underway roughly from East to 
West is happening without precedent in modern history.
    And it went on and it explained why it was happening. It 
said it is happening for two reasons: one, we are sending 
manufacturing overseas and we are sending oil and gas revenues 
overseas, and yet, it seems like we have not changed course 
when the prescription was there as it addressed the problem, 
that we continue to send overseas. And you also called this a 
cold war. I have read ``Unrestricted Warfare.'' I know a lot of 
people have, but, you know, the different ways that they talk 
about providing warfare, and this is not even a comprehensive 
list. Of course, they list the traditional ones as well.
    Mr. Atkinson, you mentioned some of these: trade warfare, 
network warfare, biological warfare, biochemical resource 
warfare. I think what is going on at our border and even how 
they are taking advantage of what is happening at the border 
and causing us to use resources, not to mention what they are 
getting across our border in the ways of fentanyl and military-
aged single adults that are coming across our border. Economic 
aid, warfare, regulatory warfare, smuggling, drug warfare, 
electronic space, it just goes on and on. As part of that, they 
said can special funds be set up to exert greater influence on 
another country's government and legislature through lobbying? 
Could buying or gaining control of stocks be used to turn 
another country's newspapers and television stations into tools 
of media warfare? I mean, they are in a no-holds-barred, all-
the-collateral, it seems, warfare against the United States. 
And so, it seems like we have to, first of all, recognize the 
moment, and I know that you all do. I think you are here 
bringing some awareness to that, but I have not felt like our 
government and certainly our State Department has felt that.
    I was wondering, Mr. Ceya--did I say it right--``Cella,'' 
yes--Mr. Cella, if you could explain to me what you have seen 
in regards of our State Department and what you think we should 
be doing to counter what we are seeing coming from China?
    Mr. Cella. Certainly. Thank you for the question, sir. I 
would say that we are where we are. I would say that after the 
cold war, in 1993, we kind of pulled up tent stakes. End of 
history, I would say, could be symbolized in the Indo-Pacific 
with closing of our embassy in the Solomon Islands. China has 
been in that realm, in the late 80's, doing irregular things. 
They had approval by UNESCO to put a tide monitoring station at 
Fiery Cross Reef. What is the Fiery Cross Reef now? A 10,000-
foot runway, a deep-water port, some suggest some missile 
armaments as well.
    So, they have done a lot in a period of time, where, again, 
obviously, our ken shifted to the Middle East and our 
engagements there. But we have a lot of time to make up for, 
and I think it is imperative for really all the interagencies, 
State Department, to provide information and education to the 
public at large. It is a whole-of-society, a whole-of-
government engagement. One element, I think, that is lacking 
within the Foreign Service Institute, for instance, would be to 
have a segment, a section on political warfare. What it is, to 
marinate in who the CCP is, who General Secretary Xi Jinping 
is, what their objectives are, and what they can do before they 
head out to post and what they need to do when they are at 
post.
    Mr. Cloud. When I have talked to leaders, Ambassadors from 
other countries, I have heard this often from different 
continents, even, from different leaders, and they say right 
now obviously, we love the United States, its history of 
freedom. We want to align ourselves to that, but when we talk 
to China, we hear about roads, bridges. When we talk to our 
State Department, we get a lecture, and it is social 
reengineering, you know, in many cases, values that really are 
not embraced in their country, and it is not really about 
creating a relationship or certainly projecting American 
interests. Do you have anything to say to that?
    Mr. Cella. I would say just, back to the Foreign Service 
Institute, an understated tool, I think, that we really should 
build on that I found useful when I was at post, using our 
Judeo-Christian roots as a country and use it as a means of 
outreach in terms of soft power engagement with our host 
countries. That has a mighty impact. China does not do that. 
They do not know how to do it.
    Mr. Cloud. All right.
    Mr. Cella. It is not here and not there. That has to be 
complemented, I think, by some very meaningful engagements. I 
think the COFA, for instance, one material way. I guess that 
when I was there, this was an appeal from other windswept 
nations that I was accredited to, suffering again. There is 
great affinity for us, there is great comity to us, we fought 
for them, bled for them, died for them in World War II--would 
to have been to extend COFA to include countries such as Nauru 
and Kiribati, who, within the last 5 years, have shifted 
allegiance from Taiwan to Beijing.
    Mr. Cloud. I see my time has expired.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair 
now recognizes Ms. Norton from Washington, DC.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Biden-Harris 
Administration knows that one of the best ways to counter the 
Chinese Communist Party is to outcompete them economically. 
That is why President Biden championed the Inflation Reduction 
Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, and thanks to these landmark 
laws, American innovation is thriving and more people have 
high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs. Now America is 
maintaining a competitive advantage over China in strategic 
sectors by investing in our workforce and in American 
businesses. Within 1 year of the CHIPS and Science Act becoming 
law, American companies announced over $160 billion in 
investments in semiconductors and electronics, and the 
semiconductor manufacturing job market is now growing after 
decades of decline.
    So, Mr. Stokes, the CHIPS and Science Act is a strong 
investment in America, but how does it help us compete with 
China?
    Mr. Stokes. I think, in general, you know, chips are 
essential for all of modern industry. And so, to be able to 
have supply chains based in our own country, in addition to 
those based in friendly countries, allies and partners, helps 
improve the resilience of the American economy overall, and 
that makes us more able to compete with China.
    Ms. Norton. The Inflation Reduction Act also invests in 
manufacturing and innovation. It is projected to create 1.5 
million new jobs over the next decade. Dr. Atkinson, how does 
the Inflation Reduction Act and its investments in electric 
vehicle batteries and other clean technology help reduce 
American dependence on Chinese manufacturers?
    Dr. Atkinson. Thank you, Congresswoman. There is no 
question that the generous incentives in IRA have played a big 
role in attracting particularly foreign investment, and we see 
a lot of Korean companies, Japanese companies, European 
companies now investing in factories and R&D facilities, so 
that is critical. But what I would add on the semiconductor 
part as well as this part, it is not enough just to attract 
factories here. You look at the troubles now that Intel is 
facing. Ultimately, what the Chinese want to do is they want to 
destroy Intel, they want to destroy Boeing, they want to 
destroy Merck. And to be fair, the CHIPS and Science Act, which 
we fully supported, is not really a fix for that. Intel is not 
making any money on this program because they are basically 
investing in America, a fab or fabs, that cost a lot more than 
if they were investing in Asia.
    So, while it is a critical program to get production here, 
it does not address the core problem of our companies facing 
predatory practices against Chinese. So overall, IRA is a very 
important program, it helps, but there are a lot of other 
sectors and there is more work to be done.
    Ms. Norton. Well, the Biden-Harris Administration is 
securing America's economy, both now and in the future, to 
compete strategically with China and fight back against the 
Chinese Communist Party. This Administration knows what it 
takes to invest in America's workforce, and this 
Administration, unlike the Trump Administration, has a strong 
approach to bolstering our economy that puts American families 
first. Thank you, and I yield any time I have left to the 
Ranking Member.
    Mr. Raskin. Well, thank you very kindly. Mr. Chairman, I 
did want to do a unanimous consent request. I looked into the 
article that was cited by Representative Mace, and indeed, 
President Biden did call President Xi a smart guy. It was in 
this context. He said, ``We are going to hold China accountable 
to follow the rules,'' Biden said. He framed the competition 
between Washington and Beijing as part of a broader battle 
between democracy and autocracy, saying that Xi ``does not have 
a democratic bone in his body, but he is a smart, smart guy.''
    Now, compare that to what we saw with President Trump, 
where he praised the brilliance and the genius of President Xi 
and said that he envied Xi's control over his body and the 
whole society snaps to attention when he speaks, and that is 
what he wants in America, too. So, I do not think President 
Biden was ever emulating General Xi's political tact, but in 
any event, I would like to submit that for the record.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    The Chair now recognizes Dr. Foxx from North Carolina.
    Ms. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank our 
witnesses for being here today.
    Dr. Thayer, as China asserts itself as a global power, it 
is important that the United States maintains a competitive 
edge so we can prevail against any potential threats. However, 
we see repeated instances where the United States fails to 
comprehend the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party, or 
CCP, and allows the CCP to infiltrate and exploit our 
institutions for nefarious purposes. While the American 
university system was once one of our greatest assets in the 
competition for fast innovation and dynamic leadership, the 
CCP's malign influence and subversion have turned it into a 
potential liability. Foreign dollars flow into the universities 
without accountability and consistently undermine our domestic 
influence. Confucius Institutes subvert traditional American 
values in key areas like equipping students with the skills to 
enter the workforce. American universities are faltering.
    How is it that the Federal Government has failed to 
comprehend the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party to 
our institutions and especially our university system? And let 
me give a finer point on that: how has the lack of leadership 
from the Biden-Harris Administration enabled the CCP's 
political warfare and undermining of our institutions?
    Dr. Thayer. I thank the representative for the question. Of 
course, that is essentially important to understand how this 
occurred. There are three points to make here. First, the 
communist leader, Deng Xiaoping, was one of the greatest 
strategists of the 20th century when he recognized to save the 
Chinese Communist Party, he was going to have to reach out to 
American investors. He was going to have to work out to 
Americans and make them partners, really, in manufacturing and 
trade with the People's Republic of China. That set us on a 
path of engagement with China, where there was the belief in 
the United States that by engaging with China, we would make it 
democratic, we would reform it. And, of course, that has not 
come to pass, and, in fact, the tyranny of the CCP has only 
hardened. With that investment in China, of course, we have 
communities, we have many individuals who have investments in 
the People's Republic of China and have, of course, their 
resources to employ to sustain those relationships. So, as you 
observed, of course, it is very a difficult problem to resolve.
    Third issue, a point just succinctly to make in this 
respect, is that it would be very valuable for the Biden 
Administration to take bold measures to call out the record, 
the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party so that all 
Americans looking at China, the People's Republic of China, can 
see the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party, what they are 
doing, of course, in the Muslim genocide in Xinjiang and 
elsewhere, crushing of the Tibetan people, crushing of their 
own people, and in international politics, of course, hyper 
aggression against the Philippines, for example.
    Ms. Foxx. All right. Well, I think the American people are 
smart enough to understand what a threat China is. I just think 
the Biden-Harris Administration has no clue.
    Ambassador Cella, this Committee and others have uncovered 
countless examples of the CCP's hyper-aggressive political 
warfare tactics, including CCP efforts to weaken America 
through economic warfare, as we just heard. As we have 
discussed, numerous instances of the CCP exploiting academic 
collaborations and U.S. taxpayer funded research for its own 
military gain. Based on your experience as Ambassador, what 
examples of this kind of economic warfare have you seen, and 
what is China's goal?
    Mr. Cella. I will share with you an anecdote on the other 
side of my service in the state of Michigan, reverting back to 
my testimony when I mentioned the PRC-based, CCP-tied company, 
Gotion, that is trying to work its way there. In February 2022, 
the top executives of Gotion--PRC nationals that came in, 
leadership in the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese people's 
consultant of Congress--they requested to divert from their 
planned itinerary and asked to see the AI laboratory at Ferris 
State University. Ferris State University is one of only two 
universities in the United States of America that are funded by 
the NSA and the DoD to do cyber studies, satellite studies, 
cybersecurity, and the driver of the bus was told to not ask 
them any questions or have conversations with them. That 
program has nothing to do what Gotion's designs are. I would 
say probably we know what their designs are, and that is 
indicative and troubling. So, our guard needs to be up, and it 
is not, Madam Congresswoman.
    Ms. Foxx. Thank you again to our witnesses. Mr. Atkinson, I 
am going to submit a question for the record for you. My time 
is up, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The gentlelady yields. The Chair now 
recognizes the Co-Chair of the China Task Force, the gentleman 
from Illinois, Mr. Krishnamoorthi.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to turn to 
a comment that you made and an article that you wrote, Dr. 
Thayer, about engagement with China. In this article, you 
write, ``The U.S. Must End Engagement with PRC Now.'' Isn't 
that what it says?
    Dr. Thayer. What is the title, sir, if you could share?
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Title is, ``The U.S. Must End 
Engagement with PRC Now.''
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. OK. In the article, you wrote that we 
must halt engagement. That is what you wrote, right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And you wrote that, ``This fundamental 
fact was understood during the Trump Administration,'' right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir. The Trump Administration took 
measures to bring about fundamental change from the engagement 
policies that we had had in the post-cold war period.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Right, and to kind of reduce 
engagement, halt engagement, as you said. Well, let us look at 
the facts.
    [Photos]
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Let me show you the first picture, this 
graphic here. Here is a picture of the first summit of Trump 
and Xi at Mar-a-Lago. That is Trump and Xi, right, Dr. Thayer?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir, it is.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Let me show you this next graphic.
    [Photo]
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Here is Chairman Xi hosting Donald 
Trump in China. That is Trump and Xi, right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Let me show you this next picture.
    [Photo]
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. This is a picture of Donald Trump 
engaging with Chairman Xi in Hamburg, Germany. Isn't that, 
right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir. It is a picture of those individuals.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And let me show you this next one.
    [Photo]
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Here is a picture of Donald Trump with 
Xi in Buenos Aires, engaging again, right?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And let me show you this next one.
    [Photo]
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Here is a picture of Donald Trump and 
Chairman Xi engaging with each other in Osaka, Japan. That is 
Trump and Xi, correct?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Dr. Thayer, these are all official 
meetings between Donald Trump and Chairman Xi, and I count just 
five in these pictures here, and I think there are a lot more. 
I would not agree with you at all that we should halt 
engagement between the U.S. and the PRC or that Trump did not 
engage with China. I believe that senior-level engagement with 
China is important. I actually agree with what President Trump 
did, which is engage the PRC. And I would encourage the next 
President, whoever he or she is, to continue that engagement, 
not halt it, as you would suggest, but to continue it, in order 
to make clear to the other side what our red lines are and what 
type of behavior we would expect of them. And this type of 
bipartisan approach by Republicans and Democrats is essential 
for winning the strategic competition between the United States 
and the Chinese Communist Party.
    And I would like to turn to my next topic. One of Xi 
Jinping's senior-most advisors is a gentleman named Wang 
Huning. Wang Huning is a member of the Standing Committee of 
the Politburo, one of the top seven people in China. He wrote a 
book called, ``America Against America,'' in which he describes 
America as a crisis-ridden society, hopelessly divided--
hopelessly divided--including between Democrats and 
Republicans. Mr. Stokes, you would agree with me that the CCP 
and other foreign adversaries seek to keep us fighting, 
Republicans and Democrats fighting with each other because in 
that state, we are much weaker in the competition between the 
U.S. and China, correct?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes, Congressman, I agree.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And so, I feel, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member, partisanship is completely counterproductive to 
our China policy, and that as the Ranking Member of the Select 
Committee on the CCP, we must pursue a bipartisan policy 
because anything else is exactly what the CCP would want. Let 
me turn to my final topic. Mr. Atkinson, you would agree with 
me that the competition between the United States and the CCP 
is not a quarrel with the Chinese people, correct?
    Dr. Atkinson. Correct.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And it is not a quarrel with people of 
Chinese origin, correct?
    Dr. Atkinson. Correct.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And, Ambassador Cella, we should never 
engage in stereotyping about Asian-American people or Chinese-
origin people, right?
    Mr. Cella. One hundred percent, and if it happens, it 
should be condemned.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And if we did engage in that type of 
stereotyping, that is exactly what the CCP would want us to do, 
right?
    Mr. Cella. They are waging political warfare when they do 
it, and we should not be complicit in any way, shape, or form.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And so, Mr. Stokes, in all of our 
comments, in all of our rhetoric, whoever we are, Democrats, 
Republicans, or anyone else, we should never, ever engage in 
any type of rhetoric or behavior that could stoke anti-Asian or 
anti-Chinese origin hate or stereotyping, right?
    Mr. Stokes. Absolutely correct.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. [Presiding.] The gentleman yields. The Chair 
recognizes Ms. Brown from Ohio.
    Ms. Brown. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
the opportunity to, once again, discuss the ways in which----
    Mr. Biggs. Excuse me. I am sorry. One second. Oh, gracious 
sakes, Ms. Brown, I am sorry. I was supposed to go back to this 
side, and that is my bad.
    Ms. Brown. OK.
    Mr. Biggs. I apologize. We will give you the full 5 because 
you were just getting revved up there, so I apologize, yes. 
Well, we will deduct that 15 seconds from Burchett to give to 
you. So now, we will recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, 
Mr. Grothman.
    Mr. Grothman. I will do a follow-up with, who was the last 
guy answering questions? Mr. Cella, was that you? Is China 
trying to divide America and cause dislike between various 
groups?
    Mr. Cella. I would say that is part of gray zone political 
warfare. I do not have access to reports on the high side that 
show their engagements in that respect, but I think there are 
far more tangible ways that the public can see and should see.
    Mr. Grothman. There is a book recently written by 
Christopher Rufo, which has received a lot of favorable 
comment, in which he goes back and finds communists in the 70s 
pushing this racial divide, trying to divide America by race. 
And of course, we have a lot of DEI professionals throughout 
the government now who, I think, their goal is to divide 
America and eventually destroy America by setting one ethnic 
group against the other. Is that something you think that China 
would like to have or to push the idea that people should view 
themselves as members of a subgroup rather than individuals?
    Mr. Cella. Whatever it takes. They would like to win 
without fighting. Back----
    Mr. Grothman. Right. That is exactly right. They believe 
that they are going to take over the United States--I think 
Khrushchev did--that they would take it over without a fight. 
And then this is the type of division that will cause them to 
destroy America when American Congressman push this DEI 
garbage, right?
    Yes, probably.
    OK. Question for Dr. Thayer. We have a lot of farmland in 
Wisconsin. You have studied China's behavior over a period of 
years. They are trying to acquire American farmland. How 
serious a threat is it when China acquires our farmland?
    Dr. Thayer. It is a very serious threat. Obviously, we need 
the food and the product of agricultural products that are 
produced on that land.
    Mr. Grothman. Right. And what becomes of the land when 
China buys? Do they keep renting it out the American farmer? Do 
they put buildings on the land? What happens when they buy this 
land?
    Dr. Thayer. Well, sir, oftentimes it is left fallow. It is 
not used or it can be, in instances, used for nefarious 
purposes. But by taking that farmland, when you understand, 
when you think like the Chinese Communist Party, what you are 
doing is denying those assets, of course, to the United States, 
and you are sending a very important political message that the 
Chinese Communist Party is becoming increasingly powerful in 
the United States.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. Which states have been the big chunks of 
farmland purchased in?
    Dr. Thayer. I think most of the states: North Dakota, South 
Dakota, sir, I know have been. Kansas, I know, is subject to 
this as well. Maine has as well.
    Mr. Grothman. And what is going on with the farmland there 
that used to have corn on it or whatever they have on it? It is 
just sitting there or what? I assume, I do not know how it is 
in those states--in Wisconsin, you would be paying property 
taxes. So, they just pay the property taxes and let it sit 
there, or what do they do?
    Dr. Thayer. Sir, I would say, in general--of course, we are 
not speaking with respect to any specifics--that the land is 
used in a less productive or not to the extent or with the 
intent that we would like to see the land used from the 
standpoint of the health of the American people and the 
American economy.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. I guess I will follow up there again 
because maybe I am not getting exactly the detail I want. What 
physically becomes of that land? If they buy land in Kansas, 
rent it out to another farmer, pay the property taxes and get 
nothing for it. What is going on?
    Dr. Thayer. They can do all of that, sir, and we also are 
aware of a particularly pernicious practice of buying farmland 
around Air Force bases and other military facilities, bases, 
ports, where drones and other intelligence collections can 
exist.
    Mr. Grothman. Do they build anything on that land? OK. If 
they buy, whatever, a 2,000-acre farm in North Dakota, do they 
put anything on that land?
    Dr. Thayer. I would say, as a rule of thumb, sir, no.
    Mr. Grothman. OK. And so, do you think part of it is just 
to exercise their power and tell the U.S., we are here, we are 
taking over?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir. It is a very important and powerful 
political message.
    Mr. Grothman. And do any Chinese citizens who are here wind 
up ever living on the land or farming the land?
    Dr. Thayer. Sir, I believe that there are many reports 
where they are resident on the land, and I would assume that 
includes an aspect of living on the land there, sir.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair 
recognizes--and I apologize again, but this time we are really 
ready to go--the gentlelady from Ohio, Ms. Brown.
    Ms. Brown. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. I would be 
remiss if I did not take the opportunity to address my 
colleague's comment as it relates to DEI. As a Black woman, I 
just want to point out that people that look like me in this 
country have been historically, traditionally, systemically, 
institutionally, and structurally held back because of our skin 
color. So, I am always disappointed when my colleagues attempt 
to attack, dismantle, discredit, and just discount DEI when it 
is really designed to provide equal opportunities when all 
things and qualifications are equal, to attempt to bring people 
who have not otherwise had these opportunities because of their 
gender or race, to get those opportunities. So, I just want to 
set the record straight that DEI does not divide, in fact, 
grows the pie and gives opportunity to other people.
    So, I appreciate the opportunity to once again discuss the 
ways in which the Biden-Harris Administration is putting 
America in the best possible position regarding competition 
with the Chinese Communist Party. As a member of the Select 
Committee on Strategic Competition With the CCP, I have been 
monitoring firsthand the progress of this Administration and 
Democratic policies in countering everything from illegal 
Chinese manufacturing policies, which severely hurt American 
industries, to tracing the fentanyl crisis back to its roots in 
China.
    I want to highlight three important steps the Biden Harris 
Administration can and should continue to build on. One, since 
President Biden and Vice President Harris signed the CHIPS and 
Science Bill into law, U.S. companies have announced more than 
$160 billion in investments in semiconductor and electronics. 
CHIPS and Science also authorized $170 billion to support 
science and innovation. No longer will the CCP continue to 
outpace the United States thanks to this action. No. 2, 
President Biden and Vice President Harris has brought together 
our allies and partners to achieve substantial success on the 
global stage, like the agreement between Australia, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States, to commit to unprecedented 
partnership in the Pacific. And three, the Biden-Harris 
Administration has taken significant steps to hold bad actors 
in China engaged in hacking, espionage, and cyber campaigns 
accountable.
    Now, in March, the Department of Justice indicted seven 
Chinese hackers charged with targeting CCP critics, businesses, 
and political officials through a coordinated cyber 
intimidation effort, and given the unprecedented nature of 
these attacks, this is where I would like to focus today. So, I 
remain very concerned about potential misuse of artificial 
intelligence by our adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran to 
influence Americans through the spread of disinformation.
    It is very troubling that social media sites, from Twitter 
to TikTok, can act as a funnel of MDI--mis- and 
disinformation--or, as I like to call it, lies, streaming 
directly onto our phones each and every day. Earlier this year, 
I introduced legislation, the Securing Elections from AI 
Deception Act, to prohibit the use of artificial intelligence 
to deprive or defraud individuals of their right to vote and 
require disclaimers on AI-generated election content. I also 
recently sent a letter to the Federal Elections Commission, 
urging them to clarify Federal law prohibiting fraudulent 
misrepresentation and how it applies to deceptive AI generated 
political campaign communication. At the same time, the Biden-
Harris Administration is in overdrive, working to protect our 
elections and exposing these plots as they are uncovered.
    So, Mr. Stokes, can you speak to how the CCP is using 
disinformation online to engage in persuasion campaigns in 
democracies around the world, including our own?
    Mr. Stokes. Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman. This 
is absolutely a major challenge. China's point of innovation, 
politically, for them has been the use of mis- and 
disinformation. They test it out at home and then kind of roll 
it out around the world. We have seen, for example, a group 
known as Spamouflage, which is really focused on impersonating 
U.S. people on social media platforms, again, to exacerbate 
existing social tensions and divide Americans. And I think that 
is just, as you indicated, the early edge of what AI might be 
able to do to supercharge mis- and disinformation. And so, I 
think we need to be preemptive in trying to respond to that 
actively.
    Ms. Brown. And with my additional 15 seconds, can you tell 
us, maybe, in short order, how the Biden-Harris Administration 
has held the CCP accountable over its spread of disinformation, 
and what more Congress can do to support these efforts?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes. I think calling it out as it is, taking 
down, as you said, cyber networks that are based in China that 
are doing espionage and disinformation, I think those are two 
pieces of the puzzle.
    Ms. Brown. Thank you, and with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back. Thank you.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentlelady yields. The Chair now recognize 
the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Palmer, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Thayer, we have heard a lot of discussion 
about where we are heading with renewables and EVs and things 
like that. But aside from that, the United States is very 
dependent on critical minerals, rare earth elements, and China 
basically controls that. They control 70 percent of the cobalt 
mining, 80 percent of the processing, and to my knowledge, 
there is not a single major rare earth element refinery in the 
western hemisphere. Do you consider that a threat to our 
security?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir, absolutely, it is a threat.
    Mr. Palmer. And one of the problems that we face in this 
country, and it has particularly been true in the last 3 1/2 
years, is the inability to get a mine permitted, processing 
facility permitted, a refinery permitted. And I am very 
concerned about this in regard to China because China has 
already fired a shot across the bow a couple of years ago when 
they cutoff supplies of germanium, and I believe the other one 
was gallium, rare earth elements that we need, that our defense 
forces need. I think that is a clear and present danger in 
terms of a threat to our national economy, economic security, 
and our national security.
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir, it certainly is a threat to it as 
increasingly these minerals are needed for the sinews of 
American national security.
    Mr. Palmer. Right, and this is true not only in United 
States, but in the entire Western Hemisphere.
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Palmer. When we do not have a single refinery for rare 
earth elements in the western hemisphere, it is a major, major 
problem, which leads me to the situation in Taiwan. If China 
were to attack Taiwan, and it appeared they were going to be 
successful, I think it is fairly clear that those semiconductor 
microchip facilities would no longer exist. China has never 
really mastered manufacturing of semiconductors, microchips. 
Now, we are building four facilities here in the United States, 
but we really do not make anything here, do we? We manufacture 
things from parts we get from China, from these critical 
minerals and rare earth elements.
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir, very few in the United States. Taiwan 
is absolutely essential.
    Mr. Palmer. So, what we have got to do here, if we want to 
have the ability to defend ourselves against China, is we have 
got to get serious about procuring our own critical minerals 
through mining, processing, and refining, and that includes the 
rare earth elements. Would you agree with that?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir, and I would broaden it to the entire 
defense industrial base.
    Mr. Palmer. Absolutely, and our economic base.
    Dr. Thayer. Yes.
    Mr. Palmer. I mean, the panel on your washing machine will 
not function without these critical minerals. I would also like 
to point out, if I may----
    We are not in order.
    Mr. Biggs. The Committee will be in order.
    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. TikTok is an 
intelligence-gathering tool and a tool for degrading Western 
culture and values. I also serve on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, and we had a classified briefing about this, and we 
voted in this Congress to ban TikTok, which the Biden 
Administration has delayed that until January to give 
ByteDance, the parent company, an opportunity to divest TikTok. 
Would you agree that TikTok is a threat to us as an 
intelligence tool of China?
    Dr. Thayer. It absolutely is.
    Mr. Palmer. Does it degrade our culture and our values?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Palmer. All right. I also want to address the issue of 
what China is doing in Sub-Saharan Africa and in South and 
Central America. They are basically turning these countries 
into vassal states through debt diplomacy. There are probably 
eight or nine countries that are on the verge of default as a 
result of this, and they are basically using these countries to 
provide food and mineral resources. They are pillaging, in my 
opinion, these countries, but at the same time, they are 
advancing their ability to project power through infrastructure 
construction, it is my understanding. And Mr. Atkins and Mr. 
Cella, you can address this if you have knowledge of this, it 
is my understanding that Xi Jinping will be in Peru in 
November, cutting the ribbon on a major seaport that will 
compete with our West Coast seaports, but will handle any naval 
military vessel that China puts in the water. Is that correct? 
Do you know?
    Mr. Cella. I can speak to my knowledge of time of service 
in the Indo-Pacific, and it spans the Indo-Pacific, sir.
    Mr. Palmer. There is a book called, ``The Hundred-Year 
Marathon,'' by Michael Pillsbury, one of the top analysts at 
the CIA on China, that I commend everyone should read this 
book. But China's agenda is, by 2049, is to establish itself as 
the dominant power in the world, and I think the American 
people and the people in the West need to be aware of this and 
need to wake up and need to engage. I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Lee.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our national security 
deserves to be taken seriously. It deserves actual oversight. 
This hearing today and all the others before, since we are on 
part three now, are not serious. My Republican colleagues are 
so hellbent on making a boogeyman, that they are deliberately 
ignoring actual problems we can address and, in the process, 
actually undermining our national security. And while our 
national security must be a priority, it must also be balanced 
in a way that is not bigoted, xenophobic, or racist. Only 
focusing on China and the CCP not only leaves us vulnerable to 
attacks from elsewhere, but it also poses a risk to the 
personal safety, civil rights, and civil liberties of Chinese 
Americans and Chinese immigrants living in the U.S.
    We saw this with the Trump Administration's China 
Initiative. They said this was meant to protect labs and 
businesses from espionage. Instead, it was used as a tool of 
discrimination. Nearly 90 percent of the more than 150 cases 
brought by the FBI under the initiative were against ethnically 
Chinese people, and many of the cases were the result of simple 
administrative errors and no obvious connection to national 
security or the theft of intellectual property or trade 
secrets. So, Mr. Stokes, how did this initiative affect Chinese 
American scientists, and did this impact our research 
landscape?
    Mr. Stokes. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman. I 
think overall, the initiative--I think the Justice Department 
has said that it, you know, fostered an environment of at least 
apparent bias, right, and had a bit of a chilling factor over 
the scientific community. So, while, on the one hand, it is 
certainly right that China is seeking to steal our 
technological and scientific secrets, I think it is right to 
refocus the initiative on the actual networks at play, rather 
than kind of casting aspersions over a broad group of people.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you. It is giving major HUAC [sic] feelings 
right now. This was just McCarthyism in a new form. Under the 
initiative, scientists falsely accused of having ties to the 
CCP had their lives upended and their careers compromised, but 
Republicans want to bring back the China Initiative. In fact, 
House Republicans recently passed a bill that would do just 
that, though, under a slightly different name: the CCP 
Initiative. Mr. Stokes, would changing the name of the China 
Initiative to the CCP Initiative, without any concrete changes 
to its implementation, make it more effective at uncovering 
efforts to steal U.S. intellectual property?
    Mr. Stokes. I think that the name does matter, but I think, 
as you indicated, what actually goes on under the auspices of 
the initiative matters just as much, if not more. And again 
because of the scope of the threat, to be able to be focusing 
resources on areas where are not where the threat is actually 
emanating from, I think means we will miss some of where the 
threat is actually emanating from. And so, to the extent that 
you can revise the initiative to focus more on the real 
networks at play, it would be both more effective and more 
consistent with our values.
    Ms. Lee. So, the assumption that a person is more likely to 
be a CCP spy because they are Chinese or because someone might 
think they look Chinese is incredibly harmful, and we have seen 
it happen in this very Committee. In January 2023, Chairman 
Comer appeared to repeatedly accuse Kathy Chung, a U.S. citizen 
born in South Korea, very much not China, who previously served 
as an aide to then Vice President Biden, of being a CCP spy. We 
have also seen how the rhetoric around China, particularly from 
Republicans, has led to increased discrimination against 
Chinese Americans and Chinese immigrants in the United States. 
Just look back at what was being said during COVID. Trump 
frequently referred to COVID-19 as ``the China virus, the 
Chinese virus, and Kong flu.'' He has kept this going, using 
this phrase at RNC just this past July and just last week at a 
townhall in Michigan. This language led to a dramatic increase 
in anti-Asian hate between 2019 and 2021, and 1 in 3 members of 
the AAPI community experienced racial abuse in 2023.
    Mr. Stokes, can you explain how this kind of language can 
contribute to an increase in hate incidents or racial abuse 
against Chinese and other Asian Americans?
    Mr. Stokes. I would say, in general, the President of the 
United States has an immense agenda-setting power, and so to 
use language of that nature does contribute and, in certain 
cases, may even enable people to take bias and racially 
motivated actions. But, again, I think, at least from my 
expertise, about how it relates to strategic competition with 
China, the fact that we can be an inclusive, diverse society 
that is governed by the rule of law is something we have, that 
China does not. That is an asset that we should work very hard 
to retain.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you. I appreciate your comments. I just want 
to conclude by saying, with caution, that when my colleagues 
speak about the CCP threat in careless or bigoted or xenophobic 
terms, they make all Chinese Americans and Chinese immigrants 
into a boogeyman, and it is wrong. We must talk about it in a 
way that gets very specifically at the harm, at the threats, 
and not in such a wide net that harms people who are innocent. 
I thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentlelady yields. The Chair now recognizes 
the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins.
    Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Atkinson, I 
believe you would be the gentleman to address what I am going 
to inquire about. And please share your insight regarding the 
Chinese Communist Party's presence as it manifests itself 
within our university structures across the country, 
acknowledging that the university culture is inherently open, 
designed to include a free exchange of ideas. And of course, I 
support that culture, but that freedom carries with it a 
particular risk to our republic and to the free world when it 
relates to the development of emerging technologies that can be 
weaponized and militarized by the Communist Chinese Party. And 
we are essentially funding it through our universities and 
having CCP-associated students, in some way--them, their 
family--let us say, they finish their studies, they return to 
China, they end up working for the CCP. There are many, many 
instances of this, and we are concerned about it. Are you 
familiar with the report that was recently produced by the 
House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and House 
Education and Workforce Committee, Mr. Atkinson?
    Dr. Atkinson. Somewhat.
    Mr. Higgins. I hope you do not have it memorized. It is a 
lot. But they had identified over 8,000 publications that DoD 
funded that included papers covering topics like hypersonics, 
directed energy weapons, nuclear and high energy physics, and 
artificial intelligence, and autonomous solutions, all in the 
realm of the emerging modern weaponry of the 21st century, 
funded by DoD through our university systems that includes more 
than 2,000 of those papers. DoD-funded papers included the PRC 
coauthors who were directly affiliated with PRC's defense 
research and industrial base. Will you share with this 
Committee and with America, your opinion on what dangers that 
presents to the entire world when we are willingly, knowingly 
funding the advancement of Chinese Communist Party 21st century 
weaponization through our university systems, Mr. Atkinson?
    Dr. Atkinson. So, Congressman, I think the short answer is, 
it is outrageous. It definitely is a way that the Chinese are 
getting an advantage over us. Their core policy at the 
beginning of what they do is suction up or hoover up as much 
knowledge, technical knowledge, as possible. They are using 
this weakness in our system to achieve that.
    I will say it is important to, and you are not saying this, 
I know, but some people say that, you know, that certain 
university, we should blame them. Look, if I were a university 
president and I want more money and the Federal Government is 
cutting back, I am going to go to China. I think we need to 
make that a choice there that they cannot make. So, I would 
say, any university, public or private, that receives any 
Chinese money should be ineligible for Federal funding.
    A second area that I would say is, if you look at postdocs, 
very few Chinese postdocs, if any, stay in this country. They 
are coming here to advance their agenda. I think we should have 
a ban on Chinese postdocs, but I would not put a ban, for 
example, on Chinese Ph.D. students. Some of them stay here, 
some of them do not, but clearly there is no way we should 
allow any Chinese company or institution to fund our research 
at university.
    Mr. Higgins. May I ask you, sir, on this topic, do you 
think it would be beneficial for Congress to discuss imposing 
requirements on universities, our research and development 
laboratory universities, that require basic level of security 
within those laboratories, because if you have been in these 
laboratories, and I am quite sure you have, there is virtually 
no security. Even when you have, like, an electronic pass on 
the door, commonly, you will find a door, like, propped open 
because that is the culture in the university--it is a free 
exchange of ideas and studies. So, do you think it would be 
beneficial for the security of our country if Congress 
discussed imposing security requirements on our universities?
    Dr. Atkinson. I do. You did not see this problem back in 
the 50's and 60's. Very few research universities collaborated 
with the Soviet Union because we knew they are an adversary, 
and yet our universities have not caught up to that. So, I 100 
percent agree that we need to take stronger steps.
    Mr. Higgins. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this hearing, 
and I yield. And I thank the witnesses.
    Chairman Comer. [Presiding.] The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes Mr. Goldman from New York.
    Mr. Goldman. My, my, my, here we are for the third 
installment of the Defending America from the CCP's Political 
Warfare. After the Chairman's impeachment investigation 
revealed zero connections between President Biden and Chinese 
businesses, he nonetheless shockingly views the nakedly 
partisan political sham impeachment as a success. Why? Because 
President Biden dropped out of the Presidential race. Now, that 
is a blatant admission that this Committee was used improperly 
for partisan purposes, but that failure has not stopped the 
Chairman from continuing down this road. Now that Governor Tim 
Walz is on the ticket, Chairman Comer has quickly pivoted to 
focus this Committee's resource on Governor Walz's time 
teaching English in China, insinuating that somehow that is a 
problem.
    What we really need to be focusing on as it relates to 
CCP's political warfare is defending this Committee from that 
political warfare. Remember, we have two witnesses who were the 
star witnesses of the impeachment investigation. The first, Gal 
Luft, turned out to be an indicted unregistered foreign agent 
of the Chinese Government. Among the allegations in Gal Luft's 
indictment was that he, at the behest of Chinese entities, 
recruited and paid an unnamed advisor to then President-Elect 
Donald Trump to adopt pro-Chinese positions. And even though he 
also was charged with making false statements to the FBI, 
Chairman Comer bragged and said Gal Luft is a very credible 
witness on Biden family corruption. That was not all the 
political warfare that we experienced during this impeachment 
investigation. Alexander Smirnov is a Russian indicted as a 
source for the FBI, who literally met with Russian officials to 
peddle lies to the FBI. You know what those lies were? They 
were the same allegations that the Chairman made against Joe 
Biden in this Committee, Russian propaganda.
    Now, this is not, unfortunately, the Chairman's only 
connections to China. Just months after our last hearing on the 
CCP political influence, a news report alleged that while he 
was the agriculture commissioner and candidate for Governor of 
Kentucky, the Chairman was involved in a failed Chinese hemp 
deal that would have benefited a campaign donor's company. This 
deal not only failed, but it turned out that Chairman Comer 
accidentally imported illegal marijuana instead of legal hemp, 
so maybe we should be investigating Chairman Comer's ties to 
the CCP.
    But there is more political warfare from China that this 
Committee should be investigating. Let us start with former 
President Trump, who acknowledged that he had a Chinese bank 
account that he used at least from 2013 to 2015 and his own 
lawyer said that it remained open throughout his presidency. Or 
let us talk about Ivanka Trump's fast-track trademarks that she 
received in 2 months, 18 of them, even though it usually takes 
18 months. Coincidentally, I am sure, it happened right after 
Donald Trump intervened to save a sanctioned Chinese 
electronics maker, ZTE. And China's biggest state-controlled 
bank rented three floors in Trump Tower while Donald Trump was 
President, netting him $7 million.
    Now, the Chairman will not investigate these incidents 
because the goal is not really here to combat political warfare 
or foreign influence in our politics. It is simply to use this 
Committee to baselessly smear Democratic Presidential and vice-
Presidential candidates. But the American people know which 
Presidential candidate is a danger to our national security, 
and it is the one who accepts millions of dollars from foreign 
governments while he is President, and it is the one who sucks 
up to dictators and despots all around the world, who cannot 
even say that the democratic country of Ukraine should win the 
war against Vladimir Putin.
    So, this unfortunately, while an important topic, is a 
waste of time as we sit 6 weeks before the election, and as 
usual, we could have been doing so many better things with our 
time. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Mr. Biggs from 
Arizona.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, panelists, 
for being here. I appreciate your testimony. It has been 
insightful. I have read all of your statements, and one way or 
another, each of you has either directly mentioned or alluded 
to elite capture. And I just want to ask, and I will start with 
you, Dr. Atkinson, what kind of elites are being captured? Who 
does the CCP target?
    Dr. Atkinson. All. Pretty much all the elites, they try.
    Mr. Biggs. So, they would like to trap politicians. They 
would like to snare university professors, researchers. They 
would like to get media.
    Dr. Atkinson. Think tanks.
    Mr. Biggs. Think tanks. They would like to get control of 
these folks. I have an interesting one. I thought it was 
interesting because it was by the New York Times, and it talks 
about the capture of a special interest group called Code Pink, 
which, in 2015, they condemned China, supported the Uyghurs. By 
the time 2022 rolls around, Code Pink now is being funded 
through a CCP cutout, and now it is the Uyghurs who are 
terrorists, and they are threatening to disrupt the CCP. Would 
that be an example of elite capture that CCP would pursue?
    Dr. Atkinson. I am not familiar with that case. I have read 
about it, but yes, absolutely, that would be a good example, if 
that were the case.
    Mr. Biggs. So, I will ask some other questions here. Now, 
Dr. Thayer, in one of your books--I am going to dovetail on 
this here--are there specific departments or offices within 
Federal agencies that are particularly vulnerable to CCP 
influence or neglecting the seriousness of the threat?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir. Yes.
    Mr. Biggs. And why do you think these departments are 
susceptible, and can you name some of those departments?
    Dr. Thayer. Well, as a rule of thumb, all departments and 
agencies are going to be vulnerable to the capture. Clearly, 
the CCP would be putting priority on national security 
departments and agencies, but it is a problem which is endemic 
to the Federal Government, state, local, tribal, and 
territorial governments.
    Mr. Biggs. And I meant to ask you, Ambassador Cella, about 
the Gotion case because in your opening statement and in your 
written remarks, you talk about what I would call classic 
mechanisms to capture elite. Would you expand on that, please?
    Mr. Cella. Textbook. I engaged with my former Ambassadorial 
colleague, Peter Hoekstra, former congressional colleague of 
yours, in this endeavor. And from the outset, Congressman, the 
intertwining of this PRC-based and CCP company, the CEO, Zhen 
Li, and his son are both members of the Chinese People's 
Consultant of Congress, the policy advising body for the 
Chinese Communist Party, United Front Work Group. They have a 
Thousand Talent station in their office in California that 
vacuums up people, intel, intellectual property, by its nature. 
So, they intertwined early working government elites, business 
elites, economic development organizations, and requiring them 
to sign the binding and punitive 5- and 10-year nondisclosure 
agreements, again, radically contrary to the published memo 
from the NCSC of July 2022 that require them to do just the 
opposite, and it is skirted by those Federal agencies that----
    Mr. Biggs. CFIUS.
    Mr. Cella. Correct.
    Mr. Biggs [continuing]. Treasury, CFIUS.
    Mr. Cella. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Biggs. So, we have talked about elite capture a little 
bit here. All of you mentioned somewhere or another this is not 
unlike or dissimilar from the post-World War II cold war 
competition, adversarial relationship we had with the former 
Soviet Union, but it is really distinctive. And, Dr. Atkinson, 
you pointed out in one way earlier, and that is, there is an 
economic integration, right? There is an economic integration 
between China and the U.S. today. So, if we were to actually 
treat China, in particular because of the CCP, as the 
geopolitical adversary it really is, my question is for all of 
the panelists, how do you disaggregate or decouple our 
relationship? Specifically, I am going to mention critical 
minerals, which we are dependent on. Our supply chain is 
dependent upon China, and if you want Green New Deal EV stuff, 
you have got to have the critical minerals that we do not allow 
to have developed here. And so, with that, I am going to ask 
all of you to respond. We will start with Dr. Thayer and go on 
down the line.
    Dr. Thayer. OK. Thank you very much, indeed, for the 
question, Congressman Biggs. What needs to be done is to change 
the paradigm, to change the way that we think about China, 
right, and recognize that the CCP is in control of it. It is a 
malign force which is targeting us for destruction, and act 
accordingly. So, we need to move from an engagement paradigm, 
if you will, to one which is a realistic paradigm, recognizing 
the nature of the geostrategic threat that we face. With 
respect to critical minerals, of course that is absolutely 
essential. It is a major vulnerability that we pose, as we have 
discussed earlier, and ensuring that our supply chains are not 
affected by that, as well as how those minerals would feed 
into, of course, the defense industrial base and other critical 
technologies. It should be one of the top priorities that we 
have.
    Dr. Atkinson. So, as a think tank, we have been focused on 
the China challenge since 2008 and I would challenge anybody to 
suggest that we are weak on China. But what I will say is, I 
worry sometimes about the complete decoupling argument. We 
should be selling Starbucks in China. I mean, what difference 
does it make? We should be taking as much money out of the 
Chinese economy as possible. So, for example, the decision to 
cutoff Intel sales and Qualcomm sales to Huawei of chips was a 
mistake because Huawei got those chips on their own, and all we 
did is weaken a company who is already in trouble, which is 
Intel. So, I think what we need to do is we need to make sure 
that we decouple on the most critical parts.
    And in terms of rare earth minerals, there are really two 
parts of that answer. One is we need a regulatory system that 
allows it to be built, but the second and most fundamental is 
we need a tariff floor because what the Chinese do is they do 
predatory pricing. As soon as somebody wants to get in the 
market, they undercut the price, drive them out of business, 
and everybody knows that is the deal. So, if we set a tariff 
floor that says, you cannot sell this below a cost and we get 
our Canadian and Australian allies with us, then we build the 
security for companies to be able to invest in rare earth. 
Absent that, I do not see it changing very much.
    Mr. Cella. You may have seen, Congressman, Deputy Secretary 
of State, Kurt Campbell, the other day say, frankly, the cold 
war pales in comparison to the multifaceted challenges that 
China presents. So, I think you take his words, and you look at 
our foot posture, and it is not commensurate with the threat. 
So, I really think, under the umbrella of a more modernized 
version of the National Security Act of 1947 that engages the 
China threat head-on, is vital, and it will work within the 
intergovernmental agency.
    Mr. Stokes. Thank you for the question, Congressman. I 
think, as we consider decoupling, we have to think about the 
overall strategy. Obviously, we got to start with security 
areas that relate directly to security and military affairs. 
And then I think we should move kind of to the next layer of 
strategic industries, the places that are going to command the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution, and what is the U.S. position 
vis-a-vis China and indeed the rest of the world there. And 
then I think a third pillar of this strategy is about, you 
know, again, as we think often of these U.S. China terms, we 
should think about how do we expand our trade ties with the 
rest of the world, to put ourselves in a more competitive 
position, but also make ourselves less reliant on China and 
more resilient in the face of the challenge.
    Chairman Comer. The gentlemen time has expired. The Chair 
now recognizes Mr. Connolly from Virginia.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to the 
panel.
    Mr. Atkinson, I was intrigued by your testimony because 
several parts of it really resonate with my own view about how 
we engage with China and how we respond to China, and I guess, 
the bottom line for me is always operate from strength, never 
from weakness. And I fear that Presidents of both parties, for 
a long, long time, we turned a blind eye to Chinese behavior, 
especially intellectual theft, which has allowed them to 
leapfrog technological milestones at our expense and our 
subsidies in terms of R&D. Why do you think the United States, 
frankly, and to both parties, for a long time turned a blind 
eye to Chinese behavior?
    And just parenthetically, in 2008-2009, when I first came 
here, we had a listening session to a number of industries, 
including software industry, Microsoft, in the state of 
Washington. But we heard everything from software to candy 
manufacturers about absolute, blatant theft, even stealing the 
candy maker's candy box design. I mean, it is that bad, and 
nothing happened. The U.S. Government did nothing, and that was 
under the Bush Administration. I do not know that the 
subsequent administrations got any better. I think Trump got 
tough, and I think this Administration showed some serious 
responses. But why did we allow, such a long period of time, 
blatant Chinese intellectual theft and other behaviors that are 
malign and clearly hindered our interest?
    Dr. Atkinson. Well, Congressman, that is absolutely right, 
the famous case where Huawei stole the Cisco code, and they 
included an error in the code in their own system. So, what 
happened? Not very much. There was a gentleman who wrote an op-
ed in the Washington Post about 10 years ago or whatever, and 
he said we should not worry about Chinese intellectual property 
theft, that is just going to make us innovate more, and that 
has been the elite view. The elite view has been we are so much 
better than them, our innovation system is superior to theirs, 
and we finally have to wake up and say, wait a minute. When you 
are stealing intellectual property, when your R&D expenses can 
be this much because you are getting everything for free, you 
are facing an intense, robust competitor. So, we just have to 
wake up. The second big problem we have is that if----
    Mr. Connolly. By the way, I am sorry to interrupt, but I 
mean, the test of that point of view is, and how did that work 
out for us? Are they weaker today or stronger, or we had a less 
competitive advantage than we were back then?
    Dr. Atkinson. We are much, much worse on.
    Mr. Connolly. Right.
    Dr. Atkinson. Much worse on. I would add one other 
component of that, and that is, we have a law on the books from 
1930 and it is a program called Section 337 at the U.S. 
International Trade Commission. And what Section 337 allows is 
somebody to bring a case against a Chinese company or any 
company, but particularly China, that steals our intellectual 
property. And if you win the case, you get a 10-year exclusion 
order against everything the Chinese company makes. U.S. 
companies have lost those cases because the judge rules, yes, 
they have stolen your intellectual property, but they have not 
reduced your market because we have a provision in U.S. trade 
law, which, if I were God, I would erase it tomorrow, which 
says, you have to show harm.
    The problem is, the Chinese go into these markets where 
that is growing. They take all the market share, and the 
existing companies, let us just say their sales are a million, 
they keep being a million. Under U.S. trade law, that American 
company cannot win that case, and there was a case that I can 
share with you where that was added. So, Congress needs to just 
change that law. That is an antiquated law. You should not have 
to require the showing of loss of sales. You just should show 
intellectual property theft and they are coming after you.
    Mr. Connolly. Yes. I guess, final question, if I may. There 
are various sources and observers who believe that we sometimes 
overstate the Chinese threat to the United States, militarily, 
economically. After all they have got their own economic 
problems. They have got a population infertility decline that 
could be quite dramatic. What is your view about that?
    Dr. Atkinson. It is a critical mistake to make. Look, their 
labor productivity will exceed ours by at least double for the 
next 30 or 40 years, so that alone means the Chinese economy is 
going to grow significantly faster than the U.S. economy. Their 
so-called decline in population, they have 1.3 billion people, 
all right? So, they get down to a billion in 30, 40 years, or 
50 years, that is a billion people that we have to face.
    And then on top of that, we have to remember the challenge 
is not about the Chinese GDP per se. China does not care about 
its GDP. What they care about is winning in advanced 
industries. They care about dominating quantum computing. They 
care about dominating space technology. They care about 
dominating biotechnology. We just finished up a study at ITI, 
an 18-month study looking at Chinese innovation capabilities in 
10 industries. Two of them, they are ahead of us. The six of 
them, they were making rapid progress, and we estimated they 
would overtake us within a decade. So, we cannot underestimate 
their capabilities. They are very, very strong.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you so much. I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Biggs.

    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes the ranking member.
    Mr. Raskin. Two unanimous consent requests. One is the 
Biden-Harris Administration's October 2022 National Security 
Strategy, and second is a letter to you, Mr. Chairman, from the 
White House, dated September 9, 2024, describing the 
Administration's strategy to fight China, including investing 
in our strength, aligning with partners, managing competition, 
and protecting democratic values and institutions.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Chairman 
Sessions, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Sessions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I want to 
follow up on the interesting dialog that my friend and 
gentleman from Virginia did, and that was, good gosh, can we 
catch on? Can we catch on that the Chinese are here? They are 
not just competitors. They are for our demise. We were told 
years and years ago they wanted to be a part of the world 
market, they would respect intellectual property, rule of law, 
tariffs, they would do all of these things, and I think there 
is more than enough evidence to suggest they do not do that. 
The gentleman from Virginia, insightfully, and I agree with 
him, well, what did we do about these things that happened that 
we were aware of?
    Mr. Atkinson, the Homeland Security in January 2021 put out 
a document that was entitled, ``DHS Strategic Action Plan to 
Counter the Threat Posed by the People's Republic of China.'' I 
should have gotten each of you a copy of this, and I will make 
sure that happens, but before that, I will see if I can coach 
you along. Well into, I think, page 11, continuing to protect 
the homeland, border security and immigration, ensure the 
effective removal of PRC nationals from the United States. At 
present, January 21, 40,800 PRC nationals in the United States 
are subject to final orders of removal. Well, we are accused of 
making this politicized, but the bottom line is, the gentleman 
from Virginia and I are pretty close on the same page. What are 
we doing about the threat? Mr. Atkinson, what would you, say, 
ensure the effective removal of, back in 2021, 40,000 nationals 
that were subject to final orders of removal?
    Dr. Atkinson. Well, again, Congressman, with the caveat 
being I do not know that case. If that is the case, I do not 
see any reason why we would allow them to continue to be in our 
country.
    Mr. Sessions. OK. How about the some 16,000, as I 
understand it, may be the last count I saw, Chinese that came 
here over some short period of time that wandered across our 
Southern border. Would you call that politics, or would you 
call that good common sense that you would like to know who 
they are and remove them since they did not follow a legal 
process?
    Dr. Atkinson. So, I do not want to comment on immigration 
policy per se, but I do think it is critical to understand who 
they are. They are different. Look, back in the Soviet Russia 
days, if somebody was Russian, that raised the question, it is 
obvious. If somebody was French, we did not raise the same 
question. So, I do think having somebody coming into the 
country from China is in a different category.
    Mr. Sessions. So, I am trying to really go to where the 
gentleman from Virginia was. What are we doing to counter the 
threat that we already know that the PRC has already openly 
said what they are attempting to manipulate, and do we just let 
this go on? Ambassador, do you have a thought on this?
    Mr. Cella. No, we do not let it go on, sir. I think we have 
to operate eyes wide open. I think there has been a great deal 
of naivete over a long period of time. I mean, you could say 
did it begin with Nixon's opening up to China, and then from 
there, I think there is----
    Mr. Sessions. Yes, but they changed their mind. They lied.
    Mr. Cella. Well, so, but there has been complacency, I 
think, profit making. I think we have been anesthetized. I 
think Wall Street is engaged, but I think we really need to be 
nimble, informed, and educated, whole of society, whole of 
government, and commensurate with the threat. You look at the 
2018-2019 National Intelligence Law, the 2015 National Security 
Law, it requires, as directed, PRC nationals, whether they are 
in the PRC or anywhere around the world, to surveil, collect, 
and report as directed or voluntarily, and sometimes they are 
paid for it. So, why we do not have our footing correspondingly 
is outrageous.
    Mr. Sessions. Well, I think that these are things that we 
can find common ground to work on. I think the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia should be concerned, but I think every 
person on this Committee should and look at this as an 
important hearing to ask professionals, not just us, what they 
think. And I think all four of you have been able to present 
yourself in such a way that the case is we have a problem, and 
we better get ourself together, and part of that means we 
better protect the American people, not just American 
intellectual property. Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. Very good 
questions, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Connolly, and that is what we 
want to do here. We want to identify the problem and try to 
come up with a bipartisan solution. The Chair recognizes Mr. 
Moskowitz.
    Mr. Moskowitz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with Mr. 
Sessions. I think the threat of China is real. That is why I 
voted for the China Select Committee, and I would also like to 
come up with bipartisan solutions, but unfortunately, that is 
not what the Chairman is doing with this issue. Tim Walz was 
announced as the vice-Presidential candidate, and immediately 
the Chairman opens up an investigation into the Vice President. 
In fact, the Chairman goes on to say, ``China has a vice-
Presidential candidate who has gone on record praising the 
country,'' as one of his rationales for opening this 
investigation and sending letters to the FBI. It does not sound 
bipartisan trying to get to the root of the China issue.
    But of course, you know, as we are doing that, you know, I 
will do, just to remind the Chairman, just a quick spirited 
reading of some of the things that President Trump has said: 
``China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. 
The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and 
transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on 
behalf of the American people, I want to thank President Xi.'' 
Trump again: ``I just spoke to President Xi last night, and you 
all know he is working on the problem, the virus. It is a very 
tough situation, but I think he is going to handle it. I think 
he handled it really well. We are helping where we can.''
    Another Trump quote: ``Just had a very long conversation 
with President Xi on the phone. He is strong, sharp, powerful, 
focused on leading the counterattack on the coronavirus. He 
feels they are doing very well, building hospitals in a matter 
of days. Great discipline is taking place in China as President 
Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We 
are working closely with China to help.'' More Trump: ``I think 
China is very, you know, professionally run in a sense, and 
that they have everything under control. I really believe they 
are going to have it under control very soon. You know, in 
April supposedly it will die with hotter weather. That is a 
beautiful date to look forward to, but China, I can tell you, 
is working very hard.'' More Trump: ``We have very few people 
with it and are getting better. They are all getting better. 
The whole situation will work out. I think China has it really 
shut down.''
    And I bring all of that up because all of those things, all 
of the praising of Xi, this is the rationale that the Chairman 
has used to do other stuff. The Chairman went on Fox Business 
with Maria Bartiromo and said, yes, the Walz family, that is a 
scary family there, when he was talking about the Walz family. 
If you look at Maria's face, it looked like she vomited, it 
came up, and then she swallowed it again as the Chairman was 
talking about that, OK? I am sure the American people think 
Gwen Walz is really scary.
    You know, the Chairman went on to say that, you know, 
``Walz is very concerning to me because we don't want to set 
our business model like China.'' Of course, Trump always has a 
quote or a tweet for that. Trump said, ``Xi is now president 
for life, right, and that that is great. And look, he was able 
to do that and I think it is great. Maybe we will do the 
same.'' Huh, that is interesting. That sounds like Trump 
looking at the Chinese model and wanting to copy it, which is 
what the Chairman said about Tim Walz.
    So, I am just curious. Is the Chairman going to open up an 
investigation into Donald Trump wanting to copy the Chinese 
model, which is what he accused Tim Walz of? We know the 
answer.
    More Trump about President Xi: ``We love each other.'' And 
so, knowing how this Committee has conducted investigations, 
knowing the evidence that they have manufactured or the 
witnesses they have had to deal with, the only evidence the 
Chairman has on Tim Walz and China is that maybe he visited a 
Panda Express once and he liked it. That is it. That is what is 
going on here. So, I do not want to hear about bipartisanship 
on China. We were there, and then the Chairman just goes all 
over TV and wants to accuse the Walz family of basically being 
spies for China with no evidence.
    And look, I appreciate the kind words the Chairman said 
about me on Newsmax the other day, calling me the court jester, 
so thank you, my liege. I appreciate that. But he said 
something else that I think really sums up what this Committee 
has done. The Chairman went on and said, ``My job was never to 
impeach.'' Well, that is interesting. So, for almost 2 years we 
have sat here while we have run impeachment hearings, while we 
have had cameras, hundreds of interviews, millions of dollars 
to spend, and now the Chairman finally says, ``My job was never 
to impeach.'' He only says that because it did not work out.
    And so, you know, Mr. Chairman, I am going to have my staff 
send this to your office. I would love for you to sign it. I am 
going to hang it in my office as a reminder, OK, of what this 
Committee was used for, OK? So, I do not want to hear about 
bipartisanship when they destroyed this Committee over nonsense 
for 2 years. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Burchett.
    Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I come at this maybe 
a little different background. My father fought in the Pacific 
in the Second World War and then in the Marine Corps, 1st 
Marine Division. Everybody has heard me tell these stories. But 
after the war--he was on Okinawa and they were getting ready to 
invade Japan, they thought, and they dropped the bomb on Japan, 
both bombs. They were told they were going to go home and he 
was not sent home. They sent some Marines over to China. And 
Daddy was--I think one of the greatest regrets in his life 
until the day he died was that he felt like we turned our back 
on them, and he would talk about how, you know, during the war 
they could literally move mountains if they had to. I mean, the 
people would, you know. I guess it is the slave labor, I am not 
sure, and they could literally move a factory from one area, 
just take it apart piece by piece and then just carry it, 
humans carrying it to another area, people dying.
    And then after the war, the hunger really for democracy and 
capitalism. Kids would stand on a street corner with a first-
grade primer and read something, and they would be stuck and 
they would say, ``G.I., G.I., what is this word, what is this 
word?'' and they would tell them, and they understood the value 
of the American dollar. And I could tell you all these stories, 
but I come at it from a little different angle because I see 
the Chinese people as wonderful folks. I see their leadership 
as some very abusive, horrible people. You know, the hundred-
year plan, the thousand-year plan, you know, to me it does not 
really matter. Their folks are there and they are being abused 
for their own purposes for their leadership.
    But Dr. Thayer, you had written that the Trump 
Administration was the start of an effective resistance to the 
Chinese Communist Party. Could you explain to me how that is?
    Dr. Thayer. Certainly. Thank you, Congressman Burchett, for 
the question. The Trump Administration recognized the threat 
that we faced from the Chinese Communist Party and that it had 
been waging the world's most successful political warfare 
campaign against the United States by making so many of the 
American elite partners with the Chinese Communist Party. And 
the Trump Administration was the first administration after, 
obviously, post-cold war administrations, from Clinton through 
Bush to Obama to Trump, that tried to turn the rudder over, 
recognizing the nature of the threat, that it was the regime 
that was the threat. It was the Chinese Communist Party that is 
the threat to the United States because of its ideology. It is 
not the Chinese people with whom we have common cause, and 
people who have suffered greatly, horribly, with scores of 
millions of individuals killed in China by the Chinese 
Communist Party.
    So, we both suffer the consequences of that odious regime, 
and the Trump Administration recognized that and took measures 
starting to turn the rudder over. There is much more work to be 
done, Congressman, as you well know, as well as this Committee 
knows, but that was a good start.
    Mr. Burchett. Any of you all feel like the Biden-Harris 
Administration implemented these same strategies?
    Dr. Thayer. The Biden and Harris Administration has not 
implemented the same strategies. They have gone back to a form 
of what I call with my frequent co-author, Jim Fanell, a neo-
engagement policy, which is to continue sustained rates of 
trade interaction, all the hallmarks that defined Clinton 
through Obama, which is sustaining the CCP at a time where they 
are incredibly weak, where they are suffering political crises 
within the Chinese Communist Party due to the tyranny of Xi 
Jinping. And they are suffering profound economic problems, 
ultimately, due to the misrule of their communist economic 
policies, but to the collapse of their real estate markets and 
a series of structural as well as more immediate economic 
problems that they face. They are supremely vulnerable. And now 
is the time to take advantage in the sense of political warfare 
against that regime.
    Mr. Burchett. You all agree to that? Mr. Stokes?
    Mr. Stokes. No. I think the Biden-Harris Administration has 
shared the diagnosis of the challenge with the Trump 
Administration but had a little bit of a different tack in 
terms of responding to it. So, you know, I do not think it is 
fair to call it neo-engagement. I would say it is still 
strategic competition, right, and that there is more of an 
emphasis on building up alliances and partnerships.
    You have seen the progress with the Quad. You have seen 
AUKUS. You have seen revival of alliances with the Philippines 
and Japan and so on. On the technological side, you have seen 
both affirmative efforts to improve, you know, the U.S. posture 
in the CHIPS and Science Act, but also pretty extreme, at least 
in Beijing's view, actions to slow down China's technological 
rise really on chips and other areas as well, AI, biotech and 
so on, and then a very, very strong and consistent stance on 
human rights issues, particularly related to Uyghurs, Hong 
Kong, and so on, and a deepened partnership with Taiwan.
    So, I think that there is, you know, a certain amount of 
bipartisan continuity here, and it is more about, you know, 
what policies do we adopt to actually deal with this problem 
now that we sort of agree on what the problem is?
    Mr. Burchett. Sorry, Mr. Chairman. I have run over. I will 
just say that, economically, Americans, unfortunately, are 
going to pay the cheapest they can get, and you just cannot get 
better than slave labor that we are dealing with competing with 
China, and that is unfortunate. Sorry, Mr. Chairman. I ran 
over.
    Chairman Comer. Good questions. The Chair recognizes Mr. 
Garcia from California.
    Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our 
witnesses.
    Clearly, China is our leading geopolitical challenge and a 
complicated one because, obviously, they are also our largest 
trading partner. And I think one thing that is bipartisan is no 
one does not think that China is not our most strategic 
challenge, and certainly, we all understand the gravity of 
China and competition as it relates to our own economy and our 
own national security interests. I know that we talked a lot 
about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump today. I 
believe that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have united our allies 
against aggressive authoritarian states. But I also think it is 
important, since we have talked so much about Trump and the 
Trump era, to compare the Biden-Harris record with the Donald 
Trump record as it relates to China.
    [Poster]
    Mr. Garcia. And of course, we here have a story by the 
Washington Post--I am going to show a recent one as well--about 
President Xi and China and John Bolton's claims, which I think 
are very credible, that somehow Donald Trump is working and had 
worked with President Xi to actually encourage election 
interference.
    Now, during a one-on-one meeting between President Xi and 
Trump, Donald Trump asked to buy more soybeans and wheat to 
help him actually win reelection, as John Bolton had noted and 
the Washington Post reported. And, in fact, in that same 
meeting, Trump actually said that Democrats were the party that 
was actually tougher on China. Now, Mr. Stokes, does this sound 
to you like Trump was pursuing some type of electoral gain and 
putting it above the national security interest?
    Mr. Stokes. I was not in the room, so I cannot speak to 
what was or was not said. I think, in general, you know, we 
should not have any hostile foreign states or any foreign 
states interfering in U.S. elections, period, full stop, no 
matter if they are supporting Democrats or Republicans.
    Mr. Garcia. And if Donald Trump was encouraging election 
interference, that would be, obviously, unethical and illegal 
as far as I am concerned. But we know that Donald Trump has 
also used the power of the presidency for his own political 
gain before. Now, Mr. Stokes, can you remind us why President 
Trump was actually impeached the very first time he was 
impeached?
    Mr. Stokes. This is not my area of expertise, but 
presumably Russia's influence in the election.
    Mr. Garcia. Thank you. And it is also true, if we remember, 
that Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law, received $2 
billion from Saudi Arabia for his investment fund after leaving 
the White House, just 2 months after leaving the White House. 
And these allegations of foreign interference of Donald Trump, 
his relationship with China, I think should be very concerning. 
Now, I want to show you this photo right here.
    [Slide]
    Mr. Garcia. There have been recent reports, again, in the 
Washington Post--and Ranking Member Raskin and I have asked 
actually for an investigation into allegations--that the 
Egyptian Government may have sent $10 million in campaign 
contributions to Donald Trump in the closing days of the Trump 
campaign. And this raises serious questions, of course, about 
what Donald Trump has done, whether it has been his meetings 
with President Xi, whether it has been his conversations with 
the Egyptian president, and others, of which he was impeached 
for the first time as to why he is trying to gain favors around 
elections. Donald Trump, of course, is resisting this 
investigation, but, Mr. Stokes, do you think that the American 
people should be concerned about potential quid pro quos?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes, from any Presidential candidate or a 
former President.
    Mr. Garcia. Absolutely, and I want to talk about one other. 
We know that President Donald Trump also received at least $7.8 
million from at least 20 foreign states and authoritarian 
leaders, including China, of which we are talking about today, 
in blatant violation of the constitution. And I think it is 
important to remember that that $7.8 million is just the 
minimum that we know about because we have a very limited 
number of the actual receipts of money that was going into the 
Trump Organization, including money that was coming in directly 
from China. So, as we are talking about the Chinese Government 
and the Chinese influence, we have to ensure that we note the 
influence that China and other foreign actors were having on 
Donald Trump. So, with that, I am going to yield back and 
remind us that that is the investigation that we should be 
having.
    Mr. Raskin. Will the gentleman yield?
    Mr. Garcia. Yes.
    Mr. Raskin. But I just wonder, Dr. Thayer, you have made a 
very strong argument that the Trump Administration confronted 
China, and yet there is all of this evidence that Donald Trump 
and his businesses were pocketing millions of dollars from the 
Chinese Government, the dozens of trademarks that went to his 
daughter, his lavish praise of President Xi. And I just wonder 
how you reconcile that in your mind. Is there any cognitive 
dissonance there, or are you saying that the Administration did 
one thing and then the President was sort of a loose cannon, 
off doing his own?
    Dr. Thayer. Well, Ranking Member Raskin, thank you for the 
comment. My thoughts are these. First, the threat from the 
Chinese Communist Party should be a nonpartisan issue in that 
the CCP is killing Americans every day. Over last year, the CDC 
said 107,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl overdoses, 
precursor chemicals being----
    Mr. Raskin. I got you. I guess my question is about elite 
capture.
    Chairman Comer. And the gentleman's time has expired.
    Mr. Raskin. Yes. I mean, was the elite capture strategy 
targeted at Donald Trump, but you are saying his Administration 
somehow survived it.
    Chairman Comer. I do not know that that is what he said, 
but the gentleman's time has expired. The Chair recognizes Ms. 
McClain from Michigan.
    Mrs. McClain. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The CCP is clearly not 
our friend. Let me repeat: the Chinese Communist Party is not 
our friend. It is well known that if you are a Chinese company, 
you must turn over all of your requested information to the 
CCP. Lawmakers from my state of Michigan have approved nearly 
$800 million in taxpayer dollars to incentivize the 
construction of the Gotion plant. Gotion, Inc. is a subsidiary 
company of Gotion High-Tech, which is a state-owned company of 
the Chinese Communist Party. State lawmakers are using taxpayer 
dollars to pay the CCP to implant thousands of Chinese workers 
and billions worth of Chinese technology strategically close to 
an intelligence program and a military facility. Coincidence? I 
think not. In the past several years, the U.S. has found 
Chinese technology to be a CCP tool used to spy on Americans, 
undermine our interests, and steal proprietary information from 
our intellectual leaders. Anyone who is looking can see that 
this is a very troubling pattern.
    So, Ambassador Cella, FBI Director Chris Wray has warned 
that colleges and universities are prone to political warfare 
from China and targeted for intellectual property theft. Now, 
Ferris State University is just a few miles from the proposed 
Gotionsite. Again, coincidence? Not much. Have you heard of any 
collaboration between Ferris State and the Gotion plant?
    Mr. Cella. I have, Congresswoman McClain. Thank you for the 
question. So, the previous president of Ferris State began sort 
of intertwining with Gotion leaders and executives as they set 
the stage to make their way into Michigan. And apparently, 
there was a soft agreement where they would house workers, PRC 
nationals, unvetted, and his regime changed. It came to a new 
one. So, there was talk of that. And there were also 
conversations that are known that Gotion had concept 
conversations with the university to support various elements 
of building. I do not know if it ever came to pass, but, again, 
I think that would just highlight another element of what has 
all the textbook markings of an influence operation.
    Mrs. McClain. I would agree, and I just want to make sure 
you said ``unvetted.''
    Mr. Cella. Yes. So, I would just say that if you look at 
the backdrop of the 2018-2019 National Intelligence Law of 
China, the 2015 National Security Law, this is just the law 
that they have to follow whether they are in China or around 
the world to surveil, collect, and report. So, I just think 
that as it now stands, our apparatus, our preparedness is not 
commensurate with that threat. That is why I shared with some 
of your other colleagues perhaps a more footed and a more 
nimble approach would begin with passing a more modern version 
of the National Security Act of 1947 that engages the China 
threat.
    Mrs. McClain. Thank you. It is widely known that 
stakeholders and other supporters of the deal, so to speak, 
with the Gotion, signed a nondisclosure, so signed non-
disclosure agreements. This, in my opinion, is a huge red flag 
for our national security and intelligence agencies when it 
comes to dealing with a company with deep ties to the CCP. Why 
would elected and appointed officials sign a 5- to 10-year NDA 
regarding Gotion? Is that not a red flag? It seems a little 
weird to me.
    Mr. Cella. It is a big red flag. And in February 2022, I 
had mentioned to some of your other colleagues, national 
security and intelligence agencies convened state and local 
elected officials on a bipartisan basis and business leaders to 
say, look, China is on the hunt. You better have your dukes up. 
Do not be duped by seemingly benign business deals because if 
you do not follow directives of strict scrutiny, transparency, 
which NDAs are not, our national security is jeopardized.
    Mrs. McClain. What is the issue with being transparent?
    Mr. Cella. Well, I think that by being transparent, much of 
what has gone on that is now in the court filings that we 
mentioned with Gotion would be known in terms of elite capture, 
influence operations, what appears to be corruption and 
enrichment. Books have never been opened over the course of 
this deal. They ought to be, and they are really, I think, 
emanating from a retrenching of National Security Act of 1947, 
in a modern sense, would get us there.
    Mrs. McClain. Thank you. I am just going to remind everyone 
again, this is going on under our noses within our state, and I 
am gravely concerned. It is next to a military facility, and it 
is right next to Ferris State with NDAs, and everything is 
under the cloak of darkness, very concerning for me and the 
people of the state of Michigan. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentlelady yield back. The Chair 
recognizes Ms. Crockett from Texas.
    Ms. Crockett. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. I am going to 
take a little bit of a different approach to this. You know, 
interestingly enough, I will say that our position on China 
should be one of bipartisanship. I will absolutely say that, 
and we do not find very much bipartisanship specifically in 
this Committee. I think some of the concerns that I have, 
though, is just about the fact that we are not speaking more 
holistically. Let me explain to you kind of what I mean by 
that.
    One of the things that has been brought up has been 
fentanyl, and I appreciate the conversation around fentanyl 
because for so long in this Committee, it has been put out 
there to the American people that fentanyl is only coming from 
the Southern border and the only reason we have a crisis is 
because of the Southern border, when the reality is that China 
is playing a huge role as it relates to the fentanyl crisis, 
and so we have got to approach any of these crises more 
holistically. And the reason that I have a problem with this 
particular hearing, like some of my colleagues have already 
stated, is that we are not really talking about the bigger 
picture. The bigger picture is that it is not China as an 
isolated bad actor.
    What is really making and exacerbating this issue is the 
fact that China is teaming up with Russia, who is also teaming 
up with Iran. Is there anyone that disagrees that these three 
have actually started to work in concert together and it is all 
for the harm of us?
    [No response.]
    Ms. Crockett. By your silence, I will say that you agree 
with me. And so, I think that we need to be honest with the 
American people and talk about the dynamic of this threat and 
that it is a lot larger, and that is actually what makes it 
even scarier. And it is why we do need someone that will lead 
this Nation and will not just call out one bad actor, but call 
them all out because they are definitely working together.
    As it has already been pointed out, not being able to say 
that we want Ukraine to defeat Russia, it is a very simple 
thing, but it means a lot. In addition to that, there is one 
portion of this world that I have traveled to most since I have 
been in Congress, and that is the Indo-Pacific area. And to go 
into places like Taiwan and to listen to what people in Taiwan, 
what people in Thailand, what people in Indonesia, what they 
are all experiencing as it relates to the CCP, it, like, hurts 
my heart.
    And so, I do want to come up with solutions because a lot 
of times when I am listening to this, I am wondering if they 
are talking about mobsters or what because that is how bad it 
sounds when they are dropping off these bags of money, and then 
the next thing you know, it is like they own these people. Yet 
we know that there is a lack of security, and we have to do our 
part in America to make sure that we are helping out these 
modern-day democracies. But also, we have got to be smart about 
our policies, right? Like, our trade policies have to be smart 
and they have to keep up. And we also have to make sure that we 
are protecting those here in our country whether we are talking 
about from military attacks or whether we are talking about 
interfering with our elections or whether we are talking about 
literally our economy, and China somehow has their hands in all 
three of these spaces.
    So, one of the issues that has not been talked about a lot 
is the tariffs and the tariffs that have been proposed by 
Donald Trump if he becomes President of the United States 
again, and how those tariffs specifically have impacted our 
farmers. Mr. Stokes, are you aware of the impact that the 
tariffs that were imposed during the previous Trump 
Administration how that impacted our farmers?
    Mr. Stokes. Well, I think, broadly speaking, the tariffs, 
on the one hand, are meant to be a tool to combat unfair trade 
practices by China, but on the other hand, they impose costs on 
consumers in the United States. So, in many ways, we have got 
to kind of strike a balance because we have not been able to 
deal with unfair trade practices from China effectively and 
this has been one of our most effective tools, but it does come 
at a cost for middle class people. And so, we have got to 
strike a balance there, and that is, in general, how I would 
approach the tariff issue.
    Ms. Crockett. That is absolutely right, and more 
specifically, when we went through this before because doing 
the same thing over and over is the definition of insanity if 
we are expecting a different result. Farmers who exported 
soybeans, cotton, and sorghum to China were hit by Beijing's 
decision to raise tariffs on those products as much as 25 
percent. Even despite Trump's attempt to mitigate his colossal 
failure by providing offsets and financial support for farmers, 
giving $23 billion in 2018 and 2019, he failed to distribute 
the support evenly to farmers, to say nothing that the support 
only partially mitigated the harm caused by these tariffs. And 
what is being proposed now is Trump is proposing a worldwide 
tariff of 10 percent and 60 percent on Chinese goods, which 
would lower the average after-tax incomes of U.S. households in 
2025 by $1,800 and reduce imports to the U.S. by $5.5 trillion 
or 15 percent.
    The thing is, I want us to come up with policies, and I am 
charging and requesting each of you as you sit here, and you 
have studied this, to talk about this in a very holistic 
mindset and give us some actual proposals that you believe 
would be bipartisan, where we can definitely deal with not just 
China, but Iran, as well as Russia, as they are working as a 
collective to harm us. Thank you so much for your time, and I 
will yield.
    Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burlison from 
Missouri.
    Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Thayer, are you 
familiar with an individual named Neville Roy Singham?
    Dr. Thayer. No, Congressman, I am not.
    Mr. Burlison. Mr. Atkinson?
    Dr. Atkinson. No, sir.
    Mr. Burlison. Mr. Cella?
    Mr. Cella. I am not, sir.
    Mr. Burlison. Mr. Stokes?
    Mr. Stokes. No, sir.
    Mr. Burlison. OK. So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit 
for the record an article from the New York Times titled, ``A 
Global Web of Chinese Propaganda Leads to a U.S. Tech Mogul.''
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Burlison. So, Mr. Singham is an individual, a former, 
as was mentioned, tech mogul. According to these articles, he 
has been financing groups like the group that is protesting 
outside this door, Code Pink. In fact, he is married to the 
individual who co-founded this organization. He has also been a 
contributor to many left-leaning Democrats, including Members 
of this Committee, so certainly Members in this Committee know 
who he is. But the question is, what is his involvement with 
China? Because so much of his philanthropy is funding groups 
that are sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party.
    And so, this is of concern. You would think that it would 
not result in anything. And yet, as this Times article points 
out, in fact, when the Committee on China was formed in the 
House, several of those Members that received contributions 
protested the creation, in fact, rallied votes against the 
creation of that Committee. There are other items that are 
listed in the article, and I would encourage you guys to read 
that. To me, this is an example of elite capture, OK?
    So, Mr. Thayer, let us talk about the history of the 
current Governor, Tim Walz, and his connections with China. It 
is estimated that he has been to China and organized trips up 
to 30 times, and then he no longer started doing those trips. 
Then he became a member of a group while he was a Member of 
Congress called the Macao Polytechnic University, which is a 
Chinese institution that characterizes itself as having a long-
held devotion to and love for the motherland. Mr. Thayer, are 
you aware of his interactions with China?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, Congressman Burlison. Those incidences and 
his corporation, which was in existence in the 1990's and into 
the 21st century, the business that ran, essentially, 
educational exchange and brought American students to the 
peninsula.
    Mr. Burlison. For over 10 years.
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Burlison. For over 10 years, he made numerous trips and 
organized numerous trips that were funded.
    My real concern is his connection to this organization, the 
Macao Polytechnic University. Can you describe that?
    Dr. Thayer. I believe, if I am not mistaken, Congressman 
Burlison, that he was a researcher there or a fellow at that 
institution in Macau.
    Mr. Burlison. One might think there has been a pivot in the 
United States, but certainly by the time the Trump 
Administration had taken office, the Trump Administration 
started sending warnings to universities about the Confucius 
Institutes and their involvement, and many universities pulled 
those from their campuses. But strangely, the universities in 
Mr. Walz's state while he is governor are uniquely still having 
the Confucius Institutes. Are you familiar with that?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Burlison. Could you elaborate on why that is a concern?
    Dr. Thayer. Certainly. Well, Confucius Institute is an 
aspect of political warfare. It is an institution which 
purports to tout the greatness of Chinese civilization, but it 
really is advancing the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party. 
My concern with respect to the businesses is that he would have 
to have a Chinese partner, at least one partner or maybe 
multiple partners in the People's Republic of China, and would 
have to receive permission at the local level, provincial 
level, and at the central level to conduct business. And that 
certainly would involve contacts with the MSS, so with the 
Chinese Intelligence Service, and with the Chinese Communist 
Party, in order to conduct that business. To my knowledge, we 
do not have information about his Chinese partner or Chinese 
partners there. Additionally, of course, for MSS intelligence 
collections, having students come over, of course, allows MSS 
to have access to those individuals, which may provide a 
benefit for their intelligence collection in the future.
    Mr. Burlison. Thank you. My time has expired.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair 
recognizes the Ranking Member.
    Mr. Raskin. Thank you kindly, just for a UC request. The 
first is an article from the Washington Post dated August 7 of 
this year. It is entitled, ``Walz Has a Long History With 
China, But He is s Not Pro-China.'' The second is from the 
Post, dated August 8, 2024, entitled, ``Walz's Deep China 
Experience is Good for the Country.'' Both articles conclude 
Walz's deep knowledge relating to China are an asset and not a 
liability.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questions and 
just to go around the panel real quick. I have a few questions. 
I am going to give you plenty of time to answer my last 
question.
    Everyone on the panel has already testified and agrees that 
the CCP is a huge threat to America and a huge threat to our 
government. Does anyone disagree that as we speak, the Chinese 
Communist Party is trying to infiltrate our government, various 
government agencies, and our political system in general? Now, 
I am going to ask each one of you ``yes'' or ``no,'', and then 
we will go into more in-depth questions, but is the average 
government agency aware of the threat the CCP poses? I mean, in 
other words, does anyone have confidence that the government 
agencies here in Washington, DC. are aware of the threat? We 
are not even talking about do they have a plan to combat 
Chinese infiltration, but do you believe the government 
agencies are aware, Dr. Thayer?
    Dr. Thayer. Thank you, Chairman Comer. Not sufficiently, 
sir.
    Chairman Comer. Mr. Atkinson?
    Dr. Atkinson. Overall, I do not believe they are.
    Chairman Comer. Ambassador?
    Mr. Cella. Our response is woefully not commensurate with 
the current threat.
    Chairman Comer. Mr. Stokes?
    Mr. Stokes. I think the foreign and security-focused 
agencies, our intelligence agencies in particular, are very 
aware. I think the more domestically focused agencies, given 
that the threat is outside their domain, it might be less.
    Chairman Comer. OK. All right. Thank you. Ambassador Cella, 
has the CCP used political and economic warfare to weaponize 
the obsession with green energy?
    Mr. Cella. We need not look any further than Michigan. So, 
we have talked about Gotion. Your colleagues have raised the 
Gotion matter and, again, as a textbook influence operation, 
subnational coercion. The one project that it did not talk 
about that is also present is a joint project with Ford CATL 
that left Virginia after Governor Youngkin said is a national 
security threat, ended up on our shores. So, malign things are 
affiliated with both of these. You have three congressional 
committees looking at the CATL deal for a reason, because it is 
a threat.
    Chairman Comer. I am concerned about the Green Deal 
specifically because I believe that this would give China a 
much greater competitive advantage, and I believe that China 
has fueled a lot of the discussion about the Green New Deal. 
What should Federal agencies do to address this problem?
    Mr. Cella. In my humble opinion, I would just say, we need 
not look any further than, I think, Germany, who, I think, got 
way out over their skis with green technology, integrating with 
the EVs, and I think it is perilous for the United States to 
get on that same track. Michigan is the automobile capital of 
the world, and I think they are on a perilous track by heading 
where they are. Toyota, I think, struck the right balance 
between hybrids and conventional internal combustion engines, 
but we really need to be aware of this technology and mindful 
of the malignness of China.
    Chairman Comer. OK. And I am going to ask, for time's sake, 
Dr. Thayer, Mr. Atkinson, and Ambassador Cella, if you could 
convince Federal agencies to do one thing to secure Americans 
from the cold war that CCP is waging, what would it be? Dr. 
Thayer?
    Dr. Thayer. Work with Congress and the executive to 
formulate a strategy of victory over the CCP.
    Chairman Comer. Mr. Atkinson?
    Dr. Atkinson. I think each agency needs to develop an 
internal plan and strategy and implementation of how they would 
see the CCP threat, vis-a-vis the areas that they cover as an 
agency.
    Chairman Comer. Ambassador?
    Mr. Cella. I think the footing of the National Security Act 
of 1947 modernized so these agencies are working with you, and 
what that would look like, it would involve a top-to-bottom 
assessment and then adjust accordingly, plugging the gaping 
holes that exist.
    Chairman Comer. OK. Mr. Atkinson, you have expressed 
concerns that America's technology powerhouses have allowed 
themselves to become increasingly dependent on China for 
manufacturing various components and ending in a vulnerable 
Taiwan. We all know about the semiconductors and all of that. 
Could you explain why this happened and what Federal agencies 
need to do to solve this issue, our dependence on China and 
Taiwan for so much of our technology, if not all of our 
technology?
    Dr. Atkinson. Well, first of all, we failed for many 
decades to put in place an effective techno-economic policy. I 
will give you an example. President Reagan was the big 
cheerleader of putting in place a research and development tax 
credit, as was every administration.
    Chairman Comer. Uh-huh.
    Dr. Atkinson. In the Clinton Administration, we had the 
most generous R&D tax credit in the world. Now, the Chinese R&D 
tax credit is 3.75 times bigger than ours, so we need to just 
do simple things like use the Tax Code to drive more innovation 
and investment. But the other part of that is we have had a 
long history of where Federal agencies have turned a blind eye. 
For example, as we speak, the National Science Foundation has a 
joint quantum computing research program with the Chinese. We 
gave away our most advanced nuclear technology.
    Chairman Comer. Uh-huh.
    Dr. Atkinson. Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We had a 
Chinese delegation there in the 2000's, and they were there for 
over 6 months and we just did not care. And so, it is time to 
raise that level of awareness much, much higher.
    Chairman Comer. Very good, very good. The Chair now 
recognizes Mr. Perry from Pennsylvania.
    Mr. Perry. I thank the Chairman. Gentlemen, great to see 
you. Dr. Thayer and Mr. Atkinson, I do not hold a lot of hope 
for Congress to do sweeping things in this arena for a lot of 
different reasons. Unfortunately, I think it is going to take 
unilateral action, which then Congress can follow by any 
President from any party. And let us start with the fact that, 
I think, and if you will confirm this, that many Americans in 
investment are funding our own demise through investments in 
China, and China operates under a different set of rules in our 
financial markets than our own United States companies do. Can 
you confirm that assertion, No. 1, and, No. 2, what would be 
the answer that an administration could take unilaterally while 
Congress continues to ponder the implications?
    Dr. Thayer. Congressman Perry, thank you for the question. 
Sir, it is correct, that is the case, and the solution to that 
would be to demand and require transparency from Chinese 
entities operating within the United States. U.S. firms and 
Chinese firms should play by the same rules.
    Mr. Perry. Go ahead, Mr. Atkinson.
    Dr. Atkinson. Well, Congressman, I agree with you that, 
ultimately, this is going to have to come from an 
administration because there is so much complexity, but, for 
example, we could delist Chinese firms from our equity market 
because of lack of transparency. I believe the SEC has the 
ability to do that now, and they have chosen not to.
    Mr. Perry. So, they have the unilateral ability, but choose 
not to. And just out of curiosity, other than what the founders 
described that the avarice of man, right, greed, what other 
reason would they have to not do that to protect America? Why 
wouldn't they just demand that a foreign entity be operating 
under the same rules as our own entities, especially a foreign 
entity that is described as their enemy?
    Dr. Atkinson. I do not think you can underestimate inertia 
in the Federal bureaucracy. It is just because they have been 
doing it that way, and it is very, very hard to change that 
attitude and that mindset, which is really ultimately what 
Presidential leadership is about.
    Mr. Perry. Are these the actions of the Secretary of the 
SEC or the Treasury guided by the direction of the President? 
Is that simply how difficult it is, or is it something much 
more complicated that requires papers and boards and meetings 
and/or can this be done essentially with the stroke of a pen?
    Dr. Atkinson. Quick, there are a lot of things that could 
be done by a stroke of a pen or just basically the Presidential 
bully pulpit.
    Mr. Perry. Dr. Thayer?
    Dr. Thayer. As Chairman Comer recognized, it is an aspect 
of recognizing the nature of the threat, of the immediacy of 
the threat, and, essentially, this is thinking of the Ancient 
regime. This is old thinking. They are thinking that the 
People's Republic of China is going to be a responsible 
stakeholder, as it was once observed. They simply do not 
recognize the nature of the CCP threat.
    Mr. Perry. I just got to say, Dr. Thayer, if you are 
working at the SEC or the Treasury or the Administration and 
have that mindset, I think it is long past time that you go 
find a job in the private sector. That having been said, 
Ambassador, what has frustrated me, among a million other 
things on this topic, is the World Trade Organization and that 
China continues to operate as a developing nation, right? 
Again, while Congress ponders the implications and does 
nothing, how can an administration unilaterally take action to 
right this thing and treat China and have the rest of the world 
treat China for what it actually is?
    Mr. Cella. Well, I am not a trade policy expert, but I 
would just begin taking steps to see how you could derisk or 
decouple them from the WTO. Not uncomplicated, but I think that 
conversation has to happen. Again, our footing is not 
commensurate with the threat. I think we need to be nimble and 
aggressively work with our Five Eyes partners and others with 
more oars in the water, and have them pedaling much faster than 
they are now.
    Mr. Perry. So, I think what I just heard you say is, look, 
we got to at least start by having a view toward doing that and 
then laying out the steps. But I gather from that comment that 
that step or those steps have not even occurred at this point.
    Mr. Cella. Widely controversial.
    Mr. Perry. Why would it be widely controversial? Who 
considers China a developing Nation like they are, you know, 
like they are still farming with oxen out in the rice paddies 
or something like that, and they all eat, like, you know, 4 
ounces of rice and drink a cup of water a day for sustenance? 
Is that what people believe literally?
    Mr. Cella. I think there are a lot of people making a lot 
of money. I think it is driven by Wall Street, and I think it 
is also driven by consumer appetites as well. So, I think we 
have settled into this kind of arcadia or sloth period for a 
number of years, and one of your colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle raised it, but it needs to be engaged accordingly 
and not have this China blindness that the great Admiral 
Studeman referred to in a speech last year.
    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes Mr. Fallon from Texas.
    Mr. Fallon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all 
the witnesses. I think the greatest threat to stability and 
prosperity and liberty that not only our country faces, but the 
world, is the Chinese Communist Party. The United States, 
though, is uniquely poised and positioned to thwart the 
ambitions of the ruling elite in Beijing as we are the only 
Nation really that is strong enough to stymie China's ever-
growing aggressiveness and their expansionist ideas. It is 
incumbent upon us here in Congress to protect our country, our 
allies, and nations across the globe from the CCP's political 
warfare and their malign influence and aggression. Mr. Stokes, 
do you think that the great power competition that we currently 
see will continue?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes.
    Mr. Fallon. I mean, I do as well. You do not think that 
China is going to change direction and amend their ways anytime 
soon, do you?
    Mr. Stokes. No.
    Mr. Fallon. No. I agree with that, and I think technology 
is going to be the currency of competition moving forward. Do 
you think that we should work together--when I say ``we,'' 
meaning Congress--in either this or the next administration, to 
protect our domestic RDT&E from foreign exploitation?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes.
    Mr. Fallon. I think that is critical because it seems to me 
that every day, China is trying to not only close the gap, but 
really even exceed our expectation or our capabilities. And we 
have got, you know, limited time, and I got a few more 
questions, and I am going to go through them really quickly. Do 
you think that the Congress and the next administration should 
also be proactively countering the China's Belt and Road 
Initiative?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes.
    Mr. Fallon. Do you think DoD could play a role in 
countering it as well?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes, mostly for the military, dual-use military 
installations part.
    Mr. Fallon. Well, because that is what I was thinking 
because tasking organizations within the Pentagon--I serve on 
the Armed Services Committee--with executing some of the 
regionally based ops may be a very good idea, and because 
considering the resources and the relationships and 
partnerships that they have already established. Are we 
tracking?
    Mr. Stokes. Yes.
    Mr. Fallon. Yes, you know, and also, let us talk real 
quickly about missile defense. I am concerned because of the 
advances that the Chinese have made and the Russians, with 
hypersonics. Do you think that our missile defense should be a 
critical component of our national security architecture?
    Mr. Stokes. I think, in general, yes, defending against 
hypersonic missiles is incredibly difficult as a technical 
challenge.
    Mr. Fallon. Sure, and so developing our own advanced 
missile defense system should be something that we should 
really focus on.
    Mr. Stokes. Yes, in general, but I think we have to weigh 
across the whole portfolio of our capabilities, where our money 
is best spent.
    Mr. Fallon. You know, and thank you. I want to appreciate 
your honest answers. And what I find interesting is that what 
we just discussed, every single question that was asked could 
be found in the Department of Defense chapter in Project 2025, 
that, like, it seems to be the boogeyman of many Democrats, and 
it is the policy Freddy Krueger, if you will. And in fact, the 
Ranking Member last week mentioned Project 2025 12 times in a 7 
1/2-minute opening statement, and nearly every Democrat did as 
well. They were talking about Project 2025 and the malign and 
influence, and it is nefarious in nature. But you know what 
Project 2025 really is? It is policy thoughts and a wish list 
from a think tank. That is what think tanks do. No Republican 
on the Hill or senior advisor to the Trump Administration or 
Presidential campaign commissioned it. It is 920-pages-plus of 
ideas, some good, some excellent, and some I am sure I do not 
agree with because I did not read all 920 pages. But because 
the Democrats talked about it so much last week, I actually 
picked it up this weekend and read a few excerpts from it.
    And I find that curious that there were pejoratives thrown 
out there. It was extreme and it was chaos and corruption. 
Well, I have another word: ``yawn.'' It was much to-do about 
nothing or at least very little. Essentially, what the 
Oversight Democrats' argument seems to be is that President 
Trump is going to push a policy platform he has never endorsed, 
but Kamala Harris will not champion any position she has 
endorsed even recently. I find that quite amazing that those 
Democrats' whole argument relies on the American people having 
the attention span and memory of a goldfish, or at least Joe 
Biden. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. Now, we are 
waiting for Mr. Langworthy, who is en route, to ask questions. 
So, after that, we are going to close and give our closing 
remarks. But if the Ranking Member is OK, I may yield to him to 
give some brief closing remarks, and then if Langworthy gets 
here, he could ask questions. If you object to that, we can 
hold off until he gets here, he is about 3 or 4 minutes away.
    Mr. Raskin. No, that is fine. I can take it until he 
arrives. That is cool. Thank you.
    Chairman Comer. OK. You know, take your time----
    Mr. Raskin. I appreciate it.
    Chairman Comer [continuing]. Within reason.
    Mr. Raskin. You know, it has been a fascinating hearing, 
Mr. Chairman, and it is the third of three. I do not know if we 
are going to do another about the CCP before it is all over in 
this Congress, but it does give an opportunity for some closing 
reflections.
    One is that Americans have got to stand strong and stand 
together against all of the foreign autocratic regimes, 
including China, including Russia and Iran and others when they 
try to attack our democracy. For the vast majority of human 
history, people have lived under dictators and thugs and 
bullies and autocrats and theocrats and those who irrigate 
themselves the power to lord it over everybody else and to act 
as dictators, and the American founders had a different idea. 
They wanted to center government on the principle of the 
consent of the governed, political participation and governance 
by the people with freedom and rights of the people. And that 
is always been controversial, both in America, but also among 
our autocratic adversaries abroad. And so, in this century, a 
number of our foreign adversaries have directly intervened in 
American politics to try to undermine our elections in order to 
fix our elections or corrupt our elections by guaranteeing that 
this or that candidate or party would win.
    Russia intervened systematically in our Presidential 
election in 2016, according to the findings of more than a 
dozen of our own intelligence agencies. I know Donald Trump 
said he agreed with Vladimir Putin that Putin had not 
intervened, but it was simply an incontestable and indisputable 
truth that is well documented and well understood both by 
Congress and also by the national security departments. The 
Director of National Intelligence tells us it is happening 
again in this election, as it happened in 2020, and I 
appreciate the fact that I believe all of our witnesses, at 
least most of them, were able to opine that they acknowledged 
that there was a very close strategic political alliance 
between the Chinese Communist Party and Vladimir Putin, the 
former chief of the KGB, who has set himself at war against 
Democratic political institutions in America and around the 
world.
    The second point I want to make is that political 
propaganda and disinformation and elite capture are indeed 
critical tools for the authoritarian powers, and we need look 
no further than the political career of Donald Trump, who has 
been played like a fiddle by the Chinese Communist Party and by 
Vladimir Putin. He has lavished praise as President on 
President Xi dozens of times. His daughter got more than 40 
trademarks from the Chinese Government. He pocketed more than 
$3 million directly from the Chinese Government, Mr. Chairman, 
and we were able to determine that from the documents that were 
turned over before the Committee stopped them from being turned 
over, according to the Mazars' litigation. And we have seen, of 
course, this same kind of capitulation to Vladimir Putin, that 
is, elite capture, that is propaganda and disinformation 
infecting our political system. And we have had Republican 
luminaries complaining about the fact that there are Republican 
Members of Congress who have been parroting disinformation put 
out by Putin and the Chinese Government.
    But what we have got that the rest of the world does not 
have is we have got a true devotion to rule by the people. And 
in the process of this election, a statement was just released 
by a bipartisan group of 741 national security leaders for 
Kamala Harris, and they wrote, ``We don't agree on everything--
the Republicans, Democrats, Independents--but we all adhere to 
two fundamental principles. First, we believe America's 
national security requires a serious and capable Commander-in-
Chief. Second, we believe American democracy is invaluable. 
Each generation has a responsibility to defend it. That is why 
we, the undersigned, proudly endorse Harris to be the next 
President of the United States. The election is a choice 
between serious leadership and vengeful impulsiveness. It is a 
choice between democracy and authoritarianism. We do not make 
such an assessment lightly,'' and I would like to submit that 
for the record, and I yield back to you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    The Chair recognizes Mr. Langworthy for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Langworthy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Just 3 
weeks ago, in my home state of New York, the Deputy Chief of 
Staff to Governor Kathy Hochul, was arrested on Federal charges 
for acting as a secret agent of the Chinese Government. Let me 
repeat that for everyone: a senior aide for the current 
Governor of one of the most populous states in our country 
infiltrated state politics and served as an asset and agent for 
the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government. Dr. 
Thayer, are you familiar with the situation?
    Dr. Thayer. Yes, Congressman, I am.
    Mr. Langworthy. Thank you. Well, I could go on and on 
about, you know, what I think of the competence level of 
Governor Hochul's Administration. What I think is particularly 
alarming is that Linda Sun was not some low-level bureaucrat in 
some deep department. She held a very senior position, advising 
Governor Hochul on critical matters of state policy. Sun 
blocked Taiwanese Government representatives from getting 
access to high-ranking New York state officials and altered the 
messaging of state officials on issues of importance to the 
Chinese Government, all at the request of Chinese officials. 
Sun also helped Chinese Government officials travel to the 
United States and to meet with New York officials by providing 
unauthorized invitation letters from high level state officers.
    Dr. Thayer, if a foreign agent can operate with such 
impunity within one of the largest states in the union for over 
a decade, how many more are there? How many more are there 
working in the shadows in other state houses or other 
municipalities or even here in our departments in Washington, 
D.C.? Is it hundreds? Is it thousands, hundreds of thousands? I 
mean, you know, the Federal Government is, you know, so 
bloated, you know. How deep is this problem?
    Dr. Thayer. Well, that is a key question, of course, in 
terms of illuminating it. The Sun case is really an archetype 
of how they proceed, of how their both intelligence collection 
as a broader component of political warfare proceeds. And so, 
it is a sad and unfortunate reminder of this problem that we 
see in the United States, that we see in other countries as 
well. So, with respect to your question, there must be orders 
of magnitude more in terms of agents as well as agents of 
influence, the evidence of the success of their political 
warfare campaign.
    Mr. Langworthy. I mean, this should scare the hell out of 
everyone on both sides of the aisle that in a state where the 
budget is $220-plus billion, you know, the financial capital of 
the world, I mean, this is not, you know, a small and 
unsophisticated government, and the fact that this was able to 
happen in New York, I just find staggering. And to make matters 
worse, this is not the first time New York state has been 
compromised by the CCP. Last year, several individuals were 
arrested on charges that they had helped to establish secret 
police stations in New York City on behalf of the Chinese 
Government, and dozens of officers with China's National Police 
were charged with using social media to harass dissidents in 
New York state and across the country. Dr. Thayer, can you 
elaborate on why the Chinese Government would establish a 
secret police station in New York City?
    Dr. Thayer. It is a tool of coercion. It is a violation of 
our sovereignty. These centers which exist, which they call 
service centers, of course, but they are police stations, and 
their purpose is to intimidate and coerce Chinese Americans, 
other members of the Chinese diaspora, for example, and why we 
tolerate such a violation of our sovereignty, I simply do not 
know.
    Mr. Langworthy. And unfortunately, New York state responded 
with absolutely no coherent strategy to combat the CCP at the 
state level, and New York state is not the only one to blame 
here. The Biden Administration has done nothing to address the 
alarming level of CCP infiltration into this country. Dr. 
Thayer, you have emphasized that the Trump Administration 
initiated a strong and effective resistance to China's growing 
interest. However, you have also noted that the Biden Harris-
Administration shifted away from this strategy, altering the 
course of what you had acknowledged as a successful approach 
countering China's actions. How did the Biden-Harris 
Administration shift away from President Trump's strategy of 
strong and effective resistance to China's growing threat?
    Dr. Thayer. It did so in many ways, but to touch on three 
which are most significant, what the Biden-Harris 
Administration did was to move away in terms of our political 
signaling to allies that engagement was returning, and that as 
a result of that, the CCP recognized that they, again, had the 
opportunity to pressure their hyper-aggressive activities, for 
example, against the Philippines, in the South China Sea, other 
allies, and partners.
    The second step that they took was to step away--the 
messaging, Congressman, is absolutely essential. Trump was 
recognizing the CCP as a threat and it was going to be dealt 
with by the United states, as many members of the 
Administration recognized. The United States was seeking to 
identify and to describe the nature of the threat and also to 
advance a solution to that threat, involving allies and 
partners, and the Biden-Harris Administration has regrettably 
and sadly backed away from it. And so those signals reverberate 
for all global audiences, those who wish us well in 
international politics, for example, and those who are our foes 
in international politics.
    But we have seen under Biden-Harris, a return to hyper-
aggression of the Chinese Communist Party, a violation of 
Japanese sovereignty, numerous threats against Taiwan, missiles 
deployed against Taiwan. Again, the Philippines, a treaty ally 
of the United States, right now is being evicted from its 
territory, as recognized by the 2016 Permanent Court of 
Arbitration decision and by the 2002 Code of Conduct between 
ASEAN states and the PRC. It is being essentially evicted out 
of its sovereign territory, coerced out of its sovereign 
territory by the PRC. So, we are seeing, sadly, this hyper-
aggressive regime applying all of its means to advance while 
the Biden-Harris Administration are not taking the steps 
necessary to deter these actions by the CCP.
    Mr. Langworthy. Well, I thank you very much for your time. 
I wish I had another 10 minutes to ask you questions, but I 
yield back.
    Chairman Comer. The gentleman from Buffalo yields back, and 
before I close, I would recognize Ranking Member for some 
unanimous consents.
    Mr. Raskin. Yes. Thank you kindly. This one is an 
Associated Press article called, ``The Arrest of a Former Aide 
to New York Governor Highlights Efforts to Root Out Chinese 
Agents in the U.S.'' It is about aggressive Department of 
Justice investigation of CCP interference.
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Raskin. I have got one from CNN, saying, ``Trump Claims 
Not to Know Who is Behind Project 2025. A CNN Review Found at 
Least 140 People Who Worked for Him Were Involved.''
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Raskin. And then finally, from Salon: ``In Resurfaced 
Speech, Trump Endorses Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.''
    Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered.
    Chairman Comer. And I want to thank our witnesses for being 
here today and wanted to have a few closing remarks and just 
state for the record, the Oversight Committee has investigated 
25 sectors of the Federal Government. The findings of this 
governmentwide investigation are very alarming. The Federal 
Government under the Biden-Harris Administration has no 
cohesive strategy to secure America in this cold war. None, 
zero. Now, they can send talking points to their very obedient 
Democrat Members of Congress, and they can say there is a 
strategy, but there really is not a strategy.
    And for example, when the Oversight Committee requested a 
briefing, just a briefing from the National Security Council 
about the Federal Government's response to CCP unrestricted 
warfare, the National Security Council declined to brief the 
Committee and instead stated that the Biden-Harris 
Administration strategy is to be resilient, that is the type of 
subsistence that we are seeing from candidate Harris is just 
talking points, we will be resilient. Now, that does not appear 
to be the case at all. So, what this Committee wants to do is 
to identify the problems, and I think with our three hearings, 
we have, in a bipartisan manner, agreed for the most part. Most 
people on this Committee are serious. There are a few that are 
not, and I think everyone in America who watched C-SPAN today 
saw the ones who are not. We agree there is a problem with 
Chinese Communist Party.
    The witnesses testified today there is a problem with the 
Chinese Communist Party trying to infiltrate our government 
agencies and our political system and what we have to do as a 
Congress is come together in a bipartisan way to come up with 
solutions to the problem. And I believe that we can come up 
with solutions, but the first step is for our government 
agencies to fully understand the threat, what is a threat and 
to have a plan to combat that threat. And certainly, Congress, 
I believe, can come together and talking about the 
manufacturing threat, when we talk about the national security 
concerns with so much of our technology, our semiconductors, 
and things being made from China and Taiwan, we certainly want 
to bring that back to the United States, and that starts with a 
tax policy. It starts with a trade policy. We need to identify, 
as a Congress, the most critical manufactured items that we 
import from China that are of the utmost importance to our 
national security, whether it be our technology or whether it 
be certain pharmaceuticals that are manufactured in China. We 
need to be manufacturing that in the United States, if not in 
the United States, then in a friendlier country than the United 
States. So, I think these are things that Congress can come 
together on.
    I want to thank the Committee staff, most of the Committee 
as a whole, for working together on this issue. This is 
something that I think we have to identify, and I think there 
is bipartisan opportunity. Hopefully, after the election, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be rid of their 
Trump derangement syndrome, and we can focus on substantive 
policy to work with our government, regardless of who wins the 
election, to try to be able to first identify the threat within 
these government agencies, and then to be able to have a 
solution to combat the threat because China is not going away. 
They are in better financial shape than we are. They are 
certainly more united than our government is, but we have to 
come together on this issue, and I think we will. And I am 
proud that this has been a priority of this Congress, for this 
Committee. This is our last Committee before November, and we 
have had a lot of accomplishments within our goal of 
identifying waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the 
Federal Government, and this is certainly a huge threat in our 
Federal Government.
    So, again, I want to thank our witnesses for being here 
today.
    With that and without objection, all Members have 5 
legislative days within which to submit materials and 
additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be 
forwarded to the witnesses.
    Chairman Comer. If there is no further business, without 
objection, the Committee stands adjourned. Thank you, all.
    [Whereupon, at 1:19 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

                                 [all]
