_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation 
of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will hold 
a hearing on Thursday, May 23, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. EDT in 2167 
Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony on the 
President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Budget Request for the United 
States Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service). The Subcommittee 
will hear testimony from the Commandant and Master Chief Petty 
Officer of the United States Coast Guard.

                             II. BACKGROUND

    The Coast Guard was established on January 28, 1915, 
through the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service 
(established in 1790) and the Lifesaving Service (established 
in 1848).\1\ The Coast Guard later assumed the duties of three 
other agencies: the Lighthouse Service (established in 1789), 
the Steamboat Inspection Service (established in 1838), and the 
Bureau of Navigation (established in 1884).\2\

    Under Section 102 of Title 14, United States Code, the 
Coast Guard has primary responsibility to enforce or assist in 
the enforcement of all applicable Federal laws on, under, and 
over the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States; to ensure the safety of life and property at 
sea; to carry out domestic and international icebreaking 
activities; and, as one of the six armed forces of the United 
States, to maintain defense readiness to operate as a 
specialized service in the Navy upon the declaration of war or 
when the President directs.\3\ Its 11 statutory missions are 
codified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002: Ports, Waterways 
and Coastal Security; Drug Interdiction; Aids to Navigation; 
Search and Rescue; Living Marine Resources; Marine Safety; 
Defense Readiness; Migrant Interdiction; Maritime Environmental 
Protection; Polar, Ice, and Alaska Operations; and Law 
Enforcement.\4\

    The Coast Guard is directed by a Commandant appointed by 
the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to a 
four-year term.\5\ Admiral Linda L. Fagan was sworn in as the 
27th Commandant of the Coast Guard in June 2022.\6\ The 
Commandant selects a Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast 
Guard, who is her principal advisor on enlisted personnel 
matters.\7\ Master Chief Heath Jones assumed the duties of the 
14th Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard on May 19, 
2022.\8\

FY 2025 COAST GUARD BUDGET REQUEST:

    The President requests $13.8 billion for FY 2025 for the 
activities of the Coast Guard, including $12.3 billion in total 
discretionary funding.\10\ The FY 2025 request for 
discretionary funding represents an increase of $566 million 
(4.8 percent) from the FY 2024 enacted level. H.R. 7659, as 
passed by the House of Representatives on May 14, 2024, 
authorizes $14.8 billion in discretionary funding for FY 
2025.\11\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT (O&S):

    The President requests $10.47 billion for the O&S account 
for FY 2025, a $412 million (4.1 percent) increase from the FY 
2024 enacted level.\12\ H.R. 7659, as passed by the House of 
Representatives, authorizes $11.3 billion for the O&S account 
for FY 2025.\13\ The O&S account supports the day-to-day 
activities of the Coast Guard including administrative 
expenses, support costs, travel, lease payments, and the 
operation and maintenance of infrastructure and assets. The O&S 
account also funds personnel compensation and benefits for 
approximately 44,000 military personnel and 9,000 civilian 
employees.\14\ Included in this request is $5.5 billion for 
military pay and personnel support, $439 million for mission 
support, including enterprise management and environmental 
compliance and restoration, and $4.5 billion for field 
operations.\15\

    The O&S budget request includes increases in funding to 
cover follow-on costs for the operation and maintenance of 
newly acquired assets and technology and increases in other 
administrative expenses.\16\ This includes $40 million for 
personnel and operations and maintenance sustainment funding 
for new cutters, boats, aircraft and capabilities--six Fast 
Response cutters; four MH-60 helicopters; eight Maritime 
Security Response Team boats; shoreside maintenance and support 
personnel for Offshore Patrol Cutters #3 and #4; crew for 
Waterways Commerce Cutter #1; and four hyperbaric recompression 
chambers. The President's budget also requests $10 million for 
the operations and maintenance of newly acquired or 
recapitalized shore facilities in Puerto Rico, Florida, New 
York, and Maryland.\17\

    The President's budget requests $1.8 million in additional 
resources to field the investigators and legal personnel 
necessary to improve the Coast Guard's ability to combat sexual 
misconduct and enabling behaviors in the maritime 
community.\18\ It also requests $4.9 million in additional 
resources to support the transformation of the mariner 
credentialing program, $4.2 million for the purchase of body 
worn cameras, and $22 million in additional resources for 
additional Fast Response Cutter mission support and personnel 
to increase engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.\19\ H.R. 
7659, as passed by the House of Representatives, authorizes $11 
million to fund the acquisition, development, and 
implementation of a new credentialing system for the Merchant 
Mariner credentialing program.\20\

    The proposed O&S increases are offset in part by proposed 
cuts derived through program decreases totaling $84.9 million 
and decommissioning and retiring certain legacy assets for 
$24.3 million, which will result in a total cost savings of 
$109 million and 995 full-time equivalent positions.\21\ 
Specifically, the FY 2025 budget request proposes program 
decreases of $17 million for the National Coast Guard Museum, 
$55 million for military workforce gap temporary reduction, 
$4.6 million in travel reductions, and $7 million in contract 
reductions.\22\ It also proposes the decommissioning of:

PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS (PC&I):

    The President requests $1.56 billion for the PC&I account, 
a $151 million (10.7 percent) increase over the FY 2024 enacted 
level.\24\ H.R. 7659, as passed by the House of 
Representatives, authorizes $3.5 billion for the PC&I account 
for FY 2025.\25\ The PC&I account funds the acquisition, 
procurement, construction, rebuilding, and physical 
improvements of Coast Guard owned and operated vessels, 
aircraft, facilities, aids-to-navigation (ATON), communications 
and information technology systems, and related equipment.\26\ 
Specifically, the budget request includes funding requests for 
sustainment and acquisition of several assets under PC&I which 
are broken down below.\27\

IN-SERVICE VESSEL SUSTAINMENT

    Major Maintenance Availabilities (MMA) ensure in-service 
vessels continue to meet their designed service life through 
the recapitalization of hull, mechanical, electrical and 
electronic systems that have been identified as the highest 
contributors to maintenance costs and operational availability 
degradation.\28\ Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) 
increase the service life of in-service vessels without 
significantly modifying capabilities. The budget requests: $148 
million for in-service vessel sustainment, including $36 
million for 47-ft Motor Life Boat SLEP; $65 million for 270-ft 
Medium Endurance Cutter SLEP; $15 million for 175-ft Coastal 
Buoy Tender MMA; and $20 million for CGC Healy SLEP, and $12 
million for a National Security Cutter.\29\ H.R. 7659, as 
passed by the House of Representatives, authorizes $36 million 
for the service life extension program and any necessary 
upgrades to the 47-foot Motor Life Boat.\30\

NATIONAL SECURITY CUTTER (NSC)

    The budget requests $7 million for post-delivery of an 11th 
NSC and program close-out costs.\31\ The Coast Guard's Program 
of Record (POR) originally called for eight NSCs to replace the 
Service's fleet of twelve high endurance cutters.\32\ The NSCs 
were originally intended to operate in excess of 185 days per 
year to maximize operational capability, but based on crewing 
and maintenance concerns, the Coast Guard now intends to 
operate the vessels for a maximum of 185 days per year.\33\ 
Congress has funded eleven vessels.\34\ The tenth vessel is 
scheduled for delivery later this year.\35\

OFFSHORE PATROL CUTTER (OPC)

    The budget requests $530 million for the construction of 
OPC #7 and Long Lead Time Materials (LLTMs) for OPC #8.\36\ The 
Coast Guard's POR calls for 25 OPCs to replace the Service's 
aging fleet of 29 Medium Endurance Cutters (WMECs).\37\ 
Delivery of the first OPC is expected later in 2024, and 
delivery of the second vessel is expected next year.\38\

FAST RESPONSE CUTTER (FRC)

    The budget requests $216 million for two FRCs to support 
the Service's operations in the Indo-Pacific.\39\ The final two 
boats of the program would bring the program total to 69 FRCs 
to replace the Service's fleet of 110-ft Island Class Patrol 
Boats (WPBs). To date, 54 vessels have been delivered.\40\ 
Delivery of hulls 55 through 57 is anticipated to occur in FY 
2023.\41\ H.R. 7659, as passed by the House of Representatives, 
authorizes $216 million for the acquisition of two Fast 
Response Cutters.\42\

POLAR SECURITY CUTTER (PSC)

    The budget does not call for additional funding for FY 2025 
for the PSC.\43\ Sustainment of the program will occur with 
prior years authorized funds.\44\ The Service's POR calls for 
three PSCs to replace the service's two heavy icebreakers--only 
one of which is still operational. The first PSC was expected 
to be delivered in 2027.\45\ However, at best, the first hull 
will likely not be delivered until the end of the decade.\46\ 
The program suffers from significant delays, and the Coast 
Guard has failed to produce an updated cost estimate or 
delivery estimate to the Committee.

aircraft, sustainment of MH-65 and MH-60 helicopters, and 
installation of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)

OTHER ACQUISITION PROGRAMS

    The budget requests $141.7 million for other acquisition 
programs, including investments in the Service's antiquated IT 
technology.\50\ H.R. 7659, as passed by the House of 
Representatives, authorizes $36.3 million to modernize IT

CONSTRUCTION AND FACILITIES MAINTENANCE

    The budget request also includes $166.75 million for shore 
facilities and ATON.\52\ This request is a decrease of 
approximately $248 million from the FY 2024 enacted level.\53\ 
The Coast Guard estimates that there is a $1 billion deferred 
shore facility maintenance backlog, while the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) approximated that number at $2.6 
billion in February 2019 (likely higher today).\54\ As of 2018, 
the deferred maintenance backlog included more than 5,600 
projects, while the recapitalization and new construction 
backlog included 125 projects.\55\ GAO's analysis of Coast 
Guard data found that as of November 2018, there were hundreds 
of recapitalization projects without cost estimates--
representing a majority of recapitalization projects.\56\ Coast 
Guard officials told GAO that these projects were in the 
preliminary stages of development.\57\ From that report, GAO 
recommended that the Commandant of the Coast Guard employ 
models for its asset lines to predict the outcome of 
investments, analyze trade-offs, and optimize decisions among 
competing investments.\58\ H.R. 7659, as passed by the House of 
Representatives, authorizes $500 million to fund maintenance, 
construction, and repairs for Coast Guard shoreside 
infrastructure.\59\ Of this amount, $225 million is authorized 
for the improvements to facilities at Training Center Cape May, 
$10 million to create an infrastructure development plan for 
the Coast Guard Academy, $50 million to complete repairs and 
improvements of Chase Hall at the Academy, $70 million for a 
floating drydock at Coast Guard yard in Baltimore, $40 million 
for a HC-130J Hangar at Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, 
and $90 million for waterfront improvements of Base 
Seattle.\60\

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D):

    The President requests $6.76 million in FY 2025 for the 
Coast Guard's R&D account, which represents a $713,000 
reduction compared to the previous year's request.\61\ H.R. 
7659, as passed by the House of Representatives, authorizes 
$15.4 million for the R&D account for FY 2025.\62\ The R&D 
account supports improved mission performance for the Service's 
11 statutory missions through applied research and development 
of new technology and methods.

                         THURSDAY, MAY 23, 2024

                  House of Representatives,
          Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime 
                                    Transportation,
            Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:02 a.m., in 
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Daniel Webster 
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation will come to order.
    I ask unanimous consent for the chairman to be authorized 
to declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
    Without objection, show that ordered.
    I ask unanimous consent that the Members not on the 
subcommittee be permitted in the subcommittee today to ask 
questions.
    Without objection, show that ordered.

    OK. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for the 
purpose of an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN, 
    SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

    Mr. Webster of Florida. We meet today to receive testimony 
from the Coast Guard on the fiscal year 2025 budget request.
    I would like to welcome our witnesses, Admiral Linda Fagan, 
who is the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and Master Chief 
Heath Jones, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard.
    First, I would like to recognize the Coast Guard's 
leadership in recovery and response efforts for the Francis 
Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore. I had a chance to go 
view that. That was pretty awesome. This reminds us of the 
vital importance of the Coast Guard in protecting our Nation's 
waterways. We are here today to discuss what the Coast Guard 
needs to continue that, providing that service.
    While I applaud the increase in the President's budget for 
both the operations and support and the procurement, 
construction, and improvements accounts, I urge funding levels 
in line with H.R. 7659, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 
2024, which recently passed the House. That measure authorizes 
nearly double the currently requested amount for new vessels, 
aircraft, IT, and shoreside infrastructure investments.
    But even the House-passed authorization levels are not 
generous. Funding at that level would only stop the growth of 
the construction and maintenance backlog and fund those 
acquisition programs already approved by the Department of 
Homeland Security.
    Admiral Fagan, during your address on the state of the 
Coast Guard, you rightly recognized your Service's funding 
challenges, admitting that your maintenance budget will only 
cover half of the planned cutter maintenance projects in 2024. 
I look forward to hearing you share what you are doing to 
address those challenges.
    I also look forward to hearing the update about your 
recapitalization priorities, including plans for the Polar 
Security Cutter and shoreside infrastructure. This subcommittee 
has serious concerns about the combined budget impact of 
simultaneous construction of the Polar Security Cutters and 
construction of two Offshore Patrol Cutters per year for a 
decade starting in fiscal year 2026. I expect to hear from you 
today about your plan to move these programs forward.
    Given the Coast Guard's current recruitment and retention 
challenges, I also look forward to hearing what the Coast Guard 
is doing to ensure that its members, who give so much to our 
country, have the buildings, facilities, and IT support they 
need and deserve.
    The subcommittee greatly appreciates the hard work that the 
Coast Guard does every day. Just last month, a young Coast 
Guard pilot, Michael McCaslin, the brother of one of our T&I 
Committee staffers, rescued a pregnant woman on a cruise ship 
hundreds of miles off Puerto Rico. And just a few days ago, the 
Coast Guard rescued seven people from a vessel after it was 
disabled by a lightening strike that struck both the captain 
and the vessel off the coast of my home State of Florida. This 
demonstrates why you live up to your motto of semper paratus, 
and we just really appreciate that.
    This subcommittee urges you to be straightforward with 
Congress about the Service's needs and ask for what you need to 
carry out that mission.
    Thank you for your participation today. I look forward to 
your candid testimony.

    You are recognized.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Before I do that, I wanted to ask to be able to allow 
Ranking Member Larsen's statement to be submitted for the 
record.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Without objection, show that 
ordered.
    [Mr. Larsen's prepared statement is on page 33.]
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL OF CALIFORNIA, 
   RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME 
                         TRANSPORTATION

    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for calling today's 
hearing on the fiscal year 2025 budget request for the U.S. 
Coast Guard.
    Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones, while the Service is 
facing trying times, your leadership is instrumental in 
supporting Coasties. You have done an outstanding job leading 
the Service thus far, and I am confident that the Coast Guard 
has a bright future under your leadership.
    We expect a lot from our Coasties. Recently, they have 
responded to the vessel collision and bridge collapse in 
Baltimore, delivered supplies to iced-in McMurdo Station in the 
Antarctic, and traversed the Taiwan Strait.
    I was pleased that the fiscal year 2025 budget request 
included a slight increase in discretionary funding, but still 
more resources are needed to support the Service.
    I have had the opportunity to visit numerous Coast Guard 
stations around the country. While the new cutters and aircraft 
I have seen are great, the people who are charged with 
operating those assets are certainly strained.
    Coasties in many cases are working in subpar buildings. 
They are living hours away from their workplace due to 
insufficient housing allowances. They are not able to take time 
off because of workforce shortages. They often can't find 
quality childcare. And so on.
    I have heard from servicemembers across the country about 
mental health concerns. Search and rescue, drug and migrant 
interdiction, and extended deployments can take a serious 
physical and mental toll. Coasties and their families deserve 
the highest level of medical care regardless of their 
geographic location.
    If we don't take care of the Coasties, we cannot expect the 
same Coast Guard we have come to rely on. Search and rescue 
capacity will decline, more illegal drugs will make it across 
our borders, more environmental disasters will occur as a 
result of fewer vessel inspections and decreased response 
capacity.
    Congress must do better.
    The Commandant has said that the Coast Guard needs to be a 
$20 billion Service by 2030, and I believe that should be the 
minimum.
    Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Coast 
Guard's efforts to address sexual assault and sexual harassment 
and the culture change in the Service.
    Turning a ship as old and large as the Coast Guard takes 
strong leadership, time, and commitment. I am pleased to 
witness strong leadership and commitment by Admiral Fagan and 
believe that the Service is on the right course. This committee 
continues to conduct vigorous oversight to ensure that the ship 
stays on course.
    As we discuss the Coast Guard's budget and ongoing resource 
needs, I hope our witnesses will be candid. Congress and the 
American people need to know what will happen if the Coast 
Guard is not a $20 billion Service by 2030.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    [Mr. Carbajal's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Salud O. Carbajal of California, Ranking 
    Member, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
    Thank you, Chair Webster, for calling today's hearing on the fiscal 
year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Coast Guard.
    Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones: while the Service is facing 
trying times, your leadership is instrumental in supporting Coasties. 
You've done an outstanding job leading the Service thus far, and I'm 
confident that the Coast Guard has a bright future.
    We expect a lot from our Coasties. Recently, they have responded to 
the vessel collision and bridge collapse in Baltimore, delivered 
supplies to iced-in McMurdo Station in the Antarctic and traversed the 
Taiwan Strait.
    I was pleased that the fiscal year 2025 budget request included a 
slight increase in discretionary funding, but still more resources are 
needed to support the Service.
    I've had the opportunity to visit numerous Coast Guard stations 
around the country.
    While the new cutters and aircraft I have seen are great, the 
people charged with operating those assets are strained.
    Coasties, in many cases, are working in subpar buildings. They are 
living hours away from their workplace due to insufficient housing 
allowances. They're not able to take time off because of workforce 
shortages. They often can't find quality childcare.
    I've heard from servicemembers across the country about mental 
health concerns. Search and rescue, drug and migrant interdiction and 
extended deployments can take a serious physical and mental toll. 
Coasties, and their families deserve the highest level of medical care 
regardless of their geographic location.
    If we don't take care of the Coasties, we cannot expect the same 
Coast Guard we've come to rely on. Search and rescue capacity will 
decline. More illegal drugs will make it across our borders. More 
environmental disasters will occur as a result of fewer vessel 
inspections and decreased response capacity.
    Congress must do better. The Commandant has said that the Coast 
Guard needs to be a $20 billion service by 2030, and I believe that 
should be the minimum.
    Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Coast Guard's 
efforts to address sexual assault and sexual harassment and culture 
change in the Service.
    Turning a ship as old and large as the Coast Guard takes strong 
leadership, time, and commitment. I'm pleased to witness strong 
leadership and commitment by Admiral Fagan and believe that the Service 
is on the right course. This Committee will continue to conduct 
vigorous oversight to ensure that the ship stays on course.
    As we discuss the Coast Guard's budget and ongoing resource needs, 
I hope our witnesses will be candid. Congress and the American people 
need to know what will happen if the Coast Guard is not a $20 billion 
service by 2030.
    Thank you, Chairman, and I yield back.

    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
    I would again like to welcome our witnesses today and thank 
them for being here today. We really appreciate that.
    I would like to take a moment to explain our lighting 
system, though it is familiar to everybody in the room, I 
think.
    Red--well, we will start with green. Green means go, yellow 
means slow up, and red means stop.
    I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements 
be included in the record.
    Without objection, show that ordered.
    I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing 
remain open for such time as our witnesses have to provide 
answers to any questions that may be submitted in writing.
    Without objection, show that ordered.
    I ask unanimous consent that the record remain open for 15 
days and that additional comments and information submitted by 
the Members or witnesses be included into the record of today's 
hearing.
    Without objection, show that ordered.
    As your written testimony has been made part of the record, 
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5 
minutes.
    And with that, Commandant, you are recognized for 5 minutes 
for your testimony.

  TESTIMONY OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST 
  GUARD; AND MASTER CHIEF HEATH B. JONES, MASTER CHIEF PETTY 
          OFFICER OF THE COAST GUARD, U.S. COAST GUARD

        TESTIMONY OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT,
                        U.S. COAST GUARD

    Admiral Fagan. Good morning, Chair Webster, thank you. 
Ranking Member Carbajal, distinguished members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
    On behalf of the Service, I would like to thank you for 
your continued support for the Coast Guard, our workforce, and 
our families.
    The work the Coast Guard does every day is critical to the 
Nation's success. We protect ports, waterways, and maritime 
commerce. We respond to crises like the Baltimore bridge 
collapse, hurricanes, and oilspills. We are at our best during 
those challenging leadership responses.
    We are the world's experts at saving lives at sea. We fight 
criminals on the high seas, such as narcotics smugglers, human 
traffickers, and illegal fishermen.
    We are present in the Arctic, the Indo-Pacific, and 
throughout the Western Hemisphere.
    We work to protect U.S. national security every day. We 
work for the Joint Force, interagency, international allies and 
partners to respond to crises and enable responsible maritime 
governance and protect the rules-based international order.
    We are in the news almost every day, and the story is our 
exceptional service to the Nation.
    How do we do it? The answer is our people. Without their 
dedication, the ships or aircraft we are investing in don't 
move. Our people truly are the heart and soul of the Coast 
Guard.
    But we must ensure that their needs are being met. We are 
at risk right now across the Service, and we need your support 
to ensure we continue to support our workforce to continue 
operations today and invest in the capabilities necessary for 
operations tomorrow.
    Those investments reflect our need to be a $20 billion 
Coast Guard by 2030, our need for 3-plus billion dollars in 
PC&I budget annually.
    We need to invest in our talent management system, which 
has not changed in over 60 years, and continue to improve the 
support to our workforce and their families.
    We are in a competition for talent, and our success relies 
on our ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest.
    We must also provide our workforce the tools they need to 
be successful.
    Last year, we celebrated a significant milestone in our 
acquisition portfolio as we launched the first Offshore Patrol 
Cutter, Argus.
    My top acquisition priority is beginning construction on 
Polar Security Cutter, and the topline reality of the budget 
does not align with this priority.
    Our procurement, construction, and improvements 
appropriation is at its lowest level in nearly a decade. To 
properly invest in our readiness today and for the future, the 
Coast Guard needs at least $3 billion annually in PC&I.
    We are extremely grateful to the committee for the $3.4 
billion in PC&I funding included in the Coast Guard 
Authorization Act which just passed the House a few weeks ago.
    I am also concerned about our maintenance budget shortfall. 
We currently project our ship maintenance budget will only 
cover half our planned ship maintenance projects. We have 
similar shortfalls in infrastructure and aircraft accounts.
    Deferring maintenance increases unplanned maintenance, 
disrupts work and training schedules, takes cutters and 
aircraft off operational mission. It reduces readiness and 
operational effectiveness.
    Our people bear the burden of these unplanned repairs. They 
spend time scrambling to keep assets operational and defer 
their own time off and time with their families.
    This isn't a notional problem in the future. It is the 
Coast Guard we are operating today.
    Our crews put their lives on the line every day to protect 
our Nation and the public that we serve. We launch into the 
teeth of a hurricane, we respond to wildfires, we put ourselves 
at risk so that others may live, so that others may be saved, 
and so that we can prosper as a Nation.
    We must invest in 2025 and beyond to generate sustained 
readiness and resilience while building the Coast Guard of the 
future.
    Together, I am confident that we can meet the challenges 
facing the Service and ensure our workforce has the resources 
they need to accomplish their missions safely and effectively.
    I look forward to your questions.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [Admiral Fagan's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
       Prepared Statement of Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant,
                            U.S. Coast Guard
                              Introduction
    Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify. I am 
grateful for your continuing support of the United States Coast Guard. 
Today, I look forward to discussing how the Administration's FY 2025 
Budget request positions the Service to sustain recent strides in 
growing and supporting a resilient workforce, increases meaningful 
presence in the Indo-Pacific, enhances support for the maritime 
community, and delivers capable assets to the fleet, while building the 
Coast Guard of the future.
    The Coast Guard remains the world's premier, multi-mission, 
maritime service responsible for the safety, security, and stewardship 
of the Nation's waters: we offer a unique and enduring value to the 
American public. At all times a military service and branch of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, a federal law enforcement agency, a first responder, a 
regulatory body, and a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community, the 
Coast Guard serves on the front lines for a Nation whose economic 
prosperity and national security are inextricably linked to the sea. 
This pivotal connection was highlighted on March 26th, when the M/V 
DALI allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, resulting 
in the devastating loss of six lives and continuing impacts to the 
Nation's most significant port for light vehicles and other critical 
cargoes. We are working closely with federal, state, and local partners 
to restore the flow of commerce in this vital waterway and enable 
efficient operation of nearby ports and the Marine Transportation 
System.
    Last year, your Coast Guard navigated unique challenges presented 
by our increasingly connected and rapidly changing world. In FY 2023, 
the Service saved over 5,500 lives, assisted over 40,000 people, and 
removed over 212,000 pounds of cocaine and 54,000 pounds of marijuana 
with an approximate wholesale value of $2.9 billion. It responded to 28 
weather or climate disaster events, protected 3.5 million square miles 
of Exclusive Economic Zone, and boarded over 50 foreign vessels to 
suppress illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. In the same 
year, the Coast Guard maintained nearly 45,000 buoys and beacons across 
the Marine Transportation System and conducted over 10,000 waterborne 
patrols to protect critical infrastructure and key resources. It also 
provided support to U.S. Central Command to advance security 
cooperation, maritime security, and counter-piracy objectives in the 
Arabian Gulf, and deployed the Nation's only two icebreakers--the 
cutters Polar Star and Healy--to further U.S. geopolitical, security, 
and economic interests in the High Latitudes.
    The Coast Guard continued to serve as a highly effective partner, 
uniquely qualified to lead the interagency in multiple capacities, 
including incident response and search and rescue. In June 2023, the 
Coast Guard led search and recovery efforts for the missing submersible 
Titan in the Northern Atlantic. In August, crews from Coast Guard 
Station Maui rescued 17 people fleeing the fires that devastated the 
community of Lahaina. Coast Guard personnel also deployed in response 
to Hurricane Lee and Tropical Storm Idalia, saving or assisting 16 
lives and rapidly restoring trade across the Marine Transportation 
System.
    The Service safeguards our Marine Transportation System, a vital 
part of U.S. economic prosperity and national security. In February 
2024, the President signed an Executive Order to bolster the Coast 
Guard's authority to directly address cyber threats and strengthen port 
security. To complement this action, the Service issued a Maritime 
Security Directive on cyber risk management actions for ship-to-shore 
cranes manufactured by People's Republic of China state-owned companies 
and published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on cybersecurity 
in the Marine Transportation System.
    In addition to protecting our ports and maritime partners from 
evolving threats, we also began to expand our presence in the Indo-
Pacific, a region vital to U.S. security, by homeporting the Harriet 
Lane, the Service's first dedicated Indo-Pacific Cutter, in Hawaii. 
This multi-mission cutter's presence in the region is already promoting 
maritime governance through meaningful engagements with regional allies 
and partners. During its first ``Operation Blue Pacific'' patrol, the 
Harriet Lane worked closely with Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, and other 
partners to complete numerous bilateral shiprider operations, advancing 
capacity building with island nations and upholding international 
rules-based order.
    While I am incredibly proud of our Coast Guard Active Duty, 
Reserve, Civilian, and Auxiliary workforce and remain optimistic about 
our future, we must adapt to the growing demand for the Coast Guard in 
the face of evolving global threats. In order to transform our Service 
and continue to provide our unique capabilities to the American people, 
we need Congressional support.
    The ability for the Coast Guard to generate sustained workforce and 
mission readiness is paramount to our ability to protect the Nation's 
maritime safety, security, and prosperity. The FY 2025 President's 
Budget provides needed investment in these areas and helps position the 
Coast Guard for the future.
           Generate Sustained Workforce and Mission Readiness
Workforce Readiness
    My highest priority remains modernizing our talent management 
system, which has not significantly changed in 75 years, to best 
recruit and retain our workforce in the 21st century. I am committed to 
fostering a Service culture that attracts the best talent and empowers 
a resilient force of Coast Guard women and men ready to take on 
tomorrow's challenges.
    The FY 2025 budget requests $160 million to bolster military and 
civilian pay and benefits; funding to enhance our culture through 
efforts related to integrated primary prevention (IPP), victim 
advocacy, anti-hate and anti-harassment prevention and response, and 
modernizing our officer evaluations system. Investments to expand our 
IPP program will promote prevention efforts across all harmful 
behaviors, to include sexual harassment and sexual assault, by 
facilitating the swift implementation of policies and procedures to 
ensure everyone experiences a workplace with enhanced protective 
factors and increased outreach. To further those efforts, support for 
our recently created Enterprise Victim Advocate role--the first of its 
kind across the armed forces--will further advance the connection 
between victims of harmful behavior, stakeholder groups, and Coast 
Guard leadership. In addition to these strides for our workforce, the 
request provides $7 million to bolster our workforce's support of the 
U.S. maritime community by fielding personnel to improve the Coast 
Guard's ability to combat sexual misconduct in the maritime industry 
and to support the transformation of the Mariner Credentialing Program.
Mission Readiness
    The Coast Guard must continue to adapt to a constantly evolving 
environment and remain resilient to change. The demand for the Coast 
Guard has never been higher; we continue to demonstrate our value 
across the globe but increasingly so in the Indo-Pacific, where our 
unique capabilities position us to effectively and meaningfully advance 
U.S. strategy. Through foreign partner interactions and work with 
regional organizations, the Coast Guard is a relevant, non-escalatory 
resource which strengthens maritime governance, the rule of law, and 
democratic institutions.
    The FY 2025 budget requests $263 million to expand Coast Guard 
operations in the Indo-Pacific along three primary lines of effort: 
Increased Presence, Maritime Governance, and Meaningful Engagements. 
This investment includes the acquisition of two Fast Response Cutters 
(FRC) and the addition of a Marine Transportation System Assessment 
Team, a Maritime Engagement Team, and various regional liaisons and 
attaches, and will continues the Service's transition from episodic to 
persistent presence in the region.
    The Coast Guard operates in dynamic conditions, and changes in the 
strategic environment impact our missions every day. Given evolving 
national security threats, we must prepare now for the challenges of 
tomorrow.
    We will employ our assets and resources to the highest priority 
missions that we are uniquely capable to perform, build on our ability 
to lead in crisis, strengthen existing and forge new partnerships to 
improve global maritime governance, and safeguard a rapidly changing 
Marine Transportation System.
    The FY 2025 budget requests funding for the operations, 
maintenance, crew, and mission support elements for six FRCs; shoreside 
maintenance and support personnel for Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC) #3 
and #4; crew for Waterways Commerce Cutter #1; funds to support four 
hyperbaric recompression chambers; and crew, operations, and 
maintenance for four MH-60T helicopters and eight Maritime Security 
Response Team boats. Additionally, the budget includes $10 million for 
the operations and maintenance of newly acquired or recapitalized shore 
facilities.
                  Build the Coast Guard of the Future
    I remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the Coast Guard has 
the capable, modern assets necessary to meet evolving mission demands.
Surface
    The OPC is one of the Service's highest acquisition priorities and 
is absolutely vital to recapitalizing the capability provided by our 
legacy fleet of 210-foot and 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters (MEC). 
In October 2023, the Service christened and launched the first hull in 
the class, the Argus--we look forward to continued progress on this 
critical class of vessels. The FY 2025 request provides $530 million 
for construction of the seventh OPC and long lead time materials for 
the eighth cutter. The legacy assets the OPCs will replace have been 
workhorses for decades and continue to serve the Nation with 
distinction. Thirteen of these venerable cutters have been in operation 
for more than 50 years. The MEC fleet will only become more difficult 
and expensive to maintain, and we will continue to see decreasing 
readiness and operational availability.
    The Service's other acquisition priority remains the Polar Security 
Cutter. In FY 2025 we expect to rely on prior appropriations to 
continue construction of the first hull. In future years it will be 
important that the Nation continue to invest in the heavy polar 
icebreakers that the United States needs to protect America's sovereign 
interests in the polar regions. These cutters are national assets, and 
revitalizing the defense industrial base to produce this first-in-class 
ship is a necessary investment that will pay dividends for decades.
    Some of our inland tenders have been in service since the 1940s, 
maintaining both fixed and floating aids to navigation for the Marine 
Transportation System--the 25,000 miles of rivers and navigable 
channels that support $5.4 trillion in annual commerce and 30 million 
jobs. The FY 2025 request for $135 million supports program management, 
long lead time material for future hulls, and construction of three 
Waterways Commerce Cutters. These cutters--which will replace our 
legacy inland tender fleet--will feature modern designs for propulsion 
and crew habitability to enable men and women to serve in the 
heartland, where they help ensure that some of America's most critical 
waterways remain navigable despite constantly changing conditions and 
water levels.
    As we consider aging assets, one of the most critical elements of 
the Service's surface budget request is the In-Service Vessel 
Sustainment program. That request for $148 million is vital to 
extending the service life of cutters and boats, including our 47, 
motor life boats, Coast Guard Cutter Healy--one of the Nation's two 
polar icebreakers--the 270, MECs, our 175, coastal buoy tenders, and 
even our 418, National Security Cutters. These upgrades provide legacy 
assets with modern capabilities, repair wear and tear on major systems, 
and overall deliver incredible return on investment.
    The FRC is an incredibly capable asset, with a proven track record 
of successful mission execution around the globe. Our FRCs demonstrate 
endurance and agility in their near-shore operations but have also 
displayed an inimitable ability to patrol the Indo-Pacific and engage 
with our partners, increasing presence and promoting governance 
throughout the region. The FY 2025 request provides $216 million to 
support the construction of two FRCs that will expand Coast Guard 
presence to support the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States. 
FRCs are uniquely equipped to conduct the types of engagements that 
support our partners, deter our adversaries, and promote good maritime 
governance in this vital region.
Aviation Assets
    Coast Guard aviation is integral to accomplishing our wide spectrum 
of missions. Aviation assets and support infrastructure are, and will 
continue to be, a major target of future investments. The FY 2025 
request includes $206 million to recapitalize and sustain fixed and 
rotary-wing aircraft, including support for growth of the MH-60T 
helicopter fleet through the acquisition of four aircraft that will 
continue our transition away from the MH-65E as that aircraft reaches 
its end of service life in the late 2030s.
Shore Infrastructure
    Shore facility recapitalization is critical to mission success. As 
the Service deploys new, more capable assets, infrastructure projects 
like pier construction, maintenance and industrial support buildings, 
and facilities that support our workforce cannot be viewed as optional. 
The FY 2025 request includes targeted investments to continue the 
buildout of Base Charleston, South Carolina; funds the construction of 
a FRC homeport in Astoria, Oregon; delivers new facilities for Sector 
Lower Mississippi in Memphis, Tennessee; and supports the buildout of 
Forward Operating Locations for FRCs in the Indo-Pacific. Given the 
Coast Guard's broad infrastructure needs, these investments are 
necessary to ensure the Service has the resilient infrastructure 
required to meet the operational demands of today and tomorrow.
                               Conclusion
    The Coast Guard is the only military Service outside the Department 
of Defense and the only Armed Force that is primarily funded via non-
defense appropriations. Funding the Coast Guard at the levels below 
those requested in this budget could jeopardize the long-term readiness 
of the Service, putting American lives, national security, and the 
Marine Transportation System at risk. I ask for your support to ensure 
the Coast Guard--like every U.S. Armed Force--has the resources 
necessary to safeguard the Nation.
    Now is the time to move the U.S. Coast Guard forward. Our 
commitments at home to protect, defend, and save, grow every day, while 
demand for the Service around the globe has never been higher. To meet 
the rising challenges, we must invest to secure the Homeland and 
counter strategic competitors.
    With the support of the Administration and Congress, your Coast 
Guard will continue to live up to our motto--Semper Paratus--Always 
Ready. Thank you for your enduring support.

    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you so much.
    Now, Master Chief Jones, you are recognized.

 TESTIMONY OF MASTER CHIEF HEATH B. JONES, MASTER CHIEF PETTY 
          OFFICER OF THE COAST GUARD, U.S. COAST GUARD

    Master Chief Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Good morning, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, 
and distinguished subcommittee members. It is an honor to 
appear before you as the Master Chief Petty Officer of the 
Coast Guard.
    And as I begin, I would like to express my sincere 
appreciation, alongside Admiral Fagan, and on behalf of our 
dedicated Coast Guard sentinels, for your unwavering support of 
our workforce and their families.
    Our workforce is the heart and soul of the Coast Guard, and 
their dedication and sacrifice to keeping our Nation safe and 
secure shows in their commitment to duty.
    I want to echo the Commandant and clearly state to this 
committee and our entire workforce that we are committed to 
revitalizing our talent management system and to strengthening 
our Service culture.
    Despite the work that remains, I am immensely proud of our 
workforce's unwavering drive and dedication to tackle every 
challenge head on.
    The Coast Guard is more than a military service. At the 
core of every sentinel is the call to serve and to help others.
    We are a closely bonded community and our Coast Guard 
families are paramount. Their altruistic sacrifices and 
constant support are imperative to achieving our mission.
    Therefore, we must provide for our families by focusing on 
the acronym of CASH: childcare, access to physical and 
behavioral healthcare, schools, and housing.
    As we discuss the future of the Coast Guard, my primary 
focus will always be our sentinels, specifically the Service's 
ability to attract and retain talented individuals essential to 
effectively carry out the critical missions that our Nation 
calls us to do and our Nation deserves.
    Additionally, while we are extremely optimistic about the 
positive trends in our Coast Guard recruiting efforts, we must 
continue to invest in the resources our members needed to 
enhance our recruiting technologies and capabilities.
    We must also continue to focus on base pay to ensure that 
we can maintain our ability to compete with the private sector 
for the talent that we need.
    The fiscal year 2025 pay raise and the work of the Quality 
of Life Panel have made steps in the right direction.
    While I acknowledge that young people who join our Service 
are not primarily motivated by financial gain, it is essential 
to recognize that they may be more likely to leave for better 
opportunities if offered.
    These highly skilled Americans execute a broad array of 
missions every day. To meet these demands, we require stable 
and on-time appropriations to provide the tools and 
infrastructure to recruit, train, and retain them.
    As we saw in 2019 when Coast Guard members did not receive 
paychecks, continuing resolutions pose an immediate and severe 
threat to our Service's readiness.
    Beyond pay, we need the appropriate facilities to train our 
people. Training Center Cape May, our single accession point 
for the entire enlisted workforce, will always remain a top 
priority for Admiral Fagan and I.
    As we prepare to break ground on the first new barracks in 
over 50 years, we express our gratitude to Congress for their 
recent support and planning of the construction of the second 
barracks.
    However, we must not lose focus on the ongoing total 
recapitalization efforts at Cape May. The current facilities 
hinder our ability to continuously train recruits to Service 
standards.
    By modernizing these facilities, we can significantly 
increase our throughput, ensuring that we can meet the growing 
demands of our mission. Therefore, the Service needs a 
modernized training facility to develop the most resilient and 
fleet-ready sentinels.
    To this end, the Coast Guard has included a request for a 
multipurpose training facility and barracks recapitalization in 
Cape May as part of our unfunded priorities list of 2025.
    I would like to reiterate the critical role of the Coast 
Guard in protecting our Nation's maritime interests and 
ensuring the safety and security of our citizens.
    The Coast Guard will continue to face significant 
challenges in maintaining Service readiness and modernizing 
capabilities to meet the evolving threats and demands of the 
21st century. But we remain true to our motto and we will be 
semper paratus, but we cannot do that without your continued 
support.
    Your Coast Guard remains steadfast in its dedication to 
attracting and fostering a skilled and inclusive workforce, and 
I am grateful for the unwavering commitment of this committee 
to support the mission to defend and safeguard America's vital 
maritime domain.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you 
today, and I look forward to your questions.
    [Master Chief Jones did not submit a prepared statement.]
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you.
    Thank you both for your testimony. We really appreciate 
that.
    I will turn to questions. I will recognize myself.
    I first want to say both of you are a credit to the Coast 
Guard, and you have presented yourself well today. I look 
forward to your answers to the questions.
    Admiral Fagan, on April 29, during an interview with the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies, you twice 
stated that the Polar Security Cutter was on budget. This 
committee is well aware that the Coast Guard does not have an 
agreed-upon price or a timeline for the program.
    What are your comments about that?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you, Chairman.
    I share your concerns with regard to the current progress 
and state of the Polar Security Cutter. When I said we are on 
budget, I was reflecting the previous appropriations in prior 
years that have been budgeted, over $1.8 billion, with 
approximately $820 million remaining in previous appropriations 
for Polar Security Cutter.
    And I acknowledge that the Polar Security Cutter, there is 
no ask in the 2025 budget. It reflects some of the top line of 
pressure and priorities.
    We are working daily with the shipyard who has the 
contract, Bollinger Mississippi, to bring clarity to both the 
design maturity and timeline and cost. I don't have that 
definitized yet. Committed to sharing it with the committee as 
we gain greater fidelity with regard to what rebaselining in 
the schedule will look like with regard to Polar Security 
Cutter.
    Polar Security Cutter, we are building that under an 
integrated program office with the Navy, so, we are working 
with the Navy as well as we work to understand what cost and 
time is associated with that.
    This is a critical national asset. It is a national 
security asset. It is critical to our sovereignty in the Arctic 
and elsewhere. We remain committed to fielding that Polar 
Security Cutter.
    I have a sense of urgency. I share the frustration with 
regard to timeline. But we remain committed to creating that 
clarity and articulation with regard to cost, schedule, and 
design maturity, and committed to sharing that with the 
committee as it comes into clarity.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. How does the Navy play into all 
that?
    Admiral Fagan. It is an integrated program office that is 
overseeing the building and the execution of the contract. And 
so, we work with the Navy on the contracting and acquisition 
piece of procuring the Polar Security Cutter.
    And I am happy to have the staff come over and give your 
staff more details on how that is working. It is a great 
relationship with the Navy, and we continue to remain 
committed, both Services, through that integrated program 
office.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Will they have any ownership in the 
boat, in the security cutter, or is it just advice they are 
giving us?
    Admiral Fagan. Oh, sure, the cutter will be a commissioned 
Coast Guard cutter and the Coast Guard will operate it on 
behalf of the Nation as a national security asset.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Is there an agreement of a cost 
estimate and a timeline being--is anybody withholding it from 
this committee or is it just it hasn't been produced yet?
    Admiral Fagan. Sir, we are not withholding the cost and 
timeline schedule. We will provide that as soon as there is 
clarity. We are working diligently with Bollinger Mississippi 
to provide that clarity. And certainly as soon as we have it, I 
am committed to sharing it with the committee.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. So, on the screen I think is going 
to be an appropriated authorized level for the Coast Guard.
    [Slide shown.]
    Mr. Webster of Florida. So, the level that was agreed to is 
the top one, but the money we got is not that. So, we are 
short. I mean, is Homeland Security taking part of our money?
    Admiral Fagan. Sir, I, as every agency and organization in 
the Government, am subjected to a topline budget submission, 
and we continue to work to submit budgets that reflect 
priorities for the Nation. I acknowledge, and what the chart 
reflects, we are at the lowest PC&I level of funding for the 
organization, the lowest that we have seen in 10 years.
    We continue to work to make priority decisions as we submit 
those budgets and as I have acknowledged and we just were 
talking about the Polar Security Cutter. The outyear cost for 
fielding additional Polar Security Cutters, that is not a 
number that is going to fit in the current top line as the 
budget is constructed for the Coast Guard.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. OK. My time is up, so, I will yield 
back and thank you right now. I appreciate that.
    Ranking Member Carbajal, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are the 
chairman. Your time is never up if you don't want it to be up. 
But I appreciate you handing it over to me, Mr. Chairman.
    Master Chief Jones, I have had the opportunity to meet and 
talk with Coasties stationed across the country and across the 
world. I have found that the best way to understand their 
problems is to ask what their spouses would change about their 
experience with the Coast Guard.
    What are you hearing from servicemembers and their 
families? And what is the Coast Guard doing to address those 
concerns?
    Master Chief Jones. Thank you for the question, sir.
    And I would say that you are absolutely spot on. That is 
where we often get the most realistic feedback on things or how 
it is affecting the families.
    In my opening statement, when I referred to the acronym of 
CASH, that is where we got that from. That came from our 
ombudsman at large who visits with the families as we are 
visiting with units.
    Those four things--the childcare, the access to physical 
and behavioral healthcare, schools, and housing--are the top 
four things everywhere we have sentinels stationed around the 
world. Where they are geographically, that order may change in 
there, but those are the top four things at all times.
    Some areas where we have seen it is making a marked 
difference have been on the ability to get childcare subsidies 
so that our folks can pay for childcare in areas where we don't 
have child development centers. We have made investments in the 
childcare development centers in areas of mass where we have 
large groups.
    The change that is forthcoming this summer to be able to 
have the childcare subsidy sent directly to the families so 
that the families can then determine the best childcare for 
their situation is making a marked improvement in this area, 
sir.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Admiral Fagan, with the passage of the Safer Seas Act, the 
Coast Guard is tasked with implementing several new authorities 
and requirements for industry.
    How important is the requirement to report harassment to 
the Coast Guard? And how does the Coast Guard plan to use that 
information?
    Admiral Fagan. We are actively implementing the Safer Seas 
Act now. We are 100 percent committed to eradicating sexual 
assault, sexual harassment, not just at sea, on commercial 
vessels, but in our own organization as well.
    Every employee, whoever their employer is, has the right to 
a workplace that is free from sexual assault and sexual 
harassment.
    We have stood up the call lines. We are accepting calls 
from mariners who experience harmful behaviors at sea and are 
actively investigating those cases.
    What is good for the commercial industry and our mariners 
applies as well to our workforce, and we are committed to that 
work and look forward to continuing to work with the committee 
as we engage to eliminate those behaviors at sea and in our own 
workforce.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Admiral Fagan, in light of Operation Fouled Anchor, the 
Coast Guard underwent a, quote, ``accountability and 
transparency review,'' end quote, which resulted in directed 
actions for you and your leadership team. All the while, the 
Coast Guard is facing a 10-percent workforce shortfall.
    Any amount of distrust in leadership will hinder 
recruitment and potentially harm readiness.
    Do you have the resources you need to fully accomplish 
these actions? And will additional resources be needed?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
    We completed the accountability and transparency review, it 
was a 90-day sprint, to help focus the work ahead for the 
organization.
    I am happy to report that we are well underway in 
completing the directed actions in the direct action report.
    But that is not the only thing we are doing. It is part of 
a much broader effort on the part of the organization to 
address Service culture and to eliminate the harmful behaviors 
of assault, harassment, bullying, hazing, retaliation, 
retribution.
    I do need resources, and I owe the committee more insight 
into investments. For example, our human capital IT system has 
not been updated in years, and we need to have a system that 
allows us to track and increase transparency around misconduct 
and crimes when they occur.
    There are additional people resources we need to add into 
our personnel system, and we have made some of those 
investments now as we continue to understand the work ahead.
    Another example is an Integrated Prevention Program Office. 
I have an office of one on the DoD side. These are much larger 
programs and they are all areas for additional investment, and 
look forward to working with the committee to ensure that we 
are resourced on parity with other military services and that 
we are providing the support that our workforce so much 
deserves.
    Mr. Carbajal. Building on that, how are you working to 
address the issue of trust among the workforce? You have 
already touched on some of it.
    Admiral Fagan. So, it is clear that trust and trust in 
leadership is a central theme. That trust was lost over a 
lengthy period of time.
    It is going to take time to rebuild that trust, and I am 
100 percent committed to that. And as I said, we have embarked 
on a number of initiatives and efforts that include training, 
leadership awareness, understanding our own administrative 
misconduct system, investing in resources.
    And this is not a checklist approach, it is not a one-and-
done. This is the journey we are on now as an organization, and 
trust is at the core of all that we do, and it is most 
elemental for us as leaders.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chair, I am out of time. I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Dr. Babin, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Dr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I also want to thank Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones 
for being here today.
    It seems like it has been a very busy time for the U.S. 
Coast Guard here lately. The Dali hitting the Key Bridge in 
Maryland. A recent barge crash and oilspill in Galveston. 
Responding to devastating storms and flooding in southeast 
Texas. And some impressive seizures of illegally harvested fish 
in the Gulf of Mexico by illegal Mexican immigrants.
    We know you have got a lot on your plate. We appreciate you 
coming in to discuss your fiscal year 2025 budget request with 
us.
    One of the comments I consistently hear when talking with 
members of the Coast Guard is what a serious issue that housing 
is. In fact, you have already addressed it this morning a 
little bit.
    I know this is an issue you are familiar with, but 
particularly for junior enlisted members of the Coast Guard, 
housing is a tremendous challenge.
    I notice that the fiscal year 2025 budget request did not 
include an increase in the housing fund, and I know you have a 
limited budget to work with. But I was curious why you decided 
not to include an increase in housing for your request.
    So, the Coast Guard is doing a lot of great work--excuse 
me, if you can address that.
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you for the question around housing.
    Dr. Babin. Yes.
    Admiral Fagan. So, the best approach to housing for our 
workforce is a diversified approach. So, ensuring that we have 
got parity with DoD and our pay scales that include a housing 
allowance for our work members and engaging in that system to 
ensure that that housing allowance is reflective of actual 
costs in living areas.
    Other areas, we have lease authority and exercise leases so 
that junior members have some certainty and ability to access 
housing.
    And then, in remote locations where there is insufficient 
housing, the option to build and operate Coast Guard-built 
housing is also an option.
    And we exercise all three of those to ensure that our 
members have access to housing.
    Housing is a challenge nationwide. There has been 
disruption in the housing market. And so, just finding 
available housing is priority one.
    Two is ensuring that the workforce then has the pay and the 
ability to exercise those leases.
    And we are working across all of those portfolios.
    Dr. Babin. Good to hear.
    The Coast Guard is doing a lot of great work to support the 
southeast Texas community in response to the ongoing rainfall 
and flooding that we have seen over the past really 6 weeks.
    Air Station Houston, which I represent, is currently 
operating three Dolphin helicopters. They are doing a great 
job. We are extremely proud of them. But I think there is a 
general consensus that an upgrade is needed.
    I am curious if and when the air station will be getting 
upgraded to the new MH-60 helicopters. Is this something that 
is in the fiscal year 2025 budget or is something in the near-
term plan? And if you don't have that information on hand, I 
would appreciate it if you would send that to my team.
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
    We will have the team provide the more detailed approach 
with regard to how we are transitioning from the aging fleet of 
65s to the new fleet of 60s.
    And Air Station Houston is one of those air stations that 
will get 60 helicopters, but it is space constrained, the 
hangar. We have got more work to do there to enable a fielding 
of the 60s at Air Station Houston.
    We are committed to moving towards the 60 fleet and 
replacing the 65s. We have also got work to do, though, in the 
later phases of that to understand what the right rotary wing 
asset is going to be for some of those specialized missions.
    But right now, we remain focused on those primary search-
and-rescue stations. As I said, Houston is on schedule for 
that, and I will have the team walk you through the details of 
how we do those transitions.
    Dr. Babin. OK. Thank you.
    And lastly, the recruitment challenges facing the Coast 
Guard are very serious.
    Master Chief Jones, can you talk about how you are working 
to address these challenges, and what is the Coast Guard doing 
to improve recruitment, and what are some of the challenges 
that you are seeing to get the recruitment up?
    Master Chief Jones. Yes, sir. Thank you very much for that 
question.
    Recruiting is actually a reason for us to be optimistic 
right now, thanks in large part to the support of this 
committee over the last couple years for investment into our 
recruiting capacity: opening new recruiting offices, creating a 
recruiter rating so that we have folks that that is their 
expertise and that is where they focus.
    I just actually spoke to the CO of Recruiting Command this 
morning, and we, as of this week, have passed 3,600 recruits 
into Training Center Cape May.
    Our goal every year is 4,200; the last time we reached that 
was 2017. The 3,600 we passed this week is the most we have had 
since 2017, and we remain pretty optimistic that we may be able 
to meet that goal.
    What that does is it allows us to, where we have maybe 
bottomed out on the gap, but we still have many years in front 
of us to close that gap of building back forward with this.
    So, we just look forward to continued support to open more 
recruiting offices in the areas where we need them, and I truly 
believe that we are going to see the sustained trend upwards.
    Dr. Babin. Thank you very much.
    My time has expired, so, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Ranking Member Larsen, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Commandant Fagan, the budget request has $4.9 million for 
the mariner credentialing. I believe in the recently passed 
Coast Guard authorization, we authorized $11 million, so, it is 
a little less than half--much less than half--of the $11 
million.
    Do you expect that you will come back in the next year to 
look for the remainder? Or how will you approach that?
    Admiral Fagan. You are referring to the Navita system, that 
we do have a budget authority field. It will field it to an 
initial operating capacity and we will need to come back for 
additional funding authority to field the full system.
    It is a critical step forward in bringing our mariner 
licensing and credentialing into the modern era, and look 
forward to continuing to work with the committee to do that.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks.
    So, when the other uniformed services have funding 
shortfalls, they are actually pretty brazen. They go to the 
Pentagon and ask for money. In this case, you have the Francis 
Scott Key Bridge that has put further burdens on Coast Guard's 
operations in order to deal with that situation.
    I asked Admiral Gautier a couple weeks ago when he 
testified here about backfilling the Coast Guard budget because 
of the resources devoted to the Key Bridge situation.
    Are you any closer to deciding how much and when you will 
be requesting from the administration any backfill dollars?
    Admiral Fagan. So, the direct cost to the Coast Guard at 
this point of the Francis Scott Key Bridge response is 
approximately $20 million in fuel and maintenance and spare 
parts.
    The broader reality is that as we focus that readiness and 
operational capacity on that particular response, it diminishes 
our ability to create operational capacity for other responses.
    It also highlights the fragility of the Marine 
Transportation System and infrastructure, and there are 
opportunities for greater investments there for the Nation to 
secure our waterways. And we are working to identify where 
those areas of investment are beyond just the immediate direct 
cost that the Coast Guard has expended.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, I imagine we are going to 
have a hearing probably in the future on what you find out 
about what we need to do to better harden the MTS.
    But do you have a plan to go to the administration and ask 
for that $20 million or so to help with backfill?
    Admiral Fagan. We will continue to work through the process 
as there is opportunity for a supplemental or to articulate the 
cost for the Guard and we will engage in the process, yes sir.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks.
    So, on the PC&I budget, you have $1.56 billion and you said 
in your testimony you really need $3 billion. Is that what I 
got? Is that what I understood?
    Admiral Fagan. Yes. Closer to $3 billion to $4 billion is 
the actual PC&I need a year.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And did you ask for that and it 
got pared down by DHS? Or what is that, to the extent that you 
can enlighten us on the process there at DHS?
    Admiral Fagan. So, as we work to submit a topline budget to 
the Department, hard offset decisions need to be made within 
the Service.
    And so, as a capital intensive frontline operating 
organization, we prioritize people and operating assets as we 
work to create that topline budget.
    And you can see in the chart that was shown earlier, we are 
at our lowest level of PC&I funding in 10 years. The 
maintenance accounts are about half of what they need to be.
    We have normalized parts exchanges as we take good parts 
off the cutters when they come in and put them onto others.
    Those numbers reflect the reality of operating a frontline 
operating agency and critically recapitalizing the organization 
with regard to the major cutter programs.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Is it your role then in that 
process to explain to DHS that you have people, but they need 
to operate on platforms, but they are not funding the platforms 
for people to operate on and you are hitting that point where 
the lines in the graph cross, which is a bad place to be?
    Admiral Fagan. No, we continue to articulate that need. We 
signal the highest priority need through the unfunded priority 
list, which I know the committee has seen. Those are some of 
the first priorities. And continue to engage the process to 
adequately identify those areas of investments that the Service 
needs.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. I will just conclude, Mr. Chair, 
by just noting we are still monitoring the Base Seattle 
expansion in that role.
    So, we will follow up with you on that from the Pacific 
Northwest, Admiral. Thanks a lot.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The ranking member yields back.
    Mr. Ezell, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones, for being 
here. It is always good to see you both come before the 
committee.
    The Coast Guard plays such a vital role in securing our 
Nation's maritime border and securing America's ports. As a 
member of this committee, I want to ensure that the men and 
women of this branch have the resources they need to carry out 
their mission effectively.
    Currently, the Coast Guard is facing an unprecedented 
manpower shortage. Autonomous and uncrewed vessels could 
potentially alleviate the strain that is putting on the force.
    Great strides are being made in my district in south 
Mississippi at the Roger Wicker Center for Ocean Enterprise, 
which includes numerous research and development partnership 
programs focused on uncrewed maritime systems in the broader 
blue economy.
    Admiral Fagan, do you think that the autonomous maritime 
vehicles could help alleviate your workforce shortage?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
    Obviously, unmanned systems and unmanned technology is 
here, it is game changing, and it is critical to ensure that we 
have that appropriately reflected in our portfolio of operating 
capacity.
    We released an unmanned system strategy in 2023. We are 
working a joint program office with CBP as we operate MQ-9s, 
examples of the way that the Service is bringing unmanned 
technology into our portfolio.
    ScanEagle is a critical enabler on our National Security 
Cutters. We have contracted with Saildrone, which are unmanned 
on-the-water systems, and we continue to look for how we can 
bring unmanned technology into our portfolio.
    But unmanned is not not manned. It still requires people to 
operate those systems. But continue to look at that technology 
as key enablers for our workforce.
    Mr. Ezell. Very good.
    When looking at acquisitions, what are some of the needs 
that the Coast Guard in the autonomous sphere, what are some of 
the needs that you have in this vessel space?
    Admiral Fagan. Specific to autonomy or just broader?
    Mr. Ezell. Yes, yes.
    Admiral Fagan. We continue to look at those technologies. 
ScanEagle is a great example that we fielded, that ship-based, 
ship-recovered, contractor-owned, contractor-operated unmanned 
system, into the NSC fleet.
    It has been game changing for us in the operational work 
that we do. We will continue to look for other opportunities to 
field unmanned systems into new assets.
    We have talked about the Polar Security Cutter. That, too, 
will be a platform that is ripe for unmanned technology in 
certain portfolios.
    Mr. Ezell. Very good.
    The Coast Guard currently collaborates with CBP on the use 
of long-range autonomous aircraft systems as well. These types 
of assets provide the Service with the ability to monitor large 
areas in a cost-effective way.
    Does the Coast Guard plan to explore the acquisition of its 
own long-range unmanned aircraft systems?
    Admiral Fagan. We are operating jointly with CBP with the 
MQ-9s. They have provided a great benefit.
    As we look at the aviation portfolio that we are operating 
as a Service, we have talked about the 65-to-60 transition, we 
have got a medium-range and long-range fixed-wing aircraft 
portfolio that we are also looking at from an analysis 
standpoint. And you can logically look at that analysis and 
study and conclude that there is room for unmanned systems.
    What that is, how it is operated, and what kind of budget 
support and people support we will need to do that is part of 
an ongoing analysis of where we are with the overall aviation 
portfolio.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    We are seeing a lot of things going on in the country right 
now, around the world especially.
    Could you tell us a little bit about some of your concerns 
the Coast Guard role is playing around the world to some of our 
adversaries, such as Iran and China and Russia?
    Admiral Fagan. We are a globally deployed Coast Guard. So, 
the demand for the kind of capabilities, professionalism, law 
enforcement, rule of law that the United States Coast Guard 
brings to the maritime problem set, that demand is loud and 
growing.
    The work we are doing in the Indo-Pacific, we specifically 
engage partner nations and allies, help them build their own 
sovereignty, their own capacity.
    Look no further than the Harriet Lane, who was in Vanuatu 
in the Pacific recently helping Vanuatu enforce their own 
sovereignty and their own exclusive economic zone by allowing 
Vanuatu to board Chinese fishing vessels in Vanuatu's exclusive 
economic zone.
    Whether it is ships or people, we have the great respect of 
many coast guards and navies around the world and look forward 
to continue to be able to enable other nations to create their 
own capacity and sovereignty.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    Mr. Chairman, if I have just 1 minute, I have a question 
submitted by Chairman Graves, if I could ask on his behalf.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. You are recognized.
    Mr. Ezell. My next question is on behalf of T&I full 
committee Chairman Sam Graves.
    With bridge safety at the forefront of everyone's mind 
right now, including the Midwest just north of Chairman Graves' 
district where a barge struck the Fort Madison Bridge and shut 
down operations for a few hours, do you think an evaluation of 
the Truman-Hobbs list of bridges makes sense? And should 
Congress look for resources to fund those critical 
infrastructure assets?
    Admiral Fagan. It is clear if you look at the 
infrastructure in the country, and obviously the Dali and the 
recent barge-bridge allision, it reflects the changes in the 
Marine Transportation System that have occurred in time.
    And we are looking at how we might look holistically at 
several of the key ports in the country to ensure that there is 
an understanding of what the infrastructure is, what has 
changed, and what might be needed to mitigate it, and bridges 
will be a part of that.
    I am happy to come back to Chairman Graves and others and 
share with the committee thinking in a way ahead to ensure that 
our Nation's maritime transportation system is secure and 
resilient.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Mr. Pappas, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Pappas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Admiral Fagan, Master Chief Jones, thanks for being with 
us, for your service to our Nation, and for your leadership, 
which is so critical for a number of the emerging challenges 
that we face as a Nation. I appreciate your insights today.
    And, Admiral Fagan, I want to ask you about an issue of 
local and regional concern in my district.
    Coast Guard Station Portsmouth Harbor is among the Coast 
Guard's busiest facilities within the northern New England 
sector. In January 2024, the facility experienced significant 
damage and was forced to temporarily close. As a result of a 
winter storm, the floating pier at the station was severely 
damaged. The storm caused a sinkhole adjacent to the seawall at 
the facility.
    While the Coast Guard has initiated interim repairs to 
restore operations at the facility--it is also leasing a space 
at a nearby marina--we know the shore infrastructure remains at 
a degraded state.
    So, I know that the Shore Infrastructure Programming and 
Governance Council recently met to prioritize the 
infrastructure needs across the Coast Guard. This station's 
covered moorings was one of the top requested funding 
priorities in the First Coast Guard District.
    But the district hasn't yet received the results from the 
governance council, and there is concern about how long this 
work is going to take.
    The work includes additional funding through future budget 
requests to perform survey and design work, but the station 
can't wait years for this survey and design work to happen 
before it even considers the needed repairs and upgrades that 
must be made.
    So, I am wondering if you are focused on this particular 
issue, if you can commit to prioritizing the rebuilding of this 
facility, and if you could just comment at large on the status 
of our infrastructure across the country and what investments 
we need to be making.
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
    And I am familiar with the flooding that occurred last 
fall, the damage at the station, and we have reflected money 
and priority in the unfunded priority list specific to that 
station.
    This comes back to the overall shortfall in the PC&I 
account writ large, the lowest level of funding in 10 years.
    And so, if you look at stations around the country, there 
is critical need, not just in the station you have referenced, 
but in others, at air stations, and across the country.
    Getting to $3 to $4 billion of predictable, regular funding 
into the PC&I account helps create the kind of predictability 
and certainty to begin the design work and the planning work 
early, and then allow us to execute that money in a way that is 
responsible to the American public.
    But this is a shortfall and a challenge that has been with 
the Service for a number of years, and you see it directly in 
your district. And we are committed to continue to, one, 
articulate the need, and then work to ensure that we have got 
the process maturity to execute on that money.
    Mr. Pappas. Well, thank you.
    I know you agree that our Coast Guard deserves to operate 
in the most modern, resilient facilities possible, and that we 
need to be able to deal with challenges that come up, including 
from weather events like we saw affect Station Portsmouth 
Harbor.
    So, I appreciate your attention to that. And any additional 
details you have about Portsmouth, we would be willing to talk 
with you more about that offline.
    I also appreciate the conversation earlier about the 
accountability and transparency review. I know you said that 
continues to produce results. And I hope you continue to keep 
this subcommittee updated on what the findings are there.
    Master Chief Jones, thanks very much for your conversation 
around recruitment. I think this is such a core issue. And you 
discussed some of the systemic problems in terms of just 
quality of life issues that we need to address for the Service. 
And I appreciate the engagement that you have had with Coasties 
and their families.
    In response to the recruiting challenges, the Coast Guard 
Authorization Act includes about $12 million in fiscal year 
2025 to fund additional recruiting personnel and offices for 
the Coast Guard Recruiting Command and $9 million to enhance 
Coast Guard recruiting capabilities. I think these are smart 
investments.
    Is this of the magnitude that is needed to continue the 
progress that you say we are making? Will you continue to be 
optimistic if this is the level that we are able to fund this 
this year and in future years?
    Master Chief Jones. Yes. Any investment into our recruiting 
capacity is appreciated. With some of the technology that we 
need to allow us to recruit, with some of the modern tools, 
that is where the investment where we are really optimistic 
where the funding is going to help us get to where--if a 
recruiter meets someone at an event right now, we have got an 
older paper-based system that takes us just a long time to go 
back and forth.
    This investment is going to allow us to we could leave that 
event with that member knowing, ``OK, if I want, I can go to 
Training Center Cape May on this date,'' and we can shrink the 
timeline between contact with a recruit and getting recruits 
through Cape May.
    So, any investment in that we do appreciate as we continue 
to move forward.
    Mr. Pappas. Well, I know it takes time to build systems and 
momentum, and to change culture even, and to help spread the 
word. So, we appreciate what you are doing there. Please keep 
us updated on what we can do in Congress to help capitalize on 
this recent success.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Ms. Scholten, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    And thank you so much to our witnesses. Appreciate you 
joining us today. This is such an important conversation.
    As you both know, I am especially pleased to discuss the 
issues facing Coast Guard City U.S.A., Grand Haven. I invite 
you to our Coast Guard festival, the centennial this summer, 
and it is a lovely time.
    The Great Lakes are essential to American commerce, which 
is why I am laser-focused on the U.S. Coast Guard Great Lakes 
icebreaker program. As you know, the Coast Guard included $25 
million in its fiscal year 2025 unfunded priorities list to 
acquire new heavy icebreakers for the Great Lakes.
    I have to endure a lot of jokes in Michigan, because we had 
a low ice season, about whether or not we still need those. But 
believe me, I know how much we do.
    Planning out and trying to predict what comes in future 
years is so essential, and we are unprepared right now when it 
comes to the current state of our Great Lakes icebreakers.
    This question is for Admiral Fagan.
    In 2024, the $35 million that was requested was not funded. 
How does this year's appropriation sort of come on the heels of 
that unfunded priority from 2024? And how can we ensure that 
this gets funded and we make up additionally what was lost from 
2024?
    Admiral Fagan. And I have testified previously, we are 
committed to an additional Great Lakes icebreaker. It is 
critical that we have year-round access to navigation in the 
Great Lakes. This most previous winter's lack of ice 
notwithstanding, it is vital to the economic security of the 
Nation.
    And so, funding received in 2024 will help us with the 
analyze/select phase of acquisition for that icebreaker. From 
the time you start analyze and select, it will still be a 
number of years to actually build and field that icebreaker. 
And so, I understand the urgency and the sense of concern over 
the need to field the Great Lakes icebreaker.
    A lot of discussion around Mackinaw, which is the current 
icebreaker operating up there. It is a 20-year-old design. 
There are some limits in hull form.
    But we remain committed to the Great Lakes icebreaker as a 
priority and in our 2025 UPL request $25 million for program 
management and to begin bringing that program forward.
    But understand the urgency, and we are committed to working 
with the committee to ensure that that Great Lakes icebreaker 
becomes a reality in the future.
    Ms. Scholten. That is great. Well, let us know what we can 
continue to do to help and push for that. It is so critical.
    My second question.
    Ensuring sufficient personnel is vital for the Coast Guard 
to carry out its work and maintain defense readiness.
    In its report last year, GAO confirmed that the Service's 
workforce shortages are cyclical.
    And data points, MCPO Jones, we are excited to hear about 
your recruitment numbers coming in, but we have a huge gap to 
make up from missing that mark since 2017.
    With 49,000 Active Duty and Reserve personnel, the Coast 
Guard's workforce is smaller than the city of New York's police 
department.
    Admiral Fagan, considering the importance of the operations 
and support account to address the Coast Guard's attrition 
challenges, how will the requested funds bolster additional 
recruitment to keep up the good success that we are seeing 
right now?
    Admiral Fagan. So, we are seeing success in recruiting. And 
I am thankful for support we have had from the committee in 
previous years which has allowed us to reinvest in recruiting 
capacity.
    We have brought recruiters online. We have opened new 
recruiting offices. We have stood up Junior ROTC programs. And 
we are on track to have a program in all of our districts here 
soon.
    And we continue to make the needed investments to, one, 
ensure that we are quicker from the time of contact to get 
people into Cape May.
    And the other thing we struggle with is not everybody knows 
who the United States Coast Guard is. And so, illuminating to 
the workforce and the talent out there who we are and what we 
are as an organization.
    We do have investments that we need to make. And we have 
signaled through some of the UPL around our training center in 
Cape May.
    So, one, finding the talent, but then, two, you need to 
give them the appropriate training experience when we bring 
them through our single enlisted training source in Cape May.
    But we continue to invest in workforce. And as I said, I am 
excited about where the numbers are. But we need to continue to 
gain ground.
    Ms. Scholten. No greater asset than our Coasties. So, thank 
you so much.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentlelady yields back.
    Mr. Auchincloss, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chair.
    Admiral and Master Chief, appreciate your testimony today.
    I had the great pleasure of spending time earlier this week 
at the invitation of Rear Admiral Platt in Boston with the 
First District command and staff and enlisted, and was so 
impressed--though not surprised--by the professionalism and 
poise of the young officers and enlisted who are ensuring 
readiness for search and rescue, who are enforcing our 
fisheries laws and conservation mandate, and who are just 
generally representing, I think, the very best of this country. 
And I know both of you would be proud. And we need to recruit 
and support more of this type of personnel in the Coast Guard.
    And although I voted against the Coast Guard authorization 
out of objections to a misguided offshore wind provision in 
there, I am fully committed to resourcing and supporting the 
Coast Guard as you perform your 11 essential missions.
    Admiral, in your testimony, you discuss the importance of 
the Coast Guard's presence in the Indo-Pacific region and the 
increased demand from our allies and partners for sustained 
Coast Guard presence.
    I think it is a vitally important way that we project not 
just hard, but also soft, power. People want to work with the 
Coast Guard.
    The fiscal year 2025 budget requests $263 million to expand 
Coast Guard operations in the Indo-Pacific along three primary 
lines of effort: increased presence, maritime governance, and 
meaningful engagements.
    As these kinds of operations and partnerships expand, do 
you think the current structure of these operations is 
effective? Would it potentially be more effective, for example, 
to take lessons from the Combined Maritime Forces model based 
in Bahrain that the Navy uses?
    Admiral Fagan. So, we are very thankful for the support 
that we received in the 2024 budget, which includes two 
additional Fast Response Cutters beyond the original program of 
record, and those will be focused into the mission sets in the 
Indo-Pacific.
    So, as we have looked at the opportunity that the Coast 
Guard can provide to countering some of the problem set in the 
Pacific, we have been articulating that these are investments 
above the needs that the organization has right now, and we 
have talked about the PC&I and maintenance challenges that we 
are faced with.
    And so, as money and support is provided, we look at 
creating that opportunity, whether it is ships like the two 
Fast Response Cutters, ships like the Harriet Lane, which was 
funded as a Pacific support tender and re-homeported into 
Honolulu.
    We create incredible return on investment for the resources 
that do focus into the region.
    Mr. Auchincloss. I think Congress in a bipartisan manner is 
convinced of that. The question is whether CMF, a Combined 
Maritime Forces-style system, will work for the Coast Guard as 
it has for the Navy in the Indo-Pacific.
    Admiral Fagan. So, happy to work with the committee on 
analysis. That system works well for us with regard to our 
assets that are supporting Fifth Fleet. When and how to posture 
forces across the Pacific, forces that include Coast Guard 
forces, look forward to working with the committee on that 
question.
    Mr. Auchincloss. And what questions would you have as part 
of that discussion?
    Admiral Fagan. So, when you forward deploy ships, we need 
to be clear-eyed with regard to the full support need--piers, 
maintainers, logistics, infrastructure, family support--and 
ensuring that we have thought through the totality of that so 
that when you have an operating asset you can actually put them 
into theater and operate them for effect to counter the threat.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Isn't that true now though with or without 
the Combined Maritime Forces model? Or why is that different 
under that?
    Admiral Fagan. So, the Combined Maritime Forces model, 
those ships are permanently assigned in Bahrain. They work 
under the operational and tactical control of the Navy.
    Mr. Auchincloss. So, it is a permanent versus rotational.
    Admiral Fagan. There are operating concepts to models, 
several that need to be thought through with regard to sort of 
the merits and pros and cons. Each brings cost and 
infrastructure and logistics support. Just have not done the 
analysis. But welcome the opportunity to have that conversation 
with the committee.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Is there a nation along the rim of the 
South China Sea that if you think you were going to apply that 
model to the South China Sea would work to be a permanent 
station?
    Admiral Fagan. What and how U.S. forces, and include Coast 
Guard forces, are postured in the region is a conversation 
broader than the Coast Guard, but we would welcome the 
opportunity to be included in that.
    Guam is a perfect example. I have Coast Guard forces in 
Guam now.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Right.
    Admiral Fagan. There are a number of initiatives that the 
Navy and the Marines have going on in Guam.
    We need to be part of that conversation so that it doesn't 
become just a DoD lens into the region with regard to our 
national security needs.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Got it. So, it is fair to say that the 
Coast Guard is ready, willing, and able to have a conversation 
about a CMF for the Indo-Pacific region?
    Admiral Fagan. We welcome the opportunity to be part of 
that Joint Force and part of that conversation.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Let's see, Mr. Garamendi, you are recognized.
    Mr. Garamendi. Admiral and Mr. Jones, good work in 
Baltimore. The rumors around here, all the chatter around here 
is that the Coast Guard, working with the Army Corps of 
Engineers, has done an extraordinary piece of work with the 
bridge collapse in Baltimore. So, thank you. Another example: 
If you want something done, get the Coast Guard.
    Mr. Auchincloss, you were pursuing a very, very important 
piece of questioning. In the 2021, 2022 Don Young Coast Guard 
Authorization Act, it directs the Coast Guard to calculate the 
cost of doing missions with or on behalf of other service 
branches like the Navy.
    Mr. Auchincloss, you had a detailed discussion with Admiral 
Fagan about the Middle East, as well as the South Pacific.
    The Navy cannot do its work without the Coast Guard. Yet 
the Coast Guard, with a budget one one-thousandths of the U.S. 
Navy, is expected to stand and to carry on tasks that the Navy 
cannot do.
    There is something seriously wrong here about this 
situation. And the Department of Defense jealously guards every 
$1 billion of the $900 or so that they have and refuses to 
share any of that with the missions that the Coast Guard 
carries on in support of the Navy and the United States 
missions in those areas.
    Is that correct, Admiral?
    Admiral Fagan. We are 1.4 percent of the DoD budget. And, 
as I articulated, it is not just the demand from allies and 
partners for Coast Guard services, but, as I meet with every 
one of the combatant commands, demand for the Coast Guard.
    And the budget structure--this is broader than my 
organizational changes--the budget structure creates that 
challenge with regard to funding for work that the Coast 
Guard--national security work, defense work--that the Coast 
Guard does on behalf of the Nation.
    Mr. Garamendi. My point here is that we need the 
information so that we can fight on your behalf. Please, it has 
been 1 year, almost 2 years now.
    Tell us what you are spending in these--also the Caribbean, 
the South Pacific, the Arctic, and also the Middle East--so 
that we can then carry on an argument with the Department of 
Defense about the financial support that is absolutely 
essential to the security of this Nation and to your 
operations.
    And, Mr. Auchincloss, you are on this. Thank you for 
raising this issue.
    I came in on the discussion of the Polar Cutter, and I 
promised myself I wouldn't raise it. It has been 11 years, 11 
years since this committee raised the issue, started the 
project.
    It is really essential that you come to us with why it 
hasn't been done, what are the problems, what is your solution. 
There is no way that the United States role in the Arctic can 
be achieved without these icebreakers.
    And I am not saying just one; it has to be more than one. 
It is a hell of a lot more important than the money that we are 
spending with a whole bunch of billions last night in the Armed 
Services NDAA markup. You have got to get us detailed 
information about why it isn't going forward and what you need 
to make it happen.
    So, please, it is a national security issue of profound 
importance, and we are way, way late here. So, please do that. 
Deliver it to the committee, if you would.
    Offshore wind. The legislation in 2021. The President 
signed an amendment that I put forward in the Coast Guard bill 
that closed a loophole in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act 
by applying all Federal, labor, environmental, immigration, 
customs, antitrust, and Jones Act to the Outer Continental 
Shelf wind industry.
    Customs and Border Patrol has made some progress in writing 
rules and regulations to carry out that law. You haven't. Why?
    Admiral Fagan. I am aware of the law, aware of the 
challenges around offshore wind. We are committed to continuing 
to work to implement the intent with regard to the committee 
and Congress' desires in that regard.
    Mr. Garamendi. Why haven't you done it?
    Admiral Fagan. We are engaged in the process around the 
notice of proposed rulemaking, and we will continue to work 
with the committee specific to the legislation as it pertains 
to Jones Act application. And I am happy to have the team 
provide the current status of those efforts.
    Mr. Garamendi. Little things mean a lot. This is a major 
issue about how we are going to participate--the American 
industry, American workers, American maritime--we are going to 
participate in the offshore wind industry. Your regulations are 
critically important in carrying out the law, as are the U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection regulations.
    For the committee, some of this committee is on the Armed 
Services Committee also, some of the Members. Maybe it is a 
hangover from the extraordinary money that was spent last night 
as we finished up the NDAA.
    I am definitely out of time, and I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Mr. Van Drew, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Chairman.
    Although Training Center Cape May is such a--in fact, let 
me start at the beginning.
    Training Center Cape May is the fifth largest base in the 
Coast Guard and the sole accession point for the entire 
enlisted workforce.
    In turn, the Coast Guard is a fundamental part, as you 
know, of the culture and the economy of southern New Jersey.
    Although Training Center Cape May is such a vital piece of 
shoreside infrastructure through the Coast Guard, many 
facilities are in urgent need of repair--and I know, again, you 
are very aware of this--especially the barracks.
    While I am glad to see that $225 million is authorized in 
fiscal year 2025 for the improvements of facilities at the 
training center, I am aware that phase 1 construction is 
currently running over budget.
    I personally testified in front of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security and submitted a request for 
this project. So, I want to ensure that enough funds are 
provided to complete this project entirely. It is an important 
project.
    Commandant Fagan, thank you for being here again. It is 
good to see you again. And thank you for taking the time to be 
here today.
    Could you provide an update on the progress of phase 1 of 
the barracks? And how much more money are we going to need over 
the requested budget for this project?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you for the question.
    I do not have a specific figure with me but will commit to 
you to come back and do that. I remain committed to the 
investments at Cape May. As you have highlighted, it is 
critical that our enlisted workforce has access to safe and 
modern buildings and training facilities.
    I know you are aware of the broader investment plan and 
strategy that we have for Cape May and welcome the opportunity 
to come over and share exact status of phase 1 and then plans 
for the additional phases as we look to gain funding support 
for those critical investments in Cape May.
    Dr. Van Drew. I would appreciate that, Commandant, and if 
you could share that, obviously with me, but also with the 
entire committee. It is not only important to New Jersey or 
Cape May; as you know, it is important to the entire country.
    And with the changes--some of them good--that are occurring 
in the Coast Guard, with many more women coming into the Coast 
Guard, we want to ensure that those barracks are updated. It is 
essential.
    My team was recently up in South Jersey at a public meeting 
on navigation, and it was navigation safety, where they met 
with members of the Coast Guard. And they took the opportunity 
to express the concerns of dozens of my constituents that were 
there.
    It represents many thousands of my constituents, tens of 
thousands, including fishermen, tug barge, and shipping vessel 
operators and recreational boat users, about the navigational 
security issues that exist relating to the offshore wind 
projects.
    Now, I am going to do a change of tack for me. I am not 
going to attack the offshore wind projects today, even though I 
am thoroughly, completely, totally opposed to them for many, 
many different reasons.
    But today, I want to really reference their conversations 
and let the Coast Guard acknowledge that there is a risk of 
vessel radar interference from wind turbine towers. Personally, 
I hope we are never going to have to worry about it.
    However, do you also recognize the concerns with the radar 
interference?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
    We are obviously working closely with regard to the 
challenges presented by the wind farms. We have completed a 
number of studies. We participated in that public meeting you 
referenced. We have got a notice of proposed rulemaking out 
with a comment period that will close on 17 May, committed to 
the environmental study in process, and we are fully engaged 
with that process and with BOEM as well.
    With regard to the radar issue, we participated in a 
National Academy of Sciences working group, but we have 
provided guidance in the form of a navigation vessel 
inspection.
    It is an advisory notice to proactively address potential 
risks. It includes requirements for warning signals, devices, 
charting, uniforms, spaces, safety equipment.
    We are committed to the safety of navigation and addressing 
those challenges and issues specific to wind farms and have 
engaged on the challenge----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. There are a lot of real 
concerns out there, Commandant, and I appreciate that. And both 
issues that were brought up were done so to ensure that our 
Coast Guard--and I am sure yours--were well provided for and 
can operate in the safest way possible. And I urge 
consideration of the safety risks that are prevalent to the 
entire maritime community posed by offshore wind.
    I am happy to work with you, I am happy to work with your 
team, and I am happy to work to ensure that the barracks and 
other shoreside infrastructure projects at the Training Center 
Cape May are completed, because it is for the good of America, 
not just for the good of New Jersey.
    And most of all, I am willing to work with you on these 
wind turbine issues. I think they are very serious and of 
tremendous concern. I think these projects are not well thought 
out, in my opinion.
    But I do appreciate you and the work that you do. And I 
always love the Coast Guard. And it is good to see you here 
today.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentleman yields back.
    Mrs. Peltola.
    Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Commandant, thank you.
    Before I begin my line of questioning, I just wanted to 
bring up some concerns that I have heard this week regarding a 
work order that was issued 11 months ago by the Office of 
Vessel Compliance called Issued Work Instruction 032.
    And what that work instruction potentially--there are 
potential negative impacts to the fishing vessels that make up 
the Alyeska Pipeline Ship Escort Response Vehicle System in 
Prince William Sound.
    After the Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef, the fishing vessels 
within Prince William Sound rallied and really helped us with 
that major oilspill, and that continues to be our fleet that is 
the oil response fleet.
    This fishing fleet is the backbone of Alyeska's pipeline 
oil response program, and the vessels are used to transport 
response equipment, deploy and tend boom, mobilize pre-stage 
equipment to protect hatcheries, and to recover oil into micro 
and mini barges that have a capacity to carry less than 250 
barrels of oil.
    The Alyeska SERVS oilspill response system for Prince 
William Sound has been held up as a world-renowned model, 
largely because of the contracted and trained fishing vessel 
response fleet, and that work order has created a lot of 
ambiguities for them and the Prince William Sound region.
    And I know that this probably isn't something that you are 
directly involved with, but I really wanted to put it on your 
radar and see if I can get your help in addressing some of 
those ambiguities in that work order.
    Admiral Fagan. Yes. No, thank you for raising the issue. 
And my staff is absolutely engaged on that issue as we seek to 
find the right balance to ensure that oilspill planning and 
response capabilities in Alaska--and I know it is different in 
Alaska--but I am committed to working with you and the 
stakeholders to ensure that we strike that right balance.
    Mrs. Peltola. OK. And I have some other questions about 
asking you to help me and my office keep on track of the 
timelines for the Fast Response Cutter headed to Seward, the 
Fast Response Cutter headed to Sitka, and the icebreaker headed 
to Juno.
    And I also had a question prepared for me for Master Chief 
Jones regarding the childcare facilities, and I know that that 
is an ongoing work effort.
    But I am going to forgo these questions.
    I just came from a seafood roundtable that we had with our 
two Senators and Secretary Raimondo from Department of 
Commerce.
    And what we have in Alaska right now is a fishing industry 
in freefall, and so much of it is because of the war with 
Russia and Russia's need to fund their war against Ukraine. And 
much of that funding is coming literally from stolen fish from 
Alaska. There are salmon that are being trawled in waters that 
border with Russia, and many of our seafood resources go back 
and forth.
    And Russia has upped their quota. And they also--not only 
are they unsustainably harvesting just astronomical amounts and 
really glutting the market, but they also are using Chinese 
slave labor. And much of the product is being processed through 
China using slave Uyghur labor.
    So, that really puts Alaskan fishermen and United States 
fishermen at a severe disadvantage when the harvests are 
exorbitant and then there is almost no overhead in processing 
these.
    And what the Senators and I are trying to do is to elevate 
this to the national security issue that it is and the global 
issue that it is when we are talking about using United States 
resources to fund this war against Ukraine. And I am wondering 
how we can better give the Coast Guard resources to help this.
    And I think it is noteworthy to mention that in Alaskan 
waters, we have had the Coast Guard alert us that Chinese and 
Russian warships are in formation in Alaskan waters, and the 
deterrent right now is the presence of the Coast Guard. We 
really don't have a Navy presence. The Navy doesn't like ice, 
so, it falls to you all to protect America in Alaska's waters.
    And that doesn't even speak to the search-and-rescue 
efforts that you do every day. And I understand that there was 
a submerged vessel near Sitka that you all have been responding 
to, and I really appreciate that response, although it looks 
like it is all bad news from that incident. But so often it is 
good news because you are out there rescuing Alaskans and 
United States citizens almost daily.
    But this issue of national security and our economies being 
very impacted by Russia, I am wondering, how can we help make 
sure you have the resources to tackle this?
    Admiral Fagan. So, I will commit to having my staff engage 
with yours. There are a number of elements in the issues that 
you raised, starting with illegal fishing, our role in illegal 
and unregulated fishing, presence in the Arctic, the 
criticality of the Polar Security Cutter, the assets that we do 
have in Alaska.
    And we will have FRCs in Sitka and Seward. I am happy to 
affirm that.
    But we will come over, because it will probably merit just 
broader conversation than what we can do here. But look forward 
to that conversation with you and your team.
    Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. The gentlelady yields back.
    Are there any more questions from Members? Anybody that I 
haven't recognized yet?
    Well, I have one. I have been recognized, but I have got to 
ask this.
    So, for, I guess, for the purposes, Admiral Fagan, for the 
purpose of our Members in Florida, can you assure me that the 
Coast Guard is prepared to confront the potential mass 
migration of Haitian migrants?
    Admiral Fagan. We are obviously engaged. We have Coast 
Guard assets employed in the Caribbean, in the Florida Straits, 
in the Mona Pass every day to ensure that, one, attempts at 
illegal maritime migrations don't result in the loss of life. 
It is critical, lifesaving work.
    But we have assets postured to prevent and mitigate those 
kinds of attempts. We have been in that posture for quite some 
time.
    We have contracted with Saildrone to increase some capacity 
and awareness, and we continue to remain very focused on 
preventing illegal attempts, and when it does occur, again, 
ensuring that people don't lose their lives.
    The flows ebb and flow seasonally. We are postured the way 
we need to be right now.
    Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
    So, we are done. No one else to recognize.
    And the subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]



                       Submissions for the Record

                              ----------                              


 Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member, 
             Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
    Thank you, Chair Webster and Ranking Member Carbajal, for calling 
today's hearing.
    The U.S. Coast Guard plays a vital role in safeguarding U.S. seas, 
the efficient movement of goods in our marine transportation system and 
national defense.
    The women and men of the Coast Guard conduct search and rescue 
operations at sea, prevent the shipment of drugs across our maritime 
borders and ensure safety and security in the Arctic and across the 
world.
    The Coast Guard is a lifesaving agency, a regulatory agency, a law 
enforcement agency and a military agency. Each aspect is critical to 
our national and economic security.
    The Coast Guard is facing increasing mission demand, a workforce 
shortage of nearly 10 percent, an aging fleet of assets, delays in 
major acquisition projects and growing fallout from ``Operation Fouled 
Anchor''--the report outlining the Service's previous failure to report 
sexual assault and harassment cases at the Coast Guard academy.
    The Coast Guard is at a pivotal moment. I have faith in Admiral 
Fagan's ability to guide the service through this difficult time, but 
it will not be easy, and transparency is key.
    Today is an opportunity to discuss our expectations for the Coast 
Guard and gain a better understanding of the resources that the Service 
requires.
    For fiscal year 2025, the Coast Guard has requested $13.8 billion, 
which represents a 4.8 percent increase over the 2024 enacted budget. 
Unfortunately, that isn't enough. I agree with the Commandant that the 
Coast Guard needs to be a $20 billion service by 2030.
    Achieving $20 billion by 2030 would require a budget increase of 
over $1 billion a year, but past budget requests and enacted 
appropriations have failed to put us on that trajectory.
    If we do not appropriately fund the Coast Guard, we should expect 
near term decreases in service and readiness. This includes fewer 
search and rescue operations, fewer drug and migrant interdictions and 
fewer marine casualty responses.
    Last week, the House passed the bipartisan Coast Guard 
Authorization Act of 2024, which had a robust funding level of $15.9 
billion for the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2025. This is over $2 
billion more than the President's budget and what is required to 
maintain Coast Guard operational readiness.
    I remain concerned with the poor condition of many buildings 
servicemembers must work and live in on a daily basis. Inadequate 
housing and childcare are a persistent complaint among servicemembers. 
If we want to increase retention and diversity, we must do more to 
support our Coast Guard members.
    The fiscal year 2025 budget decreases the amounts for shoreside 
infrastructure by 58 percent, a significant drop. This is unacceptable 
given the Coast Guard's $3 billion shoreside infrastructure maintenance 
backlog.
    The Coast Guard has indicated that it will require at least $500 
million per year to prevent the infrastructure maintenance backlog from 
growing--this year's request of $167 million falls far short of that 
goal.
    The Coast Guard needs to recruit over 4,000 servicemembers to reach 
its annual recruiting goal. I look forward to an update on progress 
made to meet the 2024 recruitment goal.
    The Service's current workforce shortage is having major impacts on 
mission readiness, for example, forcing station closures and cutter 
decommissions this year. The Coast Guard cannot continue to be asked to 
do more with less.
    As the agency responsible for maintaining a U.S. presence in the 
Arctic, icebreaking capabilities are vital to the Coast Guard.
    The Coast Guard maintains two heavy icebreakers, although only one 
is currently operating. Replacing these cutters is long overdue and the 
need to do so has only increased.
    The ongoing acquisition of three new icebreakers--known as Polar 
Security Cutters--has faced major delays and the Service has yet to 
release a new budget and delivery estimate on the program.
    The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that this 
program will cost well over $1 billion. I expect to hear from the 
Commandant today on the Coast Guard's plan going forward.
    Finally, I would like to take a minute to recognize the work the 
Coast Guard has done to help address sexual assault and sexual 
harassment in the commercial maritime industry.
    Since Congress enacted the Safer Seas Act in 2022, the Coast Guard 
has taken immediate action to ensure prompt implementation.
    While the Coast Guard has acted swiftly to address workplace 
respect within the maritime industry, there is work to be done within 
the Coast Guard to rebuild internal trust and transparency. I expect to 
hear more today on the Commandant's progress on the directed actions 
from the Accountability and Transparency Review.
    Thank you, and I yield back.

Questions to Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, from 
                        Hon. Jefferson Van Drew

    Question 1. The FY23 NDAA grounded the Coast Guard's fleet of 
Chinese-made drones. While this was undoubtedly good for our national 
security, Congress has yet to provide the necessary funding for a full 
replacement of the Coast Guard's drone fleet. Instead, the Coast Guard 
has relied on existing operating funds to replace a fraction of the 
drones that you once had. Given the critical training activities 
conducted at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, could you 
please provide us with an overview of the importance of drones to Coast 
Guard operations and detail any plans to incorporate drone training 
into the curriculum at Cape May?
    Answer. The Coast Guard recognizes the mission enabling 
capabilities provided by small drones. For example, Coast Guard drones 
were on scene within hours of the Key Bridge collapse, providing 
critical imagery of the structure to guide initial response efforts. 
Drones additionally supported search and rescue efforts in the wake of 
the fires in Maui, HI and have also proven to be extremely useful for 
mapping small oil spills and inspecting hard to reach aids to 
navigation. Training Center Cape May is the Coast Guard's sole 
accession point for the enlisted workforce while drone training is 
centralized at the Aviation Training Center (ATC) in Mobile, AL. The 
Coast Guard does not have any plans to incorporate drone training into 
the basic training curriculum at Training Center Cape May.

    Question 2. Additionally, how would additional funding help enhance 
this aspect of the training programs at Cape May?
    Answer. The Coast Guard does not have any plans to incorporate 
drone training into the basic training curriculum at Training Center 
Cape May. Drone training is centralized at the ATC in Mobile, AL, the 
Coast Guard's aviation and capabilities development center.

Question to Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, from 
                         Hon. Salud O. Carbajal

    Question 1. Admiral Fagan, with the passage of the Safer Seas Act, 
the Coast Guard is tasked with implementing several new authorities and 
requirements for industry.
    How important is the requirement to report harassment to the Coast 
Guard and how does the Coast Guard plan to use that information?
    Answer. The Coast Guard considers the requirement to report 
harassment a key element in addressing mariner misconduct in the 
maritime domain before behaviors may escalate to higher level offenses 
(e.g., sexual harassment, sexual assault) or negatively impact the 
safety of the vessel to the point of contributing to a marine casualty. 
Prior to the Safer Seas Act, the majority of mariner harassment cases 
were either ignored or handled through internal company investigations 
without Coast Guard involvement or awareness. In the most egregious 
cases, serial offenders who were fired by their employers for severe 
incidents of hazing and/or bullying successfully sought out employment 
with another marine employer where the harassing behaviors continued. 
Prior to the Safer Seas Act, companies were not required to report 
harassment misconduct to the Coast Guard. However, when voluntary 
reports were received, the Coast Guard was able to pursue 
administrative suspension and revocation (S&R) enforcement cases 
against the perpetrator's merchant mariner credential (MMC) for 
violating their company's policy. The S&R cases helped to remediate the 
harassing conduct with appropriate sanctions, including suspensions, 
probation, and state-certified anti-harassment courses. Prior to the 
Safer Sea Act, the Coast Guard had adjudicated less than 10 harassment 
related cases for the five-year period ending in December 2022. As of 
June 14, 2024, the Coast Guard is actively investigating 161 harassment 
cases. Multiple cases have also been fully adjudicated with sanctions 
ranging from revocation of the mariner's MMC to issuance of letters of 
warning to address minor offenses. The Coast Guard is in the process of 
determining the average duration of a harassment investigation, and 
attempting to assess the long-term projected impacts on the 
investigating officer workforce. Harassment enforcement cases along 
with associated new training requirements, have been inserted as new 
priorities for the existing pool of field investigators, adding to 
their traditional marine casualty investigation and suspension and 
revocation enforcement duties.
