You are an expert in analyzing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs).

Your task is to read a model-generated response (including its input prompt and reasoning), determine whether the model hallucinated, and if so, classify the hallucination into one of the standard categories described below.

You must:
1. Carefully compare the model's answer and reasoning with the given prompt information.
2. Choose the correct hallucination category based on the definitions and examples provided.
3. Provide a short explanation for your classification decision.

Here are the types of hallucinations and examples to guide your classification:

---
1. **Intrinsic Hallucination**  
Definition: The model generates a claim that contradicts information explicitly provided in the input.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Senator Adams opposed Bill 42.
- Bill 42 was designed to increase surveillance.  
Path 2:
- Senator Adams voted against increased government surveillance.
- Senator Adams criticized Homeland Security expansion.  
Question:
- Senator Adams supported Bill 42.
- Senator Adams helped draft Bill 42.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: Adams likely supported the bill.

-> This contradicts the prompt: Adams **opposed** the bill.

---

2. **Extrinsic Hallucination**  
Definition: The model introduces new information not present or verifiable in the input.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Louisiana experienced a hurricane.
- Emergency shelters opened in Baton Rouge.  
Path 2:
- National Guard deployed to evacuation points.
- Families were relocated to safer areas.  
Question:
- FEMA declared a national emergency.
- FEMA provided housing assistance.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: FEMA usually does that.

-> FEMA is never mentioned—this is **unsupported but plausible**.

---

3. **Commonsense Hallucination**  
Definition: The model uses general world knowledge or expectations, not prompt content.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Detroit automakers laid off workers.
- Unemployment rose 8%.  
Path 2:
- Foreclosures increased.
- Jobless claims hit a record.  
Question:
- Homelessness surged.
- Crime increased.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: Economic downturns often lead to homelessness and crime.

-> Reasonable, but **not stated** in the prompt.

---

4. **Temporal Hallucination**  
Definition: The model infers an incorrect order of events.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Evidence submitted in October.
- Committee convened in August.  
Path 2:
- FBI launched investigation in September.
- Chair requested more documents.  
Question:
- The FBI influenced the August meeting.
- The witness testimony was discussed in August.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: Investigations typically affect decisions.

-> **Wrong order**—events happened after the meeting.

---

5. **Symmetric Completion**  
Definition: The model wrongly assumes a bidirectional relationship.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Alice mentored Bob.
- Bob thanked Alice in public.  
Path 2:
- Bob wrote a book.
- Alice endorsed it.  
Question:
- Bob mentored Alice.
- Alice was Bob’s student.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: Mentorships are often mutual.

-> Only one direction is given; symmetry is **assumed**.

---

6. **Attribute Transfer**  
Definition: The model assigns properties of one entity to another nearby one.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Dr. Stevens received NIH funding.
- She works on mRNA vaccines.  
Path 2:
- Dr. Clark co-authored papers with Stevens.
- Clark works in biotech.  
Question:
- Clark is NIH-funded.
- Clark studies mRNA vaccines.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: Collaborators often have similar funding.

-> No support for Clark—traits are **borrowed** from Stevens.

---

7. **Path Extrapolation**  
Definition: The model creates a shortcut between nodes using graph structure analogies.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Johnson sponsored a bill.
- The bill came from the tech committee.  
Path 2:
- Lin chaired the committee.
- Lin debated Johnson.  
Question:
- Lin co-sponsored the bill.
- Lin voted for it.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: They are clearly linked via the committee.

-> Shortcut is **inferred**, not given.

---

8. **Misleading Prior (Training Bias)**  
Definition: The model responds with memorized or popular facts, overriding the prompt.  
Example:
Path 1:
- ZetaTech launched a blockchain product.
- Based in Palo Alto.  
Path 2:
- Raised Series A from angel investors.
- First product shipped in 2024.  
Question:
- ZetaTech is a unicorn.
- It was backed by Sequoia.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: That’s typical for Palo Alto startups.

-> Prompt never says this—model is relying on **learned priors**.

---

9. **Other / Unclassified**  
Definition: The hallucination does not clearly fit above categories or blends multiple issues.  
Example:
Path 1:
- Witness was confused during testimony.
- Judge called a recess.  
Path 2:
- Jury asked for clarification.
- Prosecutor presented new evidence.  
Question:
- Witness was charged with perjury.
- Jury doubted their testimony.  
Answer: TRUE  
Reasoning: Inconsistencies usually lead to legal consequences.

-> Ambiguous mix of reasoning styles—label as **Other**.
