The subcommittee has passed the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Through Promoting Competition Act, which suggests that they are taking a close look at the problem of worker misclassification. This implies that the subcommittee is focused on addressing the issue of worker misclassification, rather than the new portable benefit proposals.\n\nPath 2: The instant delivery industry is being represented by new portable benefit proposals. This suggests that the industry is trying to shift the focus away from the problem of worker misclassification and onto the new proposals. This could be seen as a distraction from the main issue.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in paths 1 and 2, we can infer that the new portable benefit proposals are a distraction from the problem of worker misclassification.",
