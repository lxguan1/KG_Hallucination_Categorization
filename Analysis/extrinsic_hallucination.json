This implies that the FERC has the authority to regulate and promote the use of nuclear power, which could potentially lead to affordable energy for manufacturers. Additionally, path 1 mentions that Congress has a history of racism, which is not directly related to the question at hand but suggests that the FERC may have a role in addressing energy issues in a socially responsible manner.\n\nPath 2 does not provide any information that would contradict this inference, as it only mentions that the FERC can contribute energy to manufacturers without providing any details on how this would be achieved or whether it would result in affordable energy for small businesses.
