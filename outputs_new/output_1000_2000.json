Selecting TRUE means there is enough information from path 1 and path 2 given to say these facts in question are true and FALSE would mean that it doesnt",
            "explanation": " Based on the information provided in paths 1 and 2, we can infer the following fact with complete confidence:\n\nTRUE - County's system increasing wastewater capacity is needed.\n\nReason:\n\nPath 1 states that EPA has provided potable water to Lahaina, which implies that Lahaina has a population that requires wastewater treatment. Additionally, Path 2 states that Mr. Bissen are being built homes, which implies that the population in Lahaina is growing and therefore the county's system needs to increase its wastewater capacity to accommodate the growing population.\n\nThere is no information provided in paths 1 and 2 that suggests wastewater capacity must be added before homes are built, so the option FALSE cannot be selected."
