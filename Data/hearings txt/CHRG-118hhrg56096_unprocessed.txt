Darrell Issa  presiding. Present: Representatives Issa, Massie, Fitzgerald, Cline, Lee, Fry, Johnson, Nadler, Ross, Lofgren, and Ivey. Mr. Issa. The Subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. We welcome everyone here today to a hearing on third-party litigation funding and intellectual property. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. It's an odd combination of third-party litigation and intellectual property, and to say the least, third-party litigation, or investing in litigation, is, in fact, not limited to intellectual property. However, because of the large awards that are possible and the proliferation of troll activity, it is, in fact, one of the most lucrative and growing areas. These groups often do so for good and legitimate reasons. It pays well. The law firms do it because it limits their risk. There's only an upside, no downside. Whether they win or lose, they know that their fees will be paid. When they win a portion of the profits will be split. Everyone wins, except, of course, the defendants who often find themselves with a settle-rather- than-go-to-court situation even when innocent. However, there are newer forms of third-party litigation that present particular concerns, and I say this because we are not here to eliminate third-party litigation. We are not here to eliminate people who need to have investors to protect their intellectual property rights or any other event that has happened to them. There are plenty of groups who, in fact, specialize in helping people assert their rights. However, with the growth of nonpracticing entities known as patent trolls engaged in meritless litigation campaigns, we see vast settlements by asserting a wide swath of low-quality patents. More importantly, and most importantly for today, we see and have documented instances of foreign funding from China, Russia, and other sources who use shell companies to hide where they come from and what their meaning may need to be. For example, Huawei, a company that cannot sell in the United States, in fact, can both invest in the United States and assert their patents. That means that they can, in fact, stifle the growth of fifth generation, or 5G, advancement in the United States, while freely doing whatever they want in their home country and around the world. We've also seen that foreign control patent trolls like VLSI win billions of dollars in damages from American companies on weak patent infringement claims. While some States in Federal Courts have considered and adopted measures to require at least a level of transparency, third party, or TPLF, is not regulated by Federal law. This Committee looks to change that. Right now, insurance agreements and other financials of defendants are discoverable. I want to reemphasize that. If I am insured, and a plaintiff comes, one of the first pieces of discovery is they want to know how deep my pockets are and how deep my insurance coverage is, because that may very well dictate what they're willing to settle for. They get transparency. However, the courts, with rare exceptions, have not asked for any discoverability as to the true plaintiffs, meaning the investors. That's why it is time for Congress to take a look and, in fact, look at what disclosure and transparency is needed to stem the tide of TPLF abuse. I hope to gain constructive feedback on this topic today, but let there be no doubt, we know already there is a growing problem. We know that we have to find a reasonable and balanced solution. Last, as we will hear from our witnesses, it is extremely important that we not stifle the ability of small inventors to find partners to help fund the defense of their intellectual property. If you're willing to fund a small inventor, why are you not willing to be stated as a supporter and funder of that small inventor? With that, it's my pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Johnson, for his opening statement. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've all heard this story again and again. A little guy, patent owner, small business guy, begins talks with a large corporation, a big business, a national corporation, maybe even a multinational corporation. They engage in negotiations about the little guy's invention. The little guy inventor shares documents and all kinds of secret information about the product. Then, when it seemed like everything was looking so positive for the little guy, radio silence from the corporation, don't hear anything from them, can't get your calls returned, just radio silence. Months later, small inventor wakes up, sees an advertisement for product just like the one that he showed to that big corporation, and guess what? It's that same big corporation that he talked to and shared his secrets. Come to find out that this corporation is using technology that clearly infringes on the little guy's patent. The patent owner, being a little guy, can't do anything to stop it because it is far too expensive for that little guy to afford a multi-year patent litigation against a large corporation. In the United States, the only way to enforce your rights as a patent owner, in most cases, is to sue in civil court. Inventors themselves must monitor the market for violations of their property rights, and they must hire lawyers to go after infringers. An American patent is only as good as the owner's ability to police it, and in the United States today that means stealing a patent is easier than ever. After the America Invents Act was passed into law, even the worthiest of patent claims became procedurally difficult to pursue. As a result, patent attorneys largely stopped taking cases on contingency basis because of the small likelihood of success. Corporations, confident that they could rarely be sued, began risking efficient infringement, as it's called, where a business infringes on a patent because of the reduced likelihood of ever being held accountable for doing so. Inventors left without recourse began turning to outside investors to fund their cases, so that they could access the justice system. Third-party litigation funding is increasingly being used to manage risks and absorb the astronomical cost of patent cases. In these situations, investors uninvolved in the litigation provide financing in exchange for a percentage of the final award. If the inventor does not win, they have no obligation to pay the investor back, because it is difficult for infringed parties to overcome the financial hurdles just to get to the courtroom. Outside nonrecourse funding has become a tool to allow some of these cases to move forward. In 2022, for example, inventor Michael Coffman won a judgment for Microsoft's infringement on his patent. For five years, he knew the infringement was occurring, but he was unable to cover the significant cost of pursuing the company in court until he received funding from Woodsford, which is an Australian litigation funding firm. Tort reform advocates often speak as though patent litigation is like two giants fighting, but in reality, these cases are more like David and Goliath, and many large corporations would like to keep it that way. We're here today because big business does not want to be brought to court, not for the patents they infringe and not for any of the other harms against everyday Americans. The assault on third-party litigation funding, the tort reform movement, is against the practice, third-party litigation funding. The scare tactics and fear-mongering rhetoric we hear in this debate are designed to compel changes to our third-party litigation funding system that would prevent individuals from accessing the justice system when they need it most. One of those scare tactics has been raising the specter of the threat of China to our intellectual and national security systems. The only solution, they claim, is extensive transparency measures that would give defendants clear advantages over funded plaintiffs. We've had multiple hearings about the threat to our intellectual property from China, and we know how the Chinese Government is conducting economic espionage. Patent experts agree that funding long term--excuse me, the funding long-shot patent litigation cases is not one of them. I'm committed to protecting our intellectual property from foreign governments seeking to steal it, which is why I am an advocate for a strong U.S. patent system where Americans can pursue their claims. It is also why I supported President Biden's CHIPS Act, and his Administration's work to raise tariffs on Chinese technological products and prevent China from accessing advanced AI chips made from U.S. intellectual property. With the deck stacked against inventors in the U.S. patent system today, nearly every claim has become a long shot, a series of Davids going up against Goliaths. While third-party funding has become essential to leveling the playing field by allowing just a few of the meritorious infringement claims to go forward, we should not think of it as a panacea. The only way to fix systemic problems in this system is through reforms that make the justice system more accessible and ensure that meritorious claims have a chance. I thank the witnesses for being here today, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. We now recognize the Ranking Member of the Full Committee, Mr. Nadler, for five minutes. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, access to justice takes many forms. Unfortunately, so do efforts by large corporate interests to create barriers to justice for individuals in small businesses who seek to hold them accountable. Today, we are examining proposals to restrict third-party funding of litigation, the latest attempt to slam the courthouse doors shut to all but the most wealthy and powerful. Third-party litigation funding is an arrangement in which an entity unrelated to a case agrees to pay some or all the litigation fees for a plaintiff or a defendant in exchange for a share of the potential award. Unlike a bank loan, in nonrecourse litigation funding, the recipient only owes money in return if they win their case or otherwise collect an award. These third parties can be individual investors, but more often, they are larger litigation funders, venture capital firms, or hedge funds, to name a few. There are also many ways to finance litigation. Investors can put their money into a single case, or even invest in a firm's portfolio of litigation. Funding from third parties has been used increasingly over the last 10 years to pay for the astronomical amount of money needed to enforce a patent against an infringing corporation. Even then, only a select few potential cases are backed by third parties. Litigation funders are selective about the lawsuits they take because they seek to pursue claims that have the best chance of winning, and ultimately, they take only a small percentage of those cases presented to them. Concurrent with the increase in third-party funding, litigation in the patent arena has steadily declined. Studies of all court filings have seen a trend of fewer cases each year since 2013 when 6,497 claims were filed. In 2023, for example, only 3,111 patent pleadings were filed, less than half the number from 10 years earlier. It is harder than it has ever been to take a corporation to court. The third-party funding has helped to ensure that some of these claims are heard, which is exactly why these corporate interests now seek to limit this practice. Today's hearing is simply tort reform by another name, and we have all seen the show before. Over the years, my colleagues across the aisle have repeatedly brought Chamber of Commerce-backed legislation for consideration before this Committee, from the so-called Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act to the fairness in class-action lawsuits legislation and everything in between. Each time we are told the businesses are suffering from the scourge of pesky plaintiff litigation; whereas, in reality, corporations simply do not want to be held accountable when they produce products that make people sick, violate employees' Constitutional rights, or steal patents from investors. The Chamber's attacks on third-party litigation funding are more of the same. Third-party litigation funding levels the playing field by helping individuals who cannot afford to bring their case when they are injured by a wealthy corporation. The odds are stacked against individual plaintiffs when they go up against businesses with seemingly endless resources, who can litigate until claimants run out of money or are forced to settle for pennies of what their claim is worth. While this hearing may be specific to patent cases, Republicans have introduced legislation that would affect all third-party funding arrangements for plaintiffs. Investors--I'm sorry, inventors and businesses that own an infringed patent should be able to reach the courthouse doors, as should every other injured plaintiff. The solutions in search of a problem offered by my Republican colleagues today would make it harder for them to do. Forcing only victims to comply with overly burdensome disclosure requirements, for example, would make it harder for prospective plaintiffs to fund and litigate their cases. In addition to acting as a deterrent for large investment firms with many investors, the proposed transparency measures would provide a strategic advantage to the defendant. A corporate defendant with insight into a victim's financing can strategically delay a case, bury the victim in paperwork, or pressure settlement of a case for far less than a victim or their family is owed. Finally, over the last year, I have heard my Republican colleagues repeatedly and baselessly allege that we have a two- tiered system of justice in this country. It is incredibly ironic that a two-tiered system of justice is exactly what advocates for so-called tort reform are seeking. A two-tiered system of justice exists when inventors and businesses cannot afford to enforce their property rights, but beamers (ph) can still sue one another for infringement. It exists when citizens poisoned by their drinking water cannot hold companies polluting our waterways accountable, but those companies can go to court to challenge our environmental regulation. A two-tiered system of justice exists when everyday Americans are cheated out of their savings with no affordable recourse, but big banks can pay billions to settle with regulators. The harder it is for Americans to reach the courthouse doors, the closer we are to this reality. I appreciate our witnesses for appearing today. I particularly want to welcome our former colleague, Chair Goodlatte, back to the Judiciary Committee. During his time as Chair of this Committee, we did not agree on everything, and I am sure we won't today, but we were able to get important work done together, including the U.S.A. FREEDOM Act in 2015 and the Music Modernization Act in 2018. These landmark pieces of legislation were so impactful because they were the product of bipartisan cooperation. I hope we can return to doing work like that on this Committee going forward, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. Without objection, all opening statements will be included in the record, and I'd like to now introduce our distinguished panel of witnesses, beginning with the Chair, whose picture is on the wall, Chair Bob Goodlatte. Mr. Goodlatte is the former Chair of the Judiciary Committee, former Chair of the Ag Committee, and a distinguished former Member from Virginia's 6th Congressional District, who served for many years, and as the Ranking Member said, developed a body of expertise on issues including the ones before us today. Mr. Paul Taylor, a visiting fellow at the National Security Institute at George Mason University, previously served for some long 20 years at the side of many of us here on the Ccommittee and is, in fact, an expert on the subject. Mr. Taylor has published widely on several issues, including on third-party litigation. Mr. Donald Kochan. Mr. Kochan is a Professor of Law and Executive Director of Law and Economic Center at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia School of Law. Professor Kochan's scholarship focuses on property law, constitutional law, administrative law, and law and economics. Ms. Victoria Sahani--I knew I'd miss it--I would go slowly--Sahani is an Associate Provost of Community and Inclusion and a Professor of Law at the Boston University School of Law. The Professor's scholarship focuses on attribution law and third-party litigation and funding law. I want to welcome our witnesses here today. As Chair Goodlatte did many times, I would ask that all of you rise to take the oath for your statements here today. Do you solemnly swear under penalty of perjury that the testimony you're about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief so help you God. Please be seated. Let the record reflect that all witnesses answered in the affirmative. Please, all of you note that your testimony in its entirety will be included in the record, and so that gives you the opportunity perhaps to stay at or below five minutes, recognizing that every word that you have in your written statement, plus additional material, whether extraneous or not, will be included in the record. With that, I recognize Chair Goodlatte. STATEMENT OF THE HON. BOB GOODLATTE Mr. Goodlatte. Chair Issa, Ranking Member Johnson, Ranking Member Nadler, and the Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about an urgent and growing threat to our intellectual property system. My testimony today represents my personal opinions and not those of any other organization with which I am affiliated. The rise of third-party litigation financing, or TPLF, has turned American jurisprudence on its head. Right now, very few Federal Courts require plaintiffs to disclose third parties that are funding their litigation or ownership interests that may have a stake in the outcome of their case. Like all investors, these entities are hoping to generate a return, specifically a portion of a settlement or verdict award. TPLF is now a $15.2 billion industry in the United States. Each day, hedge funds, big banks, and foreign sovereign wealth funds invest in lawsuits against productive American companies. The intricacies of IP litigation present these financiers with a ripe opportunity. By operating through shell companies called patent trolls, investors face little risk. Inflated patent infringement damages verdicts for hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars give them a high upside. As much as 30 percent of all patent lawsuits are now funded by third-party entities. Twenty percent of all new litigation funding capital is directed toward patent cases. In most lawsuits, these entities operate in the shadows, ensuring they can engage in abusive litigation free from the light of public scrutiny. The entire TPLF business model is anticompetitive by nature. The investors are not creating jobs, growing our economy, or doing anything to further American innovation. Their abusive tactics, however, slow down companies that are generating economic growth. At times, the interests of investors may also come into conflict with the interests of the plaintiffs and prevent plaintiffs and defendants from settling. Third-party funders claim to not be involved in legal strategy. We have seen reporting in publications like The Wall Street Journal investigating conflicts between funders and plaintiffs, and capturing an industry where investors influence case strategy to serve their own objectives. What's worse, there is evidence that the lack of disclosure is giving America's adversaries a window to target critical industries and productive companies. In December 2022, 14 State Attorneys General sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting information about what the Justice Department has done, or is currently doing, to ensure our courts are protected from TPLF-driven foreign interference. Their letter raised a number of valid concerns, including that foreign countries like China and Russia could use TPLF to fuel targeted lawsuits designed to weaken U.S. national defense companies in the business of protecting our national security interests. Because of the third-party funding disclosure requirements in the District Court of Delaware, one of the few venues that does require disclosure, we learned that a Chinese firm, Purplevine IP, is bankrolling patent infringement lawsuits targeting technology companies in the U.S. Courts. In March of this year, another report uncovered that sanctioned Russian oligarchs are investigating millions of dollars in lawsuits in our courts even though they are supposed to be prohibited from doing business in the United States. This is what we know. At the core of our predicament, however, is that without the disclosure requirements we cannot know the full picture, who is funding these efforts, and which industries or companies are at risk of finding themselves on the receiving end of an abusive lawsuit. This must end. The American justice system is the model the rest of the world follows. At their very best, courts work to resolve disputes with cases decided on the merits of the opposing arguments. TPLF undermines that model, treating our courts as another investment vehicle. Good news is that there are steps we can take to fix the problem, such as requiring disclosure of third-party litigation funding in civil cases, including Federal class actions in multidistrict litigation proceedings where the third-party funder has a right to receive any payment that is contingent in any respect on the outcome of the civil action by settlement, judgment, or otherwise, requiring funders to disclose litigation funding from foreign entities and a foreign government and that government's role in the litigation to other parties, the court, and the U.S. Government. Of course, Speaker Johnson and Senators Kennedy and Manchin have introduced the Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act to end overseas meddling in American litigation. These steps should all be on the table. Thank you again for your invitation to testify today, and I look forward to your questions.   Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Taylor. STATEMENT OF PAUL TAYLOR Mr. Taylor. Thanks to the Committee for inviting me here today. When lawyers fund their own cases, they do so with an understanding that they owe their clients a duty of loyalty; that is, lawyers are supposed to respect the wishes of their clients, including how their client views justice playing out in the case. Often, lawyers get paid a percentage of the money awarded, but importantly, when lawyers fund their own cases, they do so with one eye on their ability to recover their costs and make a profit and the other eye on achieving what their clients see as a just result. Today, lawyers are increasingly entering into agreements with third parties who will fund their lawsuits under a duty to maximize not justice, but their own in their investors' profits from settlements or awards, using contracts that have terms that, to some degree, take control away from lawyers and their clients and give it to their financial backers. Now, some might say that third-party litigation funders are just private businesses that should be allowed to operate in a free market, but they'd be wrong because third-party litigation funders are not private businesses, in the sense that their entire business model is based on leveraging the power of government through lawsuits. Here's how: If a litigation funder wanted to pay me to sue any of the Members here for some bogus reason, all I'd have to do is pay a small filing fee to a court, so I could hand you a piece of paper with a complaint. You might read it and think it's absurd, but you couldn't toss it away and ignore it, because if you ignored it, I'd win my lawsuit by a default judgment that is enforced by the government. You don't want that to happen, so you'd have to hire a lawyer and spend a lot of time and money to finally win your case. At some point, I could say to you, hey, maybe my case is bogus, but let's get real. This case would cost you $10,000 or whatever to defend yourself and win, but you'd be out that money because we don't have a ``loser pays'' rule in America. Why don't you just pay me $7,000 now, I'll pay my funders their cut, and then I'll go away, and that way you'll save $3,000 out of the $10,000, it would've cost you to defeat my claim in court. It's legal extortion, sure, but it's the way the system works. Rule XI of the Federal rules of civil procedure is no help because it requires victims of frivolous lawsuits to spend even more money to get their case declared frivolous, and even then, judges aren't required to make the victims whole. No truly private business relying solely on voluntary agreements in a free market could rely on government power to its advantage in that way, but third-party litigation funders can and do in fulfilling a duty that breaches the attorney's duty of loyalty and puts profit in the eyes of the funding investors in place of justice in the eyes of the client, which leads to absurd results. A lawsuit brought by food distribution company Sysco against food suppliers was funded by third parties. At a certain point in the litigation, Sysco wanted to settle, but it had signed a litigation financing agreement that stipulated Sysco, quote, ``shall not accept a settlement offer without the funder's prior written consent,'' and the funder said, ``Sysco was settling for too little,'' with the funder's chief investment officer even writing an email staying, quote, ``We are going to have to sue Sysco, it seems. They are about to breach our contract.'' OK, so that's bad, but why are we talking about this in the patent Subcommittee? Well, the American patent litigation system includes additional dysfunctions that third-party financiers can leverage to maximize their profits at the expense of innocent parties, and here's how that works: In patent litigation funders work with so-called patent trolls, companies that don't make any products themselves but instead buy from others' old, low-quality patents that likely shouldn't have been granted in the first place, and they use them to threaten productive companies with infringement suits. Patent trolls have an unfair advantage. Once granted, even patents that were not properly granted by the Patent and Trademark Office are legally deemed to have a presumption of validity. That means that a party defending against an infringement claim has to show the patent at issue is invalid by clear and convincing evidence, which is a much higher standard than the usual preponderance of the evidence, which is all the patent troll needs to meet and win the infringement claim. Think about what that means in a real-world jury room in a case involving some very complex technology. If any one of us were on that jury, we would likely be very confused. If jurors are confused about a technical issue, they'll find it difficult to reach any decision. Since they would've to reach much further to get to clear and convincing evidence and invalidate an improperly granted patent, they'll have the incentive to tap out at the much lower standard of preponderance of the evidence and decide in favor of the patent troll in their funder's infringement claims. So, even innocent innovators knowing this are incentivized to settle lawsuits involving complex technologies. The third-party funders turn patent courts into casinos where the rules are rigged in their favor. Now, as former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, There are known/unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things that we do not know. And the issue of third-party litigation financing by foreign enemies is a known/unknown of a dangerous kind. Before the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Federal agencies knew of al-Qaeda's existence and its intent to harm America, but not the specifics of its operation and capabilities. Today, patent trolls and their funders can be foreign enemies who extort money through our legal system as a means of syphoning resources away from American industries, including defense industries. We know foreign enemies like China have the will and the way to use third-party litigation financing to hurt America; we just don't know the extent of it. To conclude, a couple years ago, Chief Judge Connolly of the district of Delaware issued standing orders mandating the disclosure of third-party litigation financing in his courtroom. That simple disclosure requirement had dramatic results. Third-party litigation financing companies dismissed their own funded patent cases in the court simply because they didn't want to reveal their financing arrangements. Let that sink in for a moment. Judge Connolly simply cast a light in the direction of the litigation funders, and the litigation vanished just like that. Congress, too, could dramatically improve the justice system by simply exposing third-party litigation agreements.   Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Kochan. STATEMENT OF DONALD KOCHAN Mr. Kochan. Chair Issa, the Ranking Member Johnson, the Ranking Member Nadler, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony today on the U.S. intellectual property system and the impact of litigation financed by third-party investors and foreign entities, and the chance to submit my written testimony, which I incorporate here by reference. My name is Donald Kochan. I am a Professor of Law and Executive Director of the Law & Economics Center at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School. Across my now 22 years in academia, I have extensively researched, studied, and written scholarly analysis of our civil justice system. I've also taught courses on Federal civil procedure, Federal Courts, and State Constitutional law, among others. My research in law and economics also contributes to my understanding of the incentive's problems involved in third- party litigation financing, TPLF for short, ongoing. My testimony today represents my personal expert opinions and not those of the George Mason University, the Law & Economics Center, the Antonin Scalia Law School, or any other organization with which I am affiliated. Our Founders designed the finest court system in the world. Individuals can invest and innovate because they know and trust that the court system will be there as a forum for the neutral, predictable resolution of true cases and controversies between actual litigants. Only individuals who need the courts are supposed to be involved in cases. Courts should not be the--or should be the guarantors of the rule of law and accessed only by those seeking justice for personal wrongs or to clarify personal rights. The courts are successful at fulfilling their purpose when they can promise to be uncorrupted by private incentives in their management and uncorrupted functionally by nonlitigant speculators wishing to exploit the courts for private gain. Court systems do not work well if we create incentives to flood the courts, draining resources available for traditional consumers of courts. Yet, the new TPLF infects the court system with precisely those kinds of features, threatening to convert the civil justice system into a speculative market, flooding the courts with cases gambling on potential payouts. Courts should be insulated from normal market forces such that courts will be available to the traditional market to use in a reliable way. This is why traditional defenses of markets, from free market- oriented individuals who favor innovations in finance, and discourage limitations on vehicles for investment, do not hold true in the ``courts as a market'' narrative that TPLF encourages. Facing this, legislation should be guided by a principle that preserves the integrity of courts. We need to maintain the civil justice system outside the market if we are to preserve the civil justice system as a predictable, neutral, reliable, and accessible system that serves the market. Putting this another way, to preserve the effectiveness of our Nation's courts to serve as the necessary and neutral forums that facilitate the market, the court system must be insulated from market forces. The third-party litigation funding is used as a vehicle for investment, or as a means of achieving other strategic goals of the funder, including harming strategic or geopolitical competitors or using the courts and the litigation discovery process as a conduit to gain access to sensitive trade secrets and confidential intellectual property that otherwise would be shielded from view. When the courts are open to TPLF, funders logically include foreign influencers who will use the opening to weaken the strength of our civil justice system for their own geostrategic gain, or see it as a way to cut America's innovative spirit by investing in litigation that destabilizes our protections for intellectual property or litigation that simply imposes costs on innovators in a manner that gives a competitive advantage to the investors behind the funders. Despite these clearly distinct incentives, TPLF funders regularly propagandize TPLF as an access to justice issue to try to gain supporters, obfuscating TPLF's true contemporary features by attempting to place a public interest mask on a massive private profit activity, a type of phenomenon regularly analyzed in law and economics. It's important not to be deceived by that mask. The investment mark of a TPLF is still a pretty dark black box. The default rule operating in our system is that disclosure is not required. There are only a handful of judges and a few States that now require it. Mostly parties and judges themselves have no idea whether or who is bankrolling the litigation. Consequently, there are many known/unknowns, as my colleague mentioned, things we know or do not know about the market, like the location, scope, frequency, purposes, and backer identity of such funding. Because of the lack of transparency, there are also, many unknown/unknowns, things that we do not know, and that should scare us given the potential influence these external forces can have on the courts. On one last note, lessons from the study of law and economics predict that funders will not just have an interest in increasingly funding specific cases for immediate return. They also have an independent incentive to fund cases solely to transform precedent to their advantage or to impose costs through the change in law. This can include weakening intellectual property rights that favor their competitors or that are important to the United States economic advantages of a foreign nation. Similarly, those TPLF long-view holders will understand that it is beneficial to expand the size, scope, and frequency of tort liability because they can increase their payouts if there are more payors, i.e., more legally liable parties. They will invest in loosening constraints on the supply of favorable judgments, irrespective of the legal or policy merits of such an expansion. Thank you for examining this issue. Thank you for the time to speak. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony. I look forward to your questions.   Mr. Issa. Thank you. Ms. Sahani. STATEMENT OF VICTORIA SAHANI Ms. Sahani. Good afternoon, Chair Issa, the Ranking Member Johnson, the Ranking Member Nadler, and the Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to testify today. My name is Victoria Shannon Sahani. I serve as Associate Provost for Community and Inclusion at Boston University, and as Professor of Law at Boston University School of Law. I am honored to have the opportunity to share more than 12 years of expertise in third-party funding, and more than 15 years of experience in international arbitration involving global entities and cross-border disputes. In addition to publishing numerous law review articles, book chapters, and essays on third-party funding, I coauthored the first book in the world on third-party funding, titled, ``Third-Party Funding in International Arbitration.'' I also served on the global Third-Party Funding Task Force from 2013- 2018, and contributed to drafting the task force's 2018 final report. I am honored to be invited to contribute my expertise to this critically important dialog. My testimony reflects my personal research and views, not the views of Boston University or any other organization. I will assert three main points: First, the third-party litigation funding industry serves three separate populations: Consumer third-party funding primarily for individual parties; commercial third-party funding primarily for business parties; and law firm financing. There is some overlap between these three populations, and all three populations can benefit from third-party funding. A litigant's inability to afford access to the Federal Courts, or access to experienced legal counsel due to financial constraints represents a fundamental flaw in our justice system. Third-party funding provides funding for both consumer and commercial litigants to adjudicate their rights and to law firms, seeking working capital for their case portfolios. This is also true in patent litigation where patent holders and their legal counsel can benefit from the third-party funders' resources to vindicate patent rights. Second, third-party funding is one tool that can assist with expanding access to justice, but it is not a panacea. Third-party funding illuminates but does not fix the cracks in our justice system that we as a society must repair. Nevertheless, the potential for third-party funding to deliver access to justice more broadly is even greater than we currently realize. As I have described in my research, the next frontier for increasing access to civil justice involves a multifaceted approach, including encouraging pro bono or lower cost funding as a subset of each for-profit funder's portfolio, providing access to justice for plaintiffs with nondamages claims or defenses, including patent holders seeking nonmonetary declaratory determinations of patent validity or infringement, and providing access to justice for parties with legitimate claims that are exceedingly expensive or might be difficult to prove. Third-party funding can and should be on the menu of options available to legitimate parties while we work simultaneously to make justice more affordable and accessible to all. Finally, although national security is outside my area of expertise, I understand that concerns about national security primarily stem from the fear that adversaries may use third- party litigation funding for nefarious purposes, rather than fear about the existence of third-party litigation funding itself. We should be cautious not to shut down this new industry or reduce opportunities for this industry to improve the administration from justice out of fear. Third-party litigation funding is a global industry with legitimate, ordinary business relationships between third-party funders, funded clients, investors, patent holders, law firms, and case filings that routinely cross multiple national boundaries without cause for concern. Regulation of third-party funding in the national security context should be tailored to achieve clear goals and not be overly broad in ways that may inadvertently curtail the entire third-party litigation funding industry. Thank you again, and I welcome your questions.   Mr. Issa. I thank you. We now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Lee, for five minutes. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield my time to the gentleman from California, Mr. Issa. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlelady. I'm going to go last witness first, if you will. Ms. Sahani, you perhaps share with the Ranking Member some concerns about anything that would cause further disclosure of third- party investors. Is that correct? Ms. Sahani. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chair. I think that disclosure is a complicated topic. There are different types of disclosure, different amounts of disclosure, different types of information-- Mr. Issa. Would-- Ms. Sahani. Yes. Mr. Issa. Would you give us the minimum disclosure you would support? Ms. Sahani. Sure. Thank you. I would support disclosure of the name or identity of the funder, and any relevant information regarding its business address or location. I think that is reasonable, and given my research globally, that seems to be the trend. Mr. Issa. If I could ask, if the plaintiff is allowed to ask for and receive, in all jurisdictions around--or all venues around the United States, able to receive information as to whether the defendant is insured, and how much that insurance is for. Would a similar reciprocal as to the funder's investment and/or return, or something along that line be equally the other side of the same coin? Ms. Sahani. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chair. My understanding of the rule regarding the disclosure of the limits on liability insurance is with respect to the merits of the case, and any potential damages award, which may be paid by the insurance policy. Third-party funders do not pay the actual claim awarded amount. They only pay costs. So, the disclosure for the purpose of insurance is for a different purpose than the disclosure for third-party funding agreements. Mr. Issa. Mr. Goodlatte, how would you feel about this balancing question? Because we know that there will be people who perhaps disagree with any transparency, and there will be those looking for common ground, and I'd like to seek as much understanding of that today as we could. Mr. Goodlatte. Well, I think the insurance analogy is actually a good one, because the parties in most jurisdictions are able to not only get the information that Professor Sahani referred to, but can also get an actual copy of the insurance policy. That contains a lot of useful information regarding how the strategy of a lawsuit will be pursued, whether you're going to settle the case and whether the insurance company is going to deduct the amount of the cost of the litigation from the overall coverage limit in the case. Mr. Issa. This is an important question. Would you repeat that for everyone to understand that they normally do not pay just for the damages, and in some cases don't pay for the damages at all, but they actually are paying for the defense? Mr. Goodlatte. Definitely. That is a very, very common standard for the insurance company to pay for the cost of the litigation, which is exactly what the third-party funder is doing. Mr. Issa. So, we are dealing with the equivalent, in your opinion, of the third-party litigant investor who's paying for the legal fees, and the insurance company who's paying for the legal fees, at least those two are identical? Mr. Goodlatte. That's right. I think for a judge, whose duty is to make sure there's fair and impartial administration of justice, and given the volume, the efficient need for that justice to be administered, the judge needs to know what the terms of that are to be able to facilitate a discussion process to settle the cases. If you don't have that information, you wind up with a situation like the one Mr. Taylor referred to in which the plaintiff in the Sysco case had a very different objective than the third-party funder had, and not only did that not result in settlement of the case, when Sysco attempted to settle the case, Burford stepped in and said you're violating the terms of our agreement. I think the judge and all the parties of the case, not the jury, not the general public, but the parties of the case need to know that information for the efficient and fair administration of justice. Mr. Issa. Mr. Taylor, the Chair brought up a very interesting point. Would you agree that even if the jury never hears or sees any of this, that, in fact, at a minimum the judge needs to know or has a right to know, and a magistrate who is doing the early neutral attempt at settlement would certainly have a right to know this or should? Mr. Taylor. Absolutely. In fact, the judge that's the leading reformer on this, Judge Connolly in the District of Delaware, originally decided he had to come up with a standing rule to disclose this sort of thing because he was having lawyers come up to him during cases. He was trying to discuss in a sidebar some potential resolution and some of the lawyers were not able to give him a definitive answer there, indicating to him that there was someone else not in the courtroom who was directing what was decisions that were going to be made. Now, that is not a good system. We need to know who is making the calls to negotiate fair settlements with the interests of all concerns represented. Mr. Issa. Thank you. My time is expired. The Ranking Member is recognized. Mr. Johnson. Thank you. I want to recognize the appearance of our good friend Bob Goodlatte. Always good to see you, sir. I want to address a question to Ms. Sahani. You stated that there are some disclosure requirements that you would be comfortable with. Those seem to be insufficient to suit the other witnesses. What other disclosures would they be asking for, and what would be your opinion of going further than just simply name, address, and the identifying information? Ms. Sahani. Thank you for the question, Ranking Member Johnson. This is a debate that has been going on worldwide for many years, actually. So, disclosure is one of the key features of the third-party litigation funding regulation movement around the world, and there's a wide variety of different types of disclosure that have been requested and different rules that exist in the international arbitration as well as the litigation space. The reasons why further information beyond the identity or name of the funder and, say, the address or location of the funder, the reasons why that other information would be requested would have more to do with whether or not the funder is, say, for instance, engaged in controlling the litigation, or whether the funder is trying to participate in the proceedings in some way, which is unusual. Most funders don't do this. In those circumstances, the judge or arbitrator in international arbitration that has observed such behavior already has power inherent in their role as judge, or inherent in their role as arbitrator to request further disclosure of the funding arrangement, and that has occurred. So, under the existing rules, judges or arbitrators can ask for more if they feel more is warranted based on the facts and circumstances of the case. Mr. Johnson. So, how would a requirement that more information than just simply identifying information be produced? Why is that harmful? Ms. Sahani. Thank you, Ranking Member Johnson. One of the reasons why it's harmful is much of the information in a funding agreement relates to the relationship between the funded party and the funder, or if it's a law firm, the law firm and the funder, and that can often involve limitations on the amount of money that the funder might invest. So, for example, if the opposing party were to know that the funder has capped the cost or expenses that they're willing to pay at a certain amount, then as Mr. Goodlatte, Chair Goodlatte mentioned earlier, that is litigation strategy to say they can only spend this much money of the funder's money. So, to know that in advance gives the opposing side a huge advantage, a tactical advantage that they wouldn't ordinarily have if the funded party just had a bank loan or was self- funding. They wouldn't have that information. So, to require full disclosure of the funding agreement basically is like pulling back the curtain on the litigation strategy of the funded party. Mr. Johnson. The funded party is typically the smaller guy in the equation. Is that correct? Ms. Sahani. Yes. It can be--not always, but often it's the smaller party, the party that is viewed as either a small business or individual owner of a patent. Mr. Johnson. Now, in terms of disclosing the amount of insurance coverage versus the details of the funding agreement that the funder has with the little guy, can you talk about the differences between those two disclosure requirements? Ms. Sahani. Yes. So, the funding agreement, the disclosure of the funding agreement to the court is one measure of disclosure. There's also disclosure to the opposing side, and both of those disclosure provisions are common. You can see disclosures to the court on camera, or disclosure to the court and the opposing side of either, of course, the identity and the location of the funder. Certain jurisdictions require disclosure of a few provisions within the funding arrangement if the funding arrangement is at issue in the case, but otherwise, that's not requested, and that's different from the disclosure in the rule that Chair Issa raised with respect to insurance. Mr. Johnson. OK. Thank you. Unlike the Chair of the Committee, I'm going to resist the urge to move further than my five minutes, so I'll yield back the balance of my time, and I hope that I will set the example for the-- Mr. Issa. Mr. Chair--or Mr. Ranking Member, you always set a fine example. With that, we go to the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Massie. Mr. Massie. Thank you, Chair Issa. Professor Sahani, so we've discussed insurance arrangements and bank loans, but what about venture capital? Like not specifically for the purposes of the lawsuit, but let's say they're investors, angel investors, and they're venture capital investors in a small company that brings a lawsuit. Is what we're talking about, would it encompass disclosing all those investments if somebody gets into a lawsuit, or is it just the specific financing of lawsuits? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much for the question, Mr. Massie. I presume you mean investors in the fund as opposed to investors in the party, but please clarify. Mr. Massie. Investors--let's say a company, just a small startup brings a lawsuit, and they've got some investors in their company. I think what we're discussing today is this--I don't know if it's novel, but it's certainly not what a lot of people think of when they think of lawsuits, but what we're discussing today is when you have somebody who finances a specific lawsuit, right, and putting transparency on that. My question is, those transparency requirements, would they peel back the curtain on just investors who hold stock in the company, for instance? Ms. Sahani. Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Massie. No, the current disclosure rules and provisions that we've been discussing would not necessarily reveal investors in the company unless one of those investors was a third-party funder meeting the definition in the disclosure rule. Standard investors and shareholders that would not be third-party funders would not be covered by the disclosure rule we have discussed. Mr. Massie. Thank you very much. I'm going to yield the balance of my time to Chair Issa. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Kochan, you've certainly looked at the agreements we're alluding to in many cases. Is that correct? Mr. Kochan. The few that are available, yes. I would--it's very-- Mr. Issa. What you're saying is, they're not often gotten even when they're sought? Mr. Kochan. Correct, because there is no requirement to turn them over to the court or to--unless the court decides to create a rule. Mr. Issa. So, on those that were available to you, similar to what the gentlelady said, were they--did they have limitations in what you looked at and how much they were willing to invest? Mr. Kochan. I've not seen the limitations of the willingness to invest. The things that have been exposed are the control provisions, for example, in the Sysco litigation that was alluded to earlier, and that is despite the fact that the funders regularly claim that they do not exercise control. As we stated, because we don't have access to the contracts, because there's been high resistance to providing access to those contracts, there cannot be any generalization as the funders do not exercise control, and, in fact, the few times we've seen them they are taking control of the litigation. Mr. Issa. So, let me give you a hypothetical but I think a fairly narrow one. If you have a contract between a law firm, let's say the patent holder, and the investment company, even if it limits the amount of money it has in it, isn't that simply a deal that could be renegotiated if more money was needed? Mr. Kochan. Absolutely. Mr. Issa. So, the fact that it might have a limitation doesn't mean that there is a limitation particularly if the investor is a Sovereign Wealth Fund, BlackRock, or some other large--CalPERS, some other large entity? Mr. Kochan. Correct. As litigation is ongoing, the calculus may change as to the level of expected costs or other changes that would lead to renegotiating of that-- Mr. Issa. I've never had negotiation I've been in as a plaintiff or defendant end up with what we originally estimated or less. It is only the other way. Well, isn't it also a question of, if they put a limitation on it, isn't that, in fact, by definition, a form of control, because when that money is used up the plaintiff's investor, in fact, is in a position to then renegotiate the deal, or in some other way, control whether you settle or not? Mr. Kochan. Certainly. Anytime you have an opportunity to renegotiate or any time that the person relying on that contract has a need to come and ask for permission to do something more, that you're going to have leverage. Mr. Issa. Now, for both of you, sort of put your professor's hats on for a moment, isn't one of the basic principles of American law, mostly taken from the British, that you have a right to face your accuser? Is that pretty much what we all think is normal? Mr. Kochan. Correct. Ms. Sahani. Yes. Mr. Issa. So, if an investor, in fact, is the actual accuser, in other words, if it's a competitor of yours seeking to get information through discovery, if, in fact, it's an entity that you may have disagreements with, or be in direct competition with, and you don't know who they are, then, in fact, you're not being faced by your true adversary in this case, whether they have overt or implied control? Would that be fair? Ms. Sahani. Thank you. I think that the question is whether or not the entity or person financing the case is a real-party interest. There is arm's-length financing, there is bank financing through loans, there are parent corporations that finance the litigation of their subsidiaries all the time. So, the question of whether or not there is an interested entity that's funding versus just a financier of some sort would need to be answered for me to answer your question. Mr. Issa. Thank you. To be continued. We'll go to the gentlelady from North Carolina. Ms. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you so much to our panel. This is a really fascinating subject and I think a very important one. We've heard quite a bit today about issues patent holders face in disputes over their intellectual property, on both sides. However, third-party litigation funding is not the root of these problems. These problems have come just from how patents are enforced. This Subcommittee, I believe, should be instead focusing on ways to make the PTAB a fairer venue for patent holders, and doing so would mean that patent holders with solid claims may not have to rely on third-party litigation funding. I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill with former Representative Buck called the PREVAIL Act. That bill would reform PTAB to address the high rate of patent invalidation. The bill would require standing for PTAB challengers and limit repeat petition. It would harmonize burdens of proof at PTAB and the Federal District Court. It would also end duplicative patent challenges by requiring a party to choose to sue either in PTAB or the District Court, because some people do both venues at the same time and roll the dice. These measures would be more narrowly tailored to address the high invalidation rates at PTAB, and these are the first measures we should take to make our patent system fairer, rather than measures that might overhaul our entire tort system. A broad overhaul would impact not only patent disputes, but a wide swath of civil claims, which often rely on third-party litigation funding to move forward at all. We've heard from our professor that third-party litigation funding is used in a variety of different ways and sometimes to give litigants their only method of bringing their claims forward. So, pursuing justice in court or at the PTAB is staggeringly expensive, and that's been established. Without a policy of reforms to address the root causes of the disparate access to justice, broadly limiting third-party litigation funding could threaten our already uneven justice system. Now, my first question I'll pose to the professors first and then to the practitioners. A GAO report found that third-party litigation funders only accepted about five percent of cases brought to them. Does this mean that there are some good cases that are still left on the table even with third-party litigation funding available? Ms. Sahani? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much, Ms. Ross, for the question. Yes, absolutely. Third-party litigation funders, in my understanding from talking with many of them, are very selective in terms of which cases they choose to fund. There are a variety of factors that are financial and nonfinancial that go into that decision, and many cases end up on the cutting room floor, so to speak, meaning that they don't receive funding. This is one of the challenges of the access to justice piece that I write about in my research, where I say that funders should fund more cases than the ones that they already do. Ms. Ross. Mr. Kochan? Mr. Kochan. So, the GAO Report is, I believe, a few years old, correct? So, I'm not sure what that number would be today. I also think there's a presumption in there that the five percent that is claimed there are actually meritorious cases. As mentioned, the funders consider a variety of factors which may not, in fact, be about merit. Many of them are about the ease of settlements, the ease of leverage that can be gained in these cases. So, they're being assessed for their financial return, rather than necessarily for their legal claims. Ms. Ross. Just as they would be with the private bar. I'm going to move on to my next question. Does third-party litigation funding replace the need for equal access to justice reform that gets to the heart of the issue in our justice system, Ms. Sahani? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much, Ms. Ross. No, it does not replace. Third-party funding is a bit of a Band-Aid. Again, as I just mentioned, since they don't fund very many cases, it's not a big enough Band-Aid to help stop the issue that we have in our legal system with many, many litigants that don't have access to sophisticated counsel to be able to pursue their claim or defend against their claim. Ms. Ross. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlelady. We now go to the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Fry. Mr. Fry. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Former Mr. Chair, good to see. It's always a pleasure to have you in front of this Committee. Mr. Chair, what do you think, what would you say, for an average law firm, your run-of-the-mill country lawyer, what does a contingency percentage usually look like? Mr. Goodlatte. That's a great question, Congressman. Generally, I think you're talking about between 25-40 percent. Mr. Fry. That's usually the standard. That's pretty standard across, in your experience, across the profession. Is that correct? Mr. Goodlatte. Well, in my rural part of the world, maybe the same as yours. Mr. Fry. Yes, sir. Mr. Goodlatte. Of course, so the third-party funder is going to take something on top of that. Mr. Fry. Well, and who usually sets that, right? Who usually sets that percentage? I know it's a contract issue. Aren't there usually rules in Federal Court or in State Courts that kind of cap the percentage that a plaintiff's lawyer could get? Mr. Goodlatte. There are in some jurisdictions, yes. Mr. Fry. What do you see the difference in something like that from a plaintiff's side and something in what the industry is having with third-party litigation funding? Mr. Goodlatte. Well, I think the biggest difference is that that lawyer has a fiduciary responsibility to the court. They have all kinds of obligations in terms of disclosure, in terms of how they treat their client, in terms of making sure there are no conflicts of interest, and so on. When that attorney or the client decides to bring in a third-party funder--and these are generally in larger cases-- you develop another potential major conflict that is not disclosed to the court. Mr. Fry. Right. Mr. Goodlatte. Which you have two bosses. You have two bosses. As we've talked about with this Sysco case, which is sort of an open look into something that we usually don't get an open look into because there's no transparency, in those circumstances, that third-party funder--I saw the one that was involved in the Sysco case on ``60 Minutes'' last year say, ``We don't have any control over the course of the litigation.'' Then, we found out that in that case they had a very nice clause that said, ``You can't settle this case without our approval.'' Mr. Fry. So, they need the bar license to file the pleadings with the court, right? They need that. They need the straw man in the chair to ask the questions. The lawyer is not actually advising the client. They're just kind of propped up by the third-party litigation funding component. Is that fair to say? Mr. Goodlatte. That's fair to say. There's another danger, and that is, the lawyer may find themselves with their own conflict of interest, as they found in the Sysco case, because Sysco eventually fired their attorneys because they felt they were representing the third-party funder more than they were representing their interests when they wanted to settle the case and the third-party funder-- Mr. Fry. Chair, I looked at the Delaware court. So, Professor Sahani talked about the disclosure. Her threshold was disclosure of the name or the entity and the address, right? That's what she would be comfortable with. Delaware says that you need to give the identity of the funders. You also need to describe the financial benefit the funder stands to gain, so the contingency fee in that particular case maybe, and then whether or not the funder's approval is required before settlement. In addition--is that a good model, would you say, that Congress should look at or policymakers should look at? Mr. Goodlatte. I think it's a very good model. That's why I say, and as the Chair has indicated as well, actually getting a look at the agreement, which is very similar to getting a look at the agreement that an insurance company has with a defendant, would reveal some of these facts as well. You could avoid that by asking enough of the kind of questions you just described. Mr. Fry. Last question, and I'm going to yield the remaining portion of my time to the Chair. What would you do in the case of an identity where you have a corporate entity that has multiple people that are funding the lawsuits? Would that also be disclosed, or would there just be the corporate entity? Mr. Goodlatte. Well, I think that it would depend on, obviously, what the Congress decided to do. I would recommend that you go deeper than that, particularly when it relates to, for example, third-party litigation funders who are major investors in the vehicle that's being used. For example-- Mr. Fry. So, you couldn't hide behind a corporate shell, is what I'm getting at. Mr. Goodlatte. Right. What if you had in your hedge fund a sovereign wealth fund investor, a foreign government-owned entity? Mr. Fry. That's what I'm getting at. Mr. Goodlatte. I think that should be disclosed. Mr. Fry. Thank you for that. With the remainder of my time, I yield to you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Issa. Ms. Sahani, I'll followup on just exactly that. Do you believe that implied or possible conflicts of interest as to, quite frankly, the settlement of the case, the process, anything of that sort, should, in fact, have some level of transparency that currently it could have under the orders of a judge, but doesn't have uniformly? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much for the question, Chair Issa. I do believe that if a judge finds in a case that they think there is behavior taking place-- Mr. Issa. No. I asked about should there be discovery based on whether those conflicts exist, separate from the judge having an inkling and doing it. Because, obviously, the judges can do it now, but normally do not and don't feel obligated to know whether that happens or not. Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. As a matter of course, I think that if the funding arrangement states that the funder has control of the litigation or if the funder is a part owner, say an equity stake in the funded party, then the funder is part of the party and, therefore, should have more extensive information disclosed. In most circumstances the funder is at an arm's length and is not directing the litigation, in which case I would think that disclosure is not necessary unless a judge decides so. Mr. Issa. We now go to the Ranking Member of the Full Committee, Mr. Nadler, for five minutes. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Professor Sahani, could you walk us through why corporations seeking to avoid being sued by individuals and businesses who have had their patents stolen might advocate for burdensome tort reform measures--so-called tort reform measures--for third-party litigation funding? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much, Mr. Nadler. There are many reasons why corporations might oppose other corporations suing them with respect to patents. One of those might be that there's a chilling effect if the litigation is overly expensive. Then, the much larger corporation can often avoid having to answer for its actions if the smaller entity does not have the financial resources to engage. So, that's one example. There may be other possibilities. I am not an expert on patent law, but I can say, in general, large corporations do prefer not to be sued by anybody, definitely, but certainly not their smaller competitors. So, finding ways to reduce the opportunities for those smaller competitors to bring cases or for patent holders who are smaller to bring cases would be beneficial to the business of a larger entity. Mr. Nadler. Professor Sahani, advocates for mandated disclosure suggested that litigation is burdensome or distracting. Are burdensome or distracting lawsuits inappropriate for plaintiffs to bring? Why or why not? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much for the question, Mr. Nadler. Burdensome and distracting are interesting terms in this context. I would say there's a lot of litigation that we have that is very valid, that is burdensome. It may be expensive because it takes a lot of resources to get at the truth. Antitrust litigation, for one, is very expensive, but it is important. So, I think burden, in and of itself, isn't necessarily the right yardstick by which to measure whether a case should be brought. Distracting is an interesting one. I think that a valid claim in any circumstance is important to bring, and whether or not it's distracting--I guess the question would be, distracting from what? The business line of the defendant? Well, of course it's taking you away from that. At the same time, many of these large corporations have many lawsuits and very busy litigation teams. So, it isn't distracting them any more than any other lawsuit that they may have, in my view. Mr. Nadler. If the patents are valid and infringed, are they still burdensome and distracting? Ms. Sahani. Well, that--Mr. Nadler, thank you. That's a valid claim. If the patent is infringed, that's a valid claim, and burdensome and distracting are adjectives that I think don't apply to a valid claim that should be heard. Mr. Nadler. Professor Sahani, why would a plaintiff seek out funding from a third party? Ms. Sahani. There are a wide variety of reasons why a party might seek out funding. One of course is, as we've been discussing, the access to justice piece, which is where the party may not be able to afford to bring the claim. There are also well-resourced entities that actually prefer to engage with third-party funders as a way to have someone else deal with the fluctuations and the costs of litigation rather than have that be on the company's balance sheet. So, it's not just indigent litigants or litigants that don't have the resources. It's also well-resourced litigants, many of which are household names, also use third-party funding. So, those are a couple of reasons. I could certainly give more if you'd like. Mr. Nadler. So, the lack of funding, obviously, doesn't indicate a case that shouldn't be brought in the first place? Ms. Sahani. Yes, that's correct, Mr. Nadler. Mr. Nadler. On the other hand, why would a third party seek to place a bet essentially on someone else's court case? Ms. Sahani. Thank you for the question, Mr. Nadler. There's also a wide variety of reasons why another entity might invest in someone else's lawsuit. Third-party litigation funding as an industry is relatively new in the United States, but individuals funding the lawsuits of others is a very old practice. That's why we had at common law the torts of champerty and maintenance, because it used to be a very, very long time ago something that was illegal. We removed that provision in the United States when we instituted contingency fees. So right now, we already allow lawyers to finance the litigation of their clients through contingency fees, and that's something that's allowed in all 50 States. In some respects, that is kind of the oldest form of, quote, ``third- party funding we have in the U.S.'' Now, we've moved to a situation in which we have nonlawyer, nonpracticing lawyer entities that are funding litigation. They can do so for profit, they can do so for other motives relating to the impact that the case might have, as well as to ensure that certain businesses have their day in court. So, there's a wide variety of reasons. I'll stop there. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. We now go to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome to our witnesses. Good to see the former Chair. I want to ask Mr. Taylor, U.S. companies during the discovery process are required to share sensitive and proprietary intellectual property with their opponents. When undisclosed third-party litigation financing is involved in a suit, some funders also become aware of information shared during the discovery process. As a new Member of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, I'm concerned about the potential for our Nation's intellectual property, that it could fall into the hands of adversarial competitors. I was pleased that the Select Committee recommended the following in the Committee's December 12th report, to: Determine, and then establish, what guardrails are needed to address the possibility of foreign adversary entities obtaining sensitive IP through funding third-party litigation in the U.S. For litigation in Federal court, require enhanced disclosures for foreign adversary entities and provide judges with the authority to require enhanced disclosures for certain entities under foreign adversary entity control regarding their funding, and, when appropriate, ownership and connection with the foreign adversary government and dominant political party. Some have argued that adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party would view TPLF as an inefficient way to conduct espionage. Do you believe the Chinese Government would undertake such an effort to obtain critical information from U.S. companies? Mr. Taylor. Sure. The opportunity is there. No matter how tightly worded a judge's rules regarding the disclosure of information is, within a lawsuit, lots of entities, contractors, people who work for the contractors, end up getting this material, exponentially enlarging the pool of potential leakers of this stuff. We know the Chinese Government is going to do anything it can, exploit any opportunity it can. So, why not, if you're the Chinese Government, try, fund as many lawsuits as you think are strategically in your interest and see what sticks? Not only see what sticks, see what comes through the sieve, see what gets leaked. The more cases you file, the more opportunities you're going to have for there to be a chink in the system, the judge's order, the rules that otherwise govern. You're just maximizing your opportunity to get something that you are not supposed to have. Mr. Cline. Do you share the Select Committee's concern about our adversaries accessing sensitive IP through third- party litigation? Do you support the Committee's recommendations related to enhanced disclosures? Mr. Taylor. Yes. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Is China the only foreign adversary of the U.S. attempting to capitalize on third-party litigation funding? Mr. Taylor. No. We have adversaries all over the world. There's a case that just came to light recently where Russian oligarchs who are buddies of Putin were hit with sanctions. They weren't supposed to have any business dealings in the United States. Turns out they were funding litigation here, and that was unraveled by reporters. So, you have, of course, many opportunities for this to be exploited. We know they exist. We know they've occurred. Unfortunately, now we only know they occur in places where circumstance or the initiative of an individual judge, like Judge Connolly in Delaware, who is only one of 700 district judges, has taken the steps to bring some of this stuff to light. You can only imagine what else is out there in the jurisdictions that don't have these disclosure rules in place. Mr. Cline. Absolutely. Thank you all. I would yield the remainder of my time to the Chair. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. I'm going to followup on the national security question. Ms. Sahani, I have been choosing to go to you because the others already agree that we should have more disclosure, and I want to find the middle ground here if we can. From a national security standpoint, would it be correct basically to say that if an investor has a right to see any of the information related to the case, but is not disclosed, that, in fact, any and all protective orders and other information of that sort could, in fact, be negated by that? In other words, if you're worried about Huawei getting information and they're the investor but you don't know who they are, do we have a real risk and should we mitigate that risk by at least having rules that would govern the disclosure of these individuals based on the fact that they may, as the gentleman from Virginia cited, receive confidential information as a result of their being investors? Ms. Sahani. Thank you so much for the question, Chair Issa. I think that one clarification I'd like to make regarding the role of investors-- Mr. Issa. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm going to cut you off because we're very short on time here. They've called a vote. Ms. Sahani. Sure. Mr. Issa. The only question is, is there a risk? I'm assuming that your answer is there's a risk that should be considered for mitigation, not do most investors do not participate in that way. There is a risk. Is that correct? Ms. Sahani. There is a risk if the investors are receiving confidential information, which most are not. Mr. Issa. OK. Mr. Kochan, briefly, you've researched a lot of this. Is it true in most cases investors want to know about the case they've invested in and that that is typically shared. Mr. Kochan. (a) It certainly can be. (b) The judge has no ability to even know whether or not they should be issuing a protective order that even can cabin that disclosure outside of the parties themselves if they don't know what kind of financing arrangement is there in the first place. Mr. Issa. You don't know what you don't know. The gentleman from Maryland. We do have a vote, but hopefully we can get it done. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just to followup on that point, if a protective order is put in place by the lawyers on both sides, wouldn't it normally restrict the distribution of the information to a very tight circle on the plaintiff's sides, like counsel, maybe some of the experts, but certainly not arm's length investors, right? Mr. Kochan. Well, part--I assume that was to me? Mr. Ivey. Yes. Well, to whoever. Mr. Kochan. So, part of the problem is that if you don't have mandatory disclosure at the outset, then the judge does not have enough information to know whether or not to issue any kind of protective order. Mr. Ivey. Not the judge, but the agreement between the parties as part of the discovery process. Mr. Kochan. The opponent doesn't. I'm sorry. I cut you off. Mr. Ivey. The agreement among the parties is part of the discovery. My understanding is that when the lawyers enter into this litigation, they start off with protective orders that don't even necessarily include the judge unless some kind of enforcement is required. Isn't that right? Mr. Kochan. So, the opponent does not necessarily know and, in fact, oftentimes doesn't. They also don't have a right to an accurate answer from the plaintiff. So, if the opponent asks the plaintiff's counsel, the plaintiff's counsel is not required to disclose to the Defense Counsel the existence of the third-party financing. So, you don't know how to protect yourself if you don't know the environment in which you're-- Mr. Ivey. If you had an agreement that said--you could draft an agreement that excluded third parties who are not party to the litigation. Even within the entity that's on the plaintiff's team, you could restrict who gets access to the information, right? That happens all the time, doesn't it? Mr. Kochan. I don't think you could tailor that without knowing enough about what the agreement is and the contract is with the other side. Mr. Ivey. Well, I've got to cut you off, because I think that's routine, actually, in litigation, to limit those sorts of disclosures using protective orders. Let me ask this, because I do share the concern about the essentially economic espionage if international information gets to China that could be used in this inappropriate way, assuming there's no protective orders put in place that would limit a disclosure, but just for that purpose. Let me ask you this, because it sounds like what you're saying is that notice might not be enough. In other words, so let's say your scenario, you've got Chinese shell companies that are third party investing in a plaintiff, and then disclosure is made. I don't know that would necessarily derail the litigation. We had the case in Delaware--I think there's two--where they dropped it rather than disclose. Isn't it possible that the litigation could continue anyway after the disclosure is made? Mr. Kochan. It certainly could continue if no other regulation were in place. Mr. Ivey. OK. So, wouldn't you--I'm not trying to put words in your mouth--but wouldn't a ban on that make sense? If we're saying that we don't want information--well, I don't know, let's say it's Apple or some key information from Microsoft--we're saying we don't want the CCP to get this information through litigation, right? Why would notice be enough? Don't we want to try and find ways to actually restrict the disclosure of that information to those parties? Mr. Kochan. I don't follow. Restrict what disclosure to which parties? Mr. Ivey. The confidential information you're worried about. Mr. Kochan. If something is needed beyond disclosure, I suppose that's something to consider. The one thing that we know from the existence of the disclosure requirements, you mentioned cases have been dropped. We see at least some evidence that the overall caseload in Delaware has gone down as a result of this disclosure as well. So, we will be able to deter a lot of this behavior because people just don't want sunshine on this. To the extent that it does provide information, there's different audiences for that disclosure, which means that if you've got the disclosure, then policymakers like yourself or State legislatures could use that information to decide what the next step would be. Right now, there's not any information to actually make even some of the generalizations that have been made today about what this environment looks like because we just can't see it. So that-- Mr. Ivey. All right. Mr. Kochan. Those generalizations are dangerous on any side without knowing more about what's behind the curtain. Mr. Ivey. Fair enough. I mean--OK. I'll leave it there for that issue. My experience with third-party funding was that they weren't just putting up the money. Maybe China does that because they don't care about losing the money, but entities that are actually trying to demonstrate a return or make a profit off it as an investment are very careful about it. I think that's consistent with the five-percent number that Ms. Ross mentioned. My experience was that many of them wouldn't even--they didn't want to talk to you until after you had gotten past the motion to dismiss or some other big landmark in the litigation so they were sure that they had a reasonable chance of getting a return on their funds. Is that something you all have looked at or how--what sort of limits--how often are companies willing to just come in up front and fully fund or provide large amounts of funding? I guess, Professor Sahani, maybe I'll ask you about that. Ms. Sahani. Thank you for the question, Mr. Ivey. Funders can come in at any point in a case. So, there's pre-filing third-party funding. There's also post-filing, as you just mentioned, after the motion to dismiss or after they've survived a motion for summary judgment, for example. There's also post-case filing, which basically means there's an award or judgment and a party thinks it might be challenging to enforce, so they may sell the right to receive the proceeds to a funder who would then-- Mr. Issa. The gentleman's time has expired, so he did have a question that I think you're not quite getting to, which was, how often? Ms. Sahani. I do not have that information in terms of the statistics. We would-- Mr. Issa. OK. The gentleman I believe has an unanimous consent he'd like to ask for now. Mr. Ivey. I do? Mr. Issa. You do. Mr. Ivey. I would like to yield back to the Chair. Mr. Issa. Yield back? Mr. Ivey. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter by the Council for Innovation Promotion. A letter by inventor Chris Jones. A letter by the International Legal Finance Association. Mr. Issa. Without objection. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. I now would ask unanimous consent to place in the record a statement in support of third-party litigation reform funding and disclosure by the American Property Casualty Insurance Association; another one, a letter from Jonathan Stroud at Unified Patents; an article by former Chair McKeon, former Chair of the Armed Services Committee; a letter from Sysco Systems, the previously named defendant who made great discoveries--or plaintiff, I guess it was; a study by the Center for Climate Integrity; a statement from the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies; a letter by the Institute of Legal Reform; a statement of support by US MADE; an article by Patrick Tiberi, former Member of Congress; and, tenth and last, a letter from 14 State Aattorney Generals regarding third-party litigation funding by foreign adversaries. Without objection, all will be placed in the record. I'm going to be brief, because I'm going to miss the first vote at this point most likely. This has been good, but it hasn't been sufficient for many reasons, and one of them is we haven't had enough time. So, I would ask all of you if you would take additional questions. I'm going to ask that it goes on through the next week break, so you might get them as much as 10 or 12 days from now, which is an exception to the normal policy, but I believe we need that. There were Members who weren't able to get there. I'm going to close by asking a couple of narrow questions. Ms. Sahani, you've been very helpful, not necessarily in agreement, but very helpful. We never talked about in camera review by judges. Would you support, notwithstanding all of the legislation we might propose, that, in fact, the right of a defendant who suspects that, in fact, a third-party investor--for example, outside the United States, and even somebody who could be very threatening may exist--that at least the judge should be able to have in camera review of that with no further harm done? As a practitioner, each of you, would you say that this is one of those things that's a no-brainer to say yes? Ms. Sahani. Thank you for the question, Chair Issa. Yes, I would agree with in camera review by the judge. Mr. Issa. OK. Then, obviously, a judge's decision about whether that goes further is often the case after in camera review. Mr. Kochan? Mr. Kochan. Yes. Because the judge, to fulfill its duties, must determine who is in control, for example, of settlement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They need to do proportionality review under the Rules of Civil Procedure. They need to assure themselves of their own nonethical--nonconflicts for ethical purposes. There are all kinds of reasons why the judge at the very least should have this information. Mr. Issa. Mr. Taylor? Mr. Taylor. Yes, because the judge has to know the parameters of the legal ethical obligations of the lawyers. That includes zealous advocacy, no conflicts, and providing competent representation. The judge has to be aware of any limits on that imposed by a funding contract. Mr. Issa. Chair? Mr. Goodlatte. For all the reasons cited by my distinguished colleagues, yes. Mr. Issa. So as we get to a recognition, I think at the close that there are potential national security implications, including the 14 Attorneys Generasl who were placed in the record, as we recognize that, notwithstanding what often happens in the case of Sysco and others, there can be conflicts which need to be understood to be fleshed out for the possibility of a settlement, and because judges, in fact, cannot make decisions if they have no information. For all those reasons, it is fair to say, I believe, that we've agreed that, in fact, more transparency at a base level needs to be there. Now the question is, can we get to a level low enough for the gentlelady and high enough for some of the other Members of the panel? That is a challenge for Members on both sides of this dais. As you could see, we're a way off. This a bipartisan Subcommittee. We have worked well so far. Mr. Chair, when you did some of this work at the Full Committee, you pulled an entire and very diverse Committee together. So, I want to thank all of you for your comments. We will followup with questions. I intend to be producing some draft legislation in the next 10 days, which I will be happy to send to you. It is a discussion draft, but I want to make sure that we begin to talk about the parameters of what can be done. My goal, obviously, in this Congress is to get it done on a bipartisan basis. So, I thank all of you. For now, we stand adjourned.  All materials submitted for the record by Members of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet can be found at: https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent .aspx?EventID=117421.
