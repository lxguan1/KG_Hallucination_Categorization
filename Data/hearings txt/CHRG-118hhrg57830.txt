REVISITING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FACE ACT: PART II ---------- Wednesday, December 18, 2024 House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government Committee on the Judiciary Washington, DC The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:37 p.m., in Room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Hon. Chip Roy  presiding. Members present: Representatives Roy, Jordan, McClintock, Bishop, Kiley, Hageman, Hunt, Scanlon, Nadler, Escobar, and Balint. Also present: Representatives Biggs and Lee Carter of Texas. Mr. Roy. The Subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. We welcome everyone to today's hearing on revisiting the implications of the FACE Act. Without objection, Ms. Lee Carter and Mr. Biggs from Arizona will be permitted to participate in today's hearing for the purpose of questioning the witness if a member yields her time for that purpose. I would just like to add that I would welcome Ms. Lee Carter. We remember your mother's participation and contributions to this Subcommittee, and we look forward to having you participate here today. I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. The reason that statues of Lady Justice show her wearing a blindfold is because it is not supposed to matter who is being judged, what they believe, or who they voted for. The rule-of- law demands an equal application of the law without fear or favor. That is why we are here today. The FACE Act is a Federal law originally designed to equally protect access to abortion clinics, pregnancy resource centers, and places of worship by prohibiting threats of force, destruction, and property damage. Unfortunately, over the past four years, the Biden-Harris Administration has weaponized this act, disproportionately targeting prolife Americans for FACE Act violations while simultaneously failing to protect pregnancy resource facilities despite being the target of growing violence. On May 2, 2022, a draft copy of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs was leaked to the press and gave rise to widespread attacks on nearly 100 prolife facilities and 300 Catholic churches, which were vandalized, damaged, and even firebombed. Only in the aftermath of the leak did the DOJ begin to more aggressively pursue FACE charges, yet these prosecutions did not address these significant increases in violence, but rather the largely peaceful prolife demonstrations at abortion clinics. Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration until May 2024, the DOJ had brought a total of 24 FACE Act cases against 55 defendants, with only two of these cases concerning attacks on pregnancy resource centers. To this day, the FACE Act has never been used in defense of a church since it was passed in 1994. When the DOJ does prosecute pro-abortion activists, the vigor with which they pursue and penalize these individuals pales in comparison to the penalties faced by prolife advocates. Take, for example, one of our witnesses here today, Paul Vaughn, who was prosecuted for praying outside of an abortion clinic. Vaughn was arrested when an FBI SWAT team raided his home at gunpoint early in the morning in front of his wife and 11 children, later sentencing him to six months of home confinement and three years of probation. Another FACE Act defendant, Lauren Handy, was sentenced to 57 months in prison for her role in protesting late-term abortion within our Nation's capital. I would note this happens to be an individual that I don't always align with philosophically. In another grotesque prosecution, the weaponized Biden- Harris Justice Department recently sentenced a 75-year-old grandmother, Paulette Harlow, to a 24-month Federal prison sentence. Again, in the case of Eva Edl, an 89-year-old--I repeat, 89-year-old--death camp survivor who is awaiting Federal sentencing for her peaceful advocacy for praying for the unborn at abortion clinics, where prison time could be a potential death sentence given her age. She is a survivor, a survivor of concentration camps and abuse in Europe. Still, you don't see the weaponized Biden-Harris Justice Department pursuing antilife activists who vandalize prolife clinics with the same vigor. One day, after the Dobbs leak, a pregnancy resource center near the University of Texas campus was vandalized with pro-abortion slogans. Banners were torn down, and memorial bricks were dug up from the sidewalk, all while activists chanted, ``My body, my choice.'' No arrests were made. Similarly, a pregnancy resource center in Houston was vandalized with, ``Abortion for All'' written on the front of the clinic locks, gluing the entrance shut, causing $10,000 in damage. No arrests were made. It doesn't stop with the FACE Act, either. This law is just one tool that the Biden-Harris DOJ has issued in its years-long crusade against political dissenters. The DOJ Civil Rights Division has chosen to undermine election integrity laws, suing States like Virginia for taking steps to ensure election integrity. The DOJ targeted Eithan Haim after he revealed that his employer, the Texas Children's Hospital, is performing illegal trans-gender medical interventions on minors. The DOJ Civil Rights Division opened pattern-or-practice investigation into local police departments in search of patterns of misconduct during the height of the defund the police movement. They advised colleges on how to get around SCOTUS's ruling on affirmative action, ensuring race remains a key factor for admissions. The Biden-Harris DOJ would rather focus its time and resources on these efforts as well as going after prolife grandmothers, sentencing them to years of Federal prison for, at best, a trespassing charge instead of targeting actual criminals. The Civil Rights Division has been used as a tool against the civil rights of the American people, undermining their freedom and liberties. While we expect the incoming administration to end this horrific practice at the DOJ, that is not good enough. The American people deserve to know that their rights will not be violated, regardless of which administration is in power. It has been long time for Congress to address this weaponization legislatively. The Republican Congress must start to ensure that future weaponization is not possible by passing the legislation H.R. 5577 to repeal the FACE Act. It is not enough to merely end Biden-era discrimination. We must act to reverse these wrongful imprisonments, reuniting families who have been collateral damage to this administration. The Trump Administration should consider pardoning and commuting the sentences of FACE Act defendants who have been victims of this targeted harassment. Unequal application of the law is not truly law; it is tyranny imposed on those who didn't have the power by those who do have it. That is contrary to everything we believe as Americans. I thank our witnesses, some of whom know these abuses all too well, for being here today to address the need for fundamental and permanent reforms at the Department of Justice. I now yield to the Ranking Member for her opening statement. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you to our witnesses for joining us. We are here today, according to this hearing's title, ``Revisiting the Implications of the FACE Act: Part II.'' Part I occurred in May 2023, under the Chairship of now Speaker Johnson. During the intervening year and a half, things really haven't changed that much. We continue to see heightened political violence concerning reproductive rights, particularly by right-wing extremists. We continue to see the House GOP's efforts to claim disproportionate enforcement under the FACE Act, all while ignoring the disproportionately greater number of attacks against reproductive healthcare facilities that provide abortion care. We continue to see our GOP colleagues ignoring facts and pushing a false narrative of selective enforcement to form a pretext for the repeal of the FACE Act. What has become clear in the intervening months is that this attack on the FACE Act is part of a coordinated extreme antichoice agenda that seeks to gut reproductive rights and effectively ban abortion care in the United States. That agenda is outlined in the extremist conservative manifesto called Project 2025, which was rolled out just weeks before Part I of this hearing. Unless our Republican colleagues once again deny any connection between Project 2025 and their actions, we should note that both parts of this hearing have parroted false narrative of Project 2025, claiming selective enforcement against anti-abortion advocates on page--I believe it's 568 of Project 2025. Each of today's majority witnesses have close ties to Project 2025. Ms. Hawley is an anti-abortion lawyer and Senior Counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, the ADF, which is a Project 2025 Advisory Board member. Mr. Vaughn's arrest under the FACE Act for blockading a reproductive healthcare facility, for which he was convicted by a jury, is cited--I am sorry. It was on page 558 of Project 2025. I do have to correct the Chair's statement that Mr. Vaughn was arrested for praying at that facility. In fact, the record is quite clear. His arrest was for blockading the facility, not praying. Mr. Crampton, of course, was Mr. Vaughn's attorney in that case. So, they all have close ties to this manifesto. So, in revisiting the FACE Act today, our Republican colleagues are really just giving themselves another opportunity to signal their support to the extremists plotting to criminalize or block access to abortion across the country. The only thing that has changed since the first iteration of this hearing is public awareness of the deeply unpopular plans outlined in Project 2025. Over the past year and a half, House Republicans have attempted to cloak their unpopular agenda with misleading claims that their policies will support women, children, and civil rights. Those claims have repeatedly turned up empty because the truth is every step we take toward a nationwide abortion ban drastically undermines the health and well-being of American women and children, and furthermore, it violates women's rights to make their own personal medical decisions without politicians invading their doctors' offices and their private business. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act, protects facilities providing access to abortion and other reproductive health services as well as places of religious worship--protects them from the use of force, threats, intimidation, or physical obstruction. The record from the Subcommittee's hearing on this topic in May of last year is clear. There is no credible evidence to support Republican allegations that the FACE Act is being selectively enforced. Even so, if our colleagues were actually concerned about that, you would assume they would be calling for stronger and broader enforcement of the FACE Act. Instead, our Subcommittee Chair and 47 other House Republicans have introduced legislation to repeal the FACE Act. Actions speak louder than words, and with that action, the motivation here is very clear. In repealing the FACE Act, they would invite every anti-abortion extremist to use violence, threats, intimidation to block access to abortion services everywhere, even in States where it is legal, a nationwide ban in practice if not in law. Congress passed the FACE Act in 1994 in response to two decades of escalating violence, intimidation, and blockades against abortion providers and their patients. The need for this protection was extremely clear, as the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Labor and Human Resources Community detailed numerous incidents in their respective Committee reports of abortion providers being subjected to horrifying threats, including murder. Dr. David Gunn was murdered by an anti-abortion extremist outside a clinic in Pensacola, Florida, in March 1993. The House report on the FACE Act noted that Dr. Gunn's murder was the tragic culmination of years of threats, blockades, and personal attacks. In addition to threats against providers, both Committees detailed incidents where abortion clinics were the targets of arson, bombings, chemical attacks, and blockades by anti- abortion extremists that resulted in sometimes severe injuries for doctors, clinic workers, volunteers, patients, and others. Today, the FACE Act remains an important deterrent to political violence regarding reproductive healthcare. Since January 2021, the Department of Justice has brought 25 FACE Act cases involving 57 defendants, and yes, those cases have involved both abortion providers and anti-abortion facilities. Of course, we must condemn all political violence and threats of violence, whatever the beliefs or motivations of those who engage in it and regardless of who the target may be. It remains that abortion providers and their patients are actually the ones who face higher levels of violence. To the extent there is a disparity in FACE Act prosecution, that disparity is a reflection of the facts. A 2022 report from the National Abortion Federation, which we introduced into the record in Part I of this hearing, confirmed that anti-abortion violence is escalating in the wake of the Dobbs decision. That report detailed that there was a 100 percent increase in arsons and a 20 percent increase in threats of death and harm against clinics and providers as compared to 2021. There was also a 229 percent increase in stalking from 2021-2022, indicating an increase of reports of providers and patients being followed as they entered, exited, traveled to or traveled from clinics. Moreover, that report noted that after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs, clinics in States where abortion remains legal saw a disproportionate increase in violence and destruction. This escalating violence is part of an anti- abortion extremist campaign to achieve by extralegal means what they have been politically unable to do since Dobbs, which is to enact a nationwide abortion ban. This decades-long effort, which the FACE Act has helped to de-escalate, involves intimidating doctors and providers from delivering necessary and often life-saving reproductive care and denying access to healthcare facilities where women can exercise the freedom to make decisions impacting their own health and their family's well-being because, as a leader of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue said when asked during the FACE Act passage, if there is no one willing to conduct abortions, there are no abortions. Republican lawmakers are now trying to turn the FACE Act into yet another rallying cry in their cultural war against abortion, blatantly politicizing a law that is about protecting Americans and keeping them safe. In doing so, they knowingly enable dangerous and hostile rhetoric that threatens women's access to reproductive healthcare all across this country. Ultimately, that makes them complicit in the consequences of those actions. No one deserves to be denied medical care because of someone else's political or religious beliefs. Everyone deserves the freedom to provide or seek appropriate medical care without threats to their own safety, and all women deserve the freedom to work with their doctors to decide on and access the healthcare that is right for them. That is the America that my Democratic colleagues and I are fighting for because that is the America our constituents deserve. I yield back. Mr. Roy. I thank the Ranking Member. I would note that at least one thing that has changed since 2023, as the Ranking Member referenced saying nothing had changed, we sent a letter to the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice responded to the letter, and I ask that we consent that we insert that in the record. Without objection, we will put it in the record. That confirms the numbers that I cited in the opening statement, that there have been 24 FACE Act cases against 55 defendants obtaining 34 convictions, and of which only two were directed, as they say here, toward nonprolife--directed toward something that isn't attacking prolifers. With that, I would ask the Chair if he would like to offer up any statement. Chair Jordan. I thank the Chair. Yes, only two. What we forgot and what the Ranking Member didn't mention is, in the aftermath of the Dobbs leak and the Dobbs decision, that Spring and Summer, 103 churches and crisis pregnancy centers were attacked. She used the term ``extremist'' for the prolife people. Look. We are against all violence. I agree with that statement. That was not in any way an accurate picture of what took place in that Summer and, frankly, the disparity in who is prosecuted under the FACE Act. Here is the bottom line. Government has been weaponized against ``We the People.'' September 23, 2022, Mark Houck at home in Pennsylvania--ten unmarked cars pull up to his house at 6:30 a.m., and arrest him in front of his wife and seven kids. What did they arrest him for? Praying in front of an abortion clinic and protecting his son from some crazy person screaming swear words in his child's face. In fact, he was prosecuted, went to court, and the jury of his peers found him not guilty. Twelve days after he is arrested, our witness, Mr. Vaughn, at home in Pennsylvania--arrested in front of his wife and 11 children. What was he doing? Exactly what the Chair said: ``Praying and singing hymns outside of an abortion clinic.'' Just came and got him. On March 5, 2024, in Mr. Bigg's State, Penny McCarthy, 66- year-old grandmother in her driveway--U.S. Marshals pull up, guns drawn, and arrest her. They said she violated parole, a parole violation for a nonviolent offense from 25 years earlier. They show up with guns drawn and arrest this lady. She said, ``I think you got the wrong person.'' Guess what: She was right. They had the wrong person. Of course, we had a hearing on this right here in this room. Bryan Malinowski. Bryan Malinowski--the top official, highest paid official in the municipal government in Little Rock, Arkansas, gun hobbyist. Sold six guns, and the ATF said, ``You're a felon because you sold six guns without a license.'' They show up. Again, ten cars show up at 6:01 a.m. First thing you see--because we got the video. The first thing they do is walk up and put tape on the doorbell cam. Fifty-three seconds after they put tape on the doorbell cam, Bryan Malinowski is shot and later dies. They weren't even-- this wasn't even an arrest warrant. This was a search warrant. They have been surveilling this guy for two weeks. They were going to go the week before, but found out he wasn't home, so they waited for him to be home to--you can't make any sense of what they did. Government has certainly been weaponized against ``We the People.'' Of course, last week--what did we find out last week? Two Inspector General reports came out last week. The first one said when Chris Wray first started at the FBI, they spied on Capitol Hill staffers. Here's the amazing thing: One of the guys they spied on is the guy who's going to replace Chris Wray. They spied on Kash Patel, got the email. Who are you emailing to? Emails coming in to you, phone calls--did that to--and it was Democrats, too. Democrats should be just as outraged. They were spying on Republican and Democrat staffers. Of course, the second report that came out last week from the Inspector General--we find out that there were 26 confidential human sources here in the Capitol, at the Capitol. Well, some of them came into the Capitol, 26 of them on January 6th. Seventeen went into the restricted area. Four went into the Capitol. Zero were arrested. Remember, confidential human source is a fancy name for spy--spying on Americans that day. We also know they spied on parents, right? Spied on moms and dads going to school board meetings. We know. They have to set up a snitch line. You could report on parents. One of the FBI whistleblowers came and testified in front of this Committee--this Congress told us he was sent to go get license plates from parents in the parking lot when they're at a school board meeting. Our government is doing that. Of course, all this makes me wonder, are they spying? Might they be spying on prolife activists, other Americans who are concerned about the sanctity of human life? Might they be doing that? Well, guess what: They tried that, too. They tried that, too, because we got the memorandum from the Richmond Field Office earlier this Congress. On page 4 of this memo says, We now have new opportunities to mitigate violent extremism threat through outreach to traditional Catholic parishes and the development of sources with the placement and access to report on places of worship. Now, that is fancy FBI-speak for, ``We are going to put spies in the parish, spies in the church in America.'' All this stuff happened. So, thank the good Lord we had a change in this administration back on November 5th. I want to thank the Chair for his tireless work on advocating for the sanctity of life and looking at this law. I want to thank Ms. Hawley, Mr. Vaughn for what you have been through, both of you for coming and testifying, Mr. Crampton for your good work at the Thomas More Society, and for being with us today. Protecting the sanctity of life is critically important, and just as important is the First Amendment, your right to speak, your right to pray, all the rights we enjoy under the First Amendment. That is why this Committee, which is charged with protecting the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and those important freedoms we have as Americans, is so darn important. I thank the Chair for all his good work and yield back. Mr. Roy. I thank the Chair. Now, with that, I would recognize the Ranking Member of the Full Committee, Mr. Nadler, for his opening statement. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, since the last time this Subcommittee held a hearing on the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or the FACE Act, over a year ago, Judiciary Republicans have found no, zero, credible direct evidence that supports their speeches' claims regarding what they allege is the Department of Justice's uneven enforcement of the FACE Act. What has changed since then is that the Subcommittee Chair, along with 47 of his fellow House Republicans, have once again said the quiet part aloud. They have introduced a bill to repeal the FACE Act altogether. That is right. Anti-abortion extremists continue to use violence, threats, and destruction to curb access to abortion, so Republicans want to repeal the law that explicitly protects patients, providers, and facilities that provide reproductive health services from these ongoing threats. Republicans claim that prosecutors are selectively targeting anti-abortion protesters under the FACE Act and declining to prosecute threats against anti-abortion facilities. There is zero evidence for their claims. On the contrary, it appears that DOJ is enforcing the law without regard to defendants' viewpoints. I fear, however, that once Republicans complete their takeover of the Federal Government next year, they will use these sham allegations as a pretext to put a bill revoking the FACE Act's important Federal protections on President Trump's desk. This would represent a dangerous and unacceptable attack on public safety. The FACE Act was enacted because of a long-documented history of violence specifically directed against abortion providers, their staff, and their patients. The American people need strong enforcement of the law even more now in the wake of continued and escalating violence, threats, and intimidation against women and their doctors post-Dobbs. According to the most recent report issued by the National Abortion Federation, anti-abortion extremists have intensified their efforts to block access to abortion facilities in those States that protect the right to obtain an abortion. Even by their own terms, FACE Act repeal is a nonsensical course of action. If House Republicans' supposed concern is uneven enforcement of the FACE Act, why wouldn't they simply call for the incoming Trump Administration to prioritize cases involving protection of anti-abortion facilities, which are explicitly protected under the FACE Act? Instead, the Chair and his Republican colleagues have come up with a new, equally farcical pretext for attacking the FACE Act: They believe that it is unconstitutional and should be eliminated altogether. While the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the constitutionality of the act, that is because, as far as I can tell, every Federal Circuit Court of Appeals that has considered the issue has upheld the FACE Act against challenges that the law violates the First Amendment's free speech guarantees or exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. House Republicans' manufactured narrative about the FACE Act, however, makes perfect sense if one recognizes that their ultimate goal is to ban abortion nationwide. House Republicans clearly feel more beholden than ever to the special interests of anti-abortion activists over the will of the American people, a majority of whom reject their extreme anti-abortion agenda. As we stand on the eve of the next Trump Administration, today's hearing, the last of the Judiciary Committee in the 118th Congress, can only be interpreted as a message from House Republicans to these extreme anti-abortion activists. That message is, ``Sit tight,'' because Republicans will use the 119th Congress to lay yet another brick in the groundwork for the Trump Administration's plans to use complete Republican control of the Federal Government to block women from obtaining the reproductive health-care they need, all while inching toward enacting a total nationwide ban on abortion. The House Democrats will not stay silent in the face of this onslaught. We will do everything within our power to protect the right to an abortion and to resist Republican efforts to enact a nationwide abortion ban. I yield back. Mr. Roy. Without objection, all their opening statements will be included in the record. We will now introduce today's witnesses. Mr. Paul Vaughn-- Mr. Vaughn is a prolife advocate and the President of Personhood Tennessee, an organization dedicated to the advancement of the recognition and protection of life from conception to natural death. He was prosecuted under the FACE Act by the Biden's Department of Justice for praying and singing hymns outside an abortion clinic. Ms. Erin Hawley--Ms. Hawley serves as Senior Counsel and Vice President of the Center for Life and Regulatory Practice at the Alliance Defending Freedom. Prior to joining ADF, she specialized in appellate law in private practice and has litigated extensively before various Federal Appellate Courts and the U.S. Supreme Court. She also previously served as an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Missouri, where she taught constitutional law, Federal income tax, and other courses. Mr. Steve Crampton--Mr. Crampton is a Senior Counsel at the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit public interest law firm that focuses on cases involving individual liberty. He has more than 30 years of experience litigating religious liberties cases in both the civil and criminal justice systems. Professor Jessica Waters--Ms. Waters is an Assistant Professor of Justice, Law, and Criminology at the American University. She also serves as the Director of the American University School of Public Affairs Leadership Program. Her research focuses on higher education leadership, student success, and reproductive rights law and policy. We thank our witnesses for appearing today, and we will begin by swearing you in. Would you please rise and raise your right hand? Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief, so help you God? Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. Please be seated. Please note that your written testimony will be entered into the record in its entirety. Accordingly, we ask you to summarize your testimony in five minutes. Mr. Vaughn, you may begin. I would remind everybody to turn your microphones on before you speak. STATEMENT OF PAUL VAUGHN Mr. Vaughn. Chair Roy, Ranking Member Scanlon, and the honorable Members of this Committee, thank you for entertaining this important discussion today and allowing me to share our story with you. I'd like to speak to you about the DOJ's Project 2022. It happened October 5th at 7 a.m. in the morning, when my house was assaulted, my wife and children were terrorized, and I was kidnapped at gunpoint by four armed men. I had just sent three of my children to the car so I could take them to school when the house began to shake from a loud banging near the front door. I heard men shouting on my porch, ``Open up. FBI.'' The banging continued. As I looked out a side window to check the location of my children, I saw two unmarked SUVs with lights flashing but I did not see my children. The banging continued and I heard more shouting. I opened the curtains on the front door to find three men with guns trained on the door. I asked who they were looking for and they replied, ``We're here for you.'' They did not identify me or provide identification for themselves. As I believed there was an imminent threat to the safety of my wife and seven children who were home that day, I determined to surrender myself to them, hoping that they were legitimate law enforcement. I opened the door and stepped out onto the porch, staring down the barrels of both a pistol and an automatic weapon pointed at my head. As I did, I asked what authority they were operating under and if they had any identification. I later learned at the same time three of my children, ages 12, 14, and 18, were being detained in the side yard on the edge of the woods by a fourth armed man. I was taken without the presentation of a warrant or identification when requested. Make no mistake, this was an armed conflict, and I was unarmed. Lethal force was abused and to abridge my God-given and constitutionally secured rights. At the moment of being placed in handcuffs I became a slave to ideological tyrants, either the ones holding the weapons or the ones they obeyed. The event that brought this ill-fated drama to my front door took place 18 months prior, as been noted. Prolife Christians gathered at carafem abortion clinics in Mount Juliet to attempt to save unborn children that were scheduled to die that morning. Out of the couple hundred people who attended that day eight adults were, in fact, arrested for nonviolently sitting at abortion clinic doors for doing a sit-in like many of you have seen right here in your own buildings by Antifa, BLM, and Hamas. I wonder how many of those have faced 10 years of prison for those activities. The fact remains that I did not do any of these things. I did nothing that was outside constitutionally protected free speech and religious freedom. I did nothing that day that I've not done many times since FACE was passed in 1994. I did not sit in. I broke no laws, Federal or local, and I was not arrested the day of the event. Yes, Member Scanlon, I did pray that day. I had talked with the police chief and lead negotiating team. I helped the police and the prolifers by messaging back and forth. The police spokesperson complimented us on the peacefulness nature of the event on the evening news. The lead negotiator testified for us in our Federal trial. There's a lot of talk about violence around the issue of abortion. Of course, all people of honor and character denounce acts of violence on either side of this issue. The narrative has been projected against the prolife people and fails to take into account at least three other aspects of violence around this issue. There is violence committed against every unborn child in every abortion. There's violence committed by aggravated fathers or other family members of aborted children and there's violence being done to prolifers by our own government. Any serious conversation about violence, going forward, needs to include these three facts. The FACE Act was ostensibly passed because of violence. As my family knows very well, all it did was give violence the cover of law and place it in the hands of the government. The phrase ``the process is the punishment,'' and the weapon- ization of the FACE Act are not just words in our household. We are living the reality of those words. Since my arrest, I've been restricted to the Middle District of Tennessee for over two years under control and supervision of the Federal Government. My family spent 20 months of having a potential decade in prison hanging over their lead provider's head--my head. We endured long, stressful days of the actual trial, enduring lies and half-truths for the sake of government winning a case with no regard to actually seeking justice. The process has entailed government agents invading and inspecting our home, calling my home to make sure I'm obeying the rules. It involved giving up my rights as a U.S. citizen in spite of the novel use of the 1,800 conspiracy laws. The Appeal Court refused to stay the order pending the appeal to find out if this was a legal right--application of the law. All this process is a punishment, and I was the one that did not get jail time. There are those who are in jail today while we are discussing this abuse, some of them for over a year at this point. With the overturning of Roe and the long train of abuses of the unequal application of the FACE Act there is no legitimate reason for it to remain on the books. It is a tool whose sole purpose is to stifle free speech and abuse the rights of Christian conservatives. There is nothing that the FACE Act does that is not already accomplished by State laws across the land. If abortion is returned to the States, so should the laws governing it.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Roy. Thank you, Mr. Vaughn. Ms. Hawley, you may give your testimony. STATEMENT OF ERIN M. HAWLEY Ms. Hawley. Good afternoon. Thank you, Chair Roy, Ranking Member Scanlon, and the Members of the Committee. One of the most enduring and crucial features of the American constitutional design is its commitment to the equal application of law. John Adams famously described the republic as a government of laws, not of men, meaning that in America the rule-of-law comes before politics. Yet, the Biden Administration has broken this promise. It has consistently put politics above the rule-of-law in its one-sided application of the FACE Act to target prolife individuals. The text of the FACE Act is clear. Its protections apply to, quote, ``reproductive health services,'' which is broadly defined to include not only abortion facilities, but also pregnancy centers. The FACE Act also protects churches and other houses of worship from violence, vandalism, and intimidation. Instead of applying the FACE Act in an even-handed way, the Biden's DOJ has weaponized the act to target prolife advocates. Since 2001, it has brought criminal or civil cases under the FACE Act against 55 individuals, 50 of them prolife. It has charged 24 cases under the FACE Act, but only two in defense of pregnancy centers. Since the Dobbs decision was leaked in May 2022, there have been close to 100 pregnancy care centers that have been vandalized, spray painted, or firebombed. Only eight percent of the Biden DOJ's FACE Act cases have been filed to protect pregnancy centers. Again, just two cases. As for churches, again, expressly protected by the FACE Act, the Family Research Council has identified 436 instances of threats or violence in 2023 alone. Shockingly, the Biden Department of Justice has failed to initiate a single FACE Act prosecution to protect a house of worship. Take just a few examples of the violence confronting prolife organizations. On June 7, 2022, CompassCare's office in Buffalo, New York, was firebombed and tagged with spray paint reading ``Jane was here.'' Three days later on June 10th the Gretchen Pregnancy Resource Center in Oregon was set on fire, and on June 25th Life Choices in Longmont, Colorado, was firebombed and spray painted with the message, ``If abortions aren't safe neither are you.'' Not only has the Biden Justice Department demonstrated bias in its refusal to prosecute violence against prolife organizations, but for the first time in the FACE Act's history the Biden's DOJ has used the FACE hook--excuse me, the FACE Act as a hook to tack on an additional conspiracy against rights felony charge. This charge comes with a potential 10-year prison sentence even for nonviolent civil disobedience, showing how the Biden's DOJ has upped the ante, placing prolife Americans in as much jeopardy as possible. Take Eva Edl, an 89-year-old survivor of a Soviet concentration camp, who sat in front of the entrance to an abortion clinic in a wheelchair. Because the Biden's DOJ tacked on a conspiracy charge, Eva could face a sentence up to 11 years in Federal prison along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Federal fines, all for singing and praying from her wheelchair. The Biden DOJ's one-sided use of the FACE Act raises serious concerns about viewpoint-based selective enforcement. While the Executive Branch does have discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case, it cannot selectively enforce the law in a way that violates the Constitution. As the Federal Courts have said, ``this is antithetical to a free society.'' The Biden's DOJ has consistently declined to enforce the FACE Act against individuals attacking pregnancy centers and churches while vigorously enforcing it against prolife advocates. That's the definition of selective enforcement. To make matters worse, the FACE Act is a questionable exercise of Congress' commerce clause authority. The Federal Government is one of limited enumerated powers. Thus, in United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down two criminal statutes because they had nothing to do with commerce. These cases rejected the argument that Congress may regulate crime so long as it has an aggregate effect on economic activity. That would obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local. To be clear, there is never any excuse for violence in expressing one's viewpoint. Repealing the FACE Act would not mean that criminal conduct could occur with impunity or without legal consequence. Every State has laws that regulate trespass, assault, disorderly conduct, unlawful assembly, and the like. In summary, the FACE Act has been weaponized to target prolife activity while leaving pregnancy centers and churches, largely, unprotected. This is not the even-handed application of the law the American people deserve.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Roy. Thank you, Ms. Hawley. Mr. Crampton, you may provide your testimony. STATEMENT OF STEPHEN M. CRAMPTON Mr. Crampton. Good afternoon. Mr. Chair, the Ranking Member, and the Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for allowing us the opportunity to testify here today. My name is Steve Crampton. I serve as Senior Counsel for the Thomas More Society, a national nonprofit law firm championing life, family, and freedom. I applaud this Committee for addressing this vital issue-- as the title of this Subcommittee suggests, the Constitution and limited government, both of which are keenly implicated in this issue. FACE should be repealed, as Ms. Hawley just said, first, because it's an unconstitutional law and, second, because it's an unnecessary Federal overreach into a matter traditionally and best left to the States. I also urge this Committee, however, to take action regarding the use and abuse of the Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy Against Rights Statute passed in 1870, which has for the first time in our Nation's history been pressed into service for use against these peaceful FACE protesters. People like Mr. Vaughn and the others, many of whom, as has been mentioned, are already in jail today, face that penalty that goes up from six months for a first offense, nonviolent FACE violation, to 10 years in the Federal penitentiary. This is an outrage, and it should not be permitted. Historically, FACE was always about one thing, abortion. The legislative history, the drafts of the early bill make this quite clear, as does the use and abuse of the FACE Act throughout its 30-year history. Moreover, FACE purports to prohibit intimidation of people on the basis of their views on abortion, whichever side they might take. The weaponized Department of Justice and its Gestapo-like FBI are using FACE itself to intimidate and silence peaceful prolife advocates. It is the government, not the peaceful advocates like Paul Vaughn, who are doing the intimidating here. Furthermore, since the historic Dobbs decision June 2022, reversing Roe there's no longer any pretense of abortion being a Federal right. Because the reason for the law has ceased to exist FACE itself should cease to exist. It should be repealed. Instead of the DOJ lessening its use of the FACE Act after Dobbs, what the Biden Administration has done is increase dramatically, perhaps a hundred fold, its application. Only after Dobbs was decided did they begin rounding up prolifers all around the country for incidents that had occurred years before Dobbs was even decided and they've thrown the proverbial book at them. Many of these peaceful prolifers will spend Christmas next week away from their families behind bars in a Federal penitentiary simply because they peacefully sought to interpose on behalf of helpless babies facing a most horrific and violent dismembering and death by abortion. While those who sought to protect babies in any means now are at risk under this administration regardless of their proximity to an abortion clinic, pro-abortion zealots who fire bomb churches and pregnancy resource centers are left free to carry on their campaign of terror at will even though churches and the PRCs are theoretically protected under FACE, too. Moreover, FACE was carefully crafted from its inception to criminalize only one side of the abortion debate, namely the prolife. This viewpoint bias in FACE is seen all too clearly when contrasting the cases of two of our clients, Mark Houck, who was already mentioned here, and Mark Crosby. This Subcommittee heard from Mark Houck how he was arrested at gunpoint in front of his wife and children. Ended up facing several years in the Federal penitentiary for two violations that were charged to FACE. Thankfully, he won at trial but only after going through the entire process. Contrast that case with that of Mark Crosby, 73-year-old prolife advocate brutally beaten on May 26, 2023, by a pro-abortion zealot outside of Planned Parenthood clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. Although Mr. Crosby offers counseling on so-called reproductive health services, it should otherwise qualify for protection under FACE, guess what? His assailant is free from any FACE prosecution because they carefully defined what constitutes a reproductive health service and the counseling protected thereunder to be connected only to a facility. Because Mr. Crosby is on the sidewalk he had gotten no protection. What we have here is an out-of-control Department of Justice. The rule-of-law mentioned by Ms. Hawley has suffered and it may prove to be a mortal wound. This two-tiered system of justice must end. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Roy. Thank you, Mr. Crampton. Professor Waters, you may offer your testimony. STATEMENT OF JESSICA L. WATERS Ms. Waters. Chair Roy, Ranking Member Scanlon, and the Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. We are here to discuss the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, otherwise known as FACE. The specific provisions of FACE are detailed in my written testimony but, in brief, FACE created criminal penalties and civil remedies against specific types of conduct, not speech. That conduct includes the use of violence or threats of violence directed at people providing or obtaining reproductive health services or seeking to exercise their First Amendment religious rights at houses of worship. It prohibits physically obstructing the entrances to facilities that provide those services and prohibits damaging those facilities, importantly, only if these acts were undertaken to injure, intimidate, or interfere with someone seeking to obtain or provide the before listed services. I want to make three brief points about the impetus for FACE and why Congress found it necessary to implement a Federal remedy. First, as I detailed in my written testimony, there was clear evidence of escalating violence against reproductive health clinics and providers. As was summarized in the House Judiciary report on FACE between 1977-April 1993, so right before FACE was enacted, there were more than 1,000 acts of violence against providers of reproductive health services and the United States and these acts were serious ones. They included 36 bombings, 81 arsons, 131 death threats, 84 assaults, two kidnappings, 327 clinic invasions, one murder, and over 6,000 clinic blockades and other disruptions, and while at the time of FACE passage the documented surge in nationwide interstate violence was against providers and clinics that provided abortion care. Congress wisely made the deliberate decision to protect any reproductive health service facility or reproductive health service provider regardless of whether they provide abortion care. My second point is that FACE was needed because existing State laws and remedies were demonstrably inadequate to provide--to protect providers and patients. The June 1993, the Senate Committee report on FACE made clear findings on this point noting several reasons why State remedies were inadequate. First, the patchwork of State laws made it impossible to address unlawful conduct that spanned across State lines. State penalties were often insignificant, thus not providing a deterrent effect. States weren't resourced to respond to the numerous blockades and were, as the Senate report on FACE stated, quote, ``frequently overwhelmed by the sheer number of blockades,'' and, unfortunately, for some State law enforcement entities and officers were simply unwilling to enforce State laws against people attempting to, in their view, stop abortions. My third point is that there is a constitutional--sound constitutional basis for FACE. Congress relied on both the commerce clause of the Constitution as well as Section 5 of 14th Amendment and developed an extensive record in support of both. In support of commerce clause authority the record showed that reproductive health providers are involved in interstate commerce both directly and indirectly by things like purchasing medical supplies and equipment across State lines, that their patients engage in interstate commerce by traveling from one State to another to obtain services, that clinic employees travel across State lines to work, and that the conduct that FACE addressed directly negatively affects interstate commerce by, for example, forcing clinics to cease operating. Indeed, every U.S. Circuit Court that has considered the issue has found that the FACE Act is a constitutional exercise of Congress' authority under the commerce clause. I note these three points because they hold true today and speak to the need for continued enforcement of FACE. The statistics for 2022 show an increase in major incidents like arson, burglaries, death threats, and clinic invasions. There was also a sharp increase in violence and disruption in States that are protective of abortion rights. It is plain that many of us differ on questions of the legality and morality of abortion. I'm under no illusions about that as I sit here. Where I do hope we do not differ is in our condemnation for vandalism, violence, threats against any reproductive healthcare facility, whether it is a prolife facility, an IVF clinic, or a facility that offers comprehensive ranges of services including abortion. People should be able to seek medical care, and medical professionals should be able to go to work and provide it without fear of assault, invasions, blockades or murder, and this is an issue that warrants a Federal remedy. Thank you.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Bishop.  Thank you, Professor Waters. We will now proceed under the five-minute rule with questions, and I recognize myself for five minutes of questioning. Mr. Crampton, I take it you represent Mr. Vaughn. I've had occasion to look at the Sixth Circuit's Opinion or a panel's Opinion there from November 24th--hang on one second--I guess, an application to stay his sentence and it, of course, went against you, Mr. Vaughn. I find this piece to be very interesting at the heart of what I believe to be the issue here. It says that you presented a study by the Crime Prevention Research Center which identified 135 attacks on prolife churches and pregnancy resource centers compared to only six attacks on abortion clinics since the date of Dobbs and that Mr. Vaughn's argument to the court was that under the FACE Act the Department of Justice has prosecuted only two people under the FACE Act for attacking pregnancy resource centers while prosecuting 26 prolife activists under the same statute. Here's where it gets very interesting, having just read this. It says, but most of the incidents in the CPRC study appear to allege vandalism in potential violation of one subsection of the FACE Act rather than obstruction in violation of another subsection, which is what Vaughn was prosecuted for, and the government could exercise its discretion to prosecute obstruction rather than vandalism without violating the equal protection clause. Now, as I just ran across it--I've been practicing law a long time--well, practiced until I got here--and that may--I guess I get the distinction being drawn. When you consider that vandalism against pregnancy resource centers usually, almost always, itself is conveying a threat of force for people who may subscribe to the services of that clinic there's no distinction whatsoever between those acts and for the Department of Justice to exercise discretion to one and not the other based, apparently, on the ideology of the person engaged in those acts. I can't think of anything that seems to be more of an example of selective prosecution the Constitution would not abide. So, that's a stunning--what about that, Mr. Crampton? Do I have that wrong? Mr. Crampton. I think you have that exactly right, Mr. Congressman. A further distinction is as you suggest, I would argue the vandalism actions are of a more serious nature than a sit-in. Moreover, they were more recent. Mr. Vaughn's actions took place in 2021. Those acts of vandalism took place in 2023-2024. So, it's a very puzzling distinction that the court drew there. Mr. Bishop. To Professor Waters' point, I do not disagree that we don't want people engaged in violence around abortion clinics or pregnancy resource centers. It should be condemned, and it should be punished appropriately. When I see--I just wonder, Professor Waters, when you see these things where SWAT teams are going out to the homes of people because they've engaged in a nonviolent act, which I understand alleged here is a conspiracy to block access for an hour that denied one person--one patient and one employee access it just seems to me troubling that you got guns drawn and pointed at a man's head and his children arrested in the side yard or stopped at the--doesn't that seem we're in an environment where we're always talking about police officers should deescalate in the context of--what justifies that, Professor Waters? Does that disturb you? Ms. Waters. Thank you for the question. So, I will say that as a human listening to Mr. Vaughn speak, it sounds like that was a terrifying day and I'm not going to dispute his experience of that. I do not work for the DOJ. I am not involved in prosecutions-- Mr. Bishop. I'm not trying to make you assign responsibility. I'm just asking for a simple--are there things we can agree on and it seems to me that, and I'll just leave it at this, Professor Waters. It just seems--because I think it's a very simple thing. I don't understand--and we have seen it in so many ways--it is the fundamental part of this weaponization. I was going to yield all my time to Mr. Biggs, but I got carried away. I just don't--the American people see these incidents and they seem to be made for CNN. When people of certain political persuasions or ideas are targeted and the SWAT team goes out and raids them in their homes and it's totally disproportionate. That must stop and I'll guarantee you it is going to stop in the next Administration. I have 15 seconds for you, Mr. Biggs. Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, for that reason I won't even engage in a diatribe or ask questions, but I will ask that the May 5, 1994, the Congressional Record from the House, page 9409, Mr. DeLay's speech about this, the FACE Act passage be admitted into the record. Mr. Bishop. With my apologies and without objection, so ordered, and I now recognize the Ranking Member for five minutes of questions. Mr. Bishop. I beg your pardon. The gentleman is recognized. Oh, I see. Mr. Nadler is recognized. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Vaughn says he wasn't acting violently. He was acting peacefully, quote, ``sitting in an abortion provider's doors,'' in other words, blocking access. In other words, violating the FACE Act, which is the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. He was convicted of a crime by a jury of his peers because of that. He also said, or some other witnesses said, ``abortion laws have been returned to the States and so should enforcement.'' Abortion laws have been returned to the States, but enforcement in those States where abortion is still legal is a Federal responsibility. Professor Waters, has any Federal Court post-Dobbs considered the question of whether the FACE Act is constitutional and if so what did the court hold? Ms. Waters. Thank you for the question. It is important to point out that every Federal Court pre-Dobbs that has considered the constitutionality of the FACE Act, whether it is a First Amendment challenge or a commerce clause challenge has held that the FACE Act is constitutional. To my knowledge, there is one court that post-Dobbs has directly addressed the question of whether the FACE Act is constitutional, and that was actually in Mr. Vaughn's case. So, the District Court, the Federal District Court, in that case, on a motion to dismiss, held very squarely that in accordance with the prior precedent from many circuits, the FACE Act was constitutional and found that it was a valid exercise of Congress' commerce clause authority and also did not pose First Amendment-- Mr. Nadler. Thank you. How would you describe the effect that State abortion bans have had on interstate commerce, such as on transit of persons across State lines? Ms. Waters. It's somewhat ironic when we think about a post-Dobbs world what that has created is more interstate commerce. We know that in 13 States, abortion is almost completely unavailable. We know that this means that a person, a woman who is seeking abortion care now needs to travel. We know that the rates of people traveling to receive abortion care have risen dramatically. One in five patients who seek abortion care now have to travel across State lines. That does not--what that does is increase expenses for that woman. She has to take more time off from work. She has to be away from her family. She has to pay the travel expenses that it takes to cross State lines. That pushes pregnancies later, right? So, the impact, ironically in a post-Dobbs world is more impact on interstate commerce. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. In 1993, during testimony before this Committee, the field director, the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, when asked whether the purpose of violent and threatening activity by some anti-abortion activist was to deny women access to abortion services testified, and I quote, We may not get laws changed or be able to change people's minds. But if there is no one willing to conduct abortions, there are no abortions if there is no one willing to conduct abortions. Are you concerned that today's evident joint effort by Congressional Republicans and anti-abortion extremists to repeal the FACE Act or to have it declared unconstitutional is another step in a campaign to intimidate abortion providers in States where the right to an abortion remains protected? Ms. Waters. I am concerned. I appreciate the statements of multiple members that they don't condone violence, and I am sure that is true. Unfortunately, there are people out there who will engage in violent activity. The statement you just read is a prime example of it. I do think that what we are operating now is a climate of fear. Medical professionals fear liability. They fear being able to do their jobs up to existing standards of medical care. Without protections like those provided in FACE, they fear for their own safety and the fear going to work. So, I do agree that we are in a climate of fear and uncertainty. I think that is deliberate. I think reversing the protections that we have will only add to that. Mr. Nadler. In other words, repealing the FACE Act would add to violence? Ms. Waters. It is very possible that it would. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Roy.  Ranking Member? Ms. Scanlon. I just wanted to seek unanimous consent to enter the two opinions that were mentioned, the Tennessee District Court's order and Memo Opinion denying Mr. Vaughn and his codefendants' joint motion to dismiss. That's U.S. v. Gallagher. The 2002 Sixth Circuit decision in Norton v. Ashcroft. Mr. Roy. Without objection. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. Mr. Roy. With that, I will recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Kiley. Mr. Kiley. Ms. Hawley, I'm from California. Would it surprise you to learn that there are pregnancy centers in my region that have had to invest significantly in security measures because of the multiplicity of threats against them? Ms. Hawley. It would not at all. Mr. Kiley. They have also been the subject of hostile legislation from our State legislature. One law was even struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court because of violation of the First Amendment. Of course, we have been talking about the ways in which the Biden Administration has turned a blind eye to hostile and potentially even violent actions against these centers. So gosh, they have been subject to attacks and to hostility at the State and Federal level. There must be really nefarious things going on at these places. Could you tell us some of what goes on there that might be sparking this outrage? Ms. Hawley. Sure. So, pregnancy care centers are a strange target for ire. Pregnancy care centers are there when no one else is. We know from women who have had abortions that the majority of them say they would have chosen a parent or chosen differently if they would have had additional resources, either financial or familial support. The pregnancy care centers are there to supply that support when they can. They provide financial resources. They provide material resources like car seats, baby blankets, clothes, financial resources, food, housing, job training, and resume training as well as parenting classes. In 2022, they provided almost $316 billion worth of goods and services to moms and families facing unexpected pregnancies. Again, a strange target. Mr. Kiley. A very strange target. They are giving away diapers. They are giving away wipes. They are giving away baby formula. Baby formula, that is outrageous, isn't it that they are just giving it away? What is driving this? It is really incredible that these centers that provide such critical services to people who are in need have been left in a position where they have to spend their own limited resources putting up a security fence or something like that to protect folks who go there. On a separate note in terms of the law here, so is there any precedent for a law that at least on its face is neutral to be challenged on First Amendment grounds based on this idea of selective enforcement? What would that look like and has that been attempted here? Ms. Hawley. Absolutely. There is a number of cases in Federal Court. I would point out to you the Frederick Douglass Foundation case decided unanimously by a D.C. Circuit panel a year or two ago. In that case, there was a vandalism--or excuse me, an ordinance against writing on public streets here in the District of Columbia. The court allowed that to go forward on the claim that it had been unequally enforced against prolife advocates and other advocates. Mr. Kiley. Very interesting. Perhaps something to look at and thank you very much for your testimony. I will yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Arizona, Mr. Biggs. Mr. Biggs. I thank the gentleman. Ms. Hawley, have there been increased attacks against pregnancy resource centers during the Biden Administration? Ms. Hawley. Absolutely. We have had almost 100 attacks since the Dobbs' decision was leaked in May 2022. Mr. Biggs. Are you concerned that pro-abortion extremists would continue to attack pregnancy resource centers? Ms. Hawley. I think that's a concern. We just heard from the gentleman from California about pregnancy care centers who are having to build security fences and hire security guards. That is something that is now commonplace for centers that provide resources to women. Mr. Biggs. Mr. Vaughn, would you characterize the events in Mount Juliet Tennessee as violent? Mr. Vaughn. Absolutely not. Mr. Biggs. Did you or anyone with you pose a physical threat to the people around you? Mr. Vaughn. Absolutely not. Mr. Biggs. Was there anything you did or said that could cause someone to think their life was immediately in danger or harm? Mr. Vaughn. Absolutely not. Mr. Biggs. So, it was clear you were not a threat to anyone around you? Mr. Vaughn. That is correct. Mr. Biggs. When the FBI came to serve your indictment, they raided your house and arrested you at gunpoint in front of your family? Mr. Vaughn. That is correct. Mr. Biggs. You know why they did that, right? It was to intimidate you. Mr. Vaughn. Sure. Mr. Biggs. It wasn't just to intimidate you and your family. It was to intimidate any other prolife activists in this country. That is the disproportionality that has resulted from the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of the FACE Act. So, you were at the brunt of that. This regime is going to attack anyone that has disparate beliefs from them. That is why they have gone after Catholics. That is why they have spied on parents at school boards. It is a tactic they have employed for the last four years against conservatives of any stripe. Criminal terrorists and illegal aliens, let them in. Give them free housing and other benefits. Conservative prolife Americans exercising their First Amendment rights, send the SWAT team to their house. That is clear political intimidation and that is why the FACE Act has to be repealed. Mr. Chair, I yield. Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding time to the gentleman from Arizona unlike my good friend from North Carolina, parting shot on the way out of the Committee. With that, I would yield five minutes to the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Escobar. Ms. Escobar. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to thank the witnesses for their testimony before the Committee today. We are closing out business in the House Judiciary Committee this Congress with a hearing that is meant to set the stage for the continued hostility we can expect next Congress toward reproductive healthcare. Not content with undermining abortion access across the country since the fall of Roe, my colleagues across the aisle continue their attacks on the right to safely seek reproductive care in this country. Let's remember that the reason the FACE Act was enacted at all was in direct response to escalating violence by the anti- abortion movement on abortion patients, clinic employees, and providers. I want to be very clear. I stand firmly against all violence. I don't condone any threats or intimidation. I introduced the Healthcare Providers Safety Act earlier this Congress, which would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants to healthcare providers to enhance the physical and cybersecurity of their facilities, personnel, and patients. My bill would give providers the needed resources to ensure the safety of patients and that providers are able to continue providing essential reproductive healthcare. Reproductive healthcare providers, patients, and facilities are frequently the targets of violence and harassment, ranging from vandalism to online harassment, to stalking, arson, and deadly attacks. Our providers deserve to care for patients, and patients deserve access to abortion care in safe environments. Ms. Waters, how can Congress build on the protections created by the FACE Act and what steps can Congress take to improve or strengthen protections for patients and providers? What other effective--or are there other effective methods to combat routine harassment and violence like the kind experienced by providers and patients at healthcare clinics? Ms. Waters. So, I think it is important to note that while FACE does provide an important Federal remedy that I would argue to your question that Congress needs to zealously protect, it does not preclude States from also enforcing remedies in their own State, right? So, we need both of those things, and we can hold both things. Both things can be true, right? It is incredibly important that Congress send the message that if someone is providing legal healthcare, which abortion providers and other medical professionals are in the majority of the States, they will be protected. They don't have to fear liability. They don't have to fear violence. They don't have to change their medical practice to try to comply with ever changing laws. That is a message that Congress can send. Ms. Escobar. I want to tell a very quick story to give voice to a number of constituents who reached out to me after the reversal of Roe. I heard story after story about women who were forced to terminate pregnancies because of the lack of viability of the fetus. Many of these constituents had to access their care at a clinic. As they were mourning the loss of a child they badly wanted but a fetus that if they carried to full term would threaten their own life, creating motherless children in their family, they had to walk--I heard stories about women having to walk past crowds of people screaming at them with photos that they did not want to see in that moment as they were trying to save their own life and be around for their other children and could not adequately even mourn the loss of their baby's life because they were spiraling into shame because of what was about to happen. I think it is really important that these women's stories be uplifted, which is why I wanted to share it with all of you today. Ms. Waters, thank you so much for your response. I appreciate it. I yield back. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentlelady from Texas. I would now recognize the gentlelady from Wyoming for five minutes. Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Wyoming's lone facility performing procedural abortions opened last year in Casper. On a routine basis, prolife Wyomingites pray, hold vigils, and participate in advocacy activities outside of the clinic. Advocacy to the clinic patients sometimes involves giving a woman a rose and informing them of alternative services offered at crisis pregnancy centers. Local reporting suggests that clinic employees are now claiming that this peaceful advocacy is harassment of patients and employees. The clinic is now escorting all their patients to and from the building in response to these peaceful actions. Earlier this year one of the clinic's escorts actually pleaded no contest and paid a fine for assaulting a member of the prolife protest group. There is now an attempt to elevate the harassment allegations to the local government. Mr. Vaughn, does the situation in Casper, Wyoming, that I just described sound similar to your case? Mr. Vaughn. It does. Ms. Hageman. Do you think prayer and peaceful advocacy are violations of the law or are they instead activities that are secured by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution? Mr. Vaughn. They are both First Amendment protected activities and activities of love and seeking to help others. Ms. Hageman. Have you experienced these attempted mischar- acterizations of your peaceful activities as being criminal or violent in some way? Mr. Vaughn. Right here in this very hearing. Ms. Hageman. We heard it just today from the Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee. Could you please explain and clarify what happened in your circumstances? Mr. Vaughn. Thank you for the opportunity. I was not sitting at any door. I was not standing at any door. At no time did I block anyone. My only activities were praying and talking with the police officers and relaying messages back and forth between the two parties. Ms. Hageman. OK. Do you think that the pro-abortion individuals who seek to misrepresent lawful activity as violence, that they are doing so because of the current administration's misapplication and unequal enforcement of the FACE Act? Mr. Vaughn. I think there is an element of that. I think as a Nation, we need to be able to communicate. As long as we sit here looking at each other face to face and we are not able to communicate and honestly represent facts, what hope is there for the news to get actually out to the people at the clinics? I would just add that the people going and seeking abortion as Ms. Escobar told her story, that is a tragic thing. If they stopped and talked to someone out at the clinic, what they will find is loving help and people that would take them to a crisis pregnancy center or offer some other solution to help, if it is possible. If it is not, then they would find someone that might pray with them and encourage them. They would not find someone if they stopped and engaged in a conversation and actually listened to someone yelling or screaming or abusing them verbally. Certainly, not physically. Ms. Hageman. Those who hate wisdom, love death. That is part of what we are dealing with here. That goes, Ms. Hawley, to your statement about how you find it so utterly bizarre that crisis pregnancy centers have been the target of protests, activities, and vandalism when it is offering services and support to individuals in need. I am with you. It is such a bizarre target. I think it demonstrates that this isn't necessarily a discussion about the FACE Act or the First Amendment or protecting constitutional rights or civil liberties. There is a pro-abortion agenda that has been pursued, especially by this administration that doesn't make sense. That the abuse of the FACE Act is an attempt to criminalize the free thought and the ability for people to, as you say, peacefully protest. It is a sad day in America when someone who is praying or attempting to have that kind of conversation that you are describing can be arrested years later for that behavior. Based on your experience with the FACE Act, Ms. Hawley, do you think that the pro-abortion community is aware that the Biden-Harris Administration is selectively applying the FACE Act against the prolife community? Ms. Hawley. So, I think it probably is. I would point out to you several press conferences that the Attorney General Gupta held. She announced just a short time after the Dobbs' decision was released a reproductive task force and noted that one of the goals of that reproductive task force during their daily meeting would be to seek out opportunities for FACE enforcement. Of course, that FACE enforcement would have been against prolife individuals. Ms. Hageman. Is praying outside an abortion facility where offering women information on alternative pathways, adoptions for their pregnancy a violation of the FACE Act? Ms. Hawley. It should not be, no. Ms. Hageman. To your knowledge, would that violate any Federal law, what I just described? Ms. Hawley. Not consistent with the First Amendment, no. Ms. Hageman. OK. The Biden Administration makes it appear that the FACE Act is merely a statute covering abortion facilities. In reality, it also prohibits certain acts against places of religious worship. Isn't that correct? Ms. Hawley. Absolutely. Ms. Hageman. Has the current administration, Attorney General Garland or Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke prioritize protecting religious places of worship, especially in the wake of the antisemitic violence which has occurred in the wake of October 7th? Mr. Roy. The gentlelady's has expired. So, you may answer the question and then we will move on. Ms. Hawley. Thank you, sir. Not at all. The Family Research Council identified 436 attacks on churches and houses of worship just in 2023. There have been zero, zero prosecutions under the FACE Act for that violence and threats. Ms. Hageman. Well, thank you. Thank you for your indulgence. With that, I yield back. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentlelady. I will now recognize the gentlelady from Vermont for five minutes. Ms. Balint. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the witnesses for being here today. I know you are all very busy people. Before I get to my statement on the topic at hand, I have to start by saying words absolutely matter. Mr. Crampton earlier, you likened the FBI to the Gestapo, to Nazis. That kind of rhetoric is not actually helpful in this debate. The Gestapo operated without any civil restraints. Its actions were not subject to judicial appeal. Thousands of citizens, including Jews, trade unionists, political clergy, and others simply disappeared into concentration camps, one of those being my grandfather. The political arm of the Gestapo could order prisoners to be maimed, tortured, and murdered. There was no legal process. The Gestapo under Adolf Eichmann organized the deportation of millions and millions of Jews to concentration camps. Now, I understand that you feel passionate about this issue. I do. I understand that. Your use of the word Gestapo is inappropriate, is offensive, and it is uneducated. I urge you; I urge you as you continue your work to cease using this terminology because I think what we are trying to do here is actually elicit testimony that is helpful to get us to a better place. I don't think that this is helping. Professor Waters, if the Justice Department were to stop enforcing the FACE Act or if it were no longer law, could you describe for people--because that's really what these hearings are about--describe for people what effect that would have on access to abortion care and other reproductive rights? Ms. Waters. I think it is important to note that if the FACE Act were no longer enforced, many of the institutions and many of the organizations that the colleagues to the left of me have described, they would also be at risk, right? I don't quite understand the argument that we think that DOJ and the FBI should be doing more to protect prolife centers, but at the same we should repeal FACE. Ms. Balint. Agreed. This confuses me, too. Ms. Waters. I do think, but the record is also very clear that we have seen a campaign of coordinated violence and blockades against centers and providers of reproductive healthcare, including abortion. Without these Federal protections, that would only increase. I also think it is really important that we are precise in how we talk about FACE's protections. FACE very clearly does not reach peaceful protests outside of clinics that do not interfere with passage into that clinic. That is not covered under FACE. In fact, it is explicitly excluded. Ms. Balint. Can you say that again? Please, honestly, this is like the crux of it for me. Ms. Waters. It is an important point. Congress was very deliberate in carving out pure expressive activity from FACE's purview. So, some of the activities that have been described here, like peacefully protesting outside of a clinic and even having signs that may be inflammatory, as much as we may abhor that speech, the First Amendment likely protects that. It is important to distinguish between what FACE does and protections under the First Amendment. Ms. Balint. So, it is the blocking of the entrance that is making it difficult to get the care that they are entitled to. Ms. Waters. It is. It is violence. It is destruction of property. It is blocking entrances that is prohibited by FACE. FACE does not prohibit expressive speech. Ms. Balint. From your perspective, are clinic obstructions, even if they don't lead to threats of violence, like of course, we want to avoid violence, are they related to negative health outcomes? Have we seen increased mortality since Dobbs was overturned? Ms. Waters. We have seen an increase in both maternal mortality rates and infant mortality rates. Probably not surprisingly, those were going up very quickly in States that are most restrictive of abortion care. Ms. Balint. I thank you. I yield back. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentlelady from Vermont. I am going to use the time for myself now. Mr. Crampton, you just had some questions directed at you. I want to give you a chance to respond very quickly because I want to move on to the rest of the questions. I would note also that only 42 of my Democratic colleagues sought to join with us to sanction the International Criminal Court, which is trying to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is somehow a war criminal for defending his country against the vicious attacks from Iran, from Hamas, from Hezbollah, and all of those that are trying to target the Jewish State. Do you have anything, quickly, to respond to the attacks? Mr. Crampton. Yes. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, for the opportunity. I would point to the gentlelady the facts as testified to by Mr. Vaughn. Here comes people, guns drawn, banging on his door, as he described it, and it is not an unfair characterization. He was kidnapped at gunpoint before his wife and children. No authority given. Even when asked directly, they just point to a little sticker on the vest saying that is all the authority you are going to get. That says FBI. Mr. Roy. Mr. Vaughn, can you just add to that really quick? The phraseology is used. It was used intentionally by Mr. Crampton. We are talking about the Federal Bureau of Investigation showing up to your home, in front of your 11 children, with a weapon pointed at you for what you did in terms of praying and your activity at an abortion clinic. Is that true? Mr. Vaughn. That is absolutely true. Mr. Roy. Do you think that was an appropriate use of the power of the Federal Government against you? Mr. Vaughn. Absolutely not. I am a local businessman. I have been there for 17 years in the community. A phone call, I would have happily talked to them. Mr. Roy. Does not that invoke the kind of images Mr. Crampton is talking about of previous examples in history in terms of the fascism that we see out of Nazi Germany and how they treated citizens? Mr. Vaughn. It absolutely does. The gentlewoman said that there is recourse is by law and that there are laws that oversee this. I would like to ask for my 13-, 12-, and 18-year- old daughters that was out in the side yard, what recourse do they have at law for the abuse that they handled at this guy, holding them at bay right there? Also, at the Department of the FBI in Tennessee that two months later shot a guy in his own living room. Mr. Roy. As a reminder-- Mr. Vaughn. An internal investigation, who is investigating the investigators? Mr. Roy. As a reminder, Mr. Vaughn, you were there because, as I understand your position, you believe that life begins at conception. You believe you are protecting and praying for life, correct? Mr. Vaughn. That is absolutely correct. Mr. Roy. Your great sin, that the tyranny of the Federal Government was brought to bear against you at your home with a weapon in front of your 11 children was because you want to protect a human life? Mr. Vaughn. That is correct. Mr. Roy. Ms. Hawley, are you familiar with the history of this Act? Because it is not true that the current leader in the Senate, Mr. Schumer, was the lead proponent of the FACE Act in 1993. In questioning for Republican Members of Congress, when asked about whether or not this would be used against, for example, we have 3, 10, 12 people prolife on a sidewalk in front of a clinic. People cannot get by. Police locked them up and put them in a paddy wagon. Take them away. Are they subject to a felony? Mr. Schumer said, ``no.'' Yet, here we are. Can you shed light on the extent to which the truth is, notwithstanding what Professor Waters said a minute ago, that what we are dealing with here is the conflation of the existing statutes and the things that go back to the Ku Klux Klan Act and that we now have a situation under the Federal civil rights conspiracy that they are blending these together to target people intentionally. That they are using this and targeting it intentionally, so that they can go after people, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Can you add some context to that, Ms. Hawley? Ms. Hawley. Absolutely. So, the FACE Act comes with several different sorts of levels of punishment. For a first-time nonviolent offense, there is six months in jail. A subsequent nonviolent offense might get 18 months in jail. If you tack on a conspiracy to violate civil rights, you get 10 years. Take Eva Edl. She was sitting in a wheelchair. She was blocking an entrance. Sitting in a wheelchair, blocking the entrance, singing and praying hymns, she is subject to 11 years in Federal prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars of fines. Mr. Roy. So, what we are talking about here, as I mentioned--Mr. Vaughn, did you have something you wanted to add there? Mr. Vaughn. No. Mr. Roy. That Mr. Vaughn is facing this kind of persecution. He is not alone. We have talked about Ms. Edl. To be clear, this conflation of the statute, had that ever been done before prior to Kristen Clarke? Ms. Hawley. Not until the Biden Administration, no. Mr. Roy. So, this administration took the unprecedented act of merging these together so they could have a Federal conspiracy to target very specifically prolife activists. Ms. Hawley. So, the numbers here speak for themselves. Again, 55 individuals have been subject to prosecution under the FACE Act. Fifty of those have been prolife. There have been 26 FACE Act civil and criminal prosecutions. Only two of them have been in protection of pregnancy centers. Mr. Roy. Just to finish here, do you think that is an appropriate use of Federal authority to say target Mr. Vaughn or say Ms. Edl who had been in Yugoslavia and effectively gulags and now at 89 years old is being targeted by the government of the United States? Ms. Hawley. No. As John Adams would say, we are a government of laws, not of men. The Supreme Court has been clear that selective enforcement based on viewpoint is unconstitutional. Mr. Roy. Well, thank you for your testimony. I appreciate it. With that, I will recognize the Ranking Member, Ms. Scanlon. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Professor Waters, we seem to have conflated a lot of things here in suggesting that, inaccurately, that Mr. Vaughn was prosecuted for prayer. You noted in your testimony that the FACE Act explicitly distinguishes between protective expressive speech and unlawful conduct. We have talked a lot about what is expressive speech, but the unlawful conduct includes things such as obstructing access to a clinic, does it not? Ms. Waters. That's correct. FACE explicitly makes clear that obstructing access to a reproductive health services clinic or a place of worship is a violation of FACE. Ms. Scanlon. Mr. Chair, I would like to have unanimous consent to introduce the press release when Mr. Vaughn was convicted, six defendants convicted of Federal civil rights conspiracy in freedom of access to clinic entrance for obstructing access to reproductive health services in Tennessee. Also, a USA Today article saying, ``Tennessee Man Arrested for Blocking Access to Abortion Clinic, Not Praying.'' Mr. Roy. Without objection. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. Recent data, Ms. Waters, from the National Abortion Federation shows that violence and threats directed toward abortion providers and their patients have risen. Can you speak about this escalating trend and particularly in light of this increasing threat to reproductive health services, does the FACE Act continue to be a relevant tool to protect doctors, nurses, patients, and volunteers who are seeking or providing abortion care? Ms. Waters. It continues to be a relevant tool to protect anyone who is providing reproductive healthcare services, including abortion care. What we have seen is reports of escalating violence and more numerous violence, including things like blockades happening particularly in States that are protective of abortion care. As I noted earlier, women seeking abortion care in many States now have to travel to States where abortion is legal, and it is safe. Because they were having to engage in that traveling, I think there has been a deliberate campaign to target some of the clinics where abortion care is still available. Ms. Scanlon. In fact, the case that Mr. Vaughn was involved in, although he purports to say that he was simply praying, the jury rejected his argument and actually found him and his fellow protesters to have been guilty of actually obstructing these folks in this clinic for a period of three hours. The conspiracy element came from the fact that these folks came from all over. It was actually part of an organized effort in Tennessee where his incident occurred as well as other places around the country. Is that correct? Ms. Waters. It is my understanding that people traveled from several different jurisdictions and that there was indeed a conspiracy charge in this case. Ms. Scanlon. We have also heard repeatedly that basically there is not any enforcement, or a blind eye being turned. I wanted to seek unanimous consent to introduce another DOJ press release just from a few months ago, ``Three Defendants Plead Guilty to Civil Rights Conspiracy Targeting Pregnancy Resource Centers.'' Mr. Roy. Without objection. Ms. Scanlon. OK. Finally, to the extent that our colleagues are concerned about excessive use of force, that's something that the Members on our side of the aisle have been very interested in preventing excessive use of force in a variety of contexts. That's certainly not an issue exclusive to the FACE Act and perhaps that's something we need to pursue on another day. So, with that, I yield back. Mr. Roy. I thank the Ranking Member. With that, I will recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. McClintock. Mr. McClintock. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Professor Waters mentioned the cases of violence and vandalism directed at abortion clinics that gave rise to the FACE Act, but I think she left out all the cases of violence and vandalism that were directed at churches and pregnancy centers. That's what convinced Congress to make FACE even handed to protect both sides of the controversy. Am I correct, Ms. Hawley? Ms. Hawley. That's absolutely correct. The plain text of the FACE Act applies to pregnancy centers-- Mr. McClintock. Everybody on both sides. There is no right to impede a person's access to abortion clinics, pregnancy centers, churches, or any other lawful pursuit. There is no right to vandalize those facilities or threaten the people who use them. There is every right to peaceably assemble to express one's political or religious beliefs. So, I have got no problems with the FACE Act on its face so to speak. As I read it, it forbids blockading abortion clinics and churches. As I read it, it protects the right of individuals to peaceably assemble. So, what am I missing here? Ms. Hawley. So, I'm afraid that the promise of equal application of the FACE Act has really been a false one. As Chair Roy discussed, there have been 55 individuals prosecuted. Mr. McClintock. OK. So, is that the fault of the act itself or is that the fault of the way the act is enforced? Ms. Hawley. That specific concern is the fault of the enforcement. Mr. McClintock. OK. That's what I thought. I heard Mr. Nadler say that, well, instead of repealing the FACE Act, and I am not the least bit sure that we should, Republicans ought to urge the Trump Administration to prioritize enforcement of the FACE Act on behalf of prolife activists. Well, I find this just as offensive as prioritizing enforcement of the FACE Act on behalf of pro-abortion activists. Both courses are deeply destructive to the rule-of- law and to the concept of equal protection of the law. This is the reason justice is always depicted as being blindfolded because it shouldn't matter what anyone's personal opinions are. The laws are to be applied equally to all. I hope I misunderstood what the Ranking Member said in his prepared remarks because it seems to confirm the complaint that this law is susceptible to political abuse. In fact, it sounded like he was encouraging us to abuse it, which I find bizarre. So, if we are to slant enforcement of the law depending on who is in power, it seems to me we have lost the fundamental principle of equal justice under law. This problem is not limited to the FACE Act. We have seen selective enforcement in different treatment between say George Floyd rioters and January 6th rioters or the Lois Lerner selected enforcement against Tea Party activists a few years ago. Should we, perhaps, instead of looking--repealing the FACE Act, look at clearly defining what selective enforcement looks like and then applying criminal or civil penalties to such conduct? Ms. Hawley. So, that could be a good first step. I agree wholeheartedly that the FACE Act as is every criminal statute should be applied even handedly. That is the promise of our republic. I would say-- Mr. McClintock. Because it is being administered with people with political biases, that is perhaps not always going to happen. It certainly is not happening in this case, but also it is not happening in a lot of other cases. So, is there some law that you could recommend that would define what selective enforcement is, and sanction those who apply it in a biased manner? Ms. Hawley. That is an interesting question. Selective enforcement is typically raised as a constitutional claim either under the equal protection clause or the First Amendment. So, if you had a Federal selective enforcement claim itself, you would have to think how that would play out. I do think that the constitutional cases provide a good sort of framework of reference. What those cases provided that when parties are similarly situated, there is prosecutorial discretion. When you have similarly situated parties, the law requires that they be treated equally. Mr. McClintock. Mr. Crampton, very briefly, your thoughts on the subject. Mr. Crampton. Would you repeat the question, please, sir? Mr. McClintock. The question is, since these laws are subject to enforcement by individuals who have their own biases, is there a law we should be looking at that would identify what selective enforcement looks like and sanction it? Mr. Crampton. Actually, it is a very difficult area as Ms. Hawley mentioned. The selective enforcement case law, the precedents, are frankly, not entirely consistent. There is, because of the discretion afforded prosecutors across the board, a great deal of disagreement as to when that is too far, and they've transgressed the constitutional limits. It is frankly a matter for the courts, and we do really need more clarity in that area. I can't point you to another statute or a law that would help. Mr. McClintock. Any further thoughts you have on that, I would be interested in hearing. Mr. Crampton. Thank you. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentleman from California. With that, I will recognize my friend from Texas, Mr. Hunt. Mr. Hunt. Thank you, Chair. Weaponization, two-tier justice, prioritization. What do these words have in common? They describe the unspoken policy of the Biden Administration when it comes to justice. You can apply this unspoken policy to any Biden Administration agency. Weaponization, Biden weaponized the DOJ to go after a former President for political purposes. He said Trump was undermining democracy. For two-tiered justice in the classified documents case, Biden directed the FBI to raid Mar-a-Lago, yet gently browsed the classified documents that were sitting in President Biden's garage. For prioritization, Biden's FEMA Department in Florida only helped storm victims who didn't have Trump signs in their front yard. Think about that. So, it should come to no surprise that we are talking about another example of weaponization, two-tiered justice, and prioriti- zation, in today's hearing. We are here today to talk about the DOJ's selective enforcement of the FACE Act. It is aimed at assuring equal protection for both prolife and prochoice movements. Under the Biden Administration, I will let you guess whether more prolife or prochoice activists have been charged with more crimes. The FACE Act has been the law of the land for the last 20 years. The Biden's DOJ, in just four years, has brought over a quarter of all FACE Act prosecutions. There are many examples, but I will highlight an egregious example. In Mount Juliet, Tennessee, prolife activists were arrested for singing and praying in a hallway of a shared general medical office building featuring an abortion clinic. They initially were faced with misdemeanor charges. Magically, 17 months later, the DOJ charged these Christians with Federal crimes. Among these charged was Eva Edl. Now 89 years old, she is a survivor of a Communist concentration camp in Yugoslavia after World War II. That is right. In Biden's America, you can escape a Communist concentration camp and then come to America and be arrested for praying. Mr. Vaughn, thank you for being here today. I am glad that you avoided prison time as well, sir. Did you receive three years of supervised release. Is that correct? Mr. Vaughn. That is correct. After 18 months of presentencing supervision. Mr. Hunt. Could you have ever imagined living in a country, this country, that you would be arrested for praying, singing, and providing sidewalk counseling? Mr. Vaughn. No. Mr. Hunt. We, as a country, should have seen this coming. Under the COVID censorship regime that was the Biden Administration, they restricted churchgoers from attending church but allowed people to shop in liquor stores. I guess that's because Tito's and Crown Royal were the cure for COVID. Maybe we will never know. Mr. Crampton, I have got to tell you something. You can probably imagine, sir, I am not a big fan of the KKK. I am a direct descendant of slavery, and I am also here to tell you that the Klan has been dead for a very long time. Why in God's name would you evoke an act like this under these circumstances? Mr. Crampton. I wish I understood exactly what the logic was behind it as far as any legitimate reasoning, sir. What I do know is Sanjay Patel authored an article in 2022 for the DOJ's own internal kind of a law review magazine where he laid out why he suggested they use it. He was the first one to use it as the prosecutor in the District of Columbia case. That was because it would increase the penalty and because it is easier to prove conspiracy. You don't need what is called a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. 241, this conspiracy against rights statute. Moreover, sir, if I may add, the conspiracy against rights depends on a Federal right. Mr. Hunt. Yes. Mr. Vaughn. Traditionally, that was a constitutional right. Now, as we know, there is no Federal constitutional right to abortion. So, the right they are hanging that on is the very slender thread of a right to access reproductive health clinics. So, it is a mystery, and it is such an unjust and excessive punishment, use of that statute, abuse of that statute that as I suggested in my opening remarks, it needs to be separately addressed. Mr. Hunt. Of course it does. Thank you for answering the questions, sir. The selective prosecution of FACE Act violations is two- tiered justice at its finest. The Biden Administration Attorney General Merrick Garland's prosecution of their political opponents is real, and it is pervasive. They painted January 6th protesters out to be violent criminals, yet President Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, and many other actual felons because they were on his side of the aisle, period. Peaceful January 6th protesters are in jail while violent criminals are pardoned and roam free. Thank God, they are going to get out of here on January 20th. I can guarantee you that. Merrick Garland surveilled parents at school board meetings who were simply expressing their right to free speech. Garland, however, did nothing about ANTIFA while cities in this country were being burned to the ground. Biden has been on the wrong side of justice every single time, and we know it. The American people know it. We have expressed our sentiments just last month. I can assure you we will have justice back in America on January 20th. Thank you all very much for being here. Mr. Roy. I thank the gentleman from Texas, his time having expired. I would ask consent--I have been receiving correspondence from folks from all over the country asking us to repeal the FACE Act and stop what is happening to people like Mr. Vaughn and like Ms. Edl. I would ask unanimous consent to insert this into the record. Without objection, does the gentleman from Ohio seek recognition? Chair Jordan. I was hoping for five minutes of questions. Imagine that. No, I appreciate it. Mr. Vaughn, so the day that you were at the--you were praying and singing at the clinic, did the local police show up? Mr. Vaughn. They did. Chair Jordan. Were they called by the clinic? Mr. Vaughn. They were. Chair Jordan. I want to get all the facts right. Maybe you did this in your opening statement. I apologize. I had to step out a couple of times during the hearing. So, you are in front of the abortion clinic. You are praying and singing. You were on the public sidewalk. Mr. Vaughn. It was a multiuse building. We were in the hallways of a public building. Chair Jordan. OK. Mr. Vaughn. Outside the door of the abortion clinic. Chair Jordan. There were other people with you? Mr. Vaughn. Correct. Chair Jordan. You were charged with conspiring to stop people from going into the clinic and their rights as Mr. Crampton was just talking about. Mr. Vaughn. Correct, yes. Chair Jordan. Did you physically push anyone, hold anyone back? Did you lock arms with your coconspirators or what did you do? Mr. Vaughn. No, I did none of that. Chair Jordan. None of that. Mr. Vaughn. I kneeled and prayed on the side of the hallway at one point. Sang hymns when they were singing. I interacted with the police department. The local police got a little agitated at one point, and they came and shoved a couple people. I walked back down the hallway with them and tried to assure them that these people were peaceful and keeping peace with the police department. Chair Jordan. Yes. Mr. Vaughn. I ultimately talked with the negotiator and the police chief along with another member and led to a peaceful resolution. People that wanted to be-- Chair Jordan. No one was arrested that day? Mr. Vaughn. There were eight people arrested. Chair Jordan. Were you arrested that day? Mr. Vaughn. I was not. Chair Jordan. You were not arrested that day. Mr. Vaughn. No, sir. Chair Jordan. OK. Then what day was that? What day were you there at the clinic praying and-- Mr. Vaughn. That was March 5th. Chair Jordan. March 5th of what year? Mr. Vaughn. 2022--I'm sorry, of 2021. Chair Jordan. 2021. Mr. Vaughn. Correct, yes. Chair Jordan. Because it is a year later. It just happens to be March 5th, again? Mr. Vaughn. It is October 5, 2022. Chair Jordan. October 5th, excuse me. Mr. Vaughn. Yes. Chair Jordan. So, a year later--that is right, October 5th. So, almost a year later is when the Federal police shows up, the FBI shows up at your house? Mr. Vaughn. Correct, yes. Chair Jordan. In that 11 month timeframe, what kind of contact did you have with any law enforcement or any prosecutor or anything like that? Mr. Vaughn. None. Chair Jordan. None? Mr. Vaughn. None whatsoever. Chair Jordan. So, you weren't arrested that day and other people were. You didn't do anything wrong that day. In fact, when there was some concern, you tried to de-escalate it. Mr. Vaughn. Right. Chair Jordan. Nothing happens. Local police said, this Mr. Vaughn guy, he's doing the Lord's work, whatever they said. They didn't do anything. Then 10 months later, the FBI shows up at your door. Mr. Vaughn. That's 18 months later, correct? They showed up hard and heavy. That day, the police in their media press release complimented how peaceful and orderly we were, how we interacted with them. The lead detective--I'm sorry, the lead negotiator testified for us at Federal trial. Chair Jordan. So, the police-- Mr. Vaughn. We had good relations with the police. It has been reported out--if I can, I would love to read just a quick summary. Chair Jordan. Do you know if the FBI talked to the local police prior to them coming to your house and arresting you? Mr. Vaughn. They did not. I asked them that question on the hour-long ride to Nashville in the back of the car. I asked ``Did my sheriff know or anybody know?'' and replied ``No, we didn't bother telling them.'' Chair Jordan. They just showed up. Mr. Vaughn. They showed up. Chair Jordan. If I remember the facts again, it was early morning. Show up. Mr. Vaughn. 7:15 a.m. in the morning. Chair Jordan. You open the door, you and your wife and children right there. Mr. Vaughn. Correct, yes. Chair Jordan. They had some of your kids held off on a different part of the property. Mr. Vaughn. Right. Chair Jordan. OK. Where was the conspiracy? What were you conspiring to do? Because I don't see the--I am troubled, as the legal professionals Ms. Hawley and Mr. Crampton pointed out, I am troubled by this whole conspiracy thing. I don't see any conspiracy on your part. Mr. Vaughn. No, the conspiracy, I ideologically agreed that abortions should stop. I was in the hallway with other people that did that. Chair Jordan. Were there like emails at the trial where you said, ``we are all going to meet at the clinic on this day?'' Is that how they demonstrate some concern? Mr. Vaughn. There was no evidence like that presented as to me. The only thing they showed--that piece of the trial was my driver's license. It indicated that I lived an hour from the clinic and drove an hour. So, that was the tie to the conspiracy. Chair Jordan. If the FBI called you said, ``Mr. Vaughn, we are going to charge you with this crime. Can you show up and meet us at the local FBI office or whatever, Nashville,'' I think you said, you would have called your--you would have got legal counsel. Mr. Vaughn. Absolutely. Chair Jordan. You have got Mr. Crampton. You would have showed up whatever day they told you, right? Mr. Vaughn. Sure. Absolutely. Chair Jordan. Instead they came to your house. Yes, it's crazy. Mr. Crampton, what are traditional Catholics radical? Mr. Crampton. Only in the eyes of extremists of the Biden Administration. Chair Jordan. Yes, only in the eyes of the people who show up at 6 a.m. in the morning and arrest a guy when the local police, ``wanted to give him a medal.'' Only they are the people who are going to say, the pure traditional Catholic, you are an extremist. You are a radical. Mr. Crampton. I am afraid so. Chair Jordan. Ms. Hawley, I got 32 seconds. I feel bad. I will give you the last 30 seconds. Anything you want to add to the discussion? Ms. Hawley. Thank you, Congressman Jordan. One thing I would like to mention is that the FACE Act is on top of State and local law. So, as the Members of Congress have recognized before, this would not allow criminal conduct to go unpunished. Every State has trespass laws, has nuisance laws, and has those sorts of things that are perfectly capable-- Chair Jordan. We saw it in the example. Ms. Hawley. Exactly. Similarly,-- Chair Jordan. When they arrested--any of the eight people that the local police arrested, Mr. Vaughn, did any of them get charged by the FBI? How many of them? All of them? Mr. Vaughn. All of them. Chair Jordan. All of them. OK. Mr. Vaughn. They got double charged. Chair Jordan. They got double charged. Mr. Vaughn. They got local charges and Federal. Chair Jordan. They obviously did something wrong, and you didn't. Ms. Hawley. Similarly, with Mr. Houck, who I know has testified to this Committee, the State and local prosecutors declined to prosecute. They made a Federal case out of it. He was acquitted by a jury of his peers. An Obama-appointed judge noted that this was stretching the FACE Act a little thin. Chair Jordan. No kidding. Thank you. Thank all our witnesses. I want to thank the Chair for his good work on dealing with this piece of legislation. Mr. Roy. I thank the Chair, the gentleman from Ohio. I thank the witnesses. This concludes today's hearing. Without objection, all Members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. Without objection, the hearing is adjourned.  All materials submitted for the record by Members of the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government can be found at: https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent. aspx?EventID=117765.
