FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION WITNESS CHRISTOPHER WRAY, DIRECTOR Mr. Rogers . The subcommittee will be in order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. Welcome to the first fiscal year 2025 hearing for the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. Before I start, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger for her years of dedication to this committee, and formally congratulate Chairman Cole on becoming the new chairman of the committee. We look forward to continuing to work with both of them. I will begin by recognizing myself for an opening statement. We want to welcome our witness, the Honorable Christopher Wray, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, back to this subcommittee. Director Wray, who has nearly 30 years of DOJ and FBI experience dating back to the late 1990s, has served in his current role since August of 2017. In his capacity as Director, he oversees an agency of over 35,000 people, including special agents, intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists, and information technology specialists. The 2025 budget request for FBI salaries and expenses is $11.3 billion, with $6.7 billion of that amount, about 60 percent, designated as defense spending. The request amounts to a 6 percent increase above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level for salaries and expenses. Overall, the FBI budget request includes $119 million in program increases and approximately $700 million in other adjustments, representing the substantial increased cost of continuing the FBI's current activities. In particular, the largest program increase request is for what the FBI has labeled ``restoration of 2023 national security and law enforcement personnel.'' This request is for $85.4 million and aims to fund 270 headquarter positions, of which only 60 would be actual agents. The Bureau claims these resources are necessary to limit reductions in function areas. Let's be crystal-clear, cartels continue to flood our streets with fentanyl and poison. Americans are being hurt in record numbers. They are exploiting our southern border and devastating families and communities. Violent crime levels-- murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault--all too high. There's no question the FBI's mission is more critical than ever. The requested increases in the fiscal year 2025 budget are significant, and it is my hope that they are fully discussed at today's hearing in relation to many of the issues this country is facing. However, it is no secret that the Nation's federal debt stands at approximately $34 trillion. Let me repeat that number--$34 trillion. And hardworking Americans continue to face elevated costs for everyday items. Congress, and this committee, in particular, cannot ignore the unsustainable path that we are on. It is essential that we ensure every dollar appropriated to agencies is spent effectively, efficiently, and appropriately. Anything less would be ignoring our constitutional duty. To that end, our fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill made some difficult, yet necessary, funding reductions for many agencies, including the FBI. As with all appropriations bills, the fiscal year 2024 CJS bill was the product of careful consideration and collaboration within Congress. We review budget submissions, call hearings, analyze program inquiries/ requests, engage with the agencies, have countless debates, and make final judgment calls. Not everyone will be satisfied with the final appropriated levels, but ever-increasing debt levels require tough decisions. Director Wray, we look forward to the opportunity to discuss with you today the President's fiscal year 2025 budget submission for the FBI. We are looking forward to a full conversation on the major cost drivers within this budget request. Beyond the funding implications of the budget request, I'm also interested in the ongoing issues at the FBI that include, but not limited to, the erosion of public trust in the Bureau. This includes the FBI's overly aggressive tactics, questionable investigative standards, and the overall politicization of the Bureau. Importantly, I also want to ensure we fully explore the grave crisis at our southern border and the FBI's responsibility when it comes to combating the wide range of illegal activities happening at the border that not only impact the Nation's southern states, but the entire country as a whole. I believe the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill achieved the right balance and represented a step in the right direction with targeted cuts aimed at pushing the Bureau to refocus on its core mission. Mission creep in federal agencies beyond their required duties is a real problem and it must be corrected. I believe in the FBI's mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of our great country. I recognize the challenging, yet critical, work the agency performs daily--defending the United States against terrorists and espionage, combating deadly fentanyl, protecting the Nation's children from becoming victims, and more. FBI agents are our Nation's defenders, and it is not lost on Members of Congress the sacrifices they make to protect our country. To be clear, the FBI's mission is critical to the health of our entire Nation. Mr. Wray, once again, we appreciate you being here to answer our questions. We appreciate your hard work on behalf of the American people. Let me now recognize my ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Cartwright, for any remarks he may wish to make. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you and good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. And I join Chairman Rogers in thanking our overall appropriations chair, Kay Granger, for her years of dedication and service to this Appropriations Committee, and congratulate Chairman Cole, as he takes over that very important role. And I also join Chairman Rogers in welcoming Director Christopher Wray to testify today. As we all know, the FBI does an enormous amount of work to help protect the American people. As a primary law enforcement agency for the U.S. Government, the FBI employs, roughly, 36,000 people in 56 field offices, 350 resident agencies, and several specialized facilities and analytical centers across the country, as well as in over 60 legal attache offices in 80 countries around the world. The FBI works to investigate and disrupt crime, including everything from violent gang networks, cyber criminals, white collar crime, human trafficking, and domestic and international terrorism. And I could not agree more with Chairman Rogers as he talks about FBI's mission, including combating opioid and the opioid epidemic, including fentanyl poisonings that are killing well north of 100,000 people, American citizens, every year. In addition, since Russia's brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine last year, the FBI has also successfully worked to disrupt criminal, cyber, and hostile intelligence activities from Russia that endanger Ukraine, our partners, and American citizens. The Biden administration is requesting funding for several FBI initiatives in fiscal year 2025, including investments to restore and enhance the FBI's efforts to combat violent crime and cyber crime, and to enhance the FBI's counterintelligence and counterterrorism capabilities, among other initiatives. Director Wray, I look forward to hearing more from you about these and other priorities surrounding the FBI's budget request. Again, I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back to you. Mr. Rogers. We want now to recognize our witness, Director Wray, for an opening statement. Without objection, his written statement will be entered into the record, and I would ask him that we would like to see him keep his remarks to 5 minutes or less, so we can have additional time for questions. Director Wray. Mr. Wray. Thank you, and good afternoon, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cartwright, members of the committee. I'm proud to be here today representing the, roughly, 38,000 men and women who make up the FBI. Every day our people are working relentlessly to outpace our adversaries and to stay ahead of complex and evolving threats. So, I would like to start out by thanking you and the rest of the committee for your support over the years for our efforts to achieve our mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution. At the same time, I also realize the reality of the environment we are in today where so many agencies are dealing with tightening budgets. And this year, the FBI is one of those agencies--with our fiscal year 2024 budget having now come in almost $500 million below what the FBI needs just to sustain our 2023 efforts. And candidly, this could not have come at a worse time. When I sat here last year, I walked through how we were already in a heightened threat environment. Since then, we have seen the threat from foreign terrorists rise to a whole other level after October 7. We continue to see the cartels push fentanyl and other dangerous drugs into every corner of the country, claiming countless American lives. We have seen a spate of ransomware and other cyber attacks impacting parts of our critical infrastructure and businesses, both large and small. Violent crime--violent crime--which reached alarming levels coming out of the pandemic, remains far too high and is impacting far too many communities. China continues its relentless efforts to steal our intellectual property and most valuable information. And that is just scratching the surface. As I look back over my career in law enforcement, I would be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public safety and national security were so elevated all at once. But that is the case, as I sit here today. And while we have always found ways at the FBI to innovate and make the most with what we have, this is by no means a time to let up or dial back. This is a time when we need your support the most. We need all the tools, all the people, and all the resources required to tackle these threats to keep Americans safe. So, to take each of those in turn, the tools, the people, and the resources. First, an absolutely indispensable tool that Congress can give us in our fight against foreign adversaries is the reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It is critical in securing our Nation and we are in crunch time with our 702 authority set to expire next week. So, let me be clear: failure to reauthorize 702 or gutting it with some new kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous and put Americans' lives at risk. Second, we need people. And I will stack the FBI's workforce up against anyone, anywhere, anytime. They are innovative. They are efficient. They are relentless. They are professionals. They are patriots. And we have been fortunate at the FBI in recent years that our recruiting has gone through the roof. Americans are applying in droves to devote their lives to a career with us protecting others. But we need more positions to be able to bring all the good people we can to the fight--certainly not fewer. Now is not the time to cut back. It is time to lean forward. And third, we need resources, which you will see in the 2025 budget request that we are here today to discuss. So, we need funding to protect America from terrorism. I touched on this earlier, but there was already a heightened risk of violence in the United States before October 7th. Since then, we have seen a rogues' gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans and our allies. And given those calls for action, our most immediate concern has been that individuals or small groups will draw some kind of twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home. But now, increasingly concerning is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, akin to the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia concert hall just a couple of weeks ago. We also need funding to counter the threat from the People's Republic of China--a government sparing no expense in its quest to hack, lie, cheat, and steal its way to the top as a global superpower and to undermine our democracy and our economic success. We need funding to counter cyber threats, certainly those from China, but also from a crowded field of sophisticated hostile nation-states and criminals--nation-states like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. We need funding to mitigate the range of threats from the border--fentanyl, gangs like MS-13, and human trafficking. We need funding to address the violent crime that remains at levels in this country that are still too high. And we need funding to keep going after child predators and to rescue young victims from their tormenters. On all those areas I just mentioned, we are working closely with our partners at all levels of government to achieve our shared goal of keeping our communities safe. Every day, FBI agents, analysts, and professional staff are working shoulder- to-shoulder with thousands of task force officers from hundreds of different police departments and sheriffs' offices all over the country on our FBI-led task forces. On top of that, we provide technology and expertise, valuable leads, like DNA matches, and cutting-edge training to law enforcement nationwide to help them protect Americans from harm. So, cuts to us are cuts to our partners, state and local law enforcement agencies and officers who are on the ground putting themselves in the line of fire--often quite literally. And that is just one way those cuts are going to have real impacts on the American people. So, yes, we took a hit in the 2024 budget, but the 2025 budget is a chance to get back on track, to provide the FBI's men and women the tools and the resources the American people need us to have to keep them safe. So, thank you again for having me here today, and I look forward to our discussion.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Director Wray. We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witness. I will begin by recognizing myself. Director, has the Bureau observed any improvements in our efforts to dismantle the fentanyl pipeline? And what role can the Bureau play here? Mr. Wray. So, I would say it is a mixed bag. Certainly, the scourge of fentanyl is still claiming way, way, way too many lives. And I will tell you that, from the FBI's perspective, one of the things that we have been observing is that, in our takedown of violent gangs--which is, of course, something that we are doing all over the country all the time--we are noticing, almost without exception now, that those takedowns of violent gang members also include seizures of fentanyl. So, the fentanyl that is coming from the cartels, built on precursors from China, ending up all over the United States, is often being distributed, of course, by these violent street gangs. So, that is one of the things that we are observing. We are trying to do our part. This goes way beyond any one agency, and frankly, beyond law enforcement, as I know a lot of your efforts recognize. But some of the things that we at the FBI are doing to try to do our part, I will mention a few. Our Safe Streets Task Forces are going after the gangs that are distributing so much of this poison. Our organized crime, our TOC, Transnational Organized Crime Task Forces are going after the cartels. We have close to, I think, close to 400 investigations that go just after cartel leadership. We also have things like JCODE, which is an initiative where we bring together 12 agencies that is focused on the dark web trafficking of fentanyl and other dangerous substances, dismantling darknet marketplaces, when we do that. We have a prescription drug initiative. Because, of course, especially in certain parts of the country, pill mills and irresponsible prescribers of opioids are a driver of much of this epidemic. So, we are using our healthcare fraud expertise, for example, to try to go after some of those folks. We are working with our partners on the other side of the border. And there, I would say it is very uneven. We have had some instances where we have had a key arrest, an extradition, a key operation. We are starting to work with vetted teams down there, which is an important effort in the right direction, but we need much, much more than we are getting from the Mexican Government. So, I guess I would summarize my answer to your question by saying a lot of things to be encouraged by in terms of the effort and the work across multiple agencies people are making, but a lot of things to be very, very concerned about. Last year, I guess the last 2 years in a row--I will just leave it with this point--the FBI seized enough fentanyl to kill 270 million American people. And that gives you a sense of the scale of what we are up against. Mr. Rogers. When it comes to Mexico, what is the level of cooperation between our law enforcement agencies, especially when it comes to drug trafficking? Are they working with you in Mexico? Mr. Wray. Absolutely. I think one of the really bright spots that I see, especially when I compare it to earlier in my career, is how close the partnerships are across all levels of law enforcement. All the Federal agencies, State and local law enforcement is so intertwined with today's FBI; foreign law enforcement in a lot of instances; the intelligence community working with law enforcement. So, partnerships are in many ways stronger than ever, and that is one of the things that is keeping this from becoming an even worse problem. We work with, say, DEA on everything from OCDETF Strike Forces. We have DEA task force officers on a lot of our task forces, and vice versa. We work out at their SOD, where there is intelligence-sharing. So, there is a whole range of ways in which we all work together. Obviously, always room for improvement. We are always looking for ways to innovate and take that to the next level. But if there is one bright spot that I can leave the committee with, it is that the partnerships among law enforcement are in my career the best I have ever seen. Mr. Rogers. Well, is Mexico honoring our law enforcement efforts to bring the cartel leaders to justice? Mr. Wray. As I think I said earlier, uneven--uneven. So, we have had instances, individual instances, of successes, including events involving significant cartel figures and extraditions. But, then, the reality is that especially the two major cartels, Sinaloa and CJNG, are the drivers of the vast majority of what we are dealing with here. And we need more from the Mexican government. There are instances to be pleased about. We have had a top 10 fugitive, for example, of ours that they helped us arrest and send back recently. So, there are individual instances that are bright spots, but this is such a big problem; we need consistent, sustained, scalable assistance from them. Mr. Rogers. Well, that border is so open and unchecked, and we are letting in the cartels, who not only do drugs, but they do human trafficking and everything else in the book. And my observation is we are not getting enough cooperation out of the Mexican Government on seeking out the cartels. Can you agree or disagree with that? Mr. Wray. Well, the way I would put it is we certainly need more from the Mexican Government. I'm pleased with what we have gotten, but we need a lot more. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Chairman Rogers. I want to follow up Chairman Rogers' line of questioning, Director Wray. We are getting some cooperation from the Mexican authorities, but we need more, and it is what they are giving us is incomplete, is inconsistent. The question is, what can we do? What are we doing to encourage their cooperation? What more can we get out of them and what is the best way to approach that? Mr. Wray. So, I think, you know, much of this goes beyond sort of the FBI's lane, of course, in other parts of the government. I want to be mindful---- Mr. Cartwright. But your opinion matters. Mr. Wray . Mindful of trying to stay in my lane. But what I would say is we need their help cracking down on the cartels harder. We need help rooting out labs where the poison is being produced. We need help stopping the purchase and influx of precursor chemicals from the Chinese, from the PRC. So, those are a few things. As far as what more can we do, specifically, I would say, again, at the lower law enforcement kind of working level, there are any number of operations that show us what success could look like at scale. We have now started doing--which is something I'm pleased with, with the Mexicans--we now have sort of vetted law enforcement teams, much like we used to do, and still do, in Colombia. You know, kind of going back to the efforts that we have had with the Colombian Government over the years. I think that is a step in the right direction. But it is extraditions. It is sharing of information. And it is, like I said, the key is having it at a scaled, consistent, sustained level. It is not that there aren't bright spots, but we just need a lot more of it. Mr. Cartwright. Now, you mentioned going after the cartels and 400 separate investigations at the FBI involving them. What about what you just mentioned, interrupting the flow of precursor chemicals from China to Mexico? How many of those investigations centered on that effort? And how much more help do you need from the Mexican Government on that effort? Mr. Wray. Well, we certainly need more help from the Mexican Government on that part of it. We also, of course, frankly, need the Chinese Government to do a heck of a lot more than they are doing. I mean, you have this dangerous intersection of increasingly sophisticated Mexican cartels with malicious and unscrupulous actors in the PRC, who are all too happy to be supplying the chemicals that, then, fuel the cartels' production. We are trying to tackle it on a whole bunch of different levels. Our focus, going back over decades, in terms of the FBI's approach to organized crime, is to try to look for ways to dismantle the enterprise. And so, that means trying to go after the leadership, whether we are charging them or whether somebody else is charging them. That means trying to go after their money. A big part of this is going after--after all, this is a profit business for them. So, the more we can go after their assets through asset forfeiture and things like that, and go after their money- launderers--it doesn't work for them if they don't have people and institutions to launder their money. So, we are trying to kind of tackle the infrastructure around them, too, as opposed to just onsies/twosies in terms of arrests. So, that is the approach we are trying to take, but it very much has to be a team effort. Mr. Cartwright. And do you need more money to do that or less money? Mr. Wray. We need more money to do that. Mr. Cartwright. You need more money. Now, you mentioned takedowns of violent gangs, and you are noticing that it so often includes seizures of massive amounts of fentanyl. Am I correct in that? Mr. Wray. That is absolutely right. I think something like 75 percent of the fentanyl we are seizing is coming in gang takedowns, something in that magnitude. Mr. Cartwright. Now, tell me about these gangs. Are these American citizens? Mr. Wray. Most of the gangs themselves are neighborhood gangs. I mean, there are gangs that come from the Northern Triangle, like MS-13, and so forth, as well, but a lot of the takedowns that I'm describing that we are dismantling are, frankly, neighborhood gangs, who are then the ones peddling the fentanyl on the streets, not just in the border states, but all over the country. Mr. Cartwright. And how are they getting the fentanyl and the opioids from Mexico? Mr. Wray. I think that much of that is probably a question better directed to DHS. I can tell you--because most of our seizures are happening not at the ports of entry. They are happening after the stuff is already here somewhere inside the United States. We had a big takedown in New England, about as far away from the southern border as you could get, and some of the biggest takedown, I think, in New England history involving, you know, mountains of fentanyl. So, that is really where we are seeing it, but the actual traffic across the border and the ports of entry, you know, is DHS's lane. I know they have got a heck of a challenge on their hands, to put it mildly. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Director. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Director, for being here. I wanted to ask about, continue to ask about the border and your involvement at the border in assisting with identification of individuals. You would agree that it is a national security risk to allow individuals into the country who are not properly identified, correct? Mr. Wray. That does raise national security concerns, yes. Mr. Cline. Okay. The FBI has been engaged in DNA testing for several years of individuals crossing the border. In fact, DHS recently, or within the past few years, mandated that that identification occur, correct? Mr. Wray. Yes. Mr. Cline. And when DHS rolled out that program authorities found that about 19 percent of family units crossing were fraudulent. Does that sound about right? Mr. Wray. That part I don't--I don't have any reason to dispute it, but I--as I sit here right now I can't remember that specific piece. Mr. Cline. Okay. Mr. Wray. Yes. Mr. Cline. But failure to properly identify individuals coming across the border engaged in human trafficking, sex trafficking, child and sex trafficking are attempting to evade identification, correct? Mr. Wray. Right. I mean the whole identification piece of this, as I think you are rightly putting your finger on, is such an important part of it, and that is why, for example, we have--as trying to be good partners with DHS we have been providing them with DNA kits that then--our lab is the one who would then test. And it has proven to be critical in identifying murderers, rapists, and all sorts of, you know, dangerous individuals. Mr. Cline. But you have a shortfall, right? You have a backlog? Mr. Wray. And we have a backlog, and that backlog--because of the sheer volume at the border with the volume of people coming across the volume of the need for samples has gone skyrocketing as well. So there is a backlog and the backlog should be of concern to all of us. Mr. Cline. Do you think it would be appropriate or would address this national security risk, as you say, if we were to ensure that these individuals would not be released until their identification is complete? Mr. Wray. Well, certainly I think that is something we should be taking a look at. I mean, that gets into sort of DHS' authority so I am a little reluctant to, given the sheer number of things that on our plate, before I start weighing in on what should be on somebody else's plate. But I will tell you that we have any number of instances where somebody who is of concern-- where there wasn't adequate biometrics or other identification information at the time they came across, then later information is found that highlights why they are of concern. And then it is the FBI and our partners who have to then go try to find the person, take whatever action we can to disrupt the threat that that person poses. Mr. Cline. Okay. Rather than ask if it should be mandated, let me ask it this way: Would it improve security at our border to ensure that only those who have been properly identified are released into the country? Mr. Wray. At least as I sit here right now I don't see how that couldn't help. Mr. Cline. Okay. Thank you. I want to also ask about--you touched on it in your testimony, FISA section 702. You have said that a warrant requirement would gut, I think was your term--compliance with the fourth amendment would gut a tool that you have. Is that essentially---- Mr. Wray. Well, I did use the word ``gut,'' and I stand by it. I would say a couple things: First, when you say compliance with the fourth amendment, let's be clear, no court, as in none, has ever held that a warrant is required under the fourth amendment for the FBI to run queries of information that is already lawfully under--in our holdings under section 702. And the only courts to have addressed the issue have gone the other way. So that is one. Mr. Cline. But isn't that information--the intent of the law designed to provide the information of foreign nationals, not American citizens who are--and wouldn't that really be an end-run around the statute, as you say, to lawfully obtain this information? Mr. Wray. No. No. I appreciate the question. I think the purpose of Section 702 is to identify foreign threats to us, to Americans. And so when you have--I will give an example to illustrate the point: It is critical for our ability to identify foreign terrorist organizations communicating with, inspiring, or working with people here in the U.S. And that is how we identify and stop attacks. We had an example just last year where we had an individual, foreign terrorist overseas who had some kind of contact; not sure what it was at that point, with some person we believe to be in the United States. So we did a query. We ran a U.S. person query on that U.S. individual's identifiers. But at the time we ran that query we didn't know what we had. Could have--was it the equivalent of a wrong number, was it just innocuous chit-chat, or was it something that was concerning. Well because we were able to run the query--again, information already lawfully in our holdings, that is when we discovered, whoa, wait a minute, we got a live one here. This is serious. This is urgent. Investigation kicked in very quickly and within less than a month, within less than a month from that first query we were able to arrest the person who had by that time weapons, bomb making equipment, targets circled and everything else. And the point I would try to make here is that if we had had to get a warrant---- Mr. Cline. In a day. Mr. Wray . To run that initial query--no. No, sir. It doesn't work that way. Somebody's had to get warrants. If we had to get a warrant for that initial query there is no judge on the planet that would have given us a warrant based on what we knew at the time. All we knew at the time was foreign terrorist overseas, some kind of contact with some person in the U.S., no idea what it is about. Mr. Cline. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I have gone way over. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. You mentioned earlier DNA testing. As I understand it, in 2020 Department of Homeland Security mandated an expansion of DNA collections to essentially everyone coming across the border. Is that correct? Mr. Wray. That is my understanding. Mr. Rogers. And what is the purpose of taking DNA samples of all migrants? Mr. Wray. Well, I think there are multiple purposes. I mean, I think one of them, which goes to I think the question that Congressman Cline was asking about, is, you know, sometimes you have people who--we find a lot of times somebody that tries to reenter the country. They are deported, as they should have been, but then they try to reenter. And because we have the--and they come across, you know, in some other way and they turn up somewhere else. Because we have the DNA sample---- Mr. Rogers. But presumably doing DNA testing on all people entering the country at the border is to be able to find criminals among the lot. It is comparing the DNA test sample of that person against the national criminal records. Has that been effective? Have we caught criminals that way? Mr. Wray. Absolutely. It is two-prong: And the people who of course try to illegally reenter the country are also committing a crime. But I think the point you are getting at is a very important one, which is that this authority and the funding that this subcommittee has given us over the years on this has enabled us to identify, you know, rapists, murderers, any number of other dangerous criminals and crimes around the country. And so the DNA collection and the testing and the timely testing is critical to solving sometimes very heinous crimes here in the United States. Mr. Rogers. Well, in the 2024 budget we included the $53 million that you had requested to address the increase in numbers of DNA samples. And the border has become more open since that time with much more people coming across than before. And yet you made no request for money in fiscal 2025. What is going on? Mr. Wray. Well, partly what we have done is to try to prioritize that collection effort with the funds that the subcommittee has already given us. They key to our 2025 request is to try to restore the roughly 1,000-position cut that the net effect of the 2024 budget would have. That is what--in our judgment because we have had to make hard choices, very consistent with the spirit of your opening remarks, Mr. Chairman. And so that--we didn't want to take away money from the DNA collection and so we have--and in our budget request we are trying to restore the positions that go to everything from ransomware to violent crime to fentanyl interdiction to counterespionage against the Chinese. I could go on and on, but---- Mr. Rogers. Well, now there is a 15-month backlog on DNA testing. So by the time these people are tested and counted they are going to be long gone because you got that backlog. Mr. Wray. You will get no argument from me, sir, that the backlog is a negative development and that if this subcommittee were to give us more resources for more DNA testing, we could bring down that backlog even further. You mentioned hard choices. We got good funding from this subcommittee before for this particular effort and we haven't taken money away from it, but we have had to prioritize the significant hit that we took in terms of the impact on our personnel in the 2024 budget. And that is what you see. But if you would see fit to give us more money for it, I can assure you it will help. And the effort that the DNA collection is designed to accomplish is something that you and I both agree is extremely important. Mr. Rogers. Well, you make the request, we will take it up. Ms. Meng. Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Director Wray. I along with several of my colleagues in the House and Senate have previously communicated with the DOJ and FBI about the importance of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program's reports on hate crime statistics. I am concerned about the trend of a decrease in the number of local law enforcement agencies providing the FBI with incident data. This is the fifth year in a row that the number of local agencies providing data to the FBI has declined. I wanted to ask how your agency may be working with local law enforcement agencies to increase participation in this reporting system. Mr. Wray. So I think you are right to ask about the issue because one of the things we know about hate crime reporting, just in general as a starting point, is that it is chronically under-reported. And so for quite some time now we have been trying to engage in different forms of outreach to our law enforcement partners to make it easier for them to understand what to report and how to report it and so forth. And so that effort is continuing and we are always trying to find new and better ways to improve their responsiveness, if you will. The second thing that I think contributes to the trend that you are describing is the conversion to NIBRS, the National Incident-Based Reporting System. And of course that affects statistics not just on hate crimes, but on all sorts of other crime reporting as well. And the NIBRS transition is something that has been in the works for years and years and years. I mean, getting back to well before I became FBI Director. And we have been repeatedly telling state and local law enforcement this is coming, this is coming. And once it gets to the point where we have shifted over to that, you are only--that is the only way you are going to be able to report. But there are a lot of departments that haven't yet made the conversion to NIBRS reporting. Every year it has been going up. We are getting closer and closer where we need to be on that. And I should add that the NIBRS reporting system is something that all the major law enforcement associations wanted us to switch to. It is not something we just came up with on our own. But so in the meantime we are trying to work with them to supplement that reporting to make sure that, you know, any gaps in the completeness of the statistical picture are compensated for during this kind of transitionary period. So that--those are some of the things we are doing on that. Ms. Meng. Appreciate that. And then you know in recent years there was a rise in hate crimes committed against people of Asian descent. In fiscal year 2021, I was proud to partner with the DOJ to bolster federal data collection in response to hate crimes. I am concerned about language obstacles and what the FBI can maybe be doing more to reach those who may have limited English proficiency and also to make sure that we are increasingly building trust with local underrepresented communities. I don't want the DOJ and the FBI to lose the momentum of all the efforts that have been happening to reach communities like the Asian American community. Mr. Wray. So we agree with you that outreach to the community is an incredibly important part of the effort here. We have been doing I think over the last few years, you know, hundreds of training and liaison efforts with the AAPI community specifically, both locally and some nationally. We have some of the materials that we have produced that help people understand, you know, how to recognize hate crimes and, you know, what is--what it is and what it isn't, and, you know, how to report it and so forth. We have actually had it translated into multiple languages including all of the major-- the most common AAPI languages. And we have tried to have our people out in the community. I think one additional piece to this that doesn't always get connected up with the so-called--with sort of the hate crimes piece of it is what we call transnational repression, which is efforts by the Chinese Government, specifically the Chinese Communist Party, to harass, stalk, blackmail, or worse, you know, Chinese Americans and people of Chinese descent here. And so we have been trying to reach out to the same communities on that as well so that they understand that we are there for them and to try to help protect them against the common enemy, frankly, that we both have, or the common adversary I should say, namely the Chinese Communist Party. Ms. Meng. On that note I will end with I just want to make sure that the law enforcement agencies are also utilizing culturally competent trainings and--with their agents. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Director Wray. I will be honest with you; and this pains me to say this, but I don't trust you. I don't think that this is necessarily a funding problem that we have for your agency as much as a leadership problem. And between the lack of transparency in hearings like this and intel hearings your weaponization and politicization of issues and instruments of national security against innocent Americans and against institutions like churches and the fact that you have held no one truly accountable for prior FISA abuses that we have all seen and recognized--I think you yourself have acknowledged that there has been abuses. And because of the fact that as the FBI director that you stood relatively silent and passive about the biggest national security threat to our nation, that being our very open southern border, as the chairman has been discussing, I give very little credence in either your ability to do this job or frankly lead the brave agents below you. And I don't trust you to protect us. And that is a very difficult thing for me to say. It pains me to say that because your job is critically important to the safety of this nation and American lives. And I think because of your inability to lead and also shape the policies in the DOJ and at the White House we are now in a more precarious position than we were--I would submit than we were on September 10 of 2001. You yourself say in your written testimony that ``over the past year the threats facing our nation have escalated. The breadth of these threats and challenges are as complex as any time in our history and the consequences of not responding and countering these threats have never been greater.'' These are your words. And we don't only pay you to warn of us a threat, which you have eloquently done here, although that is important and appreciated that you are warning us, but we also pay you to prevent and protect us from the threats. And you are on--in an agency and I am on committees where I am your authorizer on the Intel Committee and I am your appropriator here on the CJS Subcommittee on Appropriations and I find it difficult to trust you to protect us. And any data or budget requests you bring to us as a result of that is, in my opinion, suspect. And in your nearly 20-pages of written testimony you have mentioned the southern border only approximately four times, and even then you kind of gloss over it. And we now have 7 million people in our country, 350 people on the FBI terror watch list who have been apprehended, plus another 1.7 million known got-aways here within our borders as a result of your leadership's border policies. And I say your leadership and not your bosses' because your bosses are the American people, right? Your customers are the American people. You work for them. You work for the people to protect them. So your leadership, the President of the United States, AG Garland, and Director of Homeland Security Mayorkas are literally intentionally putting the people that you work for, the average American citizen, to a clear and present danger situation that you yourself have acknowledged in your written testimony. So you have testified before the Intel Committee with worldwide threats briefs and other committees that there are giant red warning lights and warning signs and lots of flashing signs from a threat and terrorism assessment perspective. You know, and it is evident that you know and agree with this notion and that we should all be concerned, yet despite this you have been unable to change the policies driven by your leadership, by the President, the AG, DHS Mayorkas. And so it is difficult, but in addition to being untrustworthy you are also ineffective at a very important part of your job, which is shaping the policies that do affect national security. The open border should be the biggest challenge that your administration is recognizing right now and unfortunately is not. And I think your biggest problem personally is that it is not just me that doesn't trust you; it is the American people that don't trust you right now as a result of that. Can I just get a simple yes or no in response to this question? Does the open border policy make your job easier or harder? Are we safer or less safe as a result of the open border policy? Mr. Wray. I have been consistent over the years, frankly, in citing my concerns about the threats that emanate from the border. Mr. Garcia. Okay. Mr. Wray. And as to the long narrative that you went through at the beginning, needless to say I disagree very strongly with a number of aspects of it, but I recognize that we are time limited---- Mr. Garcia. I understand. In the interest of time I want you to acknowledge that the open border policy makes us more insecure than strong. So I want to know what have your discussions been with the President? Have you been able to go into his office and say, boss, this is--this open border policy is a galactically stupid policy from a national security perspective? Have you had that conversation? If so, what did that look like? What has been the response? And how are we shaping this to make us more secure in the future? Mr. Wray. Well, I am not going to get into specific conversations with people. I have been consistent in my message, externally and internally, about my concerns about the threats that are from the FBI's perspective that emanate from the border. Mr. Garcia. I am out of time, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, always for your leadership. And thanks to the ranking member. Director, I want to say that I do trust you, one, very, very grateful for your service on behalf of this entire country and the people who put their faith in you and the Federal Bureau of Investigations. And I frankly find it somewhat astonishing at this date and the age in which we live that the American leadership here at times questions the role of the FBI. I don't question it. I know you have a tough job and I appreciate all the incredible work that you do. If I may, I just wanted to--despite decreasing--and I think you mention in your testimony decreasing rates of homicide and non-fatal shootings. In my community of Rochester, New York, Upstate New York, we remain in a gun violence state of emergency. As you know, the passage of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act implemented changes in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, including a comprehensive background check on gun buyers under the age of 21 years old. In this fiscal year you are requesting 43 million to sustain implementation of that act as well as 8.4 million to support enhanced background checks, which includes funding to address provisions such as the under-21 background checks. And I just would ask, considering the critical role NICS plays in preventing firearms from reaching the wrong hands, can you just share with me how the budget request will allow the FBI to address these what I expect are, and assume are pretty labor-intensive enhancements to the operation of NICS as transactions continue to grow? Mr. Wray. So I appreciate the question. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act added a number of additional checks that NICS was responsible for conducting, specifically focused on as we would call it the U21 group--population. And this committee; and we are very grateful for that, helped get us at the time of the passage of the act funding to bring on board positions and make certain systems changes. But the problem is it was one- time funding. And so if we are going to sustain the work, then we need funding to continue it. And that is what you see reflected in the request here. It is both to continue those positions, because it is, as you say, very labor-intensive, but also for systems enhancements to have the human workforce have them be even more efficient in their work. I have been out there myself and sat with the operators who were doing the checks on a couple of occasions and to see--and so I can see kind of how labor-intensive it is. I am very pleased with the fact that they are already getting much, much faster at them. And I think that is only going to improve, but we still do need the funding. Again, the way to remember it is funding was there, but it was one-time funding and we just need the funding to sustain it. Otherwise, it sort of loses its effectiveness. Mr. Morelle. And that is going to be obviously an annual request then to be able to continue to maintain this and I suspect it may even require additional dollars in future years to be able to deal with the growing number of challenges that we have there. If I can, coordination and partnership between the FBI and state, local, and Tribal entities is integral to the security of communities across the nation. In my community the FBI leads the Rochester Area Major Crimes Task Force, the Child Exploitation Task Force, and the Joint Terrorism Task Force and participates in the Rochester Safe Streets Task Force. Considering your successful nationwide efforts alongside state and local law enforcement partners to combat violent crime could you describe how the proposed budget will further enhance and strengthen information sharing and coordination among not only the FBI, but all the--your local partners? Mr. Wray. So the biggest part of our budget request in 2025 is to restore the--and essentially the cuts that we endured in the 2025 budget, which there is no way to sustain without having an impact on our efforts on violent crime, on child exploitation, on a whole range of threats that we are responsible for protecting the American people from. And so the request will allow us to continue the good work that is being done in Upstate New York and elsewhere on gang violence, on child exploitation, on cyber attacks, on the cartels and organized crime, which as I said before, that is not just a border problem. It affects all 50 states. And we are seizing huge amounts of fentanyl all over the country. So all these things are incredibly important. Our folks are doing great work. On the violent crime side for example just last year we were arresting through our task forces 50 violent criminals and child predators per day, every day, all year long. So a cut means more bad guys on the street, more gangs terrorizing neighborhoods, more kids at risk, et cetera. Mr. Morelle. Yes. I see my time is expired. Mr. Chair, you are always very gracious. I appreciate it. Director, thank you for your continued service, sir. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Chairman Rogers. Director Wray, as I am sure you know, this week the House has been considering the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA. I have been deeply troubled with the abuse of section 702 of FISA in recent years and so your testimony today is very well timed. Thank you. So, Director Wray, does the FBI currently comply in every way with the current section 702 of FISA? Mr. Wray. My understanding is that we're in compliance with the law. Mr. Clyde. Okay. So, you think you do. All right. How do you respond to an unsealed document released by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on May 19, 2023, which states your agency, the FBI, illegally misused this tool more than 278,000 times between 2020 and early 2021? And, is this number of 278,000 abuses accurate? Mr. Wray. So, I appreciate the question. I'm glad to have the opportunity to clarify that. So, first off, I would say that that opinion covers activity, querying activity that occurs all before all these reforms that we've put in place. So, that's number one. Second, when that---- Mr. Clyde. When did you start putting those reforms in place? Mr. Wray. Maybe after---- Mr. Clyde. Was it after this? Mr. Wray. Mid-2022, somewhere in that range. Mr. Clyde. 2022 or 2023? Mr. Wray. They started in 2022. And, they kind of rolled into '23. Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. Mr. Wray. We obviously don't just flip a switch. Mr. Clyde. All right. Mr. Wray. But, the second thing I would say too, is when you look at the FISA Court, the same judges evaluating our compliance with 702, after all those reforms had been put in place, you see consistent compliance rates well into the high 90 percent range. And, the Court was actually commending the FBI for the improvements that they've seen because of the reforms. So, that's the second point. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Mr. Wray. The third point I would make too, the third point, and this is important, because you asked. A third point that is important is that the querying that you're talking about in that opinion that again, covers older activity, something like 99.7 percent of it would all have been prevented by the reforms that we've put in place. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Mr. Wray. And, on top of that---- Mr. Clyde. But what---- Mr. Wray. On top of that, the vast majority of those queries, the 278,000, are not actually 702 queries, much less noncompliance 702 queries. Mr. Clyde. Well, let me ask you this. This report ended in early 2021. And, you started in mid-2022. So, that would be an entire year. So, during that time frame, how many times did the FBI abuse its FISA authority? Do you know? Mr. Wray. I don't have any period of noncompliance that I can report here from that period. But, I can tell---- Mr. Clyde. Okay. Mr. Wray. But, I can tell you this, around the query that-- -- Mr. Clyde. Thank you for giving that. Mr. Wray. That covers the more recent period---- Mr. Clyde. As you know, the government agencies typically need a warrant issued by a judge before they can access American citizens' phone calls, texts, internet searches and emails. However, the government, in our opinion, has been able to query Section 702 acquired communications as an end run around the Fourth Amendment. My colleague, Andy Biggs, the Representative from Arizona, has an amendment to the current FISA Reauthorization that would require the government to obtain a warrant or to obtain a FISA Court Order prior to conducting a U.S. citizen query of information already collected through the 702 FISA Program. Now, you previously stated in a Senate Hearing in December that it would be unworkable to require the government to get a warrant before collecting Americans' private communications. Yet, former NSA lawyer, George Croner, recently estimated the warrant requirement would force the FBI to get about three warrants a day. Now, Director, you've got more than 30,000 employees that work for the FBI. Are you seriously saying that three warrants a day is too much of a burden for the FBI to protect our fourth amendment rights? Mr. Wray. That's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is number one, no court has found that the fourth amendment requires us to use a warrant to look at information, to query information that's already in our 702 holdings lawfully. And, the only courts to look at it, have gone the other way. That's one. Number 2, the problem with the warrant requirement goes beyond any kind of burden or delay that comes with it. A big part of the problem is that it's often only by running the query that we get to see the information that tells us whether or not we would need a warrant requirement in the first place. Because it is---- Mr. Clyde. All right. I've got one more question for you before my time runs out. All right. We have, looking at the breakdown of the FBI's $11.3 billion budget, like last year, almost 60 percent of the budget is categorized as defense spending and only 40 percent as non-defense spending. And, to me, that seems odd. I read your mission priorities, and I did not see any reference to DoD. I mean, the FBI is not part of the Department of Defense, and they are a domestic law enforcement agency. So, why is the FBI's budget categorized as 60 percent defense spending? Mr. Wray. I believe the answer to your question, and I'm not an appropriation's expert, but I believe the answer to your question is that it's what's the so-called NIP funding. Which is overseen by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. So, a significant chunk of our budget is considered defense spending because of its part of the intelligence community budget, if you will. Mr. Clyde. All right. Mr. Wray. So, it gets a little more complicated than that. But, I think that's the high level answer to your question. Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. My time has expired. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First thing I want to say, I think that your questions are important. And, I think, a lot of people who haven't been involved in law enforcement, are not sure what 702 is and all those issues. I was a former prosecutor, investigative prosecutor, I ran a strike force, so I know that. And, I've been working in the intel committee and defense my whole career here. And, it's been over 20 years. Now, and I think, you answered the questions. And, I think, those questions are right. That you would clean up 70--we've cleaned up 702, and it's really happening. I'm not happy with the comments. And, he's not here anymore and I'll talk to him personally, too just to criticize you. I've worked with different FBI agents, and you're as good as any of them. You're good, you're quality, and you're respected by your peers, and that's what's important. Now, we're in a serious situation in this country right now. And, you know, with respect to what's happening, you know, with China and what's happening with Russia and all these issues and I'm really, really worried about where we're going to go. And, I think we're at the worst spot. Republicans and Democrats are fighting each other all the time. And, this issue is both sides of the aisle as far as what's going on in the country. What I would like you to do, is talk about what FISA, 702, why it's so important. And, why it's one of the most dangerous issues we're dealing with. And, I think, the FBI is being caught up right now. And really, President Trump, people who are supporting him, they can support him, that's fine. And, I don't want to interfere with that. That's whatever you want to do. But, don't mess with the United States of America and our national security, because that's what you're doing. This is as serious as anything. I do a lot with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. I work with them also in this regard. This issue is one of the most important issues. So, could you please say why it's so important that we pass this and not get caught up in a Trump issue because he's mad. He authorized this law when he was President. So, come on. Let's not play the hypocrisy. Could you please tell the public at this point, or us, where we are and why it's so important? Mr. Wray. So, section 702 is indispensable in keeping Americans safe from a whole barrage of fast-moving foreign threats. It is crucial to identifying terrorists in the homeland, working with, or inspired by a rogues' gallery of foreign terrorist organizations who have publicly called for attacks against our country. It helps us find out who these terrorists are working with and what they're targeting. And, we may--and, what we need to stop them before they scare Americans. 702 is crucial when countries like China or Iran target dissidents and Americans here in the homeland. In Iran's case, literally even for things like kidnapping and assassination, 702 is what helps us know who to warn and help disrupt the plot. 702 is crucial to our ability to warn and protect our critical infrastructure from hackers in China, in Russia, Iran. Including cyber threats to our electricity, our water, our hospitals. So, if Congress lets 702 lapse, which it's set to do now next week, it will massively increase the risk of missing crucial intelligence during a time of heightened national security threats across a whole multiple of fronts. And, if we're blinded from seeing what our adversaries are doing, who they're working with, I can tell you, that's going too most definitely have consequences for our ability to protect the American people. Because, I can assure you that none of our adversaries are tying their own hands. So, now is not the time for us to hang up our gloves to take away tools that we need to punch back. And, failing to reauthorize 702, or gutting it with some kind of warrant requirement, would be dangerous and put American lives at risk. Mr. Ruppersberger. And, this is the Director of the FBI. I don't know anyone who knows this law that doesn't feel strongly about this issue with respect to 702. Mr. Wray. I would add to that, that there's a pattern across multiple administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. If you look at the professionals who have actually worked with this authority and dealt with these threats, from the working level to the presidentially appointed level, again, across administrations, including a whole range of my colleagues from the last administration. Because after all, I was nominated by President Trump and that is a--overwhelmingly confirmed without a single Republican Senator ever voting against me, whether I was nominated by President Bush or President Trump. Every single one of them supports the importance of 702. And, I think that should tell people something. Mr. Ruppersberger. Well, I thank you for our country and what you're doing. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman. And, thank you, Director, for your service to this great nation. I want to acknowledge the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force that recently was able to apprehend an individual in Idaho that had ISIS related ties. That's exactly the type of things we need to do to keep Americans safe. And so, thank you for your men and women and for that. My first question is, if FISA were to expire, would our southern border be more or less secure? Mr. Wray. I think if FISA were to expire, it adds one more challenge to our ability to secure us from foreign threats, including border related threats. Mr. Gonzales. I'll tell you, in my district, a lot of people talk about the border. I live the border. We are on the border every single day. So, people throw rocks from afar. We're the ones that have to live it. My next question is, have there been any cases where the DOJ prosecutors chose not to prosecute a case that your agency, that your bureau identified as a significant threat to the homeland or community interests? Mr. Wray. I can't think of a specific case as I'm sitting here right now. I will certainly tell you that disagreements between agents and prosecutors at the working level, are something that happens. It's a healthy discussion that happens all the time when we think we have enough, and the prosecutor doesn't think we have enough. I've seen that from both sides, having been a prosecutor too. But, I don't have any specific case that I can think of that fits this question. Mr. Gonzales. This is what I worry about. Is we have a case teed up that is identified as a security threat to the community or the homeland, and it doesn't get prosecuted and something bad happens. And, we look back and we see this. You know something's going to happen. It's only a matter of when. And, I don't want us to be going, playing armchair quarterback. How do we get ahead of some of these issues? And, I think, there needs to be a closer relationship with the prosecutors and the agents on the ground. Mr. Wray. One thing in that regard that we do, that I've seen a big change in the FBI since, again, I was somebody who was in FBI Headquarters on 9/11. So, I'm well familiar with a lot of this stuff. What I would say too, is today's FBI also works very closely with state and local prosecutors too. Mr. Gonzales. Sure. Mr. Wray. So, if there's ever an instance where a charge, you know, in the state system is a better way to quickly disrupt---- Mr. Gonzales. Sure. Mr. Wray. An attack, or we--we're not shy about working with local prosecutors and not just federal prosecutors. Mr. Gonzales. My next question, what is the FBI doing to combat the rise in transnational criminal organizations, specifically the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, TdA? Mr. Wray. So, we're certainly tracking that particular gang, TdA, as we would refer to it. We have Safe Streets Violent Gang Task Forces in all 56 of our field offices, which are focused specifically on gangs and other similar violent criminal enterprises. And, that's the vehicle through which we are looking at TdA. Whether it's leaders, members, associates. We have ongoing engagement with intelligence community partners, state and local law enforcement, in some cases foreign partners. You know, looking at whether it's their, you know, drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, you know, different kinds of violent crime, different kinds of trafficking and smuggling. Even things like organized retail theft. So, it's a real menu of different crime organizations. Mr. Gonzales. I would ask that you take a hard look at this. Because no one's talk--very few people are talking about TdA right now. In 3 years, we're going to be talking about TdA no different than we're talking about MS-13. And, it's going to be the communities that get ahead of it, that create these task forces, that utilize these task forces at the local, state, and federal level, to combat these Venezuelan gangs. Once again, I live the border. We're in year four of this. Year four is much different than year one. The people that are coming over are different people. They're different actors. To that point, I was just out in West Texas. I did a swing through West Texas. I am seeing a significant increase in oil theft in West Texas. All my sheriffs are asking for help. Are there any opportunities to expand the FBI Oil Theft Task Force? Mr. Wray. So, absolutely. We're very proud of the work that our West Texas offices are doing in terms of the Permian Basin Oil Field Task Force. It's created due to the fact that, I think, something like 40 percent of the oil in the U.S. comes from the West Texas region. And so, that task force, you know, has not only state and local law enforcement participation, but we also have, which is a bit innovative, cleared oil field security personnel, you know, that typically they're former law enforcement as well, but, also on the task force. And, it's a way to kind of track oil field crime to ensure that investigations move as quickly as, and as effectively as possible. It is complex and a form of crit--it's a form of critical infrastructure threats. And, it's something we're very focused on. Mr. Gonzales. Director, this is a threat that I'm seeing is correlated directly to the open border. I'm seeing more and more foreign nationals, in particular, Cubans that are here illegally, that are operating in this space. And so, we need once again, as this border crisis expands, we need to get ahead of this. And, I'd ask that you consider taking a hard look at that Oil Field Task Force. With that, Chairman, I'm out of time and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. I want to now recognize the Ranking Member of the full Committee, Ms. DeLauro. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright. My apologies for dashing in and eventually dashing out. There are several hearings, so I'm trying to make as many as I can. And, Director, so pleased that the President's budget for 2025 increases funding to hire additional FBI personnel. Helping to bolster your capacity to deter cyber crime, combat foreign intelligence activity against the U.S., and improve the national instant criminal background check system. And, I know my colleague, Mr. Morelle, discussed that issue. First of all, I should say, thank you to you for making a visit to New Haven, Connecticut, just, you know, just a few weeks ago. And, really delighted to have you there. It was the opportunity to be in a field office, if you will, and, to talk about the FBI's work in my state. And, to piggyback off of my colleague's comment, what I wanted to do, was to address the work with task forces. I view what you are doing with regard to State and local government is an overall infrastructure. Like, we have a public health infrastructure. We rely on state laboratories, et cetera. And, when you look at defunding those efforts, you look like at the collapse of the ability to move forward with regard, that the CDC has the inability to move forward. But, I think, sometimes I think, some of my colleagues are unaware of just how frequently the FBI works in very close partnership with state and local law enforcement, to be able to deal with crime. If you could talk about whether the lessons learned by both the FBI and state and local law enforcement, about ways in which the task forces that were mentioned, maximize that effectiveness in fighting crime. And, I don't know if there are any stories that are especially worth highlighting. But, I would finally add, what happens, because there are many, as you know, that would look to defund the FBI. And, there's a lot of discussion about that. Cut back on the resources. What does that mean to the support of that national infrastructure, if you will, that you rely on and they rely on you, in order to deal with violent crime and other things in the U.S.? If you could comment on that. Mr. Wray. So, I think one of the things that a lot of people don't fully appreciate, is how integrated today's FBI is with state and local law enforcement. And, how dependent, frankly, state and local law enforcement is on us when it comes to fulfilling our shared mission of keeping Americans safe. You mentioned the task forces. Through our Safe Streets and Violent Crime Task Forces, we've got thousands of police officers and sheriffs deputies, who--from hundreds of different departments and agencies that serve on our task forces. Taking, you know, as I said, I think earlier, last year together we took 50 violent criminals and child predators off the streets per day, every single day, all year long. Three hundred sixty-five days a year when you average it out. A cut to our budget means a cut to our efforts to do that work. Which means more of the burden then gets shifted on the state and local law enforcement to handle those threats alone. I could go the same on, the same thing through multiple other threats, because we have task forces on terrorism, cyber, child exploitation, et cetera. But, it's not just arrests. I think, if you talk to chiefs and sheriffs like I do every week, you will hear constantly a refrain about how much they depend on the FBI for things like our technology and our expertise. So, it's the DNA testing. It's cellular analysis. It's all sorts of complex forensic expertise that small departments in this country don't have. But, they lean on us to provide that. And, that's one of the first things that they cite. You talk about our CJIS Division in West Virginia, which is the one that is responsible for NCIC background checks when some officer is stopping somebody on the streets. That's how they know whether the person is dangerous or not. Or, fingerprint identification. Or, the threat reporting that comes into our National Threat Operations Center which are often threats to live school shootings, whatever else happens to be, that we're then pushing out to state and local law enforcement. Cuts to those programs mean those, all those ways that state and local law enforcement are flying blind. And then, you've got things like training, right? A lot of people don't know this, the FBI is, for example, responsible for training all the civilian bomb techs. The bomb techs for every police department in the country that have bomb techs, are trained by the FBI in our facility in Huntsville. And, cuts to our ability to provide that training, means impacts on our ability to train, you know, bomb tech personnel. There's all sorts of other training. We've got all sorts of training of State and local law enforcement at Quantico. And, I, as I said, I am talking with chiefs and sheriffs in one way or another, pretty much every week. And, there's only two ways the conversation goes. Thank you, Director, for all the great things the FBI is doing for us. We need even more. And just, Director, we need even more. I've yet to meet a chief or sheriff who wants the FBI to give them less. And so, I think, people need to understand that cuts to our budget don't just hurt the FBI. They hurt all those state and local law enforcement parties, many of whom, unlike the FBI, have recruiting challenges and retention challenges. They're all down in terms of their headcount. They've got their own budget challenges. So, hurting us compounds their challenges and makes it harder for them to protect the neighborhoods and communities that we're all working together to try to protect. Ms. DeLauro. I'll just make a final comment to you. I think it would be critically important for what you've just said, and for members to understand and maybe talk with, hear from, their local law enforcement folks. And, understand what the connection is between state and local law enforcement and the FBI. I think, we see a lot less movement in the direction of saying, let's defund, let's eliminate. Let's do all of these things, when we look at the overall law enforcement infrastructure of the United States, which is part of our national security and defending the homeland and doing whatever we want in that direction. Thank you so much for your service. I really appreciate it. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. Director Wray, a lot of it doesn't always get a lot of media coverage, but there's been a lot of hostility against churches and religious organizations at alarming rates over the last few years. There was a report that was published back in February of this year that showed that more than, there's been 430 incidences of hostility or violence against churches across the United States. That's a 100 percent increase from 2022 and 800 percent increase from 2018. I guess, my question to you is, what are the Bureau resources that are being dedicated to explore and address this concerning trend that we're seeing? Mr. Wray. So, that's a really good question. And, I would say the threats to houses of worship that we're seeing, cut across a variety of settings. And, I say that with the perspective of somebody who, when I was a line prosecutor, one of my most significant cases was against the guy who was a serial church arsonist. He went all over the country burning down churches, including, right up in our mutual neck of the woods, in Georgia, where he killed in Banks County, he killed, you know, a firefighter and almost killed another one. And, so, I've always taken those cases particularly seriously. I would say, there's a couple of things. We're seeing terrorist attacks against churches. We've, just in the time that I've been the Director, we've thwarted multiple attacks against churches and synagogues. I can think of an ISIS inspired plot against a church in Pittsburgh. I can think of synagogues in the Colorado and the Las Vegas area, just as a few examples. There's also, I would say, a range of threats from a perspective of abortion related violence. So, you know, a lot of people historically have focused on abortion related violence when it comes to pro choice facilities. But, in fact, if you look at our work, post the Dobbs opinion, it's been a while since I've looked at our numbers, but, I think, something like 70 percent of our abortion related violence cases after the Dobbs decision, were against what I would call houses of worship or pro life facilities. In fact, just yesterday, we had a case, a guy got seven and a half years in a great case that our folks did against a guy who firebombed a facility up in the Madison, Wisconsin area. So, we're tackling it depending on what the motivation for the threat is. You know, sometimes it might be some ISIS inspired type attack. Some cases it might be some domestic ideology. And, some cases it might be something else altogether. So, in addition to our investigative work and working with state and local law enforcement on that, we are also, in every field office, I find that there's a whole lot of outreach and engagement with houses of worship in that area, so that the folks in those houses of worship know who to contact, what to be on the lookout for, that kind of thing. Mr. Aderholt. Well, I just, you know, let me just say, you know, thank you for the mention of that. But, you know, targeting and threatening of churches and religious organizations is something that, that I've really noticed. And, I would just implore that you would make sure that you do investigate. And, you try to make sure that this is a focus of yours, and of the Bureau. The names, Phoenix, Holly, Harriet, Christopher X, Angel, they are the names that were given to the DC Five. Those were the five unborn children that remain, whose remains were salvaged by a whistleblower after their lives were brutally ended by a late term abortionist here in the Washington, DC area. There's evidence that suggests federal crimes may have been committed in their deaths through violations of the partial birth abortion ban and the born alive infant protections. As you know, the law, this is the law of the land. And, the Administration has the duty to enforce the law without prejudice to political philosophy or those in violation of the law. Instead of seeking justice for these babies or answering-- or answers to whether federal crimes were committed, I am concerned that some in the administration have decided to weaponize the FBI and its resources against pro-life Americans by investigating and arresting individuals for the FACE Act violations. Is the Bureau aware of the DC Five case? And, if so, is the Bureau investigating the DC Five case? Mr. Wray. As I sit here now, I'm not familiar with this specific case. I can follow up with our folks on that. I will tell you, when it comes to the FACE Act enforcement, we're generally, we've used that authority in, kind of in both directions. In fact, I know that we had a case not that long ago, where we secured the FACE Act and conspiracy indictments against four individuals who were invoking the Jane's Revenge movement and who targeted pro life facilities in their areas. So, we don't care which side of the abortion issue you're on. There's a right way and a wrong way to express your passionate views. But, violence and threats against facilities is not it. And then, we'll go after it no matter which side. So, there's that. Mr. Aderholt. Yes. Well, I'd like to get your commitment to use funds to investigate this DC Five case. Mr. Wray. Well, I'm happy to find out where we are with that. Like I said, I'm not familiar with this specific case. But, we obviously want to make sure that if there's any properly predicated investigation we can conduct, we'll do that. Mr. Aderholt. Yes. If you could get back with us and let us know what you all are doing on that. Thank you. Mr. Wray. Thank you. Mr. Aderholt. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Let me do a little polling here. Do we need a second round of questions? Anyone here? I want to keep it as short as we can because we want this gentleman back at work. So Mr. Clyde, you are on. Mr. Clyde. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Director Wray, on page 16 of your budget request, you talk about civil rights. So the FBI has the primary responsibility to investigate all alleged violations of federal civil rights laws. And then you talk about color of law violations in there, which is any person using the authority given to them by a government agency to willfully deprive someone of a right. So you talk about the FACE Act and voter suppression, etc. Have you ever investigated a Second Amendment rights violation? I mean, you have got the Bruen decision, which struck down a New York law which took away people's Second Amendment rights. And I have never seen anyone in government ever prosecuted for violating citizens' Second Amendment rights. Can you think of any time when the FBI has actually, you know, used color of law to prosecute someone for violating their--someone's second amendment rights? Mr. Wray. Well, not as I sit here. But obviously we are a 115-year-old organization with 30,000 employees and something like 300 offices all over the United States. So I have no doubt that there could be any number of investigations that I wouldn't be aware of. Mr. Clyde. Okay, all right. Then you have a request in your budget for $284,000 for official reception fund. That is almost six times what the United States Attorney himself receives. I mean, his is $50,000, the ATF is $36,000, the DEA is $90,000, U.S. Attorneys are $19,600. But the FBI is $284,000. Why? Why is the FBI's literally six times what Attorney General Merrick Garland's reception funds are? Mr. Wray. I don't know that I can tell you as I sit here right now. I know that we have a lot of engagement with foreign partners, and that could be a big driver. But I can't as I sit here right now give you the specifics. But I am happy to have my staff follow back up with you. Mr. Clyde. I would appreciate that very much. And then lastly, the Department of Justice is asking for a 1.25 percent increase, totaling $467 million, all right. But the FBI is asking for a 6 percent increase, totaling $629 million. So the FBI is asking for literally a 350 percent increase in funding, more than the overall Department of Justice is. In fact, if the total spending for the DOJ is going up 467 million, and the FBI is asking for $629 million, then the DOJ actually has to take a cut somewhere in order for the FBI to get their increase in funding of at least $162 million. So what on earth, what justifies that kind of an increase for the FBI? Mr. Wray. So what I would tell you is, and we certainly appreciate the Department's support, including the Attorney General's support, for our budget request. You know, the effect of the fiscal year 2024 budget that was appropriated to us is the equivalent of about 1,000-position cut. It is about a $500 million cut in our ability to get our job done. And so when you look across the range of threats that we are responsible for protecting Americans from, violent crime-- 50 bad guys per day, every day; ransomware--a hundred different ransomware variants that we are investigating. The Chinese--a 1300 percent increase in Chinese economic espionage; the Chinese hacking programs, which outnumbers us by well over 50 to 1; fentanyl--we seized 270 million persons' worth of fatal fentanyl in the last 2 years. And so the range of threats that the FBI is statutorily responsible for protecting Americans from is significant, and the impact of the 2024 budget is such that most of what our budget request that you have talked about there calls for is to put us back on track so we can keep doing the hard work of keeping bad guys away from those people. Mr. Clyde. Okay, so what are the technical adjustments? One hundred and ninety-two million dollars for technical adjustments and $286 million in adjustments to base. What is that? Mr. Wray. I think the adjustments to base is for appropriations speak for the point that I was just making about getting us back on track in terms of the positions that essentially we would lose because of the impact on our cost of operations of the 2024 budget. Mr. Clyde. And the technical adjustments? Mr. Wray. That part, again, I would have to go back and look at the specifics. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Mr. Wray. But I can tell you that most of our budget is to get us back on track. We have a few enhancements, specifically on cyber, counterintelligence, and NICS. But that is essentially the, this year, that is essentially our budget. Mr. Clyde. All right, thank you, my time is expired. I yield back, Mr. Chair. Mr. Rogers. I yield myself for five minutes. Mr. Director, let me ask you about these global terrorist networks that you have mentioned. You recently testified that the threats, ``have gone to a whole other level,'' and that foreign terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaeda, have renewed calls for attacks here in the U.S. Could you expand on that? Mr. Wray. Yes, sir. So first off, I would say even before October 7, I would have told you, and I was telling other committees, that we were at a heightened threat level because across a range of different terrorist vectors we were, like I said, at a heightened threat level. After October 7, though, is when we went to whole other level. And part of that is that we have seen a rogue's gallery of foreign terrorist organizations calling for attacks on us. You have got Hezbollah expressing support and praise for Hamas and threatening to attack U.S. interests in the region. You have got Al Qaeda issuing its most specific call for an attack against us, against the U.S., in the last five years. You have got AQAP, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, calling for jihadists to attack Americans and Jewish communities in the U.S. You have got ISIS urging its followers repeatedly to attack Jewish communities in the U.S. And the irony is that, as anybody who has studied terrorism knows, these are terrorist organizations that don't typically see eye to eye, but they seem to be united in one thing, which is calling for attacks on us. And so you add on top of that my concern, which I have repeatedly flagged, which is that when you look around the world at foreign terrorist organizations, you can see in Afghanistan the concern about whether it is Al Qaeda or ISIS-K, growing strength and reconstituting. And of course we have lost some of our ability to gather intelligence on the threat there. You can look at Africa and look at ISIS and Al Shabab and the growth of those organizations there. In fact, Al Shabab is now the best-funded branch of Al Qaeda. You could look at Syria, and ISIS' repeated efforts to free some very dangerous fighters that are in the prisons there. And so then you look at things like the attack we just had in Moscow, an attack in Iran before that, ISIS attacks. And so when organizations like Al Qaeda, like ISIS express an intent to conduct attacks against us, it is something we need to take very seriously. And so that is part of why I have highlighted this as a heightened threat. This is not a time for panic. It is a time for heightened vigilance. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Wray, the topic of anti-FBI rhetoric raised its head today, and I wish to associate myself with the comments of Mr. Ruppersberger that I am dismayed about it. And particularly that it found its way into today's hearing. And I regret that it has become fashionable in some corners to attack the FBI. This is an elite law enforcement agency, the top law enforcement agency in this country. Protects us from all manner of mayhem, from child predators, to cyber threats, drug trafficking, gang violence, international terrorism, Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Qaeda, ISIS, Al Shabab. These are men and women that have dedicated their lives to the protection of American citizens. They don't deserve to have threats leveled against them with anti-FBI rhetoric ginning them up. Last week, a man crashed an SUV into the security gate at the FBI's Atlanta field division building. He then resisted efforts by FBI agents to bring him into custody. Although this investigation is still underway, I am concerned about threats to FBI agents and FBI facilities in the field, particularly in light of anti-FBI rhetoric from far too many public officials. And I would like you to comment on that. To what extent are you seeing an uptick in threats against the FBI, and what does that do to morale within the agency? Mr. Wray. Well, you asked a couple different questions there. I guess let me start with the threats, because that is ultimately what matters the most. You know, rhetoric is rhetoric, and there is a lot of heated rhetoric in this country across a range of issues. But when it comes to threats and threats of violence, that is something we take extremely seriously. And we have seen a substantial jump in threats towards FBI personnel and facilities from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023. In fact, we created a dedicated unit to try to deal with those issues. You mentioned the Atlanta field office one. I won't discuss that specific case. But just last year in our Cincinnati field office, we had an individual wearing a tactical vest armed with an AR-style rifle and a nail gun that tried to forcibly enter and attack our personnel. And after he was thwarted, in reviewing his devices and his postings, he was calling on people to kill federal law enforcement, and to fight, in his own words, a civil war. Unfortunately, this is part of a broader phenomenon and that we see in the country right now, which is an uptick in violence against law enforcement. Not just FBI, but state and local law enforcement. And we have had breathtaking paces of violence against law enforcement. Having a badge is dangerous enough as it is. It shouldn't make somebody a target. And some of these threats target law enforcement's family members, which is despicable. Like I said, these are dangerous jobs. And I talk every week, one of the things--to state and local law enforcement are going through a lot of the same thing in their own way. I call every--one of the things I started doing when I started this job was every time an officer or a sheriff's deputy is killed anywhere in the country in the line of duty, I call the chief or the sheriff myself to express my condolences on behalf of the FBI. And we talk about the individual's family and career and everything else. And I have made 381 of those calls since I started as FBI Director, 14 just so far this year. We have lost, in 2021, we lost three of our own. Two agents killed in Miami and a task force officer ambushed right outside of our office in Terre Haute, Indiana. So violence against law enforcement is real. It is appalling, and it is something we take very seriously. Now, when you talk about morale, which is the other part of your question, obviously no one likes to see the organization you have dedicated your lives to unfairly attacked and criticized. But our people are more focused on the people we do the work with, the people we do the work for, and the work itself. And I don't get too hung up and I think our folks don't get too hung up on rhetoric. Our focus is on do people want to work with us. You bet they do. They are applying in droves. It has gone up, recruiting has gone up significantly since I have been director. Do they want to work with us on task forces? State and local police departments, who are all down in terms of their head count, are sending more and more task force officers to work on our task forces, and it sure as heck isn't because they don't have enough work in their home department. Do people want to turn to us for help? You bet they do. I see business leaders more and more turning to us with cyber attacks and Chinese economic espionage. I see the public calling our public access line in West Virginia. More and more are turning to us for all manner of tips and threats. It is almost like we have sort of defaulted into becoming like a national 911 center. So do people want to work for us? More and more. Do people want to work with us? More and more. Do people want to turn to us for help? More and more. And so that ultimately is what our folks really care about. Would we prefer not to be criticized? Of course. Mr. Cartwright. Director Wray, thank you for your comments and thank you for your work. Yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Cline, do you desire time? Mr. Cline. Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Rogers. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Cline. And I want to thank the large number of law- abiding agents within your agency who work hard for the American people every day. But we can't ignore the violations that have occurred within the FBI by some individuals and the policy changes that were necessitated by those abuses. And for some on the other side to talk about anti-law enforcement rhetoric when morale is at an all-time low in local law enforcement offices because of the defund-the-police movement on the left, it is rich. It is rich to hear this come from the other side. So my colleague who spoke critically about the performance of some in your agency, Mr. Wray, was doing so with a love for country, a love for the Constitution, and a desire to see the confidence of the American people in their institutions restored after it has been so eroded by the performance of some within your agency acting in violation of the law and in violation of policies. So I am happy to take up what amounts to a large chunk of my time to stand up for my colleagues who have left and who are under criticism from members of this very subcommittee and to restate that there is a First Amendment. We have a right to criticize when there is evidence of wrongdoing. We have a responsibility to the taxpayers of this country when there are individuals within your agency who violate the rights of American citizens. And so I needed to stand up for my colleague, and I do want to. But I do want to ask, as part of FISA, I have an amendment that would codify a policy of the Bureau related to abouts collection. Abouts. So the FBI has decided not to engage in what amounts to collection of upstream communication from companies that operate internet cables that interconnect with ISPs' local networks to include the collections of communications about a target. Why did you all stop abouts collection? Mr. Wray. Well, I will confess to you it has been a little while since I looked at that issue. It was very much on our mind back around the time of the last reauthorization, as I recall. I think, again, my memory is not perfect on this, but I think it was a judgment that the benefits from having that were outweighed by, in our view, the potential that the authority could result in a compliance violation of some sort. Again, my memory is a little fuzzy on that, so with that big caveat. Mr. Cline. Do you have any intention of resuming abouts collection at this time? Mr. Wray. No. Mr. Cline. A since-declassified set of FISA court opinions from 2011 shed a light on the pervasiveness of the collection at the time and noted that it resulted in tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications collected each year do to what was described as technical limitations in the implementation of abouts collection. So would it in any way interfere with department policy or activities to codify the practice of the FBI and their suspension of abouts collection? Mr. Wray. Well, again, without--I would have to review any specific legislative proposal. We have tried to put in place a whole range of policies and system enhancements. And I think the effort in a number of the legislative reform proposals that are swirling around up in Congress right now are intended to-- similar language to what you are using, to sort of lock in reforms that we have put in place. And I think as a general matter, that is something that we are in favor of. But the specific issue, I would have to take a closer look. But we are happy to do that. Mr. Cline. I appreciate that. Yield back. Mr. Rogers. Does Mr. Ruppersberger---- Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes, I would respond to a couple comments. First thing, let me say this: I respect everybody on this board, in this hearing. We all have different points of view, we look at things differently. But I also look at the big picture too. My speciality throughout my life, most of it, other than being account executive or something, has been law enforcement. And when you are in law enforcement, you are trained, you develop relationships, and you learn. And one of the most important things is for Federal, State, and local to work together. And I think that the comments that were made--and I respect that individual, I said that before. I even talked about it. And I do respect him because he is a hard worker, he served at the Naval Academy. And I was just shocked that his whole, the whole five minutes or whatever he had, it was in criticizing someone who I happen to respect and I think a lot of other people respect, who has one of the hardest jobs in America. What bothers me is that we are probably in one of the worst situations for national security in the history of our country, and he is a major part of dealing with those issues. And I would hope that someone with his expertise and smarts, and he is very smart, and I will talk to him personally because I know him personally. But would spend doing this and not talk about what are we going to do with this issue, or this, which everyone else here has talked to him about. And I just was shocked. And believe it, I get probably more heat from my left than I get from you all. And but that is just my politics, and that is the way each one of us has our point of view. Mr. Clyde, he didn't--in the beginning when he started, he asked good questions. He didn't have the experience that some of us have in law enforcement or dealing with you all and that type of thing. But at least you tried, you wanted to know, you asked good questions. And I respect that. Whatever your conclusion is, I respect it. I might not like it, but I respect. So I just wanted to respond a little bit on why I felt it was really important to stand up for somebody who I think is qualified. He is doing a good job. And the FBI has really, in my opinion, grown. And I love the fact that they are now working with federal, state, and local as a team, and that makes them a lot better. Mr. Rogers. Gentleman yield back? Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes, I do. Mr. Rogers. That concludes today's hearing. We want to thank our witness, Director Wray, for being here. Without objection, members may have seven days to submit additional questions for the record. The subcommittee now stands adjourned. Tuesday, April 16, 2024. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WITNESS MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL Mr. Rogers. The subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. Today, we welcome the Attorney General of the United States, the Honorable Merrick Garland, to our subcommittee to testify on the Department of Justice's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request. The Department requests about $38 billion in discretionary sources, an increase of nearly 2 percent over the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Once again, the Department's budget submission uses themes such as ``upholding the rule of law'' and ``keeping our country safe.'' It is the job of Congress to examine whether agency priorities line up with these themes and fund the Department appropriately and accordingly. Unfortunately, the Department's budget underwhelms and has not thoughtfully identified areas where strategic reductions could be made, aside from aid to local law enforcement. I am not advocating for arbitrary, large-scale reductions that would make the Department ineffective and our country less safe. However, I do believe that robust law enforcement and strategic reductions are not conflicting goals. It just requires hard work and thoughtful prioritization. So let's examine the Department's fiscal year 2025 priorities. The Department prioritizes combating drug trafficking and preventing overdose deaths, and you know that the fentanyl epidemic accounts for some two-thirds of the more than 110,000 drug overdose deaths each year. While the submission rightly highlights ``defeating drug cartels and combating the drug poisoning epidemic and communities,'' the budget puts a department-wide emphasis on equipping federal agents with body cameras. Drug cartels and their crime syndicates in the United States must be decimated, period. The death and devastation the cartels and gangs are inflicting on American families and bringing them to justice ought to be the Department's top priority. Whether the agent doing the decimating has a camera attached to them is secondary by far. Despite this administration's best efforts to push the issue to the back burner, the Biden border crisis continues and shows no signs of stopping. People and drugs continue to flow across the southern border in blatant contravention of our laws. In an ever-evolving situation last year, 50 times more Chinese citizens were apprehended illegally from Mexico, compared to 2 years ago, 50 times worse. When land owners attempt to protect their life and property, they end up being arrested. When will this madness stop? Perhaps when this administration takes the cuffs off law enforcement and allows them to do their job. Next, the Department prioritizes combating violent crime and gun violence. In their 2023 violent crime survey, the Major City Chiefs Association noted a decrease in homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault in American cities. However, these decreases were slight and the numbers remain unacceptably high. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that this change in direction signifies a lasting ``about face'' by those who embrace the Defund the Police Movement and vindication for those of us who decried it from the very beginning. With the trends for now seeming to go in the right direction, it confounds me that the Department seeks to cut law enforcement assistance, including reductions to state and local law enforcement assistance grants and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. Another priority listed by the Department is protecting national security by countering terrorism, cyber threats, and nation state threats. To that end, I will commend the National Security Division for acknowledging in their budget submission the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel by the terror group Hamas, noting that the attack has led to an increase in ``terrorism-related conduct,'' both domestically and overseas. Such a warning has taken on greater importance in recent weeks as chants of Death to America are no longer confined to Middle Eastern capitals, but are now being heard on American streets. If such chants are not ``terrorism-related conduct,'' I tell you, it is pretty close. I would like to hear if the Attorney General agrees in what action the Department might take regarding these developments aside from issuing statements of condemnation. The Department of Justice, over the last four years, has picked sides on prosecuting and ultimately failed to uphold the rule of law equally and fairly when it comes to American citizens and even American businesses. It is not surprising that two phrases notably absent from the budget request are ``equal justice under law'' and ``respect for separation of powers.'' In closing, Mr. Attorney General, where we can find agreement, you will find support here. But when priorities diverge and agency actions are at odds with what we consider good government and common sense, we will respond accordingly. We recognize you have an incredibly demanding job. I appreciate your being here today. We look forward to working with the ranking member and all members of the subcommittee to appropriately fund the important missions of the Department of Justice as this year's appropriations process moves forward. At this time, I want to recognize Mr. Cartwright for any remarks he may wish to make. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Chairman Rogers, and I would like to echo you in welcoming Attorney General Merrick Garland back to this subcommittee to discuss the Department of Justice's fiscal year 2025 budget request. AG Garland, I thank you for your continued leadership at the Department of Justice for leading the men and women who work tirelessly to continue the pursuit of truth and justice. Resources provided to the Justice Department are and will continue to be under a microscope, but the mission of the Justice Department remains unchanged. I look forward to working with you to ensure we are making smart investments to keep our communities safe. Just last week, FBI Director Wray was before us and we heard about the real challenges that the FBI, along with its state, local and Tribal law enforcement partners are facing, especially in keeping deadly fentanyl off our streets. I heard him clearly. State and local law enforcement are asking for more support from the FBI, not less, and I trust that could be said for many other bureaus of the Department as well. Further, the defense of our national security and mitigation of emerging foreign and domestic threats including cyber, is critical. I view it as the main mission, our paramount responsibility keeping Americans safe here in Congress and the Department's role in upholding the rule of law and preserving our democratic values for free and fair elections cannot be understated. To carry out the Department's broad missions, your fiscal year 2025 budget request seeks $38.9 billion in discretionary funding, a 5 percent increase above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. Your request prioritizes funding for the over 100,000 employees of the Department of Justice and makes vital increases to every federal law enforcement agency and the U.S. Attorney's Offices. You have requested a strong increase for the Violence Against Women Act grants, as well as strong increases for COPS hiring grants, and the Byrne Justice Assistance grants formula funding for state and local law enforcement. And I look forward to working with Chairman Rogers and you, Attorney General Garland, on ensuring that we sustain investments that our State and local law enforcement partners rely on. Congress cannot ignore the challenges that our communities face back at home. Attorney General Garland, once again, welcome. Thank you for being here. I look forward to your testimony and working with you on ensuring that we provide what the Department of Justice needs for fiscal year 2025. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Attorney General, you are now recognized for an opening statement. Without objection, your written statement will be entered into the record. I would ask that you try to keep your statement to 5 minutes or thereabouts so we can have additional time for questions from the panel. Attorney General Garland. Thank you, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cartwright, and distinguished members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to discuss the Justice Department's funding requests for fiscal year 2025. Since I last appeared before you, more than 115,000 public servants who make up the Justice Department have continued to work tirelessly to fulfill our mission, keep our country safe, protect civil rights, and to uphold the rule of law. Over the past year, our U.S. Attorneys' Offices, law enforcement agents, and grantmaking experts have worked together with police and community partners across the country to help drive down violent crime. We have zeroed in on the individuals and gangs responsible for the greatest violence, made critical investments in police departments to hire more officers, and dedicated resources to initiatives aimed at preventing and disrupting violence before it occurs. We have gone after the cartels responsible for trafficking deadly fentanyl into our communities and brought their leaders to justice here in the United States. We have prosecuted fraud, recovered funds stolen from American taxpayers, and challenged illegal monopolies that hurt consumers and workers. We have worked to defend the reproductive freedoms that are protected by Federal law and to monitor laws and actions that infringe on those protections. We have worked to combat a disturbing spike in threats of violence against those who serve the public, against judges, police officers, members of Congress, and even against our own employees. We have worked to aggressively investigate, prosecute, and disrupt the hate crimes that not only harm individuals, but strike fear across communities. And in everything we do, we have worked to ensure the equal protection of law that is foundational to our democracy. I am proud of the work we have done. And I am deeply proud of the way the Department's public servants from our agents to our attorneys to our administrative staff have gone about their work. They have conducted themselves in a way that would make the American people proud. But we recognize that we have so much more to do. Our fiscal year 2025 budget request reflects the difficult budget environment we are in and the extremely difficult budget choices we have had to make because of it. It also reflects the resources that we need now more than ever to continue our work. When I became Attorney General three years ago, I knew that grappling with the violent crime that surged during the pandemic would be one of the greatest challenges we would face at the Justice Department. I am glad to be able to report that last year, we saw a significant decrease in overall violent crime across the country compared to the previous year, including an over 13 percent decline in homicides. That is the largest one-year decline in homicides in over 30 years. And data indicates that this decline is continuing. As the Wall Street Journal reported just this week, in the first three months of this year, homicides dropped 20 percent across 133 cities compared to the same period last year. But I want to be very clear. There is no acceptable level of violent crime. Too many communities are still struggling and too many people are still scared. The hard-fought progress we are seeing can easily slip away, so we must remain focused and vigilant. To continue our efforts to drive down violent crime and to help keep our country safe from a range of threats, we are seeking a total of $21 billion to support the efforts of the FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshal Service, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, as well as the Criminal Division and the National Security Division. We will use these resources to continue our fight against gun violence, to prosecute illegal gun traffickers and straw purchasers, and to invest in advanced technological tools like ballistics analysis, firearms tracing, gun intelligence centers, and local fusion cells. We will use these resources to strengthen our work to counter both foreign and domestic terrorism. As the FBI Director has testified, we are facing an increasing threat of foreign terrorism since October 7th. We will also use these resources to continue to counter the threats that the Governments of Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea pose to our national security and our economic stability, and we will use these resources to continue our efforts to dismantle the global fentanyl supply chain and to break apart the cartels that are responsible for flooding poison into our communities. As we deploy our own prosecutorial and investigative resources, we also recognize that the Department's partnerships have been and will continue to be some of the most powerful tools we have to battle violent crime. That is why we are seeking investments in the Department's three grantmaking components, the Office of Justice Programs, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, and the Office on Violence Against Women. They provide direct support to community and law enforcement partners through more than 200 grant programs. Our budget requests more than $4.3 billion to support the public safety efforts of our state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement and community partners. Of that amount, we are requesting $2.5 billion for our COPS hiring program to support law enforcement agencies across the country in their efforts to hire full time law enforcement professionals. And we are requesting $120.5 million as part of our new Violent Crime Reduction and Prevention Fund to fund 940 detectives at the state and local level. As I have noted before, when the Justice Department was founded in 1870, one of its principal purposes was to protect civil rights. Today, protecting the safety and the civil rights of everyone in this country remains our urgent obligation. Our budget seeks $201.3 million for the Civil Rights Division to continue its essential work, including its efforts to deter and prosecute hate crimes, to ensure constitutional policing, to enforce federal laws prohibiting discrimination in all its forms, and to protect the right of all eligible citizens to vote and to have that vote counted. The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy. Protecting that right also requires us to protect the citizens who we rely on to fairly administer voting. Our democracy cannot function if officials, workers, and volunteers who administer our elections have to fear for their lives just for doing their jobs. The Justice Department is aggressively investigating and prosecuting those who threaten election workers with violence and we will continue to do so. As I said, I am extremely proud of the Department's employees who are doing the work necessary to advance the Department's mission. Every day, their work brings them face- to-face with some of our country's greatest challenges. Every day, many of them risk their lives to protect the public. I am grateful to them. I respectfully ask for your support for the President's fiscal year 2025 budget request so that we can continue our work on behalf of the American people.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Attorney General Garland. We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witness. I will begin by recognizing myself. You mentioned in your testimony about being here last year at this time. This time last year, too, there were 112,000 people who died because of our inability to stop the flow of fentanyl especially. Most recent data from CDC shows that from May 2022 to May 2023 for the first time in American history over 112,000 Americans died from a drug overdose, 2200 of those from the State of Kentucky alone. Fentanyl remains the primary driver of that increase in overdose deaths and young Americans have been particularly hard hit. For teenagers, 84 percent of fatal overdoses involved fentanyl, almost all. Last week, Director Wray, the FBI Director, was testifying here. When he said that ``the last 2 years in a row, the FBI seized enough fentanyl to kill 270 million American people.'' There can be no doubt that a tragically high amount of narcotics are slipping through our southern border and the border crisis created by this administration is a dream scenario for cartels. They have never had it so good. The Department's budget submission has listed combating drug trafficking and preventing overdose deaths as a top priority. With multiple agencies and components within the Department of Justice implementing strategies to counter fentanyl, how are you assuring and ensuring that agencies don't silo their intelligence and that these efforts complement rather than inhibit each other? Attorney General Garland. It is a very important point, Mr. Chairman. Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat this country has ever faced, both because it is extraordinarily cheap to make, extraordinarily profitable to sell, and because how often it can be fatal. As the DEA has said in its public affairs campaign, just one pill can kill. So the Justice Department and the Government as a whole, is an all-government and all- department approach to this question. And you are exactly right. We have to prevent any kind of siloing. So FBI, DEA, Marshals, OCDETF, Criminal Division, Civil Division, and our grants to local and state government law enforcement are all combined to work together to battle this scourge. It begins with the precursor companies in China. You can't make the fentanyl without the precursors. So we are doing everything we can. We have charged, indicted the precursor companies. The Treasury Department has sanctions the precursor companies. The precursors then move into Mexico. I have personally traveled to Mexico three times. The Deputy Attorney General, I believe, has also traveled at least three times. Other high- government officials have traveled to persuade the Mexican Government to put controls on the precursors and to stop the precursors from coming in. In Mexico, we are working with the Mexican Marines and the Mexican Army to destroy the labs and to take down the cartels and in particular, to get assistance in the extradition of the cartel members who we have indicted in the United States. We have indicted dozens of members of the Mexican cartels. We have obtained successful extraditions of people like Ovidio Guzman who was one of the Chapitos, son of El Chapo. We have gotten some support in bringing these people into the United States. And the next thing that happens is exactly as you say. It crosses our southern border. As the Secretary of Homeland Security has testified, most of this comes through the ports of entry crossing the border. And what is necessary at that point is for more money for the Department of Homeland Security. I hate to be here asking for money for another department, but if we are going to stop fentanyl from coming in, they need those large x-ray machines, the fast x-ray machines that can look at these trucks and these SUVs and these passenger cars as they come across the border. Then FBI and DEA in the United States picks up the traffickers once they come into the United States and in combined operations including work from the Marshals and the U.S. Attorney's Offices, investigates using the latest investigative tools and prosecutes. The DEA has at the very end of the line a public affairs campaign. We have to cut off the demand as well, and that is why we emphasize that one pill can kill. That is why I went to DEA headquarters and met with the families, the very kind of families that you are talking about, young people who have died taking a pill they had no idea it was fentanyl. Mr. Rogers. Attorney General, what percentage of your drug trafficking work, what percent is tied to illegal smuggling from Mexico? Attorney General Garland. I can't give a number in that regard, but as I said, the vast majority of fentanyl comes into the United States, smuggled in trucks and cars coming across ports of entry. That is what the Department of Homeland Security has identified. Mr. Rogers. Do be even clearer, would your counter drug efforts be even more successful if we had complete control of our southern border? Attorney General Garland. If we had the x-ray machines and other investigative devices necessary to detect fentanyl as it was coming across the border, absolutely. We could cut off that flow. That would vastly decrease--the other ways that people will try to get in, through the mail, through shipping, et cetera, but if we could cut off fentanyl crossing the border using these new technologies, that would make an enormous dent in the dangerous poison that is flooding our cities. Mr. Rogers. Last week, we had FBI Director Wray sitting in the seat you now occupy. He noted that he wished there was more cooperation from Mexico about drug trafficking. From a Department-wide, counter-drug perspective, what is the level of cooperation we are receiving or not from Mexico? Attorney General Garland. I would echo what the Director said. I wish there were more cooperation. We are getting cooperation. We have had extraditions. They have destroyed some labs. They have reduced precursors coming into the country, but we need much, much more cooperation. Mr. Rogers. As I understand it, the current Mexican Government has severely constrained DOJ's ability to work alongside their Mexican counterparts to disrupt the cartels. What is the Department and this administration doing to restore full law enforcement partnerships with Mexican partners? Attorney General Garland. So the FBI is, I think as the Director testified, has been successful in setting up some vetted teams. I have personally gone to Mexico with the Attorney General to re-up the degree of cooperation that had previously existed with the DEA. I would say I have not been completely successful in that effort yet, but I am persistent and I will not give up until the cooperation with DEA is as fulsome as possible. Mr. Rogers. There are people, based on that lack of a border control, who say that the Mexican Government really is complicit with the cartels. Would you say that? Attorney General Garland. I don't want to comment on that specifically. The cartels are enormously profitable. They have more money than some nation states and there are places in Mexico where it is difficult to deal with the cartels. I will say that when Mexican law enforcement and particularly the naval forces, the marines, and the army have gone to arrest people that we have extradited, this has come at enormous loss to them as well. I called the Secretary of the Navy there to give them my condolences for the deaths of marines in connection with the arrest of Ovidio. They have a very difficult job as we do. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Attorney General Garland, it didn't escape my notice that you commented on crime statistics a little bit in your opening statement. Is that correct? Attorney General Garland. Yes. Mr. Cartwright. And we keep track of crime statistics here in the United States, not just Federal crimes, but all state and local crimes. We keep track of violent crimes. We keep track of crimes against property. Am I correct in that? Attorney General Garland. Yes, that's what the FBI's uniform crime reports now, the NIBRS reports. Mr. Cartwright. And you said homicides dropped more last year than any other year in the last 30 years. Is that right? Attorney General Garland. That's right. Mr. Cartwright. It's not just limited to a drop in homicide, though, is it, Attorney General Garland? Attorney General Garland. No. The FBI shows a decrease in violent crime across the board as well. Mr. Cartwright. And it is not just limited to a decrease in violent crime. Yesterday, a reputable analytics company came out with a report that reviewed all of the national information on crime. And if you separate out violent crime versus property crime, take violent crime. He noted violent crime is down a considerable amount--violent crime, including murder down, manslaughter down, rape down, robbery down, aggravated assault down, all of them down a considerable amount, and then, even into property crime, with the exception of motor vehicle theft, burglary down, larceny theft down, all of these down a considerable amount. Am I stating that correctly, Attorney General Garland? Attorney General Garland. You are. Obviously, there's differences in different places in the country, and some have gone up and some have gone down, but those are overall numbers. I also want to say I think I understated the success on homicide. It's actually the largest reduction in 50 years. Mr. Cartwright. It is down more than any other year in the last 50 years? Attorney General Garland. Right. I think I said 30, but 50 I think is the correct number. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you for the correction, Attorney General Garland. And thank you for the good, hard work of solid police work and solid prosecutorial work done not only by the Department of Justice, but also by the State and local police and prosecutors. That is who deserves the credit for this, isn't it? Attorney General Garland. They are the ones who deserve the credit. We support them. We help them. We deal with the most difficult crimes. We provide them with technological support. But the people who are actually face-to-face with violent crime in our communities are the state and local police and law enforcement. Mr. Cartwright. Well, you are here today before the appropriations panel, and we are the ones that fund your efforts. One of the most important areas that I look into are the COPS hiring grants and, as I mentioned in my opening statement, the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. I have been very proud to bring grants home in both of those areas to fund local police and also to fund efforts by our local district attorneys, and these are the ones that deserve the credit for that huge drop in crime over the last year, aren't they? Attorney General Garland. I quite agree with that, yes. Mr. Cartwright. And don't let me put words in your mouth, Attorney General. Who else deserves the credit for this big drop in crime that America has experienced? Attorney General Garland. We know, because we've had experience over decades now with the right kind of strategies for reducing violent crime, these involve, these strategies from the Federal point of view require the kind of cooperation, the non-siloing that the chairman was speaking, among all of our agencies. Are, then, creating joint task forces with state and local law enforcement who are enormous force multipliers for the Department. Our U.S. Attorneys' Offices, who reach out to communities; our grant programs to support community violence interrupters, who go out into communities and prevent the crime from happening in the first place, who are willing to meet with potentially violent people and talk them down. So the importance of our grants to local communities to enhance good relationships between the police and the communities, because we don't get good policing and effective policing unless the community trusts the police. So it's a combination across the board of federal law enforcement, state and local law enforcement, community engagement. Mr. Cartwright. Well, that's well said. I want to focus on hiring of attorneys to go into prosecution work. Attorney General, what is the Department of Justice doing right now to prioritize creating efficiencies in its hiring and reducing the time to hire, so that we have enough attorneys working for the Department of Justice and in prosecution generally? Attorney General Garland. Well, with respect to law enforcement reduction in time to hire, this is a significant issue with respect to retention, promotion, and recruitment in law enforcement. Sometimes both federal law enforcement and state and local law enforcement takes so long to hire the person, to go through the whole background and vetting process, that the person already accepts another job before we can finish that process and before state and locals can. So our COPS office has created a playbook for state and local law enforcement to increase and streamline that process. And, of course, we are looking internally to do the same thing. Mr. Cartwright. Well, my time is expired, Attorney General. And I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Attorney General Garland, for being here today. I view these annual appropriations hearings as similar to investor briefs, annual investor briefs, right? We get to talk to you about what is going on in your organization, the money you are asking for, the past performance, the vision, the path forward. I don't think most Americans know what the Department of Justice does. I don't think most Americans know what the Attorney General does. So I went on your website and just printed out the mission statement. The mission statement of the Department of Justice is: ``to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights.'' Pretty straightforward, pretty simple. You have been in office since 2021. You report directly to the President, and you know your mission. For your investors, the American taxpayers, how would you grade your performance over the last 3 years relative to that mission? Attorney General Garland. Well, I would grade the work of our---- Mr. Garcia. And I'm talking about, I'm talking about you, Attorney General. Attorney General Garland. Yes. Mr. Garcia. With all due respect to you and your team, I have all the respect in the world for the agents in the field. They are doing God's work on a daily basis. So this line of questioning is specifically about you, as someone who is on the Cabinet, reports directly to the President, during a period of record high crime rates. Before my colleagues across the aisle get offended, I am not talking about the agents in the field here. I think they are doing God's work. They are doing A+ with the resources that they are given and the policies that they are working under. I'm asking you, how would you grade yourself, as the Attorney General of the United States? Attorney General Garland. Well, you ask about violent crime. I think what the Attorney General does with respect to violent crime is set forth a strategy for fighting violent crime and ensures that it's carried out throughout the Department and throughout the country. So what I did almost immediately after I came into office-- -- Mr. Garcia. Just I don't mean to cut you off, but we are short on time. I'm just asking for a grade, A through F. How are you doing---- Attorney General Garland. I'm going to give myself an A, but with room for improvement. Mr. Garcia. Okay. Let me explain to you why I would give you an F. And we just hear why Mr. Cartwright from Pennsylvania was citing the decline in crime nationwide. Your mission is to uphold the rule of law, and crossing the border is a crime. It is illegal. Per penal code 8 U.S.C. 1325, crossing international border is a crime. We have 7.5 million people under your tenure who have come across our border. When you say there's a decline in homicides by about 20 percent, a historical high in decline in homicides in 30 years, or 50 years, whatever the number is, does that include the 75,000 people who were killed by fentanyl or poisoned by fentanyl by in many cases dealers who knew they actually were selling fentanyl and the victims did not? Does that decline in homicides of 20 percent include the 75,000 fentanyl poisonings? Attorney General Garland. I'm sure that it does not include the fentanyl poisoning. Mr. Garcia. Those were American lives lost, though, right, who were killed by illicit drug dealers for the most part? Attorney General Garland. That's right. Mr. Garcia. So why is that not considered a homicide? Attorney General Garland. That's right. The U.S. Attorneys' Office do pursue fentanyl traffickers and including even the sale of small amounts, where we can establish that the trafficker is the one who caused the death. Mr. Garcia. Do you charge them with homicide when that is the case? Attorney General Garland. There's a narcotics statute that includes sentencing enhancement for death. We don't prosecute homicides. Those are state law---- Mr. Garcia. Okay. So I just want to be clear. When we're putting the cape on and saying there's a 20 percent reduction in homicides, we are not counting the 75,000 Americans that have been killed by this drug over each year. Attorney General Garland. I don't believe---- Mr. Garcia. The second metric of keeping our country safe, we talk about the ``Death to America'' chants in some of our cities. We heard Wray's testimony last year that we are in one of the most precarious positions our Nation has been in our Nation's history and the last several decades. We have 10,000 people entering our border a day illegally, a 7,000 percent increase in Chinese immigrants coming across our border illegally, 10,000 people a day coming across the borders. And that is about a 40 percent increase since your watch began in fiscal year 2021. Three hundred and fifty people on the known terror watchlist. Eight in 10 Americans feel less secure than they did just three or four years ago, per the Pew Research Center. So your assessment of yourself, I think someone is in your position, literally, reports directly to the President, an attribute of a leader in that position has to be self-aware. They have to have the courage to tell the boss if the boss is screwing up, especially when it is leading to the loss of lives at a level that is unprecedented. And I think your giving yourself an A under these circumstances demonstrates a lack of self-awareness, frankly. I think you have earned an F. I think you need to talk to your boss and tell him that the policies are killing us. It is not the lack of money. I respect the $37 billion investment request here. If I was in charge, I would give you more. But it is the policies that are broken. And so with that, I'm out of time. I'm happy to discuss more things, but I will wait for the second round to talk about the treatment of law and the application of law to certain demographics. And I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to yield some time to Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Yes, and I would like to give the Attorney General a chance to respond to what he just heard. Attorney General Garland. Yes. So I didn't hear question in that at all and I disagree with almost everything that you've said. But I want to be clear that the border responsibility, you're talking to the wrong department here. The Department of Homeland Security is the department responsible for preventing things from coming across the border. The President and the Secretary of Homeland Security have proposed a bipartisan bill to protect the border, to reduce the number of people who come across, and to increase the money spent to prevent fentanyl from coming across the border. So that would be my recommendation in that respect. Mr. Cartwright. And I will yield back to Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I will just editorialize. This is the second hearing I have been at, both with the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General, that they have been personally attacked. And I want to underscore, there was a bipartisan deal on the table, and as I understand it, the former President persuaded people not to participate in that because he didn't want a political win. He cared about the politics over the safety of the United States people and the American people. So I'm getting tired at these hearings of listening to these attacks, when they can be addressed. Having said that, Mr. Attorney General, thank you for taking the time to be with us today, and I certainly thank you for your long service to the country. I want to begin by thanking your staff and you for having provided detailed feedback on a bill which I have reintroduced, the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act. This is to prohibit the disclosure of non-consensual deepfake pornography, obviously, a growing and alarming problem in the United States. Ninety-six percent of all deepfakes involve pornography on the internet. And as I work to pass this legislation into law, I hope that I can continue to have lines of communication open to you and to the Department. And I want to thank you for that. If I can, sir, there's, obviously, been a lot of public reporting on the release of the Special Counsel Robert Hur's report back in February of this year. I'm certainly not asking you to comment on the substance of the report, which has been talked about publicly, but, as a member of the President's Cabinet, someone who has regular contact with the President, would you like to comment on President Biden's fitness generally? Attorney General Garland. Well, look, I will start by thanking you for recognizing that I can't comment, and won't comment, about the Special Counsel's report at all. But if you're asking me about my own observations, as a member of the National Security Council and a member of the President's Cabinet, I have complete confidence in the President. I have watched him expertly guide meetings of staff and Cabinet members on issues of foreign affairs and military strategy and policy in the incredibly complex world which we now face, in which he has been decisive in instructions to the staff and decisive in making the decisions necessary to protect the country. Likewise, with respect to domestic policy discussions. These are intricate, complicated questions that he has guided all of us through in order to reach results that are helpful and important and beneficial to the American people. I could not have more confidence in the President. Mr. Morelle. Very good. Thank you, sir. I have a number of questions which I may submit in writing. But one thing I did want to get some additional comment you mentioned in your testimony. In addition to my role as an appropriator, I'm proud to serve as the ranking Democrat on the Committee on House Administration, which has jurisdiction over Federal election reforms. In July 2021, the Department of Justice launched a task force to address the rise in threats against election workers and election officials. In addition to threats of violence and intimidation, our country's election workers face new and unique pressures driven by the rapid spread of misinformation by extremists. With less than 8 months before the general election, can you provide an update on the activities of the task force and the Department's plan to ensure that election workers are protected from threats? Attorney General Garland. Yes. Thank you. As I said in my opening remarks, I think threats to election workers, particularly the volunteer election workers, but obviously also secretaries of state and the appointed administrators, this is a real threat to our democracy to have the people who are running our elections afraid to continue their work. I have personally spoken to all of our United States Attorneys by video and, in addition, in person during our conferences. The FBI has agents devoted to this issue, and we have this task force that you're talking about. We have prosecuted more than--around 20 cases now, many of which have yielded significant sentences. And we have investigated many, many more and disrupted other kinds of threats. So we are completely seized with the importance of preventing, deterring, disrupting threats against our election workers. Mr. Morelle. Very good. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Chairman Rogers. Attorney General Garland, as I understand it, the Hatch Act generally prohibits federal employees from lobbying Congress on legislation while on the job. Last week when the House was considering legislation to reform and reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, did you or anyone in your office make phone calls to Members of Congress urging them to oppose the Biggs amendment to require the government to obtain a warrant prior to spying on American citizens through FISA section 702? And a yes or no will suffice. Attorney General Garland. The Hatch Act and the Constitution permit the members of a President's administration to speak with Members who are interested in questions about the effect of legislation, just like you are asking me today about a---- Mr. Clyde. If we ask, that's one thing. But if we don't ask, and you actually reach out, that's a different thing. Attorney General Garland. That does not violate any law of any kind. Mr. Clyde. Okay. So will you answer my question? Attorney General Garland. Yes, I discussed the vital United States interest in extending 702 with Members---- Mr. Clyde. How many Members did you call? Attorney General Garland. I'm not going to get into my conversations with Members. Mr. Clyde. I'm not asking about the conversations. I'm asking how many Members did you call? Attorney General Garland. I'm not going to get into that question. But I'm telling you there is nothing unlawful. This is the basic---- Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. On March 3, 2024, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Selma, Alabama, you made comments regarding our country's elections and election security laws passed by various states. Specifically, you claimed that democracy was under attack by, and I quote, ``discriminatory, burdensome, and unnecessary restrictions on access to the ballot.'' Attorney General, do you believe requiring an ID to vote in a federal election is discriminatory? Yes or no? Attorney General Garland. I spoke at the iconic church from which the march for voting rights began. The system---- Mr. Clyde. Just a yes or no will be fine. Attorney General Garland. The answer is the Supreme Court's decision says that undue burdens on voting rights caused by voter IDs can be unconstitutional, but that---- Mr. Clyde. What? Attorney General Garland . The burdens--that's right. That's what the Supreme---- Mr. Clyde. Voter ID can be unconstitutional? Attorney General Garland. It can be, depending on the burdens and the discriminatory way in which they are taken. This is a---- Mr. Clyde. Okay. So do you think it is important to positively identify every voter to ensure that they are a legal voter? I think, as you called it, ``a legitimate voter.'' Attorney General Garland. No. You have to be a United States citizen. You have to meet the qualifications for it to be a voter. It's important that only those people vote---- Mr. Clyde. So how do you prove that? I mean, how do you prove what a person is if you don't require an ID? I mean, you require an ID to get on an airplane. They are not going to let you on an airplane--well, unless you are an illegal, I guess. Attorney General Garland. I don't know what your experience has been, but I have voted every year my entire life, and I've never been asked to show an identification. Mr. Clyde. I have always been asked to show identification. Attorney General Garland. Oh, then, we have--but I---- Mr. Clyde. Wow. Attorney General Garland. Somehow, the democracy has gone on without that. Mr. Clyde. Attorney General Garland, do you believe that illegal aliens residing in the United States should be allowed to vote in Federal elections? Yes or no? Attorney General Garland. No. Mr. Clyde. All right. Great. We agree on something. Other than U.S. citizens, are there any other legitimate voters? Attorney General Garland. You have to be a U.S. citizen to vote in a federal election. Mr. Clyde. You must be a U.S. citizen. Okay, great. All right. I ask unanimous consent to add this to the record, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Without objection. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, sir. This is a poster found in the city, outside the city of Matamoros. It was posted around the migrant camps. And it is a poster from HIAS, the Immigrant Aid Society. And this particular poster says, ``The resource center is a six-unit complex that is home of HIAS.'' And at the very bottom, it says, ``Reminder to vote for President Biden when you are in the United States. We need another year of your mandate to stay open.'' That's what this poster says. It reminds illegal immigrants to vote for President Biden. So is the Department of Justice concerned about illegal aliens voting in federal elections? Attorney General Garland. The Department of Justice is concerned about any illegalities with respect to voting. I've never seen that poster. I've never heard of that poster. That's the first time I've ever heard anybody even mention that poster. Mr. Clyde. Well, now you have. So if any non-citizens vote in federal elections, are you going to prosecute them at the federal level? Attorney General Garland. Anybody who violates the voting laws, and if they are federal voting laws, we will investigate and prosecute, as appropriate. Mr. Clyde. All right. That's good to hear. I appreciate that. With the additional money you asked for the Civil Rights Division, I hope that you prosecute illegal voting. Now, last year, you promised to provide the prosecution of crime statistics for the city of Washington, DC, for the last five years. It was a question that I asked you. I have not yet received them. So I'm asking you again today, do you commit to provide these statistics, the prosecution of crime statistics for the city of Washington, DC? Will you provide these in the next 30 days? Attorney General Garland. I will ask my staff to get in touch with yours. I don't know what the problem is with respect to providing those. It doesn't seem like there should be a problem. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate your commitment to provide them, Attorney General. And my time is expired and I yield back.  Mr. Rogers. The committee will be in order.  Mr. Rogers. The chair reminds our guests that disruptive demonstrations from the audience are a violation of House rules. Any additional disruptions will require law enforcement to remove protestors from the room and restore order. Mr. Trone. Mr. Trone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright. And I thank you, Attorney General Garland, for appearing here today, and thank you for your patience, as you deal with this committee. I'm a co-chair of the Bipartisan Second Chance Task Force, and we are concerned about staffing shortages at the BOP. The BOP is funded at 93 percent, but are only staffed at 86 percent. What has happened is education, wraparound services for mental health, et cetera, which could improve our outcomes, job training, get left behind. So we are all in agreement on that. We would like to figure out how to implement the bipartisan First Step Act successfully. And to do that, we have got to have the staffing. Could you talk a minute about what this does to lead to lousy outcomes, where we can't cut our prison budget because we don't give folks a second chance to win and succeed? Attorney General Garland. I think the--thanks for the question. I think that First Step Act was extremely important focusing on education of inmates. It helps reduce recidivism after people leave. And of course, if we can reduce recidivism after reentry, we can drive down the violent crime rate and prevent it from going up. Bureau of Prisons makes every effort to ensure that the staffing shortages that you're referring to don't impact the First Step Act programming as well as medication assisted treatment programming. But to be frank, if you're asking me what we need most in order to protect the ability to have full staffing at the Bureau of Prisons, we need the money for hiring and retention incentives. Being a correctional officer or being a First Step administrator, these are dangerous jobs in facilities that are not--that have not been kept up over decades. And where there are adjoining facilities, sometimes state and local facilities pay more money. So I'd say if you're asking me for the one thing that will give us a better chance here for the First Step Act and for the Second Chance Act, it would be to give us the money that we're requesting which is 205.4 million dollars for hiring and retention incentives. Mr. Trone. So quite simply, the dollars that give you the proper amount of money will result in saving millions, tens of millions more down the line by cutting recidivism? Attorney General Garland. I do think that the money we have to provide more incentives for people to stay on the job in the Bureau of Prisons means the chances of reducing recidivism will increase. Mr. Trone. That sounds like a smart investment to me. A quick question, 75 percent of BOP inmates do not have a photo ID when they leave prison. They can't secure housing, apply for jobs, open a bank account, federal benefit programs, et cetera. The Bureau is addressing this by providing some IDs to U.S. citizens now. We have a bipartisan bill, the BOP Release Card Act, that supports this effort at the BOP by ensuring new IDs fulfill all the requirements and directs BOP to work with the states to have a one-on-one exchange so we can work right with the states to move these folks into getting their new ID card and then successfully be able to exchange that for state ID cards. So we would appreciate your help in moving this bill forward. Does that make sense to you? Attorney General Garland. Yeah, we would be happy to give technical assistance. And I think we may--our staff may have already--our staffs may have already consulted on this. But of course we'd be happy to give technical assistance. The BOP has implemented its own release ID program in October of 2023. And they're on track for full implementation by this spring. Mr. Trone. Excellent, thank you. The DEA has extended current telemedicine flexibility for prescribing controlled medications through December 31, 2024. But there's not a revised proposed rule, and many patients are at risk of losing access to prescriptions needed for mental health and substance use disorder. Last year, my colleagues and expressed concerns about the proposed DEA rule that would've limited patient access to buprenorphine and encourage an evidence-based approach to make permanent the use of audio only or audiovisual telehealth technology for buprenorphine prescribing. This is crucial to reach these patient populations, including unhoused, rural, Tribal. So the follow up to that letter, we introduced the TREATS Act which allows medication for opioid use disorder to be prescribed via telemedicine. What's DOJ's position on the continuing use of telehealth flexibilities to ensure access to these medically necessary substance use disorder treatment and how is this supported in your budget request? Attorney General Garland. So as you noted, the DEA and HHS have extended the current telemedicine flexibilities until December 31 of this year. DEA has issued a proposed rule which would allow authorized providers to prescribe medicines for opioid use disorder via telemedicine. They are working to promulgate a final year by the--I'm sorry, final rule by the fall of this year. Mr. Trone. Okay, excellent. Thank you very much. Just quickly, restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, outdated an inhumane practice often used way too far too often. We believe the BOP has been dragging its feet to reform this area of restrictive housing. In the past 10 years, DOJ has conducted studies and task forces to improve restrictive housing, yet we fail to make any progress. What steps can DOJ and BOP take together so we can make this more effective and improve restrictive housing policies? Attorney General Garland. Well, the new BOP director is very much committed to what you're talking about. BOP recently published a proposed rule on discipline designed to reduce the use of restrictive housing for disciplinary segregation. BOP is trying to hire more psychologists and provide de-escalation training which would help reduce the need for restrictive housing. Mr. Trone. Excellent. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Attorney General, for being here. I listened with interest to your opening statement. And I have to say that I'm concerned that your actions are speaking louder than your words, especially when you say there's one set-- there's not one set of laws for Democrats and another for Republicans. My constituents and many Americans are watching your actions which are speaking louder than your words when it comes to--there really is a crisis of confidence in this country in your department being created by the dual treatment of American citizens depending on their viewpoints or their political positions or their political officers. As your department is currently prosecuting a former President for handling classified documents. Your office, and I'm assuming you personally, declined to take action against President Biden for his woeful mishandling of classified documents. I appreciate you making the report of Special Counsel Robert Hur public as was done historically with every other Special Counsel. Did you review the report prior to its release? Attorney General Garland. Before I released it, yes. I read it before I released it, yes. Mr. Cline. Did you approve of the--obviously, you approved the recommendations because you have it within your power to prosecute, correct? Attorney General Garland. I'm not going to comment or editorialize on the Special Counsel's report. I promised I would release it. I did release it. The report speaks for itself. The Special Counsel sat for something like five hours' worth of testimony on the subject. And any question about results he reached could've been asked---- Mr. Cline. So you won't say whether you concur with the conclusions? Attorney General Garland. I will say as I said at the time it was released I was not going to editorialize or comment on the report. I think that's inappropriate for an Attorney General. Mr. Cline. So you won't agree that Biden would've come across to a jury as a sympathetic, well meaning, elderly man with a poor memory? Attorney General Garland. I've said before and I'll say again with respect to the report that it's improper for the Attorney General to editorialize. Mr. Cline. You talked about your---- Attorney General Garland. I take that separately from the question you're asking and ask--if you're asking me about my own observations about the President. Mr. Cline. No, you've testified to that fact, and I heard you the first time. Attorney General Garland. I have complete confidence in the President. Mr. Cline. Have you ever seen evidence of impairment in your meetings with the President? Attorney General Garland. I'm sorry. I testified and I'll repeat again what I just said. Mr. Cline. Well, that's different than my question. Attorney General Garland. Well, I have seen the President effectively guide the members of the department, of his cabinet, and his military---- Mr. Cline. But you won't say you've ever seen any impairment on this part? Attorney General Garland. The President has no impairment. The President---- Mr. Cline. You've never seen any? Attorney General Garland. I don't know how many ways I can say this. Mr. Cline. Okay. Attorney General Garland. I have complete confidence in the President, and I reject your characterization. Mr. Cline. Okay. Let's talk about the audio recordings of Special Counsel Hur's interviews with President Biden's ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer. You're in possession of those, correct? Attorney General Garland. Justice Department has possession of those. Mr. Cline. Has the White House been permitted access to those recordings? Attorney General Garland. I don't know what Mr. Hur provided. But I expect that the answer is yes. Mr. Cline. So they have access. Let me let you know--well, maybe you're aware. How many times the Judiciary Committee has asked for those documents or asked for those recordings? Attorney General Garland. I know that the Judiciary Committee has asked. We have sent a letter explaining our position with respect to the recordings. Mr. Cline. Three times. Attorney General Garland. We have provided transcripts of the recordings. Mr. Hur has testified about his observations during his interviews. These are interviews or a witness. It is a longstanding practice of the Justice Department to keep these kinds of documents confidential in order to not chill future investigations. Mr. Cline. Confidential, but you provided copies to the White House? Attorney General Garland. They are the--this is the witness. The witness is only---- Mr. Cline. Do you normally provide witnesses in investigations access to their recordings of their interviews? Attorney General Garland. Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't. But here, there are--as you well know, there are privileges to be with respect to national security and other information that were addressed in those recordings and in the interviews. And the transcripts themselves had to be cleared through an interagency process. You know that because we said that in the letter to the committee. Mr. Cline. Okay. In my 20 seconds, I want to ask about something you answered to Congressman Clyde. You said following the court's rulings that IDs to vote can be an undue burden. Do you know of an example or is there any case in which you would consider a photo ID to not be an undue burden? Say if it's a free ID given to everybody. Attorney General Garland. IDs--you have a good--very good example there. There was the case in which the Supreme Court noted that there were free IDs completely available to everyone without discrimination. In those circumstances, the court upheld the law, yes. Mr. Cline. And you agree with that decision? Attorney General Garland. Well I follow the law and the Supreme Court. And whether I agree or not, it's the law. And the rule of law requires us to follow it. And that's not what I'm talking about here. Mr. Cline. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. The subcommittee will stand in recess subject to the call of the chair.  Mr. Rogers. The committee will be in order. And the chair recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Ms. DeLauro. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much. A lot of hearings happening at the same time. But I'm delighted that you're here this morning. And what I wanted to look at is the issue of crime, if you will and trade. DOJ plays a critical role in deterring crime through robust investigations, prosecutions, incarcerations, and the application of penalties. My concern about DOJ is that there may be some serious blind spots and lack of resources in critical areas, particularly the U.S. International Trade Enforcement. Example, 2022, U.S. imports were 3.27 trillion dollars. Conservative estimates based on available data from Economic Policy Institute projected 5 to 10 percent of those imports were fraudulent. This means that there's annually 163 to 327 billion dollars in illegal trade which impacts U.S. workers, manufacturers, consumers, and our free trade partners. I understand DOJ's infrastructure to combat trade crimes is lightly resourced. 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection collected $19.4 million in penalties on 3.27 trillion dollars in trade. That seems to me to be a drop in the bucket. I understand that international trade prosecutions are also low to nonexistent. A couple questions, can you give us a sense of DOJ resources you are using to prosecute these bad actors associated with crimes and violate trade laws? How do you work with CBP and HSI to increase the number of prosecutions? Would you say based on DHS enforcement data that combating international trade crime is a priority within DOJ? Why or why not? And how familiar are you with DOJ's efforts in resources dedicated to investigating and prosecuting international trade crimes? What's your assessment of the department's actions, including the number of prosecutions and penalties? Thank you. Attorney General Garland. You put your finger on an important risk to our economy which is fraudulent trade goods. That's why we have a trade fraud task force which enhances collaboration between the Justice Department and the other agencies that you were discussing to investigate trade fraud. It helped initiate more than 70 investigations involving hundreds of millions of dollars of fraudulently imported goods. One good example is just last month, the Ford Motor Company agreed to pay 365 million dollars to settle customs civil penalty claims related to misclassified and undervalued items. So I recognize the significance of this for our economy. And I believe our Justice Department task force is working well with other departments on this matter, including the Department of Homeland Security. Ms. DeLauro. Do you have enough personnel to take on this issue and resources in a more robust way? I said 3.27 trillion dollars. We collect 19.4 million. That seems be some great disparity. And I'm just asking. Attorney General Garland. No, no. Ms. DeLauro. What do you need from us to be able to deal with this area on international trade where we're getting killed? Attorney General Garland. The Justice Department would always like more money. Ms. DeLauro. I understand that. But we need an assessment. Attorney General Garland. Yeah, I think that the money that we're requesting for our civil divisions, Consumer Protection Branch which deals with this kind of fraud, and our criminal division's fraud section which deals with this on the criminal side, and the U.S. Attorneys' offices that deal with this in each of the 94 districts, and the FBI's corporate crime and fraud sections, given the budget priorities, I think we're asking for the appropriate amount. There's obviously always tradeoffs. But we are, I think, able to fund a robust program. The most difficult aspect of this, of course, is identifying the fraudulent goods as they come in. And that really is a customs and therefore a Homeland Security issue. And they, I'm sure, would say the same to you, that they need more money for this purpose. Ms. DeLauro. I'd like to pursue that. I'm just going to say something very quickly and I'm running out of time. As you know, Anti-Trust received--this is the Anti-Trust Division-- roughly a 4 percent increase in 2024 over the prior year. I want to ensure that we can continue to justify these critical investments, protect consumers from unfair and anti- competitive business practices. Do I have your commitment that we can work together? I would like to work with you and with my staff on answering questions that we have on what resources the Anti-Trust Division. And frankly, this could apply to all of DOJ that you will need for 2025. Attorney General Garland. Yes, of course. We're very eager to speak with you about that. The total we've requested is 288 million dollars which is an increase of 55 million dollars over the enacted FY 2024. I will say I have always been concerned about this. I entered the Justice Department in 1979. And we barely have more attorneys in the Antitrust Division now that we had in 1979. I think this is the first year we've been able to bring the number up to the number of attorneys we had when I first entered the department. Ms. DeLauro. Well, we'd like to work with you on how well we can track the resources that are necessary for you to be able to do your job. And as a final comment, I'm very, very interested, lastly, to listen to the FTC Commissioner about working together with DOJ because we have serious issues which affect consolidation which raises prices and essentially makes anti-competitiveness a reality and how between DOJ and the FTC we can address these issues in a very, very robust, strong way to get at ending these monopolies, if you will, that only increase prices for the American people. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Chairman Aderholt. Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. General Garland, good to have you here. Thanks for your time. I want to focus on something I don't think we've--any questions have been so far and that's on the Bureau of Prisons. And I understand according the Bureau of Prisons website, there are less than 35,000 employees to ensure the security of all the federal prisons and services that include 156,000 federal inmates. What steps is the Bureau of Prisons taking to address gaps in correctional officer and training--and leader training? And is there a reason that the Bureau of Prisons correctional leaders have not participated in the prison fellowship warden exchange which is offered without cost to the federal government? Attorney General Garland. I'm sorry. I don't know about the latter question that you asked. But I'd be happy to have our staff look into it on the warden training and get in touch with you. The pandemic delayed Bureau of Prisons' ability to provide in-person training. But BOP has since resumed many in-person training and is trying to clear the backlog in that respect. You are right with respect to the number of employees we have in the Bureau of Prisons. It's really not sufficient. It's not sufficient either for the necessary protection, or for the educational programs that we have. And as I discussed earlier with a member of the panel, the problem here is recruitment, retention, and promotion. And the best I think that the--the most important thing that the committee can do is to give us the money that we're asking for, for hiring and retention incentives. Mr. Aderholt. Do you know of any law or regulation that prevents or limits the Bureau of Prisons from accepting donations or services or programs from a nonprofit, as long as they don't accept federal funds? Attorney General Garland. I'm afraid I don't know about that, but I would be happy to have our staff look into that and get back to your staff. Mr. Aderholt. Okay. If you could look at it and see if there are examples where their community or faith-based programs could be helpful? My understanding is that, as long as they don't receive federal funds, then there are programs out there to be of assistance. And I would appreciate you looking into that and letting me know if that is something that might be possible. Because I think it is real, it could be real helpful. Of course, back on October 7 of last year, we all know what happened, and along with the attack on Israel, there were 30 Americans that were killed by Hamas terrorists in Israel, as part of a larger coordinated attack that left 1200 Israelis dead and over 200 abducted. And it is my understanding that eight Americans remain hostage in Gaza, I understand three of whom are no longer alive. But you announced that the Justice Department was investigating the death and the kidnappings of the Americans during the attack. Can you give us here on the subcommittee an update on the investigation into the death and kidnapping of those Americans? And is the Justice Department looking to pursue criminal charges against individuals responsible for those attacks? Attorney General Garland. So the killing or kidnapping of Americans abroad is a federal crime. So, of course, that is what we are investigating, as I said, for potential criminal prosecution. We have been involved in discussions with Israeli law enforcement and intelligence services to help us get evidence and information in this regard. I really can't say anything more about the progress of the investigation, but this is a matter of extreme concern for us. This was, in addition, of course, to the killing of Americans, this is the largest mass killing of Jews since the Holocaust. Mr. Aderholt. Can you say that you all, that the Department is pursuing criminal charges against these individuals? Attorney General Garland. We're investigating that. We're investigating. We have a criminal investigation in connection with the deaths and kidnapping of Americans in Israel on October 7, yes. Mr. Aderholt. Can you speak more broadly to the Department's work in investigating Hamas threats to the United States, including efforts by Hamas to raise money in the United States? Attorney General Garland. Yes. So just at a high level of generality--because I don't want to talk about matters that I can't talk about in an open session--but we do have investigations, financial investigations, with respect to Hamas, which we have had for a number of years. October 7, as the FBI Director noted in his testimony, has raised our threat level considerably with respect to concerns of foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas that might foment problems in the United States. That includes not only Hamas, but Hezbollah, the Iranian Quds Force, ISIS, ISIS-K, various sects of, branches of Al Qaeda. We are concerned and are making sure that all of our joint terrorism task forces are on the lookout for these matters since October 7. There was a heightened concern before October 7, but, obviously, October 7 has only redoubled our concern here. Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. I yield back. Attorney General Garland. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member. Attorney General Garland, the first thing I do want to say, I think that you are doing a good job. I wouldn't say it is always an A, as you said, because we have to watch giving ourselves an A, but you are close. And I like your experience in justice as a jurist and you excelled there, and now, as running the FBI. So I feel secure at this point that you are the best person for that job. Attorney General Garland. Thank you. Mr. Ruppersberger. With that, I'm going to get into China and cybersecurity. The Chinese Communist Party has an army of hackers that persistently attack the United States. They stay dormant and keep access to our networks and critical infrastructure. The Chinese Communist Party uses these hackers to steal economic information and intellectual property. We also know that the Chinese Party has been working to steal and smuggle banned U.S. tech from our shores into mainland China. They are our biggest threat and adversary. This past March, the unsealed indictment of the APT31 group, which you are familiar with, revealed a 14-year cyber campaign for intimate dissenters to steal U.S. trade and intellectual property to damage critical networks and spy on U.S. politicians. That's 14 years. Now, a recent intelligence advisory stated that these hackers, known as Volt Typhoon, have been dormant for five years, waiting just in case we are in a larger conflict with China. China is a real threat. Can you enlighten us as to the best tools we have to fight Chinese hackers? What other resources do you need, and did our fiscal year 2024 budget put the Department in too deep of a security hole? Attorney General Garland. Well, first of all, I completely agree with your characterization of the Chinese threat. The People's Republic of China, the communist party, the government of China, represents a long-term, persistent, across-the-board threat to America, in particular, in the area of cybersecurity that you're talking about. The two major actions you are talking about just from this year, the January Volt Typhoon disruption, this was a botnet that was implanting malware into our infrastructure in very significant parts of our delivery of public services, which, if activated, could have been very dangerous for us. The March APT indictments involved the hacking of computers and emails. And those are just two examples of a considerable amount of cyber hacking. So we have asked for more than $1.3 billion to combat cyber crime and for cybersecurity. The FBI, the National Security Division, have asked for $894.6 million, which is an increase of 11.9 percent over fiscal year 2024. As you know, fiscal year 2024, the fiscal year 2024 budget has required us to reduce positions substantially, and we are in a position of trying to get us back to where we were before that. But this is an area where we are doubling down and are very much concerned. Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. Thank you. Now, I want to get to the Key Bridge, just a quick question. I know the FBI has been onsite at the bridge. And there are a lot of questions that need to be answered about what happened, like did the captain and crew of the DALI know that there were power issues before the ship ever left? A criminal investigation is usually opened when authorities have reason to believe negligence may have caused an accident to rise to the level of criminality. We need to make sure we hold people accountable. Attorney General, is there anything you could share about the investigation? Attorney General Garland. So as you know, Congressman, the Justice Department doesn't normally comment on whether investigations exist or not, but plenty of people saw FBI agents onboard the ship. So the FBI has confirmed that its agents were on the ship. I can't really say anything more. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ellzey. Mr. Ellzey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Garland, welcome back. Attorney General Garland. Thank you. Mr. Ellzey. I appreciate the work the DOJ does going after legitimate criminals and protecting American citizens from foreign adversaries, and especially the COPS program, which is very important in my rural district, as we discussed a year ago. But today, I would like to talk about the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. I bring up FARA in the context of shenanigans--that is a clinical term--going on in Texas. Now, there is a proposed high-speed rail project connecting Dallas to Houston. About a decade ago, a private company called Texas Central started pushing a proposed high-speed rail project between Houston and Dallas, and they have been engaged at the federal, state, and local level in lobbying in that effort. I am vehemently opposed to this proposed project that would cut up highly arable land in my district and rid people of their well-earned land and their private property. So there's a long list of controversies surrounding Texas Central--from funding and financing, eminent domain, lack of transparency, dismissing every officer and board member, and now, they appear to be merely a company on paper with no board of directors. And as an aside, Texas Central has zero experience operating or building any type of transportation company. There are a few entities connected to or under Texas Central, and there is a consulting company called New Magellan Ventures that is pushing the project. Since the beginning of the project, sovereign wealth funds of the Japanese government are financially backing that high-speed rail proposal. A very concerning recent action was Amtrak's partnering with Texas Central in applying for a fiscal year 2022 Corridor Identification and Development Grant, and a $500,000 grant was approved. On April 9, there was a news article published about Texas Central and a letter dated April 5th addressed to you, signed by Steve Roberts from Holtzman Vogel law firm. It states that Mr. Roberts was hired by Texans Against High-Speed Rail and wrote it on behalf of Texans Against High-Speed Rail. And, Mr. Chairman, I have that letter, and I ask for unanimous consent that this article and letter be introduced into the record. Mr. Rogers. Without objection.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Ellzey. I will read part of the letter to you that I think captures the concerns that I have. ``Texas Central appears to have acted, and may still act, as an agent of the Japanese government with regard to numerous political activities intended to influence both lawmakers and the public within the United States with reference to formulating, adopting, or changing the domestic policies of the United States. Yet, neither New Magellan Ventures, nor any of the Texas Central entities or their representatives, have ever registered with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938.'' So with that laid out for you, I have two questions. Do you agree that it would be concerning if a private company or principals of a private company over the course of a decade failed to register as foreign agents under FARA if the facts are clear that they were legally required to? Attorney General Garland. Well, if you put me in that exact box, the answer has to be yes. I, obviously, don't know anything about this matter at all. Mr. Ellzey. Fair enough. Attorney General Garland. But, obviously, if someone is required to register under FARA, then we would be concerned if they don't. Mr. Ellzey. As I said, I'm not surprised that you haven't heard of this, but it is important in our district. And so I'm going to the big man on campus to ask those questions. The final question is--I will wrap it up--if a private company whose principals fail to register as foreign agents, when the facts are clear that they were required to do so, enters into a partnership with the federal government, would that concern you, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, and would that cause you to question whether the federal government is properly using taxpayer dollars? Attorney General Garland. This is less of a clean hypothetical than the previous one. I'd have to know a lot more about the facts before I could make a determination on---- Mr. Ellzey. But if those were the facts, hypothetically---- Attorney General Garland. Well, that description was a little--even with those facts, it is still a little more vague than makes clear. FARA is a complicated statute. We would always be concerned about an effort by a foreign government to try to influence the government of the United States. If I can put it at that level of generality, that's clearly true. Mr. Ellzey. And, you know, I understand that, and you, obviously, have to be somewhat obtuse about that. And so to summarize---- Attorney General Garland. I would rather have circumspect if---- Mr. Ellzey. Okay. In Texas, there is a so-called private company that has no board of directors that has now gotten eminent domain from the State of Texas to take private citizens' land and gotten a grant from Amtrak to take people's land and build a project that currently doesn't exist, and they haven't registered--on behalf of a foreign government--and they haven't registered as federal agents. So thank you for your time. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Ms. Meng. Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cartwright. Thank you, Attorney General Garland. I wanted to ask about a bill of mine that was signed into law in 2021, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which directs the Attorney General to provide guidance to state and local law enforcement agencies to bolster reporting of hate crimes. I was glad to see that the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2025 requests $10 million for Community-Based Approaches To Prevent and Address Hate Crimes, a grant program that I authored in fiscal year 2022. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership in responding to violent crime, and specifically, hate crimes in the United States in the last several years. It means a great deal to Asian Americans and so many historically underserved communities to have a President and an Attorney General who cares deeply about these issues. I wanted to ask a question that I also asked FBI Director Christopher Wray in last week's hearing. I'm concerned by the trend of a decrease in the number of local law enforcement agencies providing the FBI with incident data. This is the fifth year in a row that the number of local agencies providing data to the FBI has declined. I know that the decline may partially be due to the transition that agencies are making to the NIBRS system. But what additional resources does the DOJ need to support local and state law enforcement agencies using NIBRS? And I would like to also hear more from you about other ways that the DOJ is actively working to support local law enforcement agencies in reporting hate crimes. Attorney General Garland. Well, thank you for the question, and this is a high priority for us. I do think that, as the FBI Director suggested, that much of the problem is just a transition problem from one form of statistical compilation to another. But, of course, all of our information has to come from state and local communities. And so what we have to do is reach out to them constantly to ensure that they are providing the numbers. The FBI and our Office of Justice Programs in the Bureau of Justice Assistance have sort of identified the places that have been less compliant than they should be, and I'm trying to reach out to encourage that level of compliance. I think the money we have in the budget is sufficient for those kind of reachout programs, but we won't be satisfied until all the crimes are reported. Ms. Meng. Thank you. And just a follow-up. As you have said, State and local law enforcement agencies play a crucial role in the nationwide response to hate crimes, but I also want to make sure to ask about how the DOJ works with community-based organizations, which also have a crucial part in building up community resilience and preventing future hate crimes. Can you talk about how the DOJ is coordinating with both law enforcement and local organizations to respond to hate crimes? Attorney General Garland. Yes. So each of our U.S. Attorneys' Offices has a Civil Rights and Hate Crimes Coordinator, and each of the U.S. Attorneys has been instructed to reach out to the communities to have discussions well in advance of any crisis occurring. You know, our strategy here is to develop trust within communities before something bad things. So that, if something bad happens, the community trusts law enforcement--these are joint meetings of the U.S. Attorneys' Offices and our various law enforcement components. As I know you know well, we have a United Against Hate Campaign that the U.S. Attorneys' Offices are implementing and have been implementing for the past couple of years to reach out to communities in just the way that you said. So that federal law enforcement, State and local law enforcement, and communities can cooperate and work together. I have attended one of those meetings in Denver, and I have attended a couple of other meetings of community outreach in other places, including in St. Louis. Ms. Meng. Thank you so much. And I will quickly ask about, another question about the aftermath of the China Initiative. As we all know, in February 2022, the end of the China Initiative was announced. Previously, an unacceptably high number of these cases ended in dropped charges, dismissals, and acquittals because prosecutors could not prove allegations. Chinese American researchers and scholars who made valuable contributions in so many fields in this country for decades reported feeling targeted by a racial profiling campaign. I want to be clear, as a member of this subcommittee, I am fully supportive of the DOJ's real and necessary work to combat espionage by adversarial governments. But I just want to make sure, how does the DOJ ensure that agents working on these investigations, No. 1, avoid wasteful investigations into legitimate academic research? And second, how is the DOJ also educating the institutions themselves and the public about the real national security threats and how they can best defend themselves and our country from these threats? Attorney General Garland. So as you pointed out, we now have a consolidated section in the National Security Division to address the threats posed by the People's Republic of China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, focusing our attention on all the myriad ways in which these adversaries attempt to either attack us from a cyber point of view; prevent--present efforts to harass dissidents in the United States; steal our personal identifying information and our technology. So to take that latter part of your question first, that is the way in which we are doing that. And then, each U.S. Attorney's Office has a National Security Coordinator and the FBI has Joint Terrorism Task Forces in each of its 54 districts. As to the more general question, we have a robust review process. All national security cases have to touch base with the National Security Division, which can review to ensure that the principles of federal prosecution, which determine which kinds of prosecution should be brought and which kinds shouldn't, are done. I want to emphasize that we do not prosecute based on the ethnicity of any person. We are only looking to prosecute people who are working for our adversaries in an effort to injure the United States. But that is not in any way a part of the ethnicity of people in the United States. Ms. Meng. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Thank you. That concludes the first round of questions. I know the General needs to be through here by 12 noon. So we have a few minutes to go. Is there a desire by members for a second round? Two down here. All right. General, if that is agreeable with you. Attorney General Garland. I'm happy to be here for the questions, of course. Mr. Rogers. We will get you out of here by noon. Attorney General Garland. Excellent. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia, do you desire time? Mr. Garcia. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Three minutes. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, sir. And, Attorney General, I want to follow up on the assertions made by my colleagues from Pennsylvania and New York that I was engaging in personal attacks. I take great pride, and frankly, great caution, in making sure I don't engage in personal attacks in these hearings. I want you to know that my assessment of you, as appalled and shocked as I was of you giving yourself an A, was not meant to be a personal attack. It was a professional one. As my chemistry teacher who gave me an F on my midterm at the Naval Academy told me, ``This is to help you get better.'' So I do that in the interest of accountability and frank and objective assessments, not personal attacks. I know someone of your caliber was not personally offended by that, and I'm happy to have conversations offline. I want to follow up on Mr. Cline's conversation around the Hur report. First of all, in your written testimony, on page 3, you say, ``There is not one set of laws for the powerful and another for the powerless; one for rich, another for poor; one for Democrats, one for Republicans; or different rules depending upon one's race or ethnicity or religion.'' You would say that that is probably true for age, right? Anyone over the age of 18, regardless, unless there is a cognitive impairment, should be treated the same, and there is one set of laws, regardless of age? Attorney General Garland. Without addressing the hidden premise behind your question, I'm just going to say there is one tier or standard of justice. We prosecute under the federal principles of prosecution, and we do not distinguish based on politics, based on ethnicity, or based on ideology, based on race, or any non-meritorious factor. Mr. Garcia. Or seniors who are a protected class in the workplace, obviously, as well, anyone over the age of a certain--I think it is 55 or 65. You also, in your testimony, your verbal testimony, say you have no doubt that there is no cognitive impairment of the President. You said the Hur report speaks for itself, ``and I have complete confidence in the President'' of the United States. And so my question is--and I sit on the Intel Committee, so I have seen the classified documents and I'm aware of the nature of at least some of these documents. They are of the highest level of national security intelligence and they are extremely relevant, even today, these documents that were found in the garage of President Biden. And so if it is not a cognitive impairment problem, if he is competent, and you are confident in that, why is he not being charged for--and in his testimony, or in his Special Counsel report, Hur said, ``He willfully detained and disclosed sensitive classified information.'' So what is the explanation for not charging President Biden for mishandling of classified documents? Attorney General Garland. I will address both questions again. I have complete confidence in the President in every possible respect. On the question of why there were no charges, Mr. Hur described in detail in his report his explanation for why he decided not to bring them. He was subject to some five hours of testimony, and that is something---- Mr. Garcia. But you disagree with the foundational premise of his assertions, which is the rationale was that he was cognitively incapable of understanding what he was doing; he was too old to face charges. And you disagree with that premise, right? Attorney General Garland. I'm going to say two things. First, that is not at all what Mr. Hur said, and I urge everyone to read again what he said. He did not say anything like that. But second, Mr. Hur described his explanation for why not to bring the case, bring this case, and he distinguished other cases involving classified information where charges were brought. And I just refer you to that. Mr. Garcia. Okay. I will go reread it and will submit questions for the record. Mr. Garcia. I believe my time is up. Thank you, Attorney General. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Attorney General, in 2023, the CDC reported that over a recent 12-month period more than 112,000 Americans died as a result of drug overdoses or poisonings, and we have touched on that subject earlier in this hearing. DEA was one of the few agencies that saw a funding increase in fiscal year 2024. And the work that the Administrator is doing, especially with the U.S. Attorneys, to go after the cartels and the entire network, is critically important to stemming the flow of illicit fentanyl into our communities, but enforcement is only part of the solution. We also have to have recovery and rehabilitation tools for those with substance abuse disorders as well. You talk a little bit about the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act Grants, especially the drug courts and the veterans' treatment centers. Attorney General Garland. Yes. So you are quite right that our ability to eliminate drug trafficking and to protect the country includes our concerns about the people who are the victims of drug trafficking and the need, of course, to reduce the demand for these poisons in our country. So we have asked for more than $490 million in counterdrug- related Office of Justice program grants. These include, in particular, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act grants, for which we are requesting $443 million, which is a $23 million addition over the enacted. Those include the Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Program, the so-called COSSUP program; the mental health and residential substance use treatment; our drug courts, the drugs courts, which we are asking for $94 million; the veterans' treatments courts, for which we are asking for $33 million, as well as for prescription drug monitoring to ensure that this doesn't get out of hand again. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you. And can you give me a sense as to whether you are seeing increases in applications for these important programs you have just touched on? Attorney General Garland. I would say that there is always more applications than we have money to give out. That is definitely the case. Mr. Cartwright. And in what other ways does your Department's fiscal year 20025 budget request seek to address this terrible problem? Attorney General Garland. Well, again, on the overdose and addiction side, those are the principal issues. On the trafficking side, which is, unfortunately, what causes in the end these problems, we are asking for $10.7 billion for all of our law enforcement agents and U.S. Attorneys to respond to this problem. That is a 5.1 percent increase over enacted fiscal year 2024. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Attorney General Garland, and thank you for being here today. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Attorney General Garland, my colleague Congressman Chip Roy has twice requested a copy of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act prosecution data. He first asked for it in October 2022, and then, again, two months ago on February 16. He has yet to receive this data. And my question to you is, when will this data be provided by the Department of Justice? Attorney General Garland. I don't know, specifically, about the request, but, like the other requests you asked about, I'm very happy to look into this. And criminal---- Mr. Clyde. And provide the data. Attorney General Garland. I'm sorry? Mr. Clyde. And provide the data. Attorney General Garland. Of course, if we have the data, yes. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate that. Attorney General Garland. Yes. Mr. Clyde. In the FBI's request, fiscal year 2025 request-- excuse me. In the Department of Justice's budget, you are requesting $437.6 million for protecting civil rights. That is an increase from what I see here. Under the civil rights heading in the FBI's request, it says, ``Color of law violations are actions taken by any person using the authority given to them by a government agency to willfully deprive someone of a right.'' Now, since you have been Attorney General, has anyone in the government, or otherwise, been prosecuted for a color of law violation for denying people their Second Amendment rights? That is a civil right. Attorney General Garland. I understand that. I don't know the answer to that and I have not heard that there has been that kind of prosecution. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Well, since the SCOTUS decision overturning the New York law, which was the New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which denied New Yorkers their constitutional rights, I would think that there would be a case there. So I would ask the Department of Justice to look into that because the Second Amendment is a civil right, and when people are denied that civil right, then I think, under the Civil Rights Division, the Department of Justice should engage. Now also in last year's congressional hearing, I asked about your Department's most recent congressional authorization. Has your Department been reauthorized, or is the most recent authorization the one that expired in fiscal year 2009? Attorney General Garland. I will say you taught me something about authorizations and appropriations at the last hearing that I did not know. My understanding is that that was the last authorization, the one you are talking about. Of course, the Justice Department would always like to have an authorization. My understanding is that the yearly appropriations count as authorizations, but, of course, it would always be better for any entity to have a formal authorization. Mr. Clyde. Well, we are not an authorizing committee. We are an appropriating committee. It is the Judiciary Committee that is the authorizing committee for the Department of Justice. Attorney General Garland. Oh, I understand that. Mr. Clyde. So DOJ remains unauthorized and you are running an unauthorized agency by the Department--or excuse me--by the Judiciary Committee. So are you going to seek a new congressional authorization from the Judiciary Committee? Attorney General Garland. I haven't had those kind of discussions. I will be happy to take that back and think about it. Again, given the appropriations, I have been advised that that is not required, but I will be happy to think about it some more. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Attorney General, I have written to your office in the past about the importance of prioritizing Federal prosecutions of firearms cases, and pleased to see the success of the Guns Involved Violence Elimination Initiative operating in the U.S. Attorney's Western District Office of New York. I would like to just ask if I can follow up with staff after the meeting to ensure we have sufficient resources to continue the Western New York initiative. Attorney General Garland. Yes. I can talk about a few things in that regard, but I think you are correct that our work in the Western District of New York is ongoing and has been successful; and that we have the money that we need for that purpose. Mr. Morelle. Terrific. Thank you, sir. And then, I will just ask one other question. Last week, I was very pleased to see the Department finalize a new rule to update the definition of ``engaged business,'' as a firearms dealer. As you know, unlicensed dealers who do not conduct background checks are the largest source of firearms that are illegally brought into our communities. And if you could just talk about the budgetary impact on that requirement by firearms dealers and the ability for the Department to make sure that that new rule is carried out? Attorney General Garland. Yes. So this is the implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. And we have asked for money in the ATF budget for that purpose. The money that we have asked for should be sufficient for that rule and for the other work that ATF does. Mr. Morelle. Terrific. Thank you. I will yield back, Mr. Chair. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. The gentleman and I have similar questions today. And, oh, by the way, let's work on that reauthorization. I will send over a proposal. I may have a few changes to propose in that reauth.  Attorney General Garland. Maybe that's a good idea for us not to be thinking about that.  Mr. Cline. Given that ATF claims it can barely keep up with the workload of inspecting the current number of licensed dealers, what is the point of this new rule? Is it actually to encourage firearms sellers to become licensed or to discourage them from engaging in the constitutionally protected activity of selling and trading in firearms at all? Attorney General Garland. The purpose of the new rule is to implement the definitional change brought by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which changed the definition of being engaged in the business from ``engaged in the business for the purpose of maintaining a livelihood'' to being ``engaged in the business for the predominant purpose of earning a profit.'' With that change, it required regulations explaining what that means. Mr. Cline. Okay. Attorney General Garland. The purpose is to prevent guns from being sold to prohibited persons without a background check, to be sure that a prohibited person doesn't get a gun. That includes somebody who served time as a violent felon, for example. Mr. Cline. Okay. The rule also institutes a series of rebuttable presumptions to supposedly clarify when the licensing requirement attaches to gun sales, but these presumptions appear nowhere in statute. To the degree that they have any legal foundation at all, they are said to interpret the old, not the currently existing, language on who is a dealer. And the rule itself estimates that tens of thousands of firearms sellers will be required to become licensed dealers under its terms, which would, obviously, necessitate a significant increase in ATF oversight as well. Did ATF coordinate with the FBI or seek their input on the capacity of NICS, the background check system, to absorb the additional workload this rule would create? It seems that it would have a cascading effect on a variety of the departments and divisions and the workload. Attorney General Garland. Yes, I believe that the Department's regulation discusses workload impact. I don't know the answer to that specific question you are asking, and I will try to have somebody get back to you on that specific question. Mr. Cline. And I would just express concern that this seems to be an end run around the authority of Congress to set the laws, rather than the Department, and especially when it comes to the constitutionally protected rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms. I think your actions are headed in the wrong direction. Attorney General Garland. Just to be clear, this is really not about the second amendment in any respect. It is about implementing Congress' statute and the prohibitions on selling guns to people who Congress has said should not have them. It is not about the Second Amendment otherwise. Mr. Cline. When you keep and bear arms, you have to purchase and sell, and that is part of keeping and bearing arms. So I would just urge you to keep that in mind. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Trone. Mr. Trone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last year, we helped pass the Bipartisan Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act, which provides $124 million in grant funding over four years on de-escalation training for police officers. This is going to save lives, improve police- community relations. Although this program is new, could you talk briefly about its implementation and, more broadly, how DOJ's budget prioritizes mental health and crisis stabilization? Attorney General Garland. Yes, I don't have the specifics with respect to that program. But, as a general matter, our COPS office and our Office of Justice Programs provides de- escalation, money for de-escalation training. It is an important way to protect the lives of officers and first respondents, as well as the people who are calling for help. You are also right in the implication of your questions, that many of these calls involve people who are mentally ill or have mental impairment; and that the sensitivity of respondents to that possibility is an important element of the need for de- escalation. Mr. Trone. Thank you for your efforts there. Seventy to 100 million Americans have criminal records that appear on routine background checks, often preventing them from getting jobs. Over the last 7 years, my company has hired about 1,400 returning citizens, which is good for business and cuts down recidivism. State-passed clean slate/automatic clearing records, these type of efforts are costly and have been a barrier to widespread adoption. What resources does DOJ need to help support these clean slate laws? Attorney General Garland. Well, I don't think I'm going to be able to talk to you specifically about the clean slate laws. You know, in the area of criminal justice reform and the implementation of the Second Chance Act, which involves reentry programs, we are asking for $125 million for those reentry programs. In addition, there is a new program called the Accelerating Justice System Reform Grants, which is a $300 million request for fiscal year 2025 and $15 billion over 10 years. I'm not sure exactly whether the clean slate would fall within those. But I will ask my staff to get back to you on which of the grant programs go to the program you are talking about. Mr. Trone. Yes, I would love to keep working with you. I will ask a quick question to build on Ranking Member DeLauro on the Antitrust Division. Should this committee take another look at the language that eliminates, stops you from having full access to the merger-filing fees and locks you into that $233 million? Attorney General Garland. Oh, I'm going to leave it to the Members of Congress to resolve this question. The Justice Department is in favor of the Antitrust Division getting the full access to the fees. But, you know, in the end, the Congress makes those determinations. Mr. Trone. It seems like a good idea. Thank you. Attorney General Garland. It does seem like a good idea, yes. Mr. Trone. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. That concludes the hearing. Mr. Ruppersberger. May I have just, Mr. Chairman, may I have just one quick---- Mr. Rogers. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Ruppersberger. I know we are 7 years into the consent decree with respect to Baltimore. Attorney General Garland. Yes. Mr. Ruppersberger. And we have reached compliance with two. And you don't have to give that, unless you have it here right away. But give me an update on what is left and how we are doing. And if you could have somebody from your staff get back to my office about that, I would appreciate it. Attorney General Garland. Yes, I can just give you a little now and I will be happy to get more detail back to you. So we do think that the Baltimore Police Department has made substantial progress towards satisfying the key provisions of the consent decree. And in January of this year, we filed a joint motion to declare the city and the Baltimore Police Department in full and effective compliance on three points: the safe transportation of people in custody; officer assistance and support, and ensuring health and well-being of BPD employees. The court granted that motion. And now, BPD has to sustain a record of success in these areas for one year, and then, those provisions will be to terminate--will be terminated. The Department continues to work with the police department on compliance with the other parts of the consent decree. In particular, these include use of force, use of lethal force, use of force, stops, seizures, and arrests. But this is good progress. Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes. Well, thank you, sir. You don't have to get back to me. Mr. Rogers. That concludes today's hearing. Attorney General Garland. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. I want to thank our witness, Attorney General Garland, for being very generous with his time and being open and frank in his testimony. Without objection, members may have 7 days to submit additional questions for the record. The committee stands adjourned.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Wednesday, April 17, 2024. NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION WITNESS HON. BILL NELSON, ADMINISTRATOR Mr. Rogers. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. Senator Nelson, good to see you again. We welcome your testimony regarding NASA's fiscal year 2025 budget request. The Biden administration is asking $25.4 billion for NASA. It is a roughly 2 percent increase over fiscal 2024. Funding NASA is critical to getting back to the moon, advancing our scientific understanding, and driving innovation, however we remain accountable to the taxpayer. And with the national debt skyrocketing, it is critical that NASA remain focused on its core mission. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration founded in 1958 in response to the so-called space race with the Soviet Union to land the first man on the moon. Today we find ourselves in yet another space race, this time with China. China has made aggressive investments in both deep space exploration and low-Earth orbit. NASA's funding is critical to making sure the United States remains the international leader in space. Recently Morehead State University in my district and their staff stepped up to help NASA during the Odysseus robotic moon landing, the first ever private spacecraft to land on the moon. Working with NASA, Morehead State was able to assist with establishing a command bridge to overcome communication line issue after challenges in the landing process. I have reached the limit of my intellectual capacity thereby. And Senator Nelson, one of our former House colleagues and then later the Senate, for taking on this challenging job he is in. But you accurately described it to me earlier saying that Morehead State University was the savior of this historic mission. That is quite remarkable. We are fortunate to have with us in the audience today Dr. Ben Malphrus who led this effort at Morehead State. Doctor, stand up for us. Thank you for your work.  Mr. Rogers. This amazing story is just one example of the important work Morehead State is doing in a part of the country not traditionally known for space innovation. I am so proud of the incredible work being done at Morehead State University to build the next generation of the space workforce to ensure the United States remains the global leader in space. Many of NASA's missions are important for our country's international leadership, economic success, and scientific advancement, however it is the duty of this subcommittee to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and to continue to thoroughly examine spending levels, as we did in fiscal 2024. Given the current spending environment I want to urge NASA to continue to innovate through partnerships to reduce costs while not sacrificing mission advancements. NASA has set forth an ambitious but important agenda and we look forward to hearing more about it today. So thank you, Bill Nelson, for joining us today. Let me recognize Ranking Member Cartwright for any remarks he may wish to make. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Senator Nelson, for joining us again and all the work you do to lead our very proud NASA Program. NASA continues to be respected throughout the United States and the world as a leader in advancing our knowledge of the Earth, solar system, the wider universe, as well as in advancing human space exploration, developing new technologies with wide applications, and helping to establish more fuel- efficient and environmentally-friendly aviation, among other things. But it is an inspiration of young people that go into science, technology, engineering, and math. That is where the real value of NASA is. And you can tell young people are inspired when they wear those ugly NASA tee-shirts, right? It is not fashion they are after; it is inspiration. I hope that NASA will continue to inspire young Americans and pursue--get them to pursue STEM-related careers because it is from STEM-related careers that we create wealth in this country. It has always been that way. You look at the Fortune 500 list of corporations. The ones crowding the top weren't even around a couple of generations ago because they are based on some scientific or technological breakthrough and that created wealth and things like NASA inspire young people to go into STEM. I am also proud--I am going to--sure, we can talk about Morehead State all you want, but there is the University of Scranton to talk about here, too, Mr. Chairman. I am proud that Dr. Nathaniel Frissell of the University of Scranton was selected by NASA to lead a citizens' science investigation for the study of this month's solar eclipse. He and several of his students along with an international network of A.M. radio operators researched changes in the Earth's ionosphere during the eclipse including how the sudden loss of sunlight during totality affects radio signals. In my time on this subcommittee NASA has moved from strength to strength. And under your tenure, Senator Nelson, I mean, the things that we have pulled off: flying Ingenuity on the surface of Mars, a helicopter powered by a battery in an 1 percent atmosphere. Nobody thought we could do that. NASA did it. Opening up the James Webb Space Telescope. It had to perform 340 separate operations, each one of them perfectly in order to open up and start operating and transmitting. There were amazing images that we got. It did. If one of those operations hadn't gone off correctly, it would have been space junk a million miles away, really expensive space junk. But it worked. And it has been working. And the list goes on and on. Includes the Mars Perseverance Rover, OSIRIS-REx mission, that returned an asteroid sample to Earth last year, among many other missions. NASA also continues its work on a number of critical Earth science programs aimed at advancing our understanding of the Earth and providing key information to guide efforts to tackle the climate crisis and mitigate natural hazards. In addition, NASA's Aeronautics Research Program continues to be critical to advancing the Biden administration's goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions from the aviation sector by no later than 2050. And again, it is technological advances, engineering and science breakthroughs that are going to help get us there. I look forward to hearing more today from the administrator about NASA's plans to manage, in a cost-effective manner, these many critical missions and programs. With that, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Cartwright. Senator Nelson, you are recognized for an opening statement. Without objection, your written statement will be inserted in the record. I would ask you to keep your statement hopefully to 5 minutes or less so we can have additional time for questions. You are recognized. Mr. Nelson. Thank you, I will keep it to 5 minutes. There is so much to talk about. I can hardly say my name in 5 minutes, but let me just come in on what you have already noted, the position of Morehead State. This is exemplary of the can-do attitude in the NASA community because the Ingenuity Lander came down on the south-- in the south pole region of the moon and apparently one of its legs hit a rock and it tipped over. The antenna that is supposed to be pointed at Earth is now pointed in an opposite direction. Although they got enough telemetry to know that it was alive, all the experiments on this lander, they couldn't get the data. We are trying to find out who it is so we can give special recognition--it may have been somebody at JPL, Congressman Garcia. I just don't know at this point, but I am going to find out. They figured that Morehead State, who has the antennas that were communicating, since this was a commercial lander, it had six NASA experiments on it, one of which by the way was the way that it was able to land. It was a LIDAR which is like a RADAR. As it is circling the moon, the LIDAR on the lander is on the blink. They figured out quickly to patch through to the NASA experiment LIDAR, and they were enabling them to land, but it tipped over because it hit a rock. Some very smart person figures out Morehead State has the ability to communicate commercially, but Morehead State also has the ability to communicate with government missions through the Deep Space Network. That is our Deep Space Network. They figured out how to do a patch, so that in our big dishes we could put enough throw weight in the message and could receive as well. Every experiment, both commercial and NASA, all were able to receive the information. Again, it is symbolic of how commercial and government can work together. It is a part of what we are doing. We are going back to the Moon, this time with commercial partners and with international partners. The CLPS Program, of which Intuitive Machines was one, is a commercial lander. NASA gives them seed money and then they go out and build a manifest and get clients on their lander. It becomes a business enterprise and, by the way, going to the south pole we had six NASA instruments on there. This is symptomatic of the changes in our Space Program from a half a century ago when we went to the Moon, but we went as the government program. We are going in a different way. A lot of the things that you all will ask about and talk about today will have that theme running through it. I am within the 5 minutes, Mr. Chairman. I will just stop there.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Rogers. I appreciate the director's recognition of Morehead State, which is in a small Appalachian community. And the director was generous with his time recently by visiting Dr. Malphrus and the Space Science Department at Morehead State. They now have their own department. You can get a degree in space science at Morehead State. And so they are attracting businesses now to come to be near that campus just for that reason. So thank you so much, Mr. Director. You were very generous with your remarks about Morehead State. We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witness, and I will begin by recognizing myself. Well, we are into a new space race in my judgment, this time for a sustained presence on the Moon as the gateway to the exploration of Mars and beyond. China has made very significant investments in its space program. Mr. Director, can you provide some specific examples of investments NASA is proposing in your 2025 budget request to maintain the U.S. edge over China in space? Mr. Nelson. Yes, sir. We intend to land humans first on the Moon. We are going back to a different part of the Moon. Last time it was the equatorial part of the Moon. We are going to the south pole of the Moon for a different reason. We are going back to the Moon for a different reason. We don't need to go to the Moon just to go to the Moon. We did that a half century ago. We are going to the Moon this time to learn, to live, to invent, to create how we can exist in that hostile environment so that we can go to Mars. We are going to the south pole, because we think that there is water there. We know there is ice in the crevices. If this is the Moon and this is the south pole of the Moon, the sunlight comes in at an angle. Any kind of indention is permanently shadowed. The Moon doesn't revolve. We have seen in those permanently shadowed crevices ice. If there is ice--we are sending a couple of those landers; by the way, those commercial landers, the remainder of this year and they are going to dig and see if there is ice. If there is ice, water, there is hydrogen and oxygen, we got a gas station. Your question is about a competition with China. China has made extraordinary strides, especially in last 10 years, but they are very, very secretive. We believe that a lot of their so-called Civilian Space Program is a military program. I think in fact we are in a race. China, for example, has said, and they usually telegraph what they are going to do. Their latest date that they have said that they are going to land is 2030, but that keeps moving up. I think it is incumbent on us to get there first and to utilize our research efforts for peaceful purposes. We now have upwards of 40 nations that have signed the Artemis Accords, which is a commonsense set of declarations of the peaceful uses of outer space. My concern would be if China got there first and suddenly said, okay, this is our territory, you stay out. That is not a peaceful use. There is--obviously you don't want to interfere with each other, but don't go in and declare that this whole territory is suddenly yours. By the way, anybody that doubts that, look what China has done in the South China Sea with the Spratly Islands. That is a quick answer to you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Thank you. Well, those accords have brought countries all over the world together to have an important conversation about the future of space exploration. What role does NASA play in the current geopolitical environment that we are in, particularly as China continues to advance both its military and civilian space activities? What is at stake internationally if America loses its edge as the global leader of space exploration? Mr. Nelson. We are not going to lose that global edge, but you have to be realistic that China has really thrown a lot of money at it. They have a lot of room in their budget to grow. Their science is good. Their engineering is good. The proof is in the pudding. They now have a Space Station up there. It has three elements. They usually have three taikonauts, which is what they call the Chinese astronauts. I think that we just better not let down our guard. Now, you know we have utilized NASA because of the fascination with space around the globe. NASA is usually welcomed in most countries and we have gladly reached out to other countries with not only good will, but a lot of practical things that we can do to help other countries. It is not just necessarily in space. It may be our assets in space that are looking at the Earth. For example, we can look at a farmer's field and we can tell what the moisture content is there, we can predict floods, we can predict droughts, and we can look at a forest and determine if there is disease in the forest. We are looking from space, and therefore, that forest is subject to fire because it's diseased trees. We have gotten involved with regard to the wildfires, of being able to try to head those off by giving the cautionary note to the fire service. There is a lot that we are doing. I would hope that China, the Chinese space program would come to its senses and understand that civilian space is for peaceful uses, but we have not seen that demonstrated by China. Mr. Rogers. Thank you, sir. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, Senator Nelson, you just mentioned something that I wanted to ask you about. I think all of us remember last year we sent the better part of week trying to breathe smoky air on the East Coast of the United States. God bless them, they are kind of used to that in California and parts in the West. We weren't used to that. And we found out it came from Canada. It came from Quebec wildfires. And that is new. Now you just touched on that about wildfires. The NASA budget submission for fiscal year 2025 includes an increase in Earth science, and I would like you to talk about this effort, in particular with the Earth science budget, something a lot of people not--might not immediately think of when they think of NASA. And that is this Wildland Fires project in cooperation with other federal agencies. Could you explain for us how you anticipate this effort from NASA's Earth Science Division can help communities all across the country, and indeed North America, better prepare for and respond to wildfires? Mr. Nelson. This request is a mere $20.4 million for the Wildland Fires project which supports what you just said, congressman, the improved prediction, management, and mitigation of overall impacts of wildfires. That is not only within the U.S., that is around the world as well. Mr. Cartwright. And how does that happen? I mean, you mentioned it detects diseased trees. Mr. Nelson. Exactly. Also our improved ability to predict the weather. You think of the weather as the National Weather Service, NOAA. We design, build, and launch those spacecraft that NOAA utilizes, but we also have ours that look at different things. We can, even from space, look at a desert and we can tell you if there is water underneath the sand. We have a project, a joint project with USAID, for example, called SERVIR, that we give the data for farmers to help them, and then USAID implements that in developing countries. Mr. Cartwright. We can even detect if there are methane leaks from space, can't we? Mr. Nelson. It is unbelievable. We have a spacecraft we put up a year ago, and it was to look at dust storms, and lo and behold, one of the byproducts of it, it can detect methane emissions. We have been able to go to industries that didn't even know they were emitting methane, and they are happy to receive that information so that they can stop the emissions. Mr. Cartwright. Because leaking methane was losing money for them. Well, let me shift subjects for a moment. NASA's request for aeronautics research highlights an effort to reduce non- CO2 greenhouse gas emissions noting that with increased scientific and engineering focus this research could eventually lead to completely eliminating a major aviation greenhouse gas effect. Could you tell us more about the effort and how NASA is working to achieve emissions reductions in aviation? Mr. Nelson. Yes, sir. First of all, we are working to get an all-electric airplane. We haven't been totally successful on that yet, but we have about three-quarters of a billion dollar project going with a major manufacturer. They have put in about $5 or $600 million; this is Boeing, to develop the next medium- range single-aisle transport aircraft that will save 30 percent of its fuel. The design is a high wing on the fuselage, and a very long and thin wing, so long, and thin, that it has to have struts. Because of the greater efficient wing, and it being high, you can put the bigger fanjet engine so that you could get all the more efficiency. The combination of the wing and the engines will bring 30 percent fuel savings. That is one example. Mr. Cartwright. Terrific. Final question, Cancer Moonshot. The International Space Station budget request includes a renewed focus on cancer research that supports the President's Cancer Moonshot effort. Can you tell us how this research will help find cures for cancer? Mr. Nelson. This research is just coming into its own. I have been very frustrated over the years because 38 years ago when I flew, my experiment was sponsored by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center. That was my primary experiment, growing protein crystals in space. The results were dramatic how much clearer, purer, and larger they were of the identical protein grown on Earth in gravity. Now over the years it is just taking off, because of the dedicated time of a National lab on the International Space Station of the pharmaceutical industries going and experimenting. We are having major breakthroughs on stem cell research, protein crystal growth research, and how this applies to cancer research. I am happy to provide details. Mr. Cartwright. Well, thank you, Administrator Nelson. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator, good to be with you today. Thanks for being here. And your work at NASA, as is very evident by your comments, you take your job very seriously, and thank you for doing that. And I know you enjoy what you do. And so, that certainly shines through. Of course, we talk a lot about Russia here on Capitol Hill, but even with the illegal and unjustified invasion that we have seen recently in Ukraine, the American-Russian partnership on the International Space Station remains very cooperative, at least from my understanding. Considering this cooperation that has existed, do you see a future where we could work closely with Russia in space after the deorbit of the International Space Station? Mr. Nelson. Let me say that this cooperation has been going on since 1975, when in the middle of the Cold War an American spacecraft, Apollo, rendezvoused and docked with a Soviet spacecraft, Soyuz, and the crews lived together, and that started what has been a continued cooperation--first, us going to their Space Station, Mir. The Space Shuttle docked there, and then, the joint project of building the International Space Station together with the Russians, operating it together. It would be very difficult to operate it by one or the other without the other. It brings up the question, given the fact of the inexcusable things that President Putin is doing in Ukraine, will that cooperation last? There is absolutely no indication that anything has changed in our professional relationship between astronauts and cosmonauts, between the NASA people in Moscow at Mission Control and the Russian people at Mission Control in Houston. It has continued in a very professional and effective manner of operating the Space Station; receiving and sending astronauts; receiving and sending cargo. That has operated without a hitch. However, it brings a very important point. Mr. Aderholt. Thanks. Well, let me ask you this question: should we be concerned about a potential realignment of partnerships in space where the Russians work more closely with the Chinese? Mr. Nelson. We are concerned about that, absolutely--and not only the Chinese, but others. Mr. Aderholt. And if so, what would you agree to, would you say is the case--what indications do you see that demonstrate a closer collaboration with these nations currently? Mr. Nelson. Say that again now? Mr. Aderholt. With that being the case, that you are seeing this realignment, what are you seeing that demonstrates this, that backs this up? Mr. Nelson. The realignment? Mr. Aderholt. The realignment, yes. Mr. Nelson. Thus far, there's no realignment. There's not a hitch at all in our relationship with the Russians in civilian space. When you get into military space, you've got a whole different thing. It is something that we have to be concerned about. In our budget request to you is the fact that we desperately need in the emergency supplemental appropriations, once you get through with this first tranche that you are considering, there's another one that is coming. It has been blessed by the White House. It is our request, not only to repair the damaged deep space antennas on Guam, when the typhoon hit Guam--and that happened to DoD as well--but, also, an emergency appropriations request for a deorbiting vehicle, so that we can start now, and in six years, when we want to deorbit the Space Station--and remember, this thing is 120 yards long. It is as long as a football field from goal post to goal post, and we have got to get it down safely. What happens in the next six years? Are we still going to have the same relationship that we can get it down with the Russians? We can't count on that. We have got to start now to build that U.S. deorbit vehicle that could get the whole station down safely, so it won't hit anybody or anything. Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. My time has expired. So, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Trone. Mr. Trone. Thank you, Mr. Nelson, for joining us today, and Chair Rogers and Ranking Member Cartwright. Maryland is the proud home of Goddard Space Center, 35,000 jobs, billions of dollars of economic output. OSAM, OSAM-1, an important mission being led by Goddard. It promises to deliver significant economic strategic benefits to NASA, to the Space Force, and the commercial space sector. The ability to have space mobility, including satellite servicing, orbital debris removal, these are vital capabilities that will bolster the capacity and affordability of NASA's ongoing human and scientific exploration. In 2024, we invested, Congress, $227 million in the President's budget request for OSAM and put the language in place for a 2026 launch. While we understand you have a lot of top-line pressure, pressure that NASA is under, cancelling that program would be catastrophic for scientific innovation in Maryland and result in the loss of jobs--100 civil servant, with a total loss of 700 jobs. I am told the workers at Goddard are working hard to rescope the mission prior to the October review that Congress mandated in the 2024 bill. Please share with us how NASA plans to implement the report language and how you will honor the rescoping of the mission and allow our contractors to continue with their approach to the processes. Mr. Nelson. Thank you, Congressman. Understand the hand that you have dealt us, and I say that you have dealt us. Had I been still a Member of Congress, I would have voted for that compromise when you got to the point that you had to raise the debt ceiling, so that the Government of the United States full faith and credit wouldn't go into default. In order to get the votes to get the debt ceiling raised, you had to agree to less spending. That less spending came in primarily on the non-defense discretionary spending, of which NASA is a part--so much so, it was a $2.5 billion hit to NASA in fiscal year 2024, the current year, and another $2.3 billion hit to NASA in fiscal year 2025 from what we had requested to take care of all of these things. The hit to science was a billion dollars in just 2024, and the hit to science in 2025 was about $850 million. With less money, we have to make some very tough choices. Your program is one of them. California's program is another one. Now, specifically, OSAM, let me tell you what happened to OSAM. There was an independent review board that said the original forecast was to cost no more than $750 million and launch by 2020, and it is now seven to eight years behind schedule and its latest figure is $1.6 billion. At the same time, what has happened to the marketplace is, when OSAM was created, it was thought you would go to low earth orbit, punch holes in satellites, and figure out a way to refuel them. That technology has surpassed that. We now create/ design satellites that can be easily refueled in low earth orbit. The challenge is up 23,000 miles to resupply in geosynchronous orbit, but that is not what OSAM was designed to do. By us having to make hard choices, we understand the direction that you gave us. I know what the Maryland delegation did. I used to sit in the chairs that you all sit in. I understand that, we have to make choices. And we are, for 2025, basically, wanting us to move on from OSAM. We will follow your direction for 2024 in the appropriations. It is $227 million in this year that is being spent, but we are going to have to move---- Mr. Trone. What percent does that bring us to full completion on OSAM? When we spend that $227 million, where are we going to be at? How far deep in are we? I mean, Artemis is years late, too, and billions over budget also. Mr. Nelson. Well, you know---- Mr. Trone. So, it is like, you know, the plague is everywhere. Mr. Nelson. You are nowhere near, but the things that we had developed and learned in OSAM, now we can go and help out DARPA. Now, we can go out and help out DoD for the projects that they are trying to figure out to do on orbit servicing up there at 23,000 miles up in geosynchronous. That is our recommendation to you for 2025. Mr. Trone. So, you recommend scrapping the 2026 launch date? Mr. Nelson. In the parlance of the South, this dog doesn't hunt. Mr. Trone. I yield my time back. We will come back to this. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And it is good to see you again, Administrator/Senator/ Astronaut Nelson. I feel like you are padding your resume here a little bit now, but that is all right. You and I have had a lot of discussions over this Mars Sample Return. You just made an allusion to it, obviously. And you know how I feel right now. I'm not happy that the reprogramming decisions were made before we actually had bills passed. You ended up landing on the lower end of the spectrum between the band that the House passed and what the Senate passed. It is not just me; it is pretty much the entire California delegation, and probably one of the only times I have agreed with Schiff and been on a letter with Representative Schiff--to give you testimony on how deeply this cuts. And it is not a California thing. My concern is not only about the 500 jobs already lost, you know, in the last couple of months with the JPL layoff notifications, but the national security implications of losing more jobs and getting below what I would consider critical mass in terms of workforce at JPL. And you know the adjacencies between not just JPL relative to NASA, but also NRO and other national security implications. Those 500 jobs are gone. Those people have in many cases left California. They are in other industries now. They are working everything else. And I appreciate what NASA has done with the private-public partnership and I realize there is a reshuffling of acquisition strategies and reprogrammings and IRBs taking place on the Mars Sample Return Mission itself, and re-tech, you know, re- baselining the technical solutions there. But I'm concerned that we are below critical mass at JPL. So, I want to remind everyone that the United States has actually never accomplished a soft landing on Mars without the talented minds at JPL. And, you know, they call it ``the center of the universe'' for a reason. And so, while I echo Mr. Trone's sentiment that, you know, we are making these cuts, and I understand, and you are going to give me the same answer that you just gave him, I'm sure, on OSAM. But I worry, when we make certain decisions, that we are cutting to the bone and, actually, in this case, potentially amputating JPL. So, I understand the rationale. I understand the re-baselining. And you are asking us to invest nearly $10 billion on the Moon to Mars Mission for fiscal year 2025, and I just want to, again, underscore the scientific and national security implications of what we have done here and JPL's role. So, I guess the question is, what is JPL's future role in the Moon to Mars Mission? And what are you doing, what is NASA doing now to protect the institutional knowledge, you know, probably thousands of years of institutional engineering and program management knowledge at JPL that is getting scattered into the winds, as we speak--and not necessarily staying in the space industry or aerospace industry? And, you know, what is necessary to keep American boots on the Moon and on Mars, if we are going to disintegrate this workforce? How do we reconstitute this? How do we preserve jobs? And my understanding is there's probably going to be even more layoffs coming up with fiscal year 2025. You committed to not doing more in fiscal year 2024, but I think the buzz saw is coming out in fiscal year 2025 again. So, what is the plan to make sure JPL remains relevant? Mr. Nelson. First of all, my answer to you is not the same with regard to OSAM. Mr. Garcia. Okay. Mr. Nelson. It is an extremely important objective that we return those samples on Mars. We have got, will have about 30 titanium tubes the size of a cigar filled with cores that have been drilled. They have been drilled on a dry lakebed where a river came into that lake. That is prime for us determining if there was life there. Then, when we send our astronauts to Mars, then they won't go there, because we will have that proof. They can go to another promising area to see if there was life. When you are dealing with a budget that is overall almost $5 billion cut over two years, and science itself is cut $2.7 billion in those two years, and hopefully, the following fiscal year we won't be under these constraints that the bill to raise the debt ceiling caused, the constriction. Hopefully, then, we will have a lot more flexibility. I am quite sanguine about the future, and this is why I---- Mr. Garcia. At JPL or on the MSR Mission itself? Mr. Nelson. All of the above. Mr. Garcia. Okay. Mr. Nelson. That is why on Monday I announced, as I had discussed with you on Sunday, that I was going to ask that we simply cannot afford $11 billion; that all the independent reviews have said, and you can't even get the samples back until 2040. That is when we are going to be sending astronauts up there. I said let's start and think outside the box. We have gone to JPL. We have gone to the rest of the NASA Centers. We have gone out to industry with a Request for Information: by the 17th of next month, bring us your ideas as to how we could get this done cheaper and quicker. On the basis of that, the experts at NASA will make a decision. They will give the seed money, in the appropriation, we asked for $10 million, so that we could put out that seed money and this Request for Information for 2024. Let's see what we come back with in the answers this fall, and then, at that point, we can make a decision. Now, as I mentioned to you, the head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dr. Laurie Leshin, is very confident that they are going to be able to come up in their proposal--it is going to be faster and cheaper. We want to see what other projects are out there. Remember, this is the most difficult thing, that we are talking about having an asset come off of another planet, rendezvous in Martian orbit with the European return vehicle--and that is Europe's cost--and bring those samples back to Earth. That is what I have directed, and that is what is underway. I'm very optimistic, as I talk to our scientists, that it can be done. Mr. Garcia. Okay. I appreciate it. I'm out of time. Competition is good. I just don't want to lose that crown jewel down in Pasadena, JPL, while we do that. So, thank you, sir. Thank you again for your service. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and I thank the ranking member always. And thank you, Administrator Nelson, for your long service and dedication to our country and your leadership. I will admit I feel a little bit like a kid in the candy store. When I was a young man, NASA was everything to me. I thought it was, through the lens of NASA, my childhood, it was perhaps a time of great excitement, grand adventure, and new discovery. And so, I think of it fondly. I had hoped when I was about 10 years old to be an astronaut. That was really my goal in life. But it turns out my skill set wasn't quite in line with what my dreams were. But it is not a bad consolation prize to be sitting here with you and talking about this grand future. I want to start by thanking you and NASA for coordinating Astronaut Lee Morin's visit to Rochester. So, thank you and your staff. He was in Rochester. We were on the path of totality and he came up and spent the day with us at the Strasenburgh Planetarium, and he was like a rock star. People lined up to take pictures with him and chat with him, and he was a great ambassador. So, thank you. We were in cloud cover, but he helped bring a ray of sunshine, despite the fact that we didn't quite see the eclipse. But really grateful for that and for the cooperation of your team. I was pleased to see in your budget request the inclusion of $252 million for the NEO Surveyor's important mission, some of which is being conducted in my district at the University of Rochester. And NASA completed the mission confirmation review I think in 2022, committed to launching the Surveyor by 2028. And I just wonder, what critical next steps toward your goal as an agency of Planetary Defense? Mr. Nelson. A new Surveyor. I wanted to say to Congressman Garcia that it is also a JPL project as well. Mr. Morelle. Well, he had a lot of time, but I appreciate you continuing to take---- Mr. Nelson. NEO Surveyor is on track for 2028. NEO Surveyor is a spacecraft. Also, the University of Arizona State is involved. It is going out there and it is searching for killer asteroids. As you know, 2 years ago, we sent a spacecraft to intercept an asteroid 7 million miles from Earth. We hit it at 14,000 miles an hour, bull's eye, and it moved it. We now know that we can do that. NEO Surveyor is going to help us find a killer asteroid. This is one of the things that you all had mandated to us, is to go out there to look for asteroids that could threaten planet Earth. Mr. Morelle. Again, thank you. You talked a little bit about the investment in the International Space Station, which doesn't enable a large group of people in the supply chain companies, including those in my home State of New York, to be a part of this, and to support the ISS. NASA works with private companies under something called the Crew and Cargo Program to safely transport astronauts and supplies to and from space. Can you talk about why maintaining a regular cadence of flights is important? You talked a little bit about the ISS, but why is this important to their continued operations? Mr. Nelson. With regard to low earth orbit, with regard to the Moon, or both? Mr. Morelle. Both. Mr. Nelson. Okay. Well, the more experience and testing that you do on a continual basis in a very hostile environment, the more you build your confidence and the more you reduce your risk. That is why a continued cadence is so very important. It is also prudent to have a backup plan. Years ago when we said we are going to get commercial companies into delivering astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, we wanted two. The two were SpaceX and Boeing. Lo and behold, as it turns out, SpaceX has been flying cargo and crew for the last four years, and Boeing's first launch of the test crew of two astronauts will be somewhere around May the 1st. That constant repetition reduces your risk. The same is true for the Moon. However, the Moon is a much different thing, a much more expensive proposition, and that cadence is a lot more infrequent, but we still hope a cadence of about one a year. Mr. Morelle. Very good. I had additional questions, but I'm not sure whether there will be a second round. But I can submit in writing, if there is not. I appreciate the time, Mr. Chair, and yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman. And thank you, Senator, for being here today. When will China become the global leader in space exploration? Mr. Nelson. Well, if we have anything to do with it, they won't. Mr. Gonzales. That is exactly the right answer. And we have to make sure that China is never the global leader. The United States will always lead that way. Senator Nelson, maintaining the Artemis mission schedule is essential to ensuring we return U.S. astronauts to the lunar surface before China accomplishes a crude Moon landing. We know there are delays in Artemis 2 and 3. Does NASA have the flexibility to adjust the CONOPS as necessary to maintain the Artemis schedule? Mr. Nelson. Well, the Artemis schedule is going to be operative when it is safe for our astronauts to fly. The present schedule is that we will launch the first crew around the Moon to check out the spacecraft Orion and its life support systems. That will occur in September of next year, which is September of 2025. The schedule presently is for the first landing to occur one year later in September of 2026. That landing is dependent upon the first commercial lander, which is SpaceX. They are presently testing their big rocket--it is the largest, most powerful rocket ever--from Boca Chica, which is just to the north of the mouth of the Rio Grande. We have as a backup, the second round of competition which was run by Blue Origin. They have said, since they are two or three years behind on that second round, that they don't expect to be landing until 2029. There is a lot riding on the first successful lander. If that is successful, Artemis 3, the first landing, then Artemis 4 is a larger, taller, more powerful rocket. It is an evolved Space Launch System. It goes off on a new and larger mobile platform because it is carrying not only the spacecraft Orion, it is now carrying a component of what is known as Gateway, which is like a Lunar Space Station. That is scheduled to go about 2 years after the first landing. That is still SpaceX. Artemis 5, which would be a year or so later, would be the first landing of the Blue Origin landing. Mr. Gonzales. You have highlighted this timetable, this domino effect, if you will, why it is so critical to make sure that that first domino lands correctly. And it is nothing easy about this, right? There are some growing pains that happened. You made some mistakes along the way. I think SpaceX has done an amazing job at correcting that. But we have to make sure that we do not get in their way. As long as they are meeting all the criteria and they are moving the ball forward, that first domino is critical to making sure that that fifth domino lays on, lays on time, on time/on target is important. My next question: are there any plans to further reduce the number of scientists and engineers that are working for NASA? Mr. Nelson. We need all that we could get. I see no plans. We have about 15,000 civil servants, and we have about 45,000 contractors, all of which wear the NASA badge. A total workforce of about 60,000, we are not anticipating any major layoffs at all. Mr. Gonzales. Excellent. Because I would urge you, as you are making these tough decisions, you can't just grow scientists, you can't just add them to the equation. They are an invaluable asset overall. And then the last question that I have for you is do we know how many scientists and engineers are working on the China space program? Mr. Nelson. I don't. Of course, even if I dug, it would be hard to pull that out. Maybe you could get it from the Intel Committee. However, I caution that they have made huge strides in the last 10 years, and you better not take anything for granted. Mr. Gonzales. I mention this because if we are, we are in this space race with China, and if we are going to defeat this space race it will not be defeated with words. It will be defeated with actions. And those actions are our scientists going to work and delivering just like they always have. And with that, Chairman, I am out of time and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Rogers. Okay. Senator, good to see you, sir. As the Chinese Communist Party escalates its investment in space exploration--I want to piggyback on what Mr. Gonzales said a little bit here--I want to underscore the critical importance of NASA in countering it. NASA's primary work not only advances our understanding of the universe, but also develops cutting edge technologies important for maintaining military and economic superiority in the evolving space domain. However, I am concerned that NASA's advancements in space exploration, specifically its Artemis missions, are not remaining on track and on budget. A March 2024 ``60 Minutes'' report detailed significant questions surrounding this program and its continued bleeding costs and schedule overruns. In this report, NASA's Inspector General stated that, and I quote, ``Significant reductions in cost and better planning that the current''--that ``Without significant reductions in cost and better planning, the current trajectory of the Artemis program is not sustainable.'' In response, NASA's Associate Administrator in charge of the Artemis program said that NASA disagreed with the Inspector General's characterization of the current situation, and stated that NASA has taken a ``affordable path for the Artemis missions.'' So, Senator Nelson, what do you think? Do you agree or disagree with your Inspector General's characterization that the current Artemis trajectory is not sustainable? Please give me your thoughts on that. Mr. Nelson. Remember what President Kennedy said? He said, ``We go to the Moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard.'' Any time you go and try to create a safe set of technology to put humans, particularly at the South Pole--I gave you that illustration, so that is the Moon, this is the South Pole, and the light is coming in there. Mr. Clyde. I was listening. Mr. Nelson. It is pockmarked with craters, and the craters are completely in shadow or darkness. Mr. Clyde. Dark. Mr. Nelson. Therefore, you have to be very precise in your landing. There is no room for error. Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong taking manual control had to keep flying, and when he landed, he had just a few seconds left. He was avoiding boulders, he was avoiding craters. He had just a few seconds left when he shut down the engines. It is hard, but you have to do it as safely as you can. When it is hard and safe, it is going to cost money. The James Webb Space Telescope that went over twice the amount of money, and took twice as long, look what we are reaping from the James Webb Space Telescope: an understanding of the universe in ways that we never had, seeing galaxies that we never knew existed, et cetera. We are trying to tighten up the spending on bringing a lot of those, some 15 individual contracts, and bring them together into a unified whole. I am not going to sit here and tell you it is not going to be expensive, because it is. Mr. Clyde. All right. Well, we just want to make sure that the taxpayer's dollar is spent the most effective and efficient way possible. That is why we are here. You know, we are already $34 trillion in debt. And so, everything that we spend we have got to, you know, make sure that we get the best value for it. Mr. Nelson. May I just add a comment? I don't want to take away your time. Mr. Clyde. Go ahead, sir. Mr. Nelson. I will do it at the end of your time. Go ahead. Mr. Clyde. All right. Well, the OIG estimated that each Artemis mission, that the launch would cost $4.2 billion per launch for Artemis missions. What do you say to that? I mean, do you think that is affordable? Mr. Nelson. As you launch more over time, you bring down the per unit cost. Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. Okay, that is all the questions I have got for you. You are welcome to elaborate on what you wanted to talk about. Mr. Nelson. Yes, please. Understand that this isn't all like we are pouring money down a rathole. Look what it is doing for our country. Look what happened when we spent the money on the Apollo program. Two generations of technology development came out of it. The microminiaturization revolution came out of the Apollo program when we had to make things light in weight, small in volume, and highly reliable. Look at how that technology has spread through the American economy. Look at the jobs as a result of this program throughout the entire U.S. Look at the educational benefit. The fact that we are going and doing daring things, you go into any classroom in this country and talk about it, and immediately you have the attention of those children in that classroom. They are getting excited about technology, engineering, and mathematics. That is an intangible value to the space program that has reaped financial rewards many times over to what it cost on Apollo a half a century ago, and what it is costing in our space program now. Mr. Clyde. I appreciate that perspective, Senator. And with that, I am way over time. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to see you, Director. Good to have you here. I would like to continue the discussion of the Artemis Accords themselves and bring it down a little bit. They have an important role to play in demonstrating a new level of American exceptionalism to create a formal legal framework for space. And with Switzerland and Sweden becoming the 37th and 38th countries to join the Accords, this stands in stark contrast to China's competing International Lunar Research Station Cooperation Organization. What role in importance does continuing our international partners in low Earth orbit have on our long-term exploration strategy for the Artemis Accords? Mr. Nelson. We have 15 partners on the International Space Station. For example, in addition to the Russian section of the station, we have a Japanese module, and we have a European Space Agency module. All these nations are directly participating. Nations are flying with us as international astronauts. A lot of those that are cooperating now are going with us to the Moon as well. For example, the mini-space station that is going to be orbiting around the Moon, it already has the partners that will contribute to the building of it: Canada, UAE, the European Space Agency, Japan, and there are more to come. This international cooperation has been phenomenal wherever we are, whatever we are doing. Look at the international cooperation on the James Webb Space Telescope. I mean, this is going out to the entire international community of astronomers. Mr. Cline. Is Canada the largest contributor to the agreement other than the United States? Mr. Nelson. Which agreement? Mr. Cline. Well, Artemis. I would say the lunar mission. Mr. Nelson. The short answer is no. Mr. Cline. Okay. Mr. Nelson. Eventually the cost, for example, on the rocket the life sciences, the life supporting equipment is in what is known as the European Service Module. That is attached underneath the capsule, which is Orion. At this point it is probably Europe. Although Japan is investing very, very heavily in our space program. Mr. Cline. Gotcha. Now, the International Space Station was where I was moving toward, has also played its part on its own to many different types of advanced and expensive scientific equipment, most of which was not designated to be brought back to Earth. According to the National Academy's 2023 Biological and Physical Sciences Decadal Survey, it would cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.5 billion to rebuild and launch these to some other commercial low Earth orbit destination. Can you talk about what is being done to preserve the equipment on the International Space Station as we make plans for a de-orbit? Mr. Nelson. Well, the ones that have technological life, I am sure there is going to be some kind of thought put into that of preserving that. Stripping it out if it is still of economic value and bringing it back before you de-orbit the International Space Station in 2031. By the way, we don't de-orbit until we have a commercial space station or stations, which we now have given the incentive money to at least three companies to build a commercial space station and show its economic vitality and its business case for being there. That is our intention. Once we have a commercial space station, we can train our astronauts there, because our focus is not low Earth orbit at that point, our focus is out there at the Moon and beyond. Mr. Cline. Right. But what we want to avoid is a gap that would cede the U.S.'s leadership in space to China, especially regarding low Earth orbit. Is there a plan in place to maintain American prominence and avoid gaps in human space flight capability and presence in a low Earth orbit? Mr. Nelson. If I have anything to do with it, there is not going to be a gap. Mr. Cline. Right. Mr. Nelson. I am expecting we are going to have commercial space stations. Mr. Cline. In the next 10 years? Is that your estimate? Mr. Nelson. Well, by 2030. Mr. Cline. Okay. Mr. Nelson. If we didn't, then I would make the case. If I were still at this table, I would make the case that we need to continue the station until we do have alternatives, because I don't think we want to give up the permanent presence in space. Mr. Cline. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Director, we hope you still have that seat. Mr. Ellzey. Mr. Ellzey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks, Senator. Good to see you again. Thank you for being here. Real quick, getting right to it, let's talk about aeronautics real quick and the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator. What do we see down the road as a benefit to spending money on that and the hypersonics? Real quick. I got a couple more after this. Mr. Nelson. We are a research organization, but we are working on hypersonics. The commercial use of hypersonics is to get from point A to point B on planet Earth quick. There are, obviously, a lot of national defense issues with regard to hypersonics, but we do the research. Now, with regard to the Low Boom, this is the needle-nosed X-plane that is going to fly at the end of the year to see if we can go supersonic and not create that jarring sonic boom, but because of its design it recreates the shockwave so that it becomes a muffled roar. Mr. Ellzey. And so the idea is to translate that research that you do into a standardized wing that other commercial carriers can start to pick up and advance much faster flight around the world? Mr. Nelson. A design so that commercial aircraft can then fly supersonic overpopulated areas, so that you could go from L.A. to New York, and you could do it in maybe two-and-a-half hours. Mr. Ellzey. Okay, perfect. This next, this next subject is more of a comment that doesn't require an explanation. I will say that in the business that you are in and the operations that you conduct my comment is this: anything that is not based on merit and performance in the risky operations that you undertake, and any money extended outside of that is a waste of money. That is my comment. I think you know what I am talking about there. I just want that to be on the record because I know we are spending $22 million on programs like that. And I think that while that, in a $25 billion program that is a minuscule amount, but it is $22 million that belongs to the American taxpayer. Now, something more positive. Let's talk about your T-38s, which I have seen. Haven't flown in yet but would like to someday. They are pristine and they are the earliest T-38s ever built. Do you see a transition coming for a different trainer type aircraft? And, if so, what is your time line and what do you need? Mr. Nelson. The answer is likely yes, but I don't know the details on the trading out of the T-38s. Mr. Ellzey. Okay. Mr. Nelson. They are still operating well. Mr. Ellzey. Okay. Mr. Nelson. That is one thing that NASA does well is its maintenance program. Mr. Ellzey. Yes. You have a flaw--I mean, they are, indeed, 60, in some places older, years old, 60-year-old aircraft, the T-38 supersonic trainer aircraft. And these are the first off the line. So, I have seen the professionalism and the love that is put into those aircraft. And with the more infrequent space flights I know that keeping pilots and keeping astronauts airborne is extremely important. And doing so economically and safely is important to me, too. So, I just want to make sure that as that need comes up, we need to turn it as quickly as possible to make sure you all have what you need. Mr. Nelson. You know, the T-38s are so good for the military they are used as an aggressor aircraft in a lot of the war games. Mr. Ellzey. That is right. That is right. My time is winding down. Thank you for your time. Always good to see you. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. The gentleman yields back. There is I think a request for a second round of questions. Mr. Director, if we do a second round we will try to keep it as brief as we can, given your schedule. Is that okay with you? Mr. Nelson. I am here at your pleasure, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Thank you. We will do a second round. We will limit remarks to 3 minutes each. And we will lead off with Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Nelson, in the budget request NASA identified Mobile Launcher 2 as being the critical path to Artemis 4. That means that delays to the Mobile Launcher 2 would delay the Artemis 4 launch. Am I correct so far? Mr. Nelson. Correct. Mr. Cartwright. All right. And that will be the second Artemis Moon Landing Mission. The first crewed Gateway mission is currently scheduled to launch in September 2028. The question is what steps is NASA taking to reduce the risk of delay to Mobile Launcher 2 that would inevitably delay the launch of the Artemis 4 mission? Mr. Nelson. I have met personally with the CEO of the well- known international company that has built that. They had really dropped the ball, but they have really picked it up. I am led to believe that I think they are on schedule now. Mr. Cartwright. Keeping a close eye on them, are you? Mr. Nelson. So much so, eyeball to eyeball with the CEO. Mr. Cartwright. Good to know. Good answer. Thank you, Mr. Administrator. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. I just, I just have one question for you, Senator. Has NASA ever provided an official cost estimate for the Artemis 3 mission? Mr. Nelson. By breaking it out into one mission? Mr. Clyde. Yes. Mr. Nelson. Normally what you do is you would take your research and development cost and you would amortize that over all the missions that you are going to have in the future instead of piling all of that on the first landing, which is Artemis 3, which is what you asked. Mr. Clyde. Right. That is correct. Mr. Nelson. We can get you whatever figure you want. Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. I would like to see kind of what you all figure Artemis 3 would cost. And if you are going to, you know, take that and then build upon it, as you said, Artemis 4, Artemis 5, it would be interesting then to see what--I would like to see what the additional costs of what you think that the further missions would be, so that we can kind of see a whole end game here. Mr. Nelson. We don't intend just to go to the Moon for three or four flights and that is it. I mean, we can, we are planning this to keep going out into the future until we get sufficient technology and systems that we think we can go to Mars. I think that is in the 2040s. In the meantime, we are going to be doing a lot of science on the surface of the Moon, such as just last week the Japanese Government is going to do the cost and building of a pressurized rover. That is going to give our astronauts the ability to go out and to stay on the surface for 30 days, because they will have a mobile environment in and out of the rover. They go in and out of a lockout room and they can take off the spacesuits that they have to use outside, and then they can live and run around. When the astronauts are in it, it is going to be autonomous. They can operate it from Earth as it will roam around, so it will give a greater range that we can explore the South Pole of the Moon. Mr. Clyde. I am looking forward to seeing your plans. Thank you. I yield back.  MATERIAL FOR THE RECORD BY CONGRESSMAN CLYDE REGARDING COST FOR ARTEMIS 3 MISSION Congressman Clyde: Has NASA ever provided an official cost estimate for the Artemis 3 mission? I would like to see what kind of what you all figure Artemis 3 would cost. And if you are going to, you know, take that, and then build upon it, as you said, Artemis 4, Artemis 5, it would be interesting then to see what--I would like to see what the additional costs of what you think the further missions would be, so that we can kind of see a whole end game here. NASA Response: Since the beginning of the programs in FY 2012, what is now Artemis has been appropriated by program, not by mission. Correspondingly, the programs established their contracts by program, not by mission. Therefore, NASA has rigorous processes in place to manage costs by the Artemis program rather than by mission and does not separately calculate costs for individual Artemis missions. The agency is capitalizing on lessons learned during initial manufacturing efforts to reduce overall costs in each program, including increasing cost-efficiency through bulk purchases, implementing unique contracting structures, and standardizing workflow. NASA remains committed to transparent cost reporting that captures the unique nature of space exploration planning and mission development. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Trone. Mr. Trone. Thank you, sir, Mr. Administrator, while China is aggressively deploying more spacecraft to the Moon, they had another successful launch on March 19. Here in the U.S. we have an opportunity to catch up by combining forces with some of our domestic commercial industry partners. The CLPS missions are wonderful, as recently demonstrated by the Intuitive Machines' successful lunar landing. So, why are we not using the same techniques to get these lunar orbiters around the Moon that China has? Mr. Nelson. Well, that is exactly what we are doing with the CLPS missions, C-L-P-S, that you mention. We are using commercial enterprises to bear the costs of landers of which we put NASA instruments that, in effect, become scouts for us before we ever send our astronauts to that part of the Moon. Now, is that what your question is? Mr. Trone. Yeah, we are trying to get at what the Chinese are doing, do you think, on the backside of the Moon? Do you have any insights on that? Mr. Nelson. Well, they are going to have a lander on the far side of the Moon, which is the side that is always in the dark. We are not planning to go there. Mr. Trone. And why not? And what is the benefit of doing so? Mr. Nelson. We don't know what is on the backside of the Moon, so that would be something that they would discover. Our decision is that it is more profitable for us to go to the South Pole of the Moon, because we think that is where the water is. Mr. Trone. Why do you think they made that decision? I am curious. Mr. Nelson. I have no idea. Mr. Trone. Okay. Let's talk a second about the imbalance sometimes we are concerned with in Maryland between science versus exploration missions. What future missions do you have intended for Goddard and the Science Mission Directorates? And how does the budget request affect those missions? Mr. Nelson. Well, Goddard is one of our great assets. You have all kinds of things at Goddard. For example, you have coming up, we just announced today that we approved the Dragonfly mission. It is in Maryland at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins. That is going to the Saturn Moon of Titan. If there is a Planetary Science Mission, Goddard usually has something that it is involved in. Mr. Trone. What about the Habitable Worlds Observatory? This would be in Goddard. We got $50 million for that. And are you willing to work with the committee to make sure this program has some increased funding to really make it work? Mr. Nelson. Not only work with you, we want it to work, because the Habitable Worlds, which is one that we go in the 2040s, we have got to start it now. Its whole goal is to go out there and find other Earths where there is carbon, there is water, and that it has the right amount of distance from their Sun, looking for life. Which is one of our charters, by the way is to look for life. You also have DAVINCI. It is going to Venus. You have Landsat which is, you know, looking back at Earth, giving us all kinds of data. We have nine of those Landsats. The most recent one is, I think, Landsat 9. You have one that we just approved called Dragonfly. Just around the corner, you have the next big telescope after the James Webb. The James Webb is good for not only now, but for at least 20 years. Mr. Trone. Spectacular. Spectacular. Mr. Nelson. You have the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope that, again, is helping identify other potential Earths out there as we are searching. When we find those, by the way, not only looking for life, we start to understand their development, and we better understand who we are, why we are here, how we got here, and all of this evolution of the cosmos. Mr. Trone. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, sir. I just have one question. Your budget request proposes a rapid ramp-down of the Chandra X-ray Observatory budget. It was partly assembled in my district by Eastman Kodak. But the district synergizes with the James Webb Space Telescope and has nearly, as I understand it, a decade of mission life left. So, I am concerned that the decision diminishes our return on investment with the JWST and cedes U.S. leadership on X-ray astronomy. Would you be willing to look at reconsideration of that ramp-down? And, if not, tell me how we will continue to have leadership in this, in this area? Mr. Nelson. Remember I said we had to make hard choices? Now, Chandra has been a mission that has given us so many gifts, but it has been there for 25 years. It is time for new missions. When you cut us, and I am not saying that in any accusatory way, I am saying had I been a member, I would have voted for that too, to save the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. That was the compromise you had to do. You had to cut non-defense discretionary, and you cut us $2 billion on science, just science, over the two years, 2024 and 2025. Let's start making that up in 2026. Mr. Morelle. Well, I appreciate that. And it has been in operation for 25 years. My understanding is it is continuing to add to our knowledge base on X-ray astronomy, and that it does have useful life left. So, I would think, and I understand new missions are important, but one that is working and really generating some results, I would think we would want to continue working. I would hope. I mean, obviously I understand the need to prioritize. And I would like to be spending more in your space, in your area. I would just ask you to, perhaps if we could have additional conversation, I would like to ask you to reconsider on this. Mr. Nelson. Of course. Mr. Trone. Yes. Thank you, sir. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Well, that concludes today's hearing. We want to thank our witness Administrator Nelson for being here with us, being generous with his time and information. Sir, we thank you for your service to your country. Mr. Nelson. Mr. Chairman, may I make a personal comment? Mr. Rogers. Please. Mr. Nelson. Of course I've had the good fortune to have known you for quite a while. We served together in the House many, many moons ago. As I look at your wall here and see all of those portraits, I served with all of those former chairmen all the way back to Jamie Whitten. It is a great privilege for me to return from whence I came. Thank you for the privilege. Mr. Rogers. Well, we are delighted with your presence and your service to both the House and the Senate, as well as now with this most important job with the nation's space program. Without objection, members may have 7 days to submit additional questions for the record. The subcommittee stands adjourned.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Tuesday, May 7, 2024. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION WITNESS ANNE MILGRAM, ADMINISTRATOR Mr. Rogers. The subcommittee will come to order. Good morning, everyone. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. Administrator Milgram, we want to welcome you to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee today to testify regarding the Drug Enforcement Administration's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request. On a personal note, I want to thank you for your attendance earlier this year at the Annual Prescription Drug Summit in Atlanta. Your passion for the efforts to combat the drug epidemic is commendable. And your presence at the summit was greatly appreciated and understood. Before we delve into the specifics of the budget request, I want to address a broader theme that has emerged in our examination of DEA's operations. While the mission of the DEA remains crucial and the commitment of Administrator Milgram appears sincere, it is evident that the support the agency receives from both the Department of Justice and this administration, in general, is lacking. Recent remarks by the Attorney General and the FBI Director regarding our law enforcement relationship with key partners have raised concerns. Three weeks ago, when discussing law enforcement of cooperation with Mexico, the FBI Director testified ``I am pleased with what we have gotten, but we need a lot more.'' That is the FBI Director. When the DEA encounters obstacles such as difficulties in securing visas in a timely manner for agents to operate in Mexico, and there are outstanding warrants that the Mexican Government fails to act upon, it suggests that the state of our relationship with Mexico may be far from ideal. Additionally, it is troubling that the DEA Administrator, despite her efforts, has not been able to secure a single meeting with a Mexican Government official since assuming her position. This lack of engagement the nonsensical, bureaucratic delay in approving visas and blatantly ignoring extradition requests for cartel members should be far from pleasing for anyone who cares about our efforts to combat the cartels. Furthermore, despite this administration's announcement in November 2023 that it has secured China's cooperation to take steps to curtail the transit of fentanyl precursor chemicals, tangible progress in this regard seems to be lacking and more work remains to be done. In fiscal year 2024, our subcommittee was faced with a challenging allocation which required significant cuts to many critical agencies' budgets. Despite this, the DEA was the only law enforcement agency to receive an increase in funding, the only one. I believe this speaks to our commitment to the mission of the DEA and our hopes for your success. Notably, the largest increase in the DEA's Fiscal '25 budget request is for the expansion of the DEA's Counter Threat Targeting Teams. While this expansion is commendable, we must ensure that these investments yield measurable results, and that includes buy-in from the Department of Justice. The Attorney General's testimony before this subcommittee 2 weeks ago highlighted a concerning sentiment regarding the DEA's role in combating the fentanyl crisis. When describing the whole of government approach this administration has taken to combat fentanyl, the Attorney General noted Treasury's role and sanctions, Homeland's role in border security, the FBI's role in investigating cartels, the Marshals' role in securing fugitives, and then said ``The DEA has at the very end of the line, a public affairs campaign. The perception that the DEA's role is limited to an education campaign undermines the agency's vital enforcement efforts. Nevertheless, we continue to believe in the mission of the DEA and recognize its importance in the war on drugs.'' Administrator Milgram, we look forward to hearing from you today about the DEA's plans for fiscal year 2025 and how the agency intends to address the challenges we discussed here. I am especially interested in hearing your frank and honest assessment of our law enforcement relationship with Mexico, your agency's assessment of any progress in stopping Chinese precursor chemicals, and whether the DEA is truly receiving the support it needs from this administration. Thank you for being here. I yield back the balance of my time. Let me recognize Mr. Cartwright for any remarks he may care to make. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Chairman Rogers. And Chairman Rogers, I join you in welcoming back Administrator Milgram for her second appearance before this subcommittee while we discuss the Fiscal Year 2025 President's budget request. First, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic loss of our brothers and sisters of the Department of Justice, last week, when Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas M. Weeks and three members of a Marshals Fugitive Task Force lost their lives. It is a stark reminder of the risks and threats our federal law enforcement and their partners face every day and the ultimate sacrifice too many have had to make in the name of keeping our nation safe. I would also like to convey my deepest sympathies to their families, friends, and colleagues. Administrator Milgram, last year, we focused on how the types of drugs on our streets have dramatically shifted from plant-based narcotics, such as cocaine and heroin, to those made in laboratories that require no growing season. The accessibility and affordability of these synthetic drugs leaves DEA and its Federal, State, and local partners in a continuous defensive posture to keep dangerous narcotics out of our communities and to combat the drug-trafficking networks who are trying to put them there. It is estimated by the CDC that in the last year, we have lost over 112,000 souls to fentanyl overdoses and poisonings. DEA is in many ways the last line of defense we have to save American lives against this epidemic. So I look forward to discussing with you today what DEA has done over the last year to identify and dismantle the entire network and what investments and other tools are most important to you in your fiscal year 2025 budget to continue this important work. I also look forward to hearing how the work you are doing on the international stage further enhances your ability to prevent these dangerous drugs from ever entering our country. We have already heard from both FBI Director Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland this year about the Mexican Government and the chairman touched on this, how the Mexican Government can be doing more to help us in this fight. We know the precursor chemicals are largely being imported into Mexico from the People's Republic of China. We know the Mexican cartels are utilizing their decades old business models rapidly to produce fentanyl and distribute it. We know they are exploiting their existing drug trafficking routes to smuggle millions of dollars' worth of fentanyl pills into our country. We need Mexico to be a partner in this fight. So I look forward to discussing that more with you here today. I want to say ultimately all of DEA's work relies heavily on Congress to provide the resources needed to address the existing and emerging challenges in combating drug trafficking operations. Continued investment in DEA sends a clear signal to our adversaries on the global stage that we will not allow this attack on our communities to continue without consequence and that those responsible will be held accountable by our justice system. Administrator Milgram, I want to applaud the work of the men and the women of the DEA and I look forward to working with you on how we can best invest in this agency in FY 2025. So once again, thanks for being here. Welcome back. And I look forward to your testimony. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Administrator Milgram, you are recognized for an opening statement. Without objection, your written statement will be entered into the record. Thank you. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cartwright, members of this committee. I want to thank the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today on National Fentanyl Awareness Day. It is appropriate that on National Fentanyl Awareness Day that I am given the opportunity to highlight for you the national tragedy that is being caused by fentanyl. According to the CDC, in 2022, 107,941 Americans lost their lives. Forty-two percent of Americans in the United States now know someone who has died. This tragedy has not spared cities, suburbs, rural communities, or Tribal lands. Fentanyl is killing all Americans. Our communities today are being flooded with fentanyl hidden in other drugs or pressed into fake pills by two Mexican cartels, the Sinaloa cartel and the Jalisco cartel. We, during the past year, DEA has seized fentanyl throughout the United States at unprecedented levels. Just last year, we seized nearly 79 million fake pills laced with fentanyl and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. Together, this is more than 380 million potential deadly doses of fentanyl. For the nearly 10,000 employees working at DEA, there is no greater urgency than to defeat the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels in order to save American lives. The $3.8 million increase that you have provided to DEA this fiscal year is invaluable support for our mission. Thank you. We know that you are under financial constraints and we are grateful. This increased funding will enable us to continue our critical work to defeat the cartels to combat the fentanyl epidemic and to save lives. Building on our many successes over the past year requires continued support and resources from Congress. With your support, we have continued to transform DEA to meet this unprecedented moment. Our Counter Threat Teams, which we set up in 2022 and 2023, are active against every single part of the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels and their criminal networks. These teams include special agents, intelligence analysts, targeters, program analysts, data scientists, and digital cyber specialists. We also have partners from across the U.S. Government that have joined our team. The Counter Threat Teams are providing DEA with an operating picture of each cartel that enables us to adapt to the ever-evolving threat. We added a third Counter Threat Team in 2023 to focus on the elaborate illicit finance of the cartels. This team is providing DEA with a detailed financial picture of the cartels including their global money laundering operations and I am sure we will talk more about this today, but we are now tracking billions of dollars that are being moved by the cartels across the globe. The work of this team has allowed us to open a significant number of new money laundering investigations targeting these two cartels. In 2023, DEA took action against every single part of the global fentanyl supply chain run by the cartels. When I testified before you last April, we had just announced charges against 28 members, suppliers, chemical brokers, laboratory managers, weapons traffickers, assassins, and smugglers of the Chapitos Network of the Sinaloa cartel that are responsible for bringing deadly fentanyl into the U.S. In May of last year, we announced the Operation Last Mile where we arrested 3,337 people across the United States for working in partnership with the two cartels to sell deadly fentanyl in our communities and on social media. Those investigations showed us that half of all cases were directly linked to the sale of fentanyl on social media. In June and October of last year, as part of our investigations into Chinese chemical companies, DEA charged 12 Chinese chemical companies, 24 Chinese nationals, and took 2 Chinese nationals into custody. These are the first-ever charges to be brought against Chinese companies for fentanyl trafficking and they demonstrate that precursor chemicals are being sold, that they are cheap, that they are sold online on websites, they are shipped through common carriers, and payment for those chemicals are being made through crypto currency, Bitcoin, Western Union, PayPal, Alibaba, and other common sources. In 2024, DEA continues to innovate and to work with urgency to save American lives. The insights we have learned from our Counter Threat Teams, we are taking them and we are building the next step in the global fight against fentanyl by standing up the Trident Directorate. This directorate consists of two DEA led, joint operational task forces that will be staffed by individuals from across U.S. law enforcement, military, and intelligence communities so the United States can use every possible tool to defeat the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels. Trident will allow us to leverage all of DEA's critical information on the cartels with our state, local, federal intelligence and defense partners. We believe that this joint task force will allow us to significantly disrupt the two cartels globally. We very much hope that Congress will continue to support this work and to help us defeat the cartels. Before I close, I imagine that you have read press reports regarding the DOJ proposal to reschedule marijuana. Because the formal rulemaking process is ongoing, and my role in that process is to determine the scheduling of drugs, it would be inappropriate for me to respond to questions on this rescheduling matter. I also want to take a moment and offer my deep thanks to every member of this subcommittee for the work that you do on this National Fentanyl Awareness Day. The men and women of DEA are working tirelessly every day to defeat the cartels and save American lives and we all thank you for your support in Fiscal Year 2024. The threat continues and the work continues. Thank you.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Ambassador. We are now going to proceed under the five-minute rule with questions for the witness and I will begin by recognizing myself. Administrator Milgram, I understand that as of last month, DEA has approximately 13 visas pending Mexican approval. This has resulted in some DEA employees waiting six to eight months for visa approval to work in Mexico. Additionally, there are 13 DEA warrants pending extradition from the Mexican Government. Do you believe your agents would say they are pleased with our law enforcement relationship with Mexico the same way the FBI Director did? Ms. Milgram. Thank you so much, Congressman. And if I can, let me just start by talking about the global supply chain that the two cartels operate. Those two cartels are based in Mexico. The cartels are sourcing chemicals from China, bringing those chemicals along with pill presses, dies, and molds to Mexico, mass producing fentanyl in Mexico, taking some of that fentanyl, pressing it into pills in Mexico, and then transporting it across into the United States. So the role that Mexico plays in this--and then they are involved in illicit finance and money laundering to get the dirty money back for their profits. So the role that Mexico plays across the global fentanyl supply chain is obviously a significant and critical one for all of us to be focused on. And as I said before, before this committee, we are relentlessly focused on this. So let me say a few things about Mexico and the issue you raise. First, we are committed to working shoulder to shoulder with anyone across the globe who will work with DEA in partnership on this fight. The second is that I thought Director Wray said it very well when he said that the cooperation has been uneven and that we need much more. And I would echo that we have had some extraditions. We have seen the Mexican law enforcement destroy some labs, but there is so much more work to be done and we would very much like to partnership with Mexico in doing this. And finally, when you talk about the visas, just a moment to just sort of really recognize the incredible work that is happening by the men and women in DEA in 69 countries across the globe including Mexico. That work is hard. They work relentlessly on this and we are waiting on those 13 visas. I believe one has been pending for about eight months. And unfortunately, everyone sitting in this room, we know the price that we pay to the country when we wait that long. Mr. Rogers. Well, let me ask you again, do you believe--are you pleased with our relationship with Mexico on this matter? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I would describe myself and I would say this very clearly on National Fentanyl Awareness Day that I think there is so much more work that needs to be done urgently to stop this threat. Mr. Rogers. So you are not pleased? Ms. Milgram. I could not have higher regard for the men and women of DEA and the way that they are carrying out our mission and I believe that we need more assistance globally as we fight this threat. We also are doing more internally to meet this moment and I couldn't say enough to you that my position is I am never going to look a family member who has lost a loved one in the eyes and tell them I didn't do everything I could to stop this threat from happening. Mr. Rogers. I gather you are not pleased. Ms. Milgram. There is much more work to be done. Mr. Rogers. You are not pleased. Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I would say that--here is when I will be pleased. I will be pleased when there are no more American deaths from fentanyl. Mr. Rogers. Amen. Ms. Milgram. And that is when I think we will all be able to say that we succeeded. Mr. Rogers. I understand Mexico has created approval committees, but these all appear to amount to bureaucratic hurdles that did not previously exist. What steps have the Department of Justice and the administration taken as a whole to improve DEA's relationship with Mexico? Have you observed any progress? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I am not familiar with those committees. I do know that the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General have gone frequently to Mexico and are often advocating on our behalf for visas, for extradition, and for our ability to work jointly on operations together. Mr. Rogers. With so much fentanyl flowing across our southern border from Mexico, and all the new limitations Mexico has placed on DEA, how would you respond to Americans who view our counter fentanyl efforts as a war and the Mexican Government complicit with the cartels? Ms. Milgram. What I say often, Congressman, is right now we are in a fight to save American lives and this is as significant a fight as I think we have ever seen. You have heard me say this before, but we are losing the same number of Americans every 11 days that we lost on 9/11, so it would be impossible for me to overstate how important it is that we all be working together to stop this threat and it is a grave threat, I believe, to the United States. Mr. Rogers. I understand that since being confirmed and assuming the role of Administrator of DEA in June of '21, you have been unable to meet with a single Mexican Government counterpart. Is that true? Ms. Milgram. I met with Attorney General Gertz, the head of the--the Attorney General from Mexico. I met with him in 2021, I believe in the fall of 2021 at the Department of Justice. Mr. Rogers. How can we sincerely believe the Mexican Government is a partner in our counter drug efforts when they won't even meet with the head of our Drug Enforcement Administration? Ms. Milgram. I understand the challenges that we face are grave and again, Congressman, we stand ready to partner and work with any foreign counterpart that is willing to join us in this fight to save lives. Mr. Rogers. Well, I want to tell you that for one member of Congress I think you are doing a whale of a good job under the most difficult of circumstances, without any support from your superior functions in the Government. They are not giving you the weapons that you need, nor the support that you have to have and we will tackle that problem here in the subcommittee. Thank you, ma'am. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Well, Administrator Milgram, I want to follow up on the chairman's line of questioning about partnering with the Government of Mexico. We have to do it. I understand you are not in the State Department and international relations is not your thing, but we have to talk about this and this is where the rubber hits the road when we talk about the distribution of fentanyl into this country. It is coming from China. It is going to Mexico. It is coming here. And it is killing our kids. The chairman was asking you about delaying issuance of work visas to DEA agents and that is what we are talking about, Mexico is delaying work visas to American DEA agents working in Mexico to get after the Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels. I want to give you a chance to elaborate on exactly what effect that has on our operations. Ms. Milgram. Thank you for the question and let me say a couple of things which is as I started to say to Congressman Rogers, to Chairman Rogers, we have been waiting eight months for one visa and we know the cost of what that means for us in terms of our ability to get work done. Every year in the United States we are losing more than 100,000 Americans. So time matters and I couldn't speak with enough urgency as to how important it is for us to get those 13 agents and intel analysts into the country. The second thing I want to assure you and the committee is that our work does not stop. So we have more than 2,000 active investigations into those two cartels. We have many money laundering investigations, precursor chemical investigations across the entire supply chain and into those two criminal networks. So I want to assure you that the men and women of DEA are working nonstop to defeat those cartels and we shouldn't ask them to work under difficult circumstances, but they do, and they are incredibly effective. I have seen first-hand for the last almost 3 years. Mr. Cartwright. And you did mention the four indictments brought against Chinese companies and individuals for the manufacture and distribution of precursor chemicals. But you are not stopping there. You are continuing the investigation along those lines about Chinese companies producing precursor chemicals. Am I correct in that? Ms. Milgram. So you are correct, Congressman. The global supply chain that the cartels are running for fentanyl and these two criminal organizations dominate the entire global fentanyl supply chain, it starts and it ends in China. It starts with precursor chemicals, also pill presses that are being manufactured in China. We are actively investigating the beginning, middle, and end of the supply chain. And just to talk for a minute about the end, we have seen a switch to Chinese money laundering. So essentially right now the cartels are working with Chinese money laundering organizations essentially as their bank to clean money, to launder money throughout the globe and that money has been going back to the cartels in Mexico. Mr. Cartwright. Well, we are the appropriations panel that funds your operation and do you need less money or more money to get after this, the Chinese bad guys? Ms. Milgram. You know, I will tell you one of my first weeks I spoke to one of our senior agents in the field and he said I am tired of doing more with less. I would like to do more with more. So I would quote him that my commitment to this committee is whatever you give us we will use in this fight and already we are grateful for the support. Mr. Cartwright. Now we talked about delays in Mexico. Let's talk about delays in the United States for hiring DEA agents. Last year, you committed to working on reducing the time to hire special agents. In FY 2023, your average time to hire was roughly 452 days and I understand as of February this year, your average time to hire in FY 2024 is down to 345 days, but I think it is still too long when we are talking about applicant pool that is eager to get to work. They don't have a year to wait around for an offer. What can you tell us about how you have changed your hiring practices since last year, and what is your target for average length of time to onboard special agents? Ms. Milgram. So I really appreciate the opportunity to talk about this work. It has been ongoing at DEA. We have made a lot of progress to get to 245 days to hire. It is still too long in my estimation. I would like to see us between six and eight months to hire at the outside. Now what we have done is we have mapped our entire hiring process and we have created a dashboard so we can literally track every single applicant where they are in the process. If there is a delay, we can figure out very quickly why there is a delay and we have a weekly meeting where we are working to execute on our goals. And one of our goals is to significantly reduce this amount of time. I would say to you, Congressman, every time we put out a job application notice, when we invite people to apply, those notices close in a day or two. So I agree with you. We are seeing the desire out there for Americans to join DEA and we need to make sure we are working quickly to get them on board. Mr. Cartwright. So we are ironing out the kinks and eliminating the bottlenecks, is that it? Ms. Milgram. Yes. And we are making a lot of progress, but there is still more work to do. Mr. Cartwright. Well, good. Get after it. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Administrator Milgram, for being here. The honorable men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration play a vital role in interdicting illicit, deadly drugs before they end up in the hands of unsuspecting Americans. But it is evident that, while you have our support here in this committee, it is unfortunate that, while the stakes couldn't be any higher, you have to deal with an administration that is actively undermining your efforts. I notice you have a 5 percent budget increase proposed, but can you speak to the $10 million rescission by OMB from your budget request? Ms. Milgram. Thank you, Congressman. Yes, my understanding is that all agencies have been asked to take that rescission by OMB. Mr. Cline. So it is just across the board? Ms. Milgram. That's my understanding. Mr. Cline. Okay. We want to support you, but we also recognize that sometimes the best of intentions by agencies like yours have unintended consequences. I want to discuss one of those. In 2020, DEA proposed a rulemaking to register emergency medical services agencies, EMS agencies, under the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2017. While the rule isn't set to go into effect until November of this year, I'm hearing concerns from rural EMS operations in my district. My understanding is that some EMS providers may have to scale down their certifications from advanced lifesaving treatments to basic in order to achieve compliance with what limited resources they have. Are you concerned that this proposed rule may result in decreased availability in ALS treatments for those when they need it most? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I have not, I have not looked specifically into that rule. I would welcome the opportunity to do that and to follow up with you. Mr. Cline. We would like to work with you on that. The proposed rule targets drugs Scheduled II through V. However, it would end up pushing rural EMS to obtain a Controlled Substances Registration, a CSR, in order to maintain a supply of basic Schedule VI drugs in one-for-one exchanges with hospital pharmacies. This includes drugs such as epinephrine, Albuterol, and Zofran. Volunteer EMS in rural communities in my district, like rural Bath County, are already bracing to try to afford these compliance costs to provide the most basic of lifesaving services. Taking out loans is being considered. Is DEA working on a solution or can you commit to working on a solution to reduce the cost of compliance before my constituents experience the unintended consequences firsthand? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I would be pleased to look at that. I'll start looking at it this afternoon and we'll follow up with you. Mr. Cline. Okay. We would like to find ways to reduce those compliance costs. I want to go back to Chinese precursors. Last year, you said the only limit on how many fentanyl pills and how much fentanyl powder the cartels can make is how many chemicals they can buy. Following their November 2023 summit, Presidents Biden and Xi announced a verbal agreement in which the Department of Commerce would delist China's Ministry of Public Security from the Entity List in exchange for counternarcotics cooperation. However, a recent House China Select Committee report found that any form of cooperation was any empty gesture, considering the Chinese government is continuing to directly subsidize the manufacturing and export of fentanyl by awarding monetary grants to companies openly trafficking fentanyl materials. In combating the fentanyl precursor trade, you have made it your top priority, and that is ours as well. Do you think that this rhetoric from the Biden administration rings hollow, considering that MPS has failed to make any arrests and has, instead, been found to have warned targets of U.S. investigations? Ms. Milgram. So, Congressman, thanks for the opportunity, because I think that this is one of the most important things we can be focused on and talking about. And as I noted earlier, the supply chain begins and ends right now in China. And so there's no way we could do the work we need to do without being focused on it. I personally went to Beijing in January after the two Presidents met, and I had the opportunity to have a number of meetings with MPS and with senior leadership and law enforcement people in China. And I would say a few things, which is, one, my commitment to you, this committee, is that we are going to continue to do the investigative work that we need to do around the cartels and the supply chains, wherever that takes us, including a deep focus on precursor chemicals and illicit finance. Two, we will work shoulder-to-shoulder with any law enforcement agency that will work in partnership with us. This is a global threat. We know that those two cartels are now engaged in either drug trafficking or money laundering, or, you know, getting chemicals in more than 50 countries around the globe. So this is vital to the United States. The last piece is, we have had constructive meetings to date with MPS. What I would say to you is that it is too soon for us to know where this will end. My feeling is that, because there is a limitless supply of chemicals, we need to do everything we can to stop that from happening. And so we will do everything we can investigating, and also if we can partner, we will, but we are not going to stop the work we have to do. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you. Well, the first thing, I understand DEA is recommending a reclassification of marijuana as a less dangerous drug, is that correct? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, under the Controlled Substances Act, there's a formal rulemaking process for scheduling or rescheduling Controlled Substances. That process is ongoing. The next step in that process will be a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and then, an opportunity for public comment. Because DEA is involved very much in that scheduling process, and the DEA Administrator is personally involved in it, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it at this time. Mr. Ruppersberger. My home State of Maryland allows for adult-use cannabis to be sold under a licensed regulatory framework. Without fully descheduling cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, there will be apparent conflicts between federal and state law. With whatever direction you recommend, I urge you to strike a balance between exercising your federal oversight and enforcement responsibilities while preserving each state's ability to determine for itself the best approach to cannabis. What is happening in Maryland is working well and we want to preserve each state's ability to determine for itself the best approach to cannabis. Can you talk about the impact this recommendation will have? Ms. Milgram. Thank you, Congressman. Again, I can't get into details since this is an ongoing regulatory matter. I appreciate your comments. Thank you. Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. Also about fentanyl, at the beginning of the year, DEA had a huge bust of pills laced with fentanyl here in the DC region, 639,000 pills, 2,000 pounds of drug in powder form, an almost 300 percent increase from the previous year. Please talk to us about the drug cartels or how the drug cartels are working with local gangs, and what tools or resources do you need to combat the cartels and gangs? Also please talk about the use of cryptocurrency as a tool to facilitate their activities. And honestly, what I'm interested in is technology like artificial intelligence and how it is used by the DEA in Operation Overdrive. Ms. Milgram. Thank you so much. So let me just start with talking about seizures for a moment. Last year, as I noted, we seized almost 79 million fake pills, 12,000 pounds of powder fentanyl. That is the most fentanyl that DEA has ever seized. Every year since I have joined DEA, year upon year, we are seizing more deadly fentanyl. We are also seeing that the amount of purity in the fentanyl powder has gone up and the number of pills that have a potentially deadly dose has gone up. So in 2021, when I started, it was 4 out of 10 pills; it is now 7 out of 10 pills that have a potentially deadly dose. So I think the work that the men and women of DEA are doing taking deadly fentanyl off the streets is saving lives. Talking about gangs and local drug trafficking organizations, when we did Operation Last Mile last year--and that is the operation we did across the United States to identify people in local communities that are working with these two cartels, Sinaloa and Jalisco, to, essentially, you know, cross that last mile--because the cartels need to get those pills into Americans' hands; that is how they make money. And the way that we have seen this done, we have seen it-- obviously, it continues to be on the streets sometimes--but, overwhelmingly, we have seen a shift to the digital world, to social media. We say all the time that the most dangerous place in the world right now is our homes because everyone has a smartphone, and within two or three, you know, essentially, two or three clicks on a smartphone, people are having pills delivered to their front doorstep like Uber Eats, like they get pizza delivered. We are losing 22 Americans, teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18, every single week right now. So this is a national tragedy. And I would suggest to you, first, we need help on technology. We are committed to using the best technology we can. And my personal feeling is we cannot allow the speed of crime to move faster than the speed of government. We have to be agile. We have to be able to meet these moments. The work I have seen from our cryptocurrency tracking, our illicit finance team, in the last year is second to none. It is some of the best work I have ever seen in my career. So we have a lot of data. We have a lot of technology. We need to do more and we need more, but we are making progress, being able to track that money across the globe. So the answer is yes, we would like to do more, and we really appreciate the support of this committee. And I believe that we are setting ourselves up to be able to do this very effectively in the long term. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ellzey. Mr. Ellzey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My apologies to my colleagues. I'm cutting in line. I appreciate it. Administrator Milgram, it is good to see you again. Hard to believe another year has passed of this devastating issue that we have in our country. You know, 47,000 men died in Vietnam, 33,000 in Korea. That was over the course of 23 years. And we equal that every year just in the loss of fentanyl. So if you want to take fentanyl, fentanyl poisonings plus overdoses, in one year it equals all the wars since World War II combined. That is a war, and that is a proxy war being put on us by China, being administered by the cartels in Mexico. Put another way, if you crashed an Airbus 321 from one airline every day in this country, do you think this body would act? Do you think the international community would act? So if you killed 200 people every day in one airplane 365 days out of the year, we would be howling in this body. We would be passing laws. We would be grounding airplanes. And that is what they are doing. So this is China's way of ensuring that we don't have a military down the road, or workers, or welders, or plumbers, or police officers, or teachers. On December 6, 1941, we were at war with Japan; we just hadn't declared it yet. And right now, we are at war with the cartels at least, and you are at the frontline of that job. So I want to thank you for what you and your team do every day and everybody who wears the badge. And I would also like to say that, just yesterday in my State, you worked very closely with local law enforcement in Georgetown, Texas--the local sheriff, the local police department--and you caught a guy who had 2 kilos of meth, 1 kilo of heroin, and 10 pounds of fentanyl. How many people would that kill? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I would have to do the math for you with our lab, but I can tell you---- Mr. Ellzey. Tens of thousands? Ms. Milgram. Tens of thousands. Mr. Ellzey. Tens of thousands. Ms. Milgram. Yes. Mr. Ellzey. And so I just want to point out--I really don't have a question, especially in lieu of the time that I have been granted--I just want to say you do a great job. And I know that each and every one of you has on your shoulders the idea that we are losing 70,000 Americans just to fentanyl every year, and you are the frontline of defense. And that has got to weigh heavily on you, and I appreciate the sacrifice that each and every one of you make--the stops that you are making, the work you do with local law enforcement. I went to visit your station in Dallas right next to the FBI, that it takes a partnership with local and federal law enforcement, and your job never ends. And so other folks have some questions for you. I would like to yield back the balance of my time. Thank you for what you do. Ms. Milgram. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Administrator Milgram, thank you, certainly, for taking time to speak with us today, but also for your service to the country. And thanks to your entire agency, the agents who work tirelessly in my district and around the country to keep our communities safe. I wanted to, if I could, talk a little bit about Operation Overdrive. In 2022, the DEA initiated it, an operation driven by data- focus, DEA law enforcement resources in communities, including my own in Rochester, New York, where criminal networks are causing the most harm. And I want to thank you and your staff for continuing to be in a position to comprehensively brief us on the phase of the operation and its successes. Can you just give me an update on phase two of Operation Overdrive and what your team saw on the ground in, I think it is 57 operating locations last year, including the one in Rochester? Ms. Milgram. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. So we launched Operation Overdrive in 2021. We started it, really effectively launched it in 2022. And the idea is really to go into local communities, where we live and work, and where every American is being impacted, and focus on two things: violent crime and drug poisonings and deaths. And so we do that in partnership with our state and local law enforcement, with the local prosecutors, with the U.S. Attorneys. We have now been in 86 locations across the United States, and we are very actively working on our next phase, which will be phase four. What we have seen from this work, I would note a few things, which is, one, just remarkable partnerships with our local law enforcement, police departments, sheriffs. That is the kind of work that we need to be doing together to really effectively stop the next shooter in a community or stop the person who is going to sell the next pill. One of the things I was reading recently was a report on Little Rock, Arkansas. We just finished work in Little Rock, Arkansas. And the team, working together--and again, I want to give credit to the entire team--we geospatially mapped the community. And what that means is, we are able to provide to local law enforcement a map of where the crimes are happening; where the shootings are happening; where the drug poisonings are happening. And that, together, lets us figure out how do we stop that harm. And we saw significant reductions in both violence and drug poisonings. So we are about to announce that we are going to start moving on a rolling basis, so we can keep moving in communities across the United States. And we are also moving to do that kind of geospatial mapping work across the country, wherever we are working, because that allows us to provide local law enforcement with more insight into what we see in the community, and they are able to provide us with insight into what they see. And then, together, we can identify what are the greatest threats; who are the individuals that are causing the most harm. And then, together, we can pretty rapidly target those individuals to make sure that they cannot commit harm. Mr. Morelle. Great. And are you confident that the requested budget amount will allow you to do what you need to do in phase one? Ms. Milgram. Yes, I'm confident that we can do that. And again, you know, what I would like to be able to do is really get to a point where the kind of geospatial work we are doing, we are able to leave behind in communities. I don't think we are financially there yet, but I would love to be able to help our local police departments. I was a state attorney general and had the privilege of overseeing more than 500 police departments for the great State of New Jersey, and I know how much they could use that kind of help, to be able to have that kind of assistance with the geographic mapping of threats, and then, getting access to what we see as the threats. So I would like to evolve and get there, but, right now, I'm absolutely confident that we can do phase four, and that, again, what makes this work is the partnership between the local and state law enforcement community, the prosecutors, and DEA, all of us together. And often, we have other federal partners. We have had ATF, Marshals, FBI. So I am really pleased with the work and the partnerships. Mr. Morelle. Thank you. Last year, you were kind enough to host myself, Mr. Clyde, and Mr. Ellzey, to a day in Quantico. And during that conversation, we talked about illicit finances aiding the illegal drug trade, which I actually thought was fascinating. And to that end, I understand your Counter Fentanyl Threat Targeting Teams have been essential to combating money laundering organizations and their expanded influence in the Mexico transnational criminal organizations. Can you just discuss a little more DEA's work to identify and mitigate the cartels' illicit finance networks that are pushing fentanyl into communities like mine? Ms. Milgram. Yes. So we founded the first two Counter Threat Teams in 2022. And the idea is a very simple one of having people from across the agency--agents, analysts, targeters, data scientists, people with chemistry expertise-- working together, focused directly on what do the networks look like, mapping those networks, and then, identifying vulnerabilities that we can target to take down and defeat the cartels. We were doing so much work very quickly around illicit finance, that we realized last summer, in the summer of 2023, that we needed to create a third team around illicit finance. So we have some of our finance experts from across the United States and across the globe that have now come together. They are some of the most creative people I have ever seen. They were able to really figure out how to leverage every piece of DEA's financial data in order for us to understand the threat and start tracking it globally. We have a great number of money-laundering illicit finance cases/investigations ongoing, the majority of which right now relate to Chinese money laundering. And so you will see in the coming months a lot of that work coming forward. Mr. Morelle. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you allowing me to go a little bit over, and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Administrator. Thank you for being here and for your work. I know you had mentioned you don't want to speak about the process of going to the Schedule I to III in the marijuana, but I do want to ask you a little bit different question. I hope you can answer that or talk a little bit about that. There was a 2023 study by the National Institutes of Health that referenced a rise in influx of cases of reports of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. And I'm probably saying that incorrectly, but I think it is CHS, is what is referred to. And it states that, typically, individuals experiencing CHS exhibit a distinctive pattern of cycling through nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and often, other things over a several-month period prior to cannabis use. And the CDC said approximately 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have this disorder. Can you speak to the adverse effects of marijuana use disorder? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, because that is going to be a part of this regulatory process, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time. But I appreciate your mentioning that study and, of course, I will read it. Mr. Aderholt. Okay. Well, my understanding is that this same study that NIH referenced did numerous studies establishing a connection between marijuana use and elevated risk of psychotic conditions, including psychosis, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder. And I can speak to it. So let me just put my thoughts about it. It is I believe the United States is in the midst of a mental health crisis. And with the adverse effects that I had just mentioned, such as psychosis, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, substance abuse disorder, my concern is rescheduling marijuana would make the crisis worse. And again, I know you say you can't comment on it, but I do want to go on the record with that because I do think it is a real concern. And I'm very, very concerned about this rescheduling and it is just very disconcerting to hear this. And I'm deeply concerned about the impact that it will have, especially on the population of young Americans who are more susceptible to drug use for the first time and as they are forming lifetimes of addiction. So with that, let me say there's many of us in Washington and in the Congress--and I'm sure not all--but there's a lot of us who are very concerned about that and we hope that this is something that is not done. And I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Ms. Meng. Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Administrator Milgram, I just wanted to follow up on my colleague Mr. Morelle's questions and express appreciation, as a Representative of communities in New York City, Queens specifically--appreciation on the many ways that the DEA partners with our State and New York City local law enforcement agencies to take guns off our streets and to make our communities safer. I'm also proud of how the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which President Biden signed into law in 2022, has empowered law enforcement and the courts to hold firearms traffickers responsible. As you know well, this Act created the first federal criminal offense for firearms trafficking. I was glad to see that the DEA had worked with NYPD to dismantle a gun trafficking operation in Brooklyn. In March of this year, the defendants pleaded guilty to multiple charges related to the distribution of fentanyl and firearms trafficking. This case became one of the first cases in the country to use the provision of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that made trafficking a criminal offense in federal law, which makes a huge difference in a city like New York where the overwhelming majority of crime guns were last sold from a licensed dealer from another state. Administrator, can you speak to how these provisions of this bill, this Act, support the work that your agents are doing to take guns off our streets and reduce violent crime? And how is the DEA allocating resources to coordination efforts with local and state law enforcement to crack down on interstate, interjurisdiction firearms trafficking? Ms. Milgram. Thank you so much, Congresswoman. You know, DEA, we are focused relentlessly on drug trafficking, and particularly, on the fentanyl threat. That said, we have been doing extensive work around violence in our communities because we know the intersection between drugs and violence. They are inextricably intertwined. And so we do work around Operation Overdrive, as you heard earlier. We also seize an enormous amount of illegal firearms as part of our law enforcement work across the United States. Last year, I think we seized more than 8,200 firearms as part of our operations. So we also partner very closely with all of the DOJ components--the FBI, ATF, Marshals. And in New York City, as you know, the ATF hosts a daily meeting with the NYPD, with federal law enforcement. Prosecutors are in that room, state and federal. And they are talking about, you know, who are the individuals that are likely to be the next shooters, and really focused on, you know, how do they stop the threat of violence on the streets. And so DEA has a regular presence. We are at that meeting every single day. We have deep partnerships across the United States with our state and local law enforcement counterparts. And again, our main focus is on drugs, but we are absolutely working in violent crime in communities and very strongly working in partnership. And one of the most important things I think is those partnerships, because we call upon one another when we can be proactive in stopping the next crime from happening or when we need to investigate and prosecute something that has already happened. Ms. Meng. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Administrator Milgram, good to see you again. It dawned on me you have probably one of the most unenviable positions in the country right now. I don't envy you your job. It is like being a goalie where your own coach is actually calling plays to score against you right now, and it has got to be very frustrating. You don't have to comment on that. But we do have a President right now that has an open- border policy. You do work for an Attorney General that has, effectively, relegated the DEA to be, in his words, ``the very end of the line'' with a public affairs mission or campaign. This has got to be very frustrating for you. And what that inference is, is that your job is to focus on the demand side and not the supply side, which is, literally, the opposite of what the DEA is supposed to do. Your job description has the word ``enforcement'' in it. So we look forward, as a subcommittee, to giving you the tools to do your job, which is the enforcement side, to make sure that we can catch the bad guys, stop the cartels, and give you the resources, despite the leadership above you. And by the way, AG Garland gave himself an ``A'' in front of this committee just a couple of weeks ago, which was, in my opinion, offensive to the victims of the fentanyl. I was going to ask you if we are winning or losing this war against fentanyl, but I think the metrics are self-evident. We are losing this war right now, and I think it is okay for you say that you are not pleased--I think the chairman asked that several times--because I don't think any of us are pleased with the number of deaths that we are seeing as a result of this poison coming across our borders. Last year, you responded to Mr. Cline's testimony. He asked if you would commit to calling China a major illicit drug- trafficking or -producing country. And you answered in the negative in that questioning. I'm assuming now that the PRC has been put on the major drug transit and illicit drug-producing company list, that you would say the PRC is actually a country that we should be targeting as such? Ms. Milgram. Yes, Congressman. The Majors List was changed to include precursor chemicals and so Congress, along with the State Department, has listed China as a source of fentanyl production from those precursors. Mr. Garcia. We appreciate your support on the communication up the chain of command for that. We talked about the fact that some Chinese companies have been charged to this date. You have a $500 million budget footprint for foreign international companies going after those folks. Can you talk about if that budget is fulfilled what does that mission look like and how do we continue on that? And I used the metaphor, I think, last year in this hearing that if we had a small or a large ship--a slow-moving ship crossing the Pacific full of VX gas coming from China we would stop that ship before it got to the Port of Long Beach or a Mexican port inbound for the U.S. borders. Talk to us about the sort of TTPs and the policies that this $500 million will enable for us. Ms. Milgram. Thank you so much, Congressman. If I could start by just saying one thing about demand as well because I sit in a lot of rooms across the United States and across the world where people talk about demand, and we very much understand substance use disorder. What we are seeing happening in the United States is not demand driven and I want to be really clear that this is the cartels that are driving what we're seeing. That's why they're hiding fentanyl in other drugs. That's why they're pressing fentanyl into fake pills. That's why they're not selling fentanyl as though it were fentanyl. So I think it is a really important point. We do a lot of work around--we do do work around public awareness, One Pill Can Kill, because the cartels are being so deceptive about how they're trying to get these drugs to Americans. Talking about, you know, your analogy of stopping the ship I think is a great way to think about the analogy. What we have done over the past few years is try to map these criminal networks so we can get proactive and get in front of them. I believe that we will not be effective unless we are able to target these networks proactively. We cannot wait until the harm has happened or until there's a particular thing that happens to galvanize us. So what we do with the foreign work--foreign work is vital to DEA. We're in more than 69--we're in 69 countries right now, more than 90 offices around the world. All of those offices their number-one focus is the United States of America and the harm happening to the U.S. Of course, we assist our foreign partners with their local issues but our prime work across the globe is how do we stop the fentanyl threat, how do we stop these two cartels. So having mapped--and I see the map in the committee and I look at it and I think about the map that the teams have done showing 50 countries that the cartels are active. So we're working in multiple countries across the globe and with many foreign partners. Mr. Garcia. I just want to thank you because in L.A. we have a district attorney that won't charge fentanyl dealers with murder if they deal known poisoned pills or corrupted pills. So we are able to raise those at the federal level under the DEA and we really appreciate the ability to do that, and your comments that this is not demand driven is not lost on us. This is policy driven and education is key. But we appreciate everything that you and the agents in the field are doing to mitigate this as much as possible. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Administrator Milgram, good to see you again today and thank you for coming to my office yesterday. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Mr. Clyde. If you recall, in last year's budget hearing you made a commitment to provide me and this committee certain information regarding the use of no-bid contracts under your tenure, specifically the total of no-bid or sole source contracts administered during your tenure and the total value-- dollar value of these contracts. My staff emailed your Congressional Affairs Office eight different times over the last year following up on this commitment May 24, June 8, June 23, July 5, July 14, et cetera, et cetera, and despite your staff promising that this request would be fulfilled soon we never received a response. Now, your staff wasn't the one who made the commitment, Administrator. You made this commitment and in this very room. Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. Mr. Clyde. You know, and I realize the Department of Justice Inspector General is currently investigating your contract dealings but Congress is also an investigatory body. You know, when I was a young Navy officer my first active duty station was Strike Fighter Squadron 161 and I had a commanding officer, Commander Al Gorthy, and he had three words printed in our hangar bay 3 feet high so every solitary member of the squadron could see it and those three words stuck with me my entire life, and those words were ``Performance, not excuses.'' Because all I have gotten for the last year has been excuses. I believe you're one of the few agencies within the Department of Justice to actually get a budget increase last year but, yet, I still do not have the information I have requested. And so you can add to that list not just the number and dollar value of no-bid contracts but also list them individually by recipients so we can see who got them and with what dollar value was associated with each one. I mean, I guess I can add them up. You don't have to give me the total. But my question to you then is when will you provide me with this information? Ms. Milgram. So, Congressman---- Mr. Clyde. By what date? Ms. Milgram. Let me start by apologizing for the delay on this. As I said to you yesterday, it is not acceptable and you have my commitment that it will not happen again. We do a weekly meeting where we track a number of things. At DEA we have been tracking letters back to members of Congress. We have not been tracking QFRs until recently. We are now tracking that. So you have my solemn commitment on that. I have worked with--and, again, I want to take responsibility for this. The answers went to the Department of Justice just last week and so we are working very actively with them to get them to you. I had hoped to get them to you by the end of the day yesterday. That did not happen. So I think it's imminent. I'd be happy to actually call your office. We can call your office every day and give you a status update. It's not in our hands right now but I think it will be very, very soon. Mr. Clyde. And I would appreciate that. Thank you. I will take your offer. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Mr. Clyde. Please let us know on a daily basis. Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. Mr. Clyde. Actually, no, a weekly basis would be just fine. Ms. Milgram. You got it. Mr. Clyde. Let us know when we have that information--when you have that information--because we would like to follow up on it. In the fiscal year 2023 budget there was a $30 million program increase for the information sharing center that your administration requested. Was that for what's called mission-- the Mission Operating System or Mission OS or was that for another purpose? Ms. Milgram. I'm not sure, Congressman. I'd have to look closer at it. I do know that there was some funding that came for our internal data overhaul--our technology overhaul. Mission OS would be a part of that. We continue to work on developing that. But I'm not sure about that specifically. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Can you briefly describe to me then what you're doing with the Mission Operating System or Mission OS? Ms. Milgram. Yes. So to come very high level and then a little more granular, when I came in I found that we had a lot of technology that was over 20 years old and, as you know, and you'll see this when you look at our sole source contracts which we have reduced by more than a third, but you'll see that a lot of those relate to technology. Our systems are so old that to have coders--nobody codes in the same languages that our systems were built in a long time ago. All of that needs to be upgraded. At the same time, we need to make changes so that--another example when I came in is we were only tracking one drug at a time. Obviously, right now we live in a poly drug world so we cannot be effective unless our system lets us capture multiple drugs. So we have already made a lot of those changes but Mission OS is basically the broader system we're creating that will allow, one, us to collect all the information we need to collect digitally and then, two, our systems to be able to talk to each other. So think about the hiring conversation earlier of how we track across systems, how we basically are able to make sure that--and what our counter threat teams are able to do is any agent working in Des Moines, Iowa, can connect with the information from any agent in Maine. So we're already able to do that. But that system is still developing and, again, my feeling is--yeah? Mr. Clyde. So what's its current status? Ms. Milgram. We have made a number of changes but the sort of overall--I would use Mission OS to describe our overall, like, the sort of place we want to get to, which is we're not there yet but we have made a number of system changes and we are already, I think, taking a lot of ground on it. Mr. Clyde. Okay. I think my time has expired so I yield back, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Administrator. We always talk about the problem. We always put blame on somebody else. But, yet, our country continues to fall further and further behind and I'm very frustrated with that. I want to talk about solutions. I think back to my time in the military. You train the way you fight. You fight the way you train. Your allies are your allies and your enemies are your enemies. Let's line them up. Let's go to war and, you know, may the strongest person win. When I look at allies, we need more allies and I think the allies are the allies on the ground that are doing the work-- the sheriffs, the police chiefs, the constables, the local law enforcement. So my question--I fully support--my question is this. I fully support state and local task forces. I continue to hear every day how critical they are for the ongoing criminal and counter drug smuggling efforts. This is absolutely critical that we have a federal, state, and local nexus that tackles and wins and makes sure our communities are more safe. You reported in your budget that through the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23 that there were approximately 2,800 special agents and 3,000 task force officers across 600 task forces dedicated to transnational crime and drugs. Is there any--is there a need for additional special agents or task force officers? Ms. Milgram. So a couple of things, Congressman. First is as we stand up these Trident teams one is being set up along the border--we're going to use our El Paso office because we have great capacity there--and one is going to be set up in New York to start. These will be State, local, Federal teams that also have the intelligence community and the defense community. So that's an example I think of evolving to the next step where we'll be able to use every piece of information that DEA has to target this international threat. We serve in task forces across the United States every day. We have remarkable partnerships. We lead many OCDETF task forces. We also serve on many task forces, OCDETF, HIDTA, and otherwise. And so this is one of the ways in which I think we do really important work across the country. One of my personal views is that we need to figure out how we can share more information with our state and local partners. Again, I sat as a state attorney general and I know, you know, we're talking about tens of thousands of law enforcement professionals across the United States that are on the front line every single day and are incredible partners to us and can be very effective and work with us on a daily basis with this threat. But how do we provide even more support and information on the cartels and on the threats to them to help them do---- Mr. Gonzales. The DEA needs a win and America needs a win, and I'm tired of everyone else placing the blame on the problem. We need a win and that win starts at the local level with these task forces. We need to go out and take it block by block street by street. I had the FBI--on Friday I'm going to be in west Texas and we're doing a roundtable with local, State, and Federal law enforcement to specifically talk about expanding some of these task forces that are out there. This is how you win. You don't talk about the problem. You solve the problem. You solve the problem by getting more good guys than bad guys and rolling them up one block at a time. Blank checks aren't going to solve the problem. Blaming China or someone else that's all fine and dandy. That doesn't keep our kids safe and it doesn't make sure people don't die. That's what this game is about. This is about life or death. It's a life or death game that we're playing and the DEA used to be at the center of this game. They used to be a major chess piece in this game and it feels as if now they're a smaller part of it and that needs to change, right. That needs--you have my commitment but I need your commitment where we can work together on building out these task forces in a more robust manner. And also when we do roll up somebody that the world knows about it. It can't just be in secret. Ms. Milgram. Congressman, first of all, you know, again, on National Fentanyl Awareness Day you have my deepest commitment that I will never stop doing everything I can to stop this threat. I do believe we have a plan and we're making significant progress. But we have lost 107,941 American lives in 2022 so there is a lot more work to do. We're committed to doing it in partnership with you in Texas and with this committee and with every American community. Mr. Gonzales. I have limited time left. I'll end with this. I'm very interested in the Trident directorate and the direction that that's going. Intel is absolutely critical to solving the problem and being able to give that in an actionable way with boots on the ground to be able to do that I think is so critical, and many times they want to be able to do it but they don't have the intelligence to be able to perform that. I'm very interested in that. Would love to stay abreast of that. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Administrator, and I yield back. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. The gentleman yields back. That concludes the first round of questions. I assume that there is a desire for a second round by some members at least so we will do just that, and that's consistent with your desire to be out of here by noon and we will live up to that commitment. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Ma'am, you've previously testified before this subcommittee on the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China to Mexico. In November of 2023 President Biden announced a partnership with China where they would help stem the flow of precursor chemicals. I understand that China's new efforts are mainly civil enforcement matters with little to no actual criminal enforcement. Has the DEA observed any significant decrease in the amount of precursor chemicals flowing from China to Latin America? Ms. Milgram. So, Congressman, at this moment in time--and we work very closely with our partners at CBP on the flow of precursor chemicals--at this point in time we continue to see precursor chemicals going to Mexico for the production of fentanyl and, again, we continue to see fentanyl being produced at historic and catastrophic rates. What I would say to you is that we--DEA began our reengagement with MPS in January of this year. We had partnered with MPS and, again, in 2019, China had scheduled finished fentanyl so we began that reengagement in January of this year and have had some constructive meetings. We are committed to working with any partner across the globe that we can work with to fight this threat. We also are continuing to do all the investigative work that DEA does and has done over the last couple of years and, again, bringing the first criminal charges against Chinese chemical companies and really focusing on the movement of those chemicals. So we're going to continue to do that work investigating. We would like to see our partners in China take similar actions and, again, we're a law enforcement agency and we always ask our law enforcement counterparts to engage in law enforcement activity. Mr. Rogers. So not only do we not see a decrease in precursors out of China but we're seeing an increase. Is that accurate? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, I couldn't say that. I would have to bring in my colleagues from CBP to sort of point to the exact numbers. What I can tell you is that fentanyl has increased over the last three years in the United States and this partnership, this work, has been constructive so far but I believe it's too early to know whether we'll have the results that we want to see. But, again, you know, my commitment to you is that we are doing this work and we will continue to do this work, and as long as there's a global fentanyl threat we're going to continue to investigate every part of that supply chain. Mr. Rogers. Based on recent actions how would you characterize our relationship with China when it comes to the fight against fentanyl and what would you say to those who view--who like to view China as complicit with the cartels? Ms. Milgram. So, Congressman, when I came in we had no law enforcement cooperation or even communication, really, with MPS, which is the Chinese law enforcement agency, that change starting last November when the two presidents, President Biden and President Xi, met and they agreed to resume counter narcotics cooperation. So there are a few things that we have done. One is asked for their help in prosecuting and shutting down chemical companies, stopping pill presses from going out of China; number two, being willing to stop global money laundering in crypto currency that is originating, we believe, in many instances from there, going into the capital flight issue which we could talk a little bit about if you'd like; and then number three, scheduling additional chemicals. So one of the things China did effectively in 2019 was to schedule finished fentanyl. So there are many fentanyl chemicals--the precursor chemicals that are the building blocks that we have now asked them to schedule. Just to be clear also, what we know from our investigations is that there are people working at those chemical companies that are chemists who are actively assisting drug traffickers or people they believe to be drug traffickers with how to produce fentanyl. So they are essentially teaching them how to make fentanyl. So I want to be clear in saying what a grave threat I believe this is and also that I believe if we could stop the flow of precursors from China we could have a significant impact on the amount of fentanyl being made. Mr. Rogers. How are we supposed to reconcile the administration's November 2023 announcement that China is a partner on the efforts to combat fentanyl with what our DEA agents are actually seeing out in the field? Ms. Milgram. So, Congressman, I think, you know, what I would say to you is that the meetings have been constructive but it's too early to tell what the results will be. So I'd be happy to come back to the committee as this goes on to let you know whether we're seeing the results that we believe we need to say. Mr. Rogers. How would you rate Mexico's lack of action to get your people into Mexico in place? How would you characterize China's impact on that better? Ms. Milgram. So, you know, I would sort of take the same position as to both countries which is, number one, we stand ready and willing to work with any law enforcement partners that will work with us in this fight that are committed to helping us stop American lives from being lost. Second, we're going to keep doing the investigative work that we do and DEA has incredible capabilities. I'm so proud of the men and women in the United States and across the globe that are working on this threat day in and day out, even in difficult circumstances. And third, I do think we have seen some progress but, you know, again, to sort of refer back to Director Wray, we need much more and we have got to see sustained, scalable cooperation in order for us to be able to have the impact we know we need to have. And, again, the threat is driven by two global criminal enterprises that are headquartered in Mexico. Mr. Rogers. Keep up the good work. Ms. Milgram. Thank you, sir. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, Administrator Milgram, not to put too fine a point on it, I am interested in more questions about precursor chemicals. Your written testimony includes the following statement: On June 23, 2023, indictments were announced against four chemical companies and eight individuals, all based in the PRC, the People's Republic of China, for knowingly providing customers in the United States and Mexico with the precursor chemicals and scientific know-how to manufacture illicit fentanyl. These indictments were the first ever charges against fentanyl precursor chemical companies. Is that correct that was the first time? Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. Mr. Cartwright. How long has fentanyl been hurting Americans? Ms. Milgram. The threat really began in around 2014 or so and slowly increased year upon year. Mr. Cartwright. So there have been a few presidential administrations during the fentanyl crisis but this administration is the first one to prosecute Chinese companies. Is that right? Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. The first charges were last year. Mr. Cartwright. And do you intend to keep that up? Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. Mr. Cartwright. Okay, good. I want to shift gears and talk about marijuana for a moment. Last week the administration announced that they would be looking to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I narcotic--for example, heroin or LSD--to a Schedule III narcotic--for example, steroids or Tylenol with codeine. That will still need to go through a formal rulemaking process and you alluded to that in response to Mr. Aderholt's questions. You are restricted substantial in how much you can go into that by--I think it's the Administrative Procedures Act. Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. Mr. Cartwright. So I won't ask you to get into DEA's formal position on the decision to move forward with that rulemaking but I do want to ask you to give us a sense for how that reclassification of marijuana might allow DEA to allocate more resources to chasing fentanyl and other narcotics that are killing people. In other words, do we have agents that are working on marijuana investigations that could be freed up to go to work on cases tied to fentanyl? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, because some of this will implicate decisions that become a part of that rulemaking process I'm not going to be able to comment on that. What I can tell you very, very high level is yes, we do currently do work around marijuana across the United States where it rises to the federal level and, you know, for an example we have done work in a number of states on current illicit marijuana grows that are led by Chinese organizations, for example. So there is work we do. Our top focus is, obviously, fentanyl, the drug that's killing Americans, but we do do work on it currently. Mr. Cartwright. Okay. Now, you have said or, in fact, you led off your testimony by saying flat out there is no greater urgency than defeating the Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels on fentanyl. But beyond that, can you walk through what your top priorities are in the fiscal year 2025 budget request? Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. So the two main pieces that we have requested in this budget are additional funding, more than $18 million for the counter threat teams. This is allowing us to map the cartels and these criminal networks across the globe--who are members, who are facilitators, who are associates, what countries are they operating in, and what are they doing--what are their roles in the organization. That allows us to look for vulnerabilities and to really, I think, target in a way that can defeat the cartels. We're then going to sort of expand this into the Trident work I was describing. So a lot of the work is coming out of the counter threat teams right now, and I should--sorry--step back and say we have started counter threat teams in the field. So each of our field divisions now has one. Some are just getting up and running. But the idea with the funding would be to allow us to sort of establish the teams that we have at headquarters now--those three teams--in a permanent way, add staff to them, and then create broader teams in the field that will allow us in every single part of the United States to be able to know what's the specific threat there, is it Sinaloa, is it CJNG Jalisco, what are they doing, who are the money launderers responsible and so on. And so it really is the evolution of that work as well as the expansion to Trident. The other request, which I think is a little more than $15 million, is for body-worn cameras. The Department of Justice, DEA, we have made a commitment to expand the use of body-worn cameras and so as a matter of public accountability and transparency that work continues. Mr. Cartwright. Understood. Well, thank you for your testimony. Administrator Milgram, you've been a State prosecutor. You've been a Federal prosecutor. You've been a Federal law clerk. You've been a State attorney general. We are grateful for your service in the DEA and this administration. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you again, Administrator, for obliging us a second round. I ended the last line of questioning with the partnership between the local law enforcement and the DEA at the federal level, specifically the federal charges being raised against dealers who are selling this stuff. We have text messages coming off of phones of dead children and 16-year-olds where the dealer admits that the batch that they gave them may be tainted and not made correctly because little Johnny died yesterday so, little Susie, when you take this makes sure someone is with you with Narcan to make sure that they can bring you back to life. This is self-evident in terms of an aggravating assault--of a murder, effectively. And we talked about in my county. North L.A. has the highest density of fentanyl poisonings in all of L.A. County. We had 80 just in my district alone last year in the 27th Congressional District. We have a DA George Gascon who's like the Penguin of Gotham City. He actually helps the criminals rather than helps the victims of the criminals and it's very frustrating. So having this ability to go to the federal government to prosecute with the aggravators is key. I submitted a Combating Fentanyl Poisoning Act bill which allows for two Byrne's JAG grants, one to directly fund local law enforcement for the efforts of chasing down these dealers in cooperation with the DEA and another for nonprofits to educate kids, parents, grandparents. By the way, I think that's not your job. Your job is the enforcement side. Our job as parents and grandparents and neighbors and teachers and friends is to educate kids on the fact that this is a very real threat. One pill one kill is very real. So I guess my question is what can we do to better synergize so that the federal government and the local law enforcement regardless of county DAs, regardless of state AG paradigms that may be pro crime, how do we better synergize so that one plus one equals three? Because that is the challenge. The policies are the problem. The open border policy is the source of the problem. China is the source of the precursors. But how do we get to one plus one equal three on the enforcement side? Ms. Milgram. So this is a really important area of our work right now. We call it OD Justice and a lot of the work we're doing across the U.S. is based on our original---- Mr. Garcia. What does that stand for, OD Justice? Ms. Milgram. OD Justice--it's basically one of our operations that we now have in every single field division. A lot of that work is based on the work that the teams in L.A. have stood up. I mean, there's remarkable work that's been happening there, I think, for many years between local law enforcement and the DEA and we have used that and work in a couple of our other field divisions as a model for how we can do this partnership with state and local law enforcement. We now have this in every single field division across the United States and I'm pleased that, you know, we have significantly increased the number of cases that we can do where we charge death resulting, meaning that someone has given a pill or powder that contains fentanyl, they die, and we're able to bring federal prosecutions, holding them accountable. So we have also set up a special unit at our special operations division in Virginia for local law enforcement. We have checklists for what they should look for when they get to the scene where somebody has been poisoned or overdosed. We have got a checklist--what do they do, who do they call, and we have agents in the field who are on call at all times to answer those questions and then when we can we adopt those as to federal cases. So it's really important work and I think we have really significantly increased it, and L.A. has been a model for the work that we have done. Mr. Garcia. Yeah, we appreciate that because seeing these parents grieve and, frankly, seeing the sheriffs' frustrations at the local level, they have clear cases where they have all these text messages and then the DEA doesn't file charges. It's absurd. So that partnership is literally the only lifeline of hope being given to some of these victims' families right now and to the sheriffs who are out there trying to do God's work, enforce the law. They have a venue and a vehicle now to bring federal charges and I applaud you and I thank you for allowing that and encouraging that. I'm glad that's spreading across other major cities and throughout the country as well. I think the technology piece is also very important. You have access to technologies that maybe some of the local law enforcement agencies don't, whether it's surveillance or drones, et cetera, where we stay within the limits of the Constitution but we also improve the probabilities of successful arrests and preventing this poison from getting on the streets. So thank you again for your service and regards to all the agents in the field. Thank you. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Well, first thing, I want to thank you for all of your experience. You bring a lot of experience to this job. I was, years ago--and I mean many years ago--a former investigative prosecutor. And most of what you do, we worked federal, state, and local together, and it was really effective--probably more effective than any other law enforcement that I have seen. I think that the biggest problem that we have now, I think, is money--no question. But I think that DEA--and I'm giving based on my experience as a prosecutor, but, more so, just in this committee--that the DEA, people who work at DEA, especially the agents, are very unique. They work in tough places where it is very dangerous, where FBI in other areas probably don't have the backup, and yet, they are there on a continual basis working in that regard. So I just want to say that. And you seem to be in love and want to help them in any way you can, and we appreciate that. Now, can you talk more about the Chinese money laundering and about fentanyl, and what can the Appropriations Committee do to help you? I know there is not a lot. What staff resources do you need to investigate tracking and stopping all of this that is going on? And do you know what Treasury is doing about all of this, also? Ms. Milgram. So we work very closely with Treasury. And again, they often will bring sanctions when we have done an investigation. So we have a very close partnership with them. They have folks that are stationed with us at our headquarters, and we have invited them to join the Counter Threat Team. We think they could be very, very helpful on the finance work along with us. In terms of what we are seeing on illicit finance, to explain it just a little bit, in 2016, China passed a law limiting the amount of money that Chinese nationals can take out of the country. And so that has created a space where individuals in China who would like to get money out of China above that amount--it is about 50,000 U.S. dollars, the equivalent--so somebody who wants to get that money in the United States needs to use a money broker, and those money brokers are now, essentially, becoming the engine of global, at least in the United States, fentanyl money laundering. Because the people in the United States that have cash, that have cash that is available for individuals who want cash in the United States, are the cartels. They, obviously, drug trafficking, we believe that the cartels are making each fake pill for around 10 cents a pill and they are selling it in the United States for between $5 and $30. So again, we are tracking billions of dollars globally. A lot of the reason that I think it has shifted to Chinese money-laundering organizations is this desire to get money out of China. We are seeing across the United States that these Chinese money-laundering organizations are almost, essentially, the bank for the cartels, where they can put their dirty money, launder it, and then, that money eventually gets back to the cartels. Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. I yield back. By the way, do you know someone by the name of Payton Abbott? Ms. Milgram. Yes. She is amazing. Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes, she was trained by me. Ms. Milgram. Yes, thank you. Thank you. She is an incredible part of our team. Mr. Ruppersberger. An incredible part of the team. Ms. Milgram. Yes. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Ms. Milgram. Thank you for letting her come to us. Mr. Ruppersberger. Very good. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Chairman. Administrator Milgram, okay, according to a letter dated December 19, 2023, from the DEA's Office of Congressional Affairs, the DEA has the final authority to schedule, reschedule, or deschedule a drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Do you agree with that? Ms. Milgram. Yes, sir. Mr. Clyde. Okay. So you are the final? You're it? Ms. Milgram. Yes. There is a regulation, yes. Mr. Clyde. All right. In your statement, you mentioned that it has been publicly reported and confirmed by the DOJ a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, and it is currently being considered by the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record this particular article. It is: U.S. DEA will reclassify marijuana, ease restrictions, according to the AP News, from April 30, 2024, sir. Mr. Rogers. Without objection. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, sir.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Clyde. In this particular article, it says, ``The proposal, which still must be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget,'' and it says, also, ``Today, the Attorney General circulated the proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III.'' So, Administrator Milgram, is the decision to reschedule marijuana being initiated or encouraged predominantly by the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Attorney General's Office, or the DEA? Which is it? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, there will be a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that is released. Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to get into this conversation right now. Mr. Clyde. Okay. So you have said multiple times that it would be inappropriate for you to talk about this. Okay. ``Inappropriate'' or illegal? A violation of law or just inappropriate? Ms. Milgram. Inappropriate, according to our counsel, that I should not be engaged in a conversation about it. And just to sort of explain a little bit of that since DEA is, ultimately, the decider of scheduling and rescheduling, and the DEA Administrator is in that role, it would be inappropriate for me to make comments about this process or parts of that process. Mr. Clyde. Well, we are the United States Congress. You wouldn't have authority if we didn't give it to you. Okay? I mean, we make the law; you execute the law. We give you the authority. We are asking the questions. So, I mean, it is like you are an extension of us when we create the law. So I'm asking you the question: where is it coming from? Is it coming from the DEA? Is it coming from the Attorney General? Is it coming from the White House Office of OMB? Where is it coming from? Ms. Milgram. As you know, under the Administrative Procedures Act, which Congress has made into law there is a formal rulemaking process that goes on. That leads to the issuance of an NPRM. Then, the opportunity for public comment, and then, the process plays out beyond that--with an ultimate decision being made at DEA as to the scheduling or rescheduling of a substance. So again, as the agency that will be the ultimate decider, I'm not going to engage in conversations about issues that could be part of this conversation. Mr. Clyde. I mean, marijuana is a very, very dangerous drug--okay?--not as dangerous as some of the others we have talked about here, but it certainly is much more dangerous than what you see regularly that people partake of, like alcohol, et cetera. You have a significant increase in traffic accidents that we have seen that have sent people to the emergency rooms, like simply because they have been partaking of marijuana. So have you had any outreach from the White House or the Vice President's Office regarding the rescheduling of marijuana? Ms. Milgram. Congressman, again, I'm not going to be able to get into any of the process that takes place or has taken place on this. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Are you aware of any instance in which a rulemaking that schedules, reschedules, or deschedules a drug under the Controlled Substances Act is not signed by the Administrator of the DEA? Ms. Milgram. Just again, stepping out of marijuana and talking about this generally, I am not. Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. So are they ever signed by the Attorney General---- Ms. Milgram. I'll look and confirm that is accurate. But, at least in my experience--I'll confirm that with your office-- but I'm not aware personally. Mr. Clyde. Okay. All right. All right. That is all I have. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you again, Administrator. First of all, I was going to ask about the Trident Directorate. Mr. Cartwright asked the question. So I appreciate your response to that. But one of the things that I'm interested--and you could perhaps help expand on this--is, you know, I have always assumed that the cartels' interest was in creating sort of dependency, addiction, and, you know, have a market that you continue to supply because there is a demand. I understand that that has changed--part of what has resulted in your One Pill Can Kill project to educate the American public. So it is really no longer in the interest of the cartels per se to make sure that people stay alive, so they can continue to feed that addiction. The model has changed pretty dramatically. I wondered if you could just help the American public understand what we are dealing with right now and sort of the new mode of operation, if you could just walk through that, and then, why the One Pill Can Kill campaign is so important to that. Ms. Milgram. So you just asked the question that I think we get asked more than any other, including when we go to schools. Wherever we are, people always ask the same question: why would a drug dealer kill their customer? And it is sort of the right way to think about it in the older model of drug trafficking. When I was coming up in the Manhattan DA's Office, we strongly believed that drug traffickers did not kill their clients. And in part, it was based on some relationship. Even ``relationship'' is a strange thing to say, but drug traffickers knew their clients; clients knew who to go to, to purchase drugs from. We now live in a largely digital world where more than 200 million Americans are on social media. And the cartels can operate largely anonymously without ever knowing their client, and the clients don't know their traffickers. And so this has completely changed what we see. We are also in a world where, again, the cartels are actively trying to deceive people. They are not selling fentanyl as fentanyl. They are selling it as fake pills that look identical to real oxycodone, to real Xanax, to real Adderall, or they are hiding it in other drugs that they sell as though it were cocaine, when it is actually cocaine laced with fentanyl. And so this whole model has changed. And we think about this a lot. As cartels want to sell more drugs, fentanyl is the most addictive substance we have ever seen--50 times more powerful than heroin. So they are using it to get people to come back again and again, and as long as people survive, they believe that they will have more customers. And if they die, to the cartels, that is the cost of doing business and they are going to go back on social media and they are going to find someone else. And so---- Mr. Morelle. So it is interesting that, in a sense, you can become addicted. Clearly, one pill can kill, but it may not. So you are building, essentially, a market of repeat customers, but, you know, to the degree they might die, it is just, you know, as you said, the cost of doing business--because of the addictive nature of this, and because of the deception in their practices. So it is not only that you need to get hooked on this; they don't even care about that. It is, if you needed legitimately an opioid for a medical condition or you are buying it, you think you are buying it through a prescription, and you are not, that is really part of the additional danger now to Americans? Ms. Milgram. So any American--and I always like to emphasize this--anyone who gets a prescription from your doctor and fills it at their pharmacy, you have nothing to worry about. Those painkillers or other drugs are absolutely fine. Mr. Morelle. Because they are highly regulated. Ms. Milgram. They are highly regulated. What the cartels have done is buy pill presses from China, along with dyes and molds. So they can make a pill that looks identical to an oxy, identical to a Xanax, identical to an Adderall. They, then, advertise them for sale oftentimes on social media as though they are real oxy---- Mr. Morelle. So I'm a patient who may be dealing with some knee issue, some issue that requires this prescription. I get the prescription from the doc. But, instead of going to my local pharmacy, I go online and think, ``Oh, I can get it cheaper this way.'' Is that, essentially, how it works then? Ms. Milgram. What we see a lot is that people are looking for, whether it is an oxy, an Adderall, a Xanax, some of those people have had prior prescriptions; some have not. Some are young people who are looking for a painkiller, for anxiety, or some other issue. We should be really clear in saying you cannot buy a legitimate prescription drug on social media at all. Mr. Morelle. Yes. Ms. Milgram. That is not for sale. And so anything that any young person finds on social media, we can tell you, is going to be, most likely, fentanyl. And again, that is killing people. And so we want to be really careful. We are also seeing this--this goes across the United States, all ages---- Mr. Morelle. Yes. So I'm sorry to interrupt you. I'm just running out of time. I just wanted to ask one quick follow-up. Have you been in consultation with the major platforms about advertising those on social media? Ms. Milgram. So we are pushing social media very hard to do more. I don't think we would get to 107,941 deaths if not for the scale and scope of social media. And again, you know, we are asking them to take a zero-tolerance policy, to raise public awareness. There are a host of things we are pushing them to do. Mr. Morelle. Very good. Again, thank you for your service. Ms. Milgram. Yes. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. The DEA's budget request outlines a substantial increase--a substantial increase--for Counter Threat Teams to combat fentanyl. While you are having so much trouble operating abroad, and don't appear to be receiving the necessary support from the administration, how can we be assured that we are making a smart investment in the agency at this time? Ms. Milgram. So, Congressman, let me say that we did talk about it being difficult to work in some parts of the world, but let me assure you we have incredible foreign partners. I have met with dozens of foreign partners over the last year, and we have incredible cooperation, as the United States of America. I was at the Five Eyes law enforcement meeting just last week here in Washington. And our relationships and our partnerships are very strong and the work we are doing together is very effective. So on the Counter Threat Teams, the reason this is a top priority for us is that this lets us pull together every single piece of information from across DEA, from every investigation, every seizure, and it allows us to do it at a strategic level. If you think about targeting the entire network, which is the switch we have made, we need all that information to be pulled together, so we can identify the key vulnerabilities and now take this next step forward to share that information with the intelligence community and get to a point where, you know, we together can figure out what is the right way to dismantle these organizations. Mr. Rogers. How is the agency planning to measure the success of these new intelligence-driven initiatives? And what progress have we seen so far? Ms. Milgram. So we measure success in a number of ways. As I said, we have a weekly meeting where we hold ourselves accountable. Because you can have the best plan, but if you are not executing on that plan, you are not going to get something done. So we are actively looking at a number of things. First, of course, as I said earlier, the one number that matters, and the one number we care about above all, is American lives. In terms of our internal work, we measure a number of things, including how many active investigations we have. We, right now, have more than 2,000 against the two cartels. How we are able to identify; how many members of those cartels we are able to identify; where leads are being sent; where prosecutions are being done. And again, as we work across the entire network, we are tracking this in each part of the network. And that lets us say, okay, you know, how many operations do we have going on precursor chemicals? Do we have enough? Are there other ways we can bring them? So we are using the metrics, really, to drive us to work in a strategic way. And then, again, of course, we always measure, for example, the amount of fentanyl we have seized. Every single deadly dose off the street we believe is a potential life-save. So we take that very seriously as well. Mr. Rogers. I understand you are conducting a review of your foreign operations that could lead to possible closures or relocations of certain foreign offices, is that correct? Ms. Milgram. So we had a foreign review report that came out about a year ago and it had 17 different recommendations. We have taken on a number of those recommendations, including running a foreign footprint review. So for the first time in many years, we have asked the question, you know: where should DEA be? What is the threat posed to the United States from drugs coming from or through those countries? What is the risk of operating in that region? And how much operational capability do we have? So that is ongoing and we will make hard decisions at the end because we need to be in the countries that will allow us to be most effective to combat this threat. Mr. Rogers. This concludes today's hearing. We thank you for your service to the country. Ms. Milgram. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. And the fact that you are making, in one of the most important developments in our Nation's history, that is, the fentanyl action that we talked about today. So thank you for your service and thank you for doing a great job as DEA Administrator--tough chore. Ms. Milgram. Thank you, sir. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cartwright, do you have anything to add? Mr. Cartwright. No further questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Thank you for coming. And without objection, all members will have 7 days to submit additional written questions for the witness or additional materials for the record. With that, the hearing is adjourned. Wednesday, May 8, 2024. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WITNESS HON. GINA M. RAIMONDO, SECRETARY Mr. Rogers. The subcommittee will be in order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. I want to welcome everyone to this morning's hearing, back here to our subcommittee members that are here and to Secretary Raimondo for being here with us as well. The Department of Commerce's Fiscal Year 25 budget request totals $11.4 billion which is $654 million or 6 percent increase over the Fiscal Year 2024 enacted level. This includes initiatives related to bolstering trade enforcement, innovations in manufacturing technology, economic development, and many others, all initiatives that are vital to American prosperity. I am pleased to see increases requested for workforce development initiatives and strengthening supply chain security. The Department of Commerce's mission to spur economic growth and opportunities for all Americans grows more and more important every day. We are facing foreign economic influences and challenges that can only be halted by prioritizing domestic competition and American labor. From outbound investment strategies to improving industrial standards, the Department of Commerce is on the front line in our fight to combat China economically. Through hearings like this one and a close examination of the budget priorities that you submitted, I, along with my colleagues, will ensure the Department of Commerce uses all the tools and resources to take on China directly. Beyond international matters, the Commerce Department plays a significant role in economic expansion and prosperity within our nation's borders. My district is in the heart of Appalachia in southeastern Kentucky. I have witnessed the distress caused by the downturn of the coal mining industry. I have seen firsthand the great things that can happen when we empower small and rural communities through job creation and economic opportunity. The Economic Development Administration and its assistance programs encourage innovation by providing competitive incentives for job creation in struggling communities. This year's budget also proposes investments in newer programs, such as the recompete pilot program and the regional technology and innovation hub program. Both programs aim to create sustainable innovations to train the next generation workforce. It is no secret the American economy was and continues to be built on ingenuity, making smart and calculated risks. The Federal Government, and particularly the Department of Commerce, should not stand in the way of hard-working Americans. I look forward to hearing about how this year's budget request prioritizes American innovation and competitiveness. So let me now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to you, and good morning to our witness and welcome, Honorable Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Commerce. Madam Secretary, I don't think it is an exaggeration to say the Department of Commerce right now is more central to our national interests than ever. It is responsible for a broader than ever set of priorities. Your Department is at the forefront of critical efforts driving American competitiveness, American national security, American technological leadership. You are responsible for an awful lot, overseeing billions of dollars to help expand access to broadband, maintaining export controls that protect our national security, identifying weaknesses in our supply chains, providing accurate and reliable weather forecasting, bringing good jobs to distressed communities. The chairman just mentioned the recompete program and I am also interested in that. Jump starting our semiconductor manufacturing industry, conducting an accurate census, advancing the trade interests of American businesses, and leading the way on safety and development for critical emerging like artificial intelligence, and that is just a sample of your highest profile work. I look forward to hearing today about the Department's commitment to keep American manufacturing, our supply chains, and overall global competitiveness strong. The President's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request of $11.4 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Commerce represents an increase of 5.9 percent for the Department's important and diverse missions, all of which are critical for the success of American workers and businesses in the 21st century. The request focuses on many of the Department's needs and it was interesting to read the census request as the Bureau prepares for the 2030 census, seems just like yesterday we were gearing up for the 2020 census. The Department continues to implement key components of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act and the IIJA, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Programs under these acts will expand broadband access across the country and revitalize America's competitive edge in semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing. So I look forward to hearing further about these issues and others and I thank you, Madam Secretary, for your ongoing work and for your presence and testimony today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. We will now recognize our witness, Secretary Raimondo, for an opening statement. Without objection, your written statement will be entered in the record. Welcome to the subcommittee, Madam Chair. Secretary Raimondo. Thank you. Good morning to all of you. A special thank you to Chair Rogers, Ranking Member Cartwright, thank you for your leadership and all the members of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity this morning to discuss the President's budget and I want to say thank you for your strong support of the Department in a bipartisan way. We have received excellent support from your committee and I want to say thank you for that. As you have said, the Commerce Department is implementing major initiatives authorized by Congress through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act. Thanks to you and these laws and the funding you have provided, every day at the Commerce Department we are tackling our nation's most pressing economic and national security priorities. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Commerce Department is doing more now than we ever have before. The budget request, as you have said, is for $11.4 billion in discretionary funding and $4 billion in mandatory funding for fiscal 2025. And I am here to discuss the budget and, of course, to ask you for your support for the budget. Permit me to highlight just a few of our key priorities. First, the budget positions America to prevent China and other countries from obtaining U.S. technologies, capital, and expertise for activities that threaten our national security. Specifically, it includes a $223 million increase for BIS to expand export control enforcement and $5 million for ITA to address risks from outbound investments of investments in defense technologies in China. Second, the budget promotes America's technological leadership and responsible innovation in artificial intelligence. We all know AI is the defining technology of our generation, so we are asking for $30 million for the AI Safety Institute at NIST and also money for NTIA to establish an AI and emerging technology policy lab. With AI, we need to invest and go fast and at the same time keep a lid on the risks. The budget supports resilient supply chains. It includes an increase of $12 million in ITA to support a supply chain resiliency office and it includes $37 million for NIST's Manufacturing USA program and $175 million for NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership. We cannot be a great country unless we manufacture in America and have resilient supply chains and so that is what these investments are for. The budget provides resources to strengthen our relationship with our allies, to advance our shared values, and shape the strategic environment in which China operates. We have to out compete China. That means we have to show up around the world. So the budget includes $379 million for ITA to expand U.S. exports and services to help U.S. businesses grow in foreign markets. The budget invests in good jobs and equitable growth, as the chairman referenced. It requests $4 billion in mandatory funding for tech hubs and $523 million in discretionary funding for EDA, in order for EDA to advance its mission of tech hubs, job training with the Good Jobs Challenge, and foster geographic diversity and innovation. It also invests $80 million in the MBDA to continue our services for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. The budget invests to address climate change. It includes $6 and a half billion for NOAA, including $2 billion for the nation's weather and climate satellites, $1.4 billion for the National Weather Service, $2.12 million for climate research. Finally, the budget invests in our fundamental science infrastructure. The budget invests over $400 million in fundamental research infrastructure, science research at NIST and NOAA and NTIA. This includes critical investments in maintenance, renovations, and improvements at our NIST campuses. So in closing, I just want to echo what the chairman said and the ranking member said. Our work at the Commerce Department focuses on strengthening America's competitiveness, both at home and abroad, so that American workers, families, and businesses can participate and prosper in 21st century global economy and most important, we protect our national security. So with that, I am happy to answer any of your questions.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Rogers. Well, thank you, Madam Secretary. We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule for questions. I will begin by recognizing myself. Madam Secretary, between each decennial census, the U.S. population grows and changes. Therefore, effective and efficient government requires high-quality and objective sources of information. How does the Census Bureau determine what questions will be included in the decennial census? Secretary Raimondo. Thank you for the question and we are gearing up for 2030 which is closer than you might think. I am so proud to say that we have unbelievably high quality data scientists, statisticians, economists at the Census and they are constantly in the process of using the best data science and statistics techniques to figure out how do you ask these questions to get the best information. Fundamentally, the census should have nothing to do with politics. It should just be about getting the data, so we have the best objective picture possible of all the people who are in America and every information that we can gather about them and their needs. Mr. Rogers. Illegal immigration is out of control. There is a crisis at our Southern Border and just like you need to be an American citizen to vote, I think that you should be an American citizen to be counted in the census. Just like voting, census data has a direct impact on our representation. If a locality knows they can receive greater representation in Congress and greater resources from the Federal Government, doesn't the current policy encourage that locality to flout illegal immigration laws to inflate its own census number? Would the Secretary like to comment? Secretary Raimondo. Respectfully, sir, I do not agree with that. The Constitution is crystal clear. Our job is to count all persons without regard to their immigration status and as I said before, I am very proud of the professionals who work at the Census. And honestly, my job is not to inject my political views or the President's political views or anyone's political views into the way they do their job. Their job is to be nonpartisan, collect the best data possible, and count every person. Mr. Rogers. Given China's increasing dominance in various industries including technology, I would hope the International Trade Administration is working towards a plan to prioritize national security concerns alongside efforts to promote U.S. exports and reduce the trade deficit with China. What measures is ITA taking to prevent the transfer of sensitive U.S. technology to China? Secretary Raimondo. So thank you for the question. This is probably the thing I spend most of my time on which is making sure we do everything we can to deny China our most sophisticated technology. So BIS, working with ITA, we try to have a robust program. I am very proud to say that in my tenure, we have put more Chinese companies on the entity list than under any other Commerce Secretary. Last year, we had more convictions of export control violations than ever before and we are just constantly, I wake up every single day figuring out how we might tighten our controls to make sure that China cannot get access to our most sophisticated chips, AI, quantum, et cetera. This budget requests additional funding for BIS. It has been flat since 2023, but licensing requests are going up. The budget also requests money for ITA so we can do outbound investment screening to make sure that U.S. money doesn't go to advance Chinese capability in these sensitive areas. So I am out of time. I will leave it at that, but I absolutely share the priority. Mr. Rogers. How will ITA ensure that U.S. businesses are not inadvertently supporting China's military ambitions or engaging in activities that could cause a threat to U.S. national security? What steps is ITA taking to strengthen its screening processes and ensure compliance with export controls? Secretary Raimondo. So as I said, we are constantly looking--the thing here that we watch out for mostly is dual use, the technology that can be used in a commercial application, but also in the military. And so that is the hard work of what we do, trying to figure out what are commercially- available technologies by U.S. companies that China doesn't have that they want access to to advance their military. And so it is a constant vigilance like constantly interfacing with U.S. companies, constantly gathering data, and importantly, enforcing. You know, under my leadership, we have imposed the largest single civil penalty ever for a company, in this case, Seagate, who went around our export controls. We have had more convictions last year than any year before. So it is a combination of changing the policy, working with companies, but also being really serious about enforcement. Secretary Raimondo. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Raimondo, you finished your opening statement rightly pointing out that our top priority in the Commerce Department is national security and I agree with that. So I want to follow up on some questions the chairman had about BIS. In the interconnected and rapidly modernizing world, our biggest challenges in national security are often problems of economics and technology, two areas where the Department of Commerce leads. Now you have been using the three letters BIS a lot and a lot of people aren't familiar with that. BIS stands for the Bureau of Industry and Security and I think we ought to say that whole title for people that don't know what that is. The Bureau of Industry and Security, this year, your request includes a $32 million increase and a request for 26 new positions. I would like you to discuss how this Bureau of Industry and Security request helps address national security challenges, especially the threat posed by China's military modernization. Secretary Raimondo. Thank you, sir. The Bureau of Industry and Security wasn't very well known until the last handful of years and the reason is because of what the chairman said, the threat from China. When you think national security, you might think guns, tanks, missiles, fighter jets. I think semi- conductors, quantum, AI model weights, et cetera. And so what we are doing at the Commerce Department is constantly studying these dual-use technologies to figure out what do we have, where is China, and make certain that China cannot access our technology for their military. So for example, in the budget request, there is the number $8 million for export control officers. If we are going to go after the bad guys, we need to be on the ground collecting data to find them when they do an end run around export controls. We are asking for $3.5 million for IT systems, right? Like we need to know where they are at all times. And by the way, it is not just China. We find Chinese and Iranian equipment in drones in Russia. So in any event, the Bureau of Industry and Security is at the leading edge of protecting this country's national security. The budget has been flat. The threat is quadrupling and I am respectfully requesting additional monies. Mr. Cartwright. Your request is noted. Madam Secretary, as the scope and complexity of the agency's work continues to expand, do you worry about being able to hire and retain staff with the necessary technical expertise and what is being done to address this challenge? Secretary Raimondo. That is such a great question. I worry about it constantly. If we are going to compete, the U.S. Government needs the top tech talent that there is and it is why, for example, I am requesting money for artificial intelligence, the Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute. If we are going to know what is going on at the cutting edge of AI, I need the best scientists there are. So yes, I worry about it. That being said, I am very proud of our track record. We just recruited somebody from OpenAI to come and work for us who is a leading scientist there. The CHIPS team is run by some of the best semiconductor professionals in the industry, so it is a daily challenge. It is why we are requesting funding, but I will say I have been very impressed with the quality of people we have been able to get. Mr. Cartwright. Well, speaking of AI, what specific investments are you proposing? Secretary Raimondo. So in AI, we are asking for funds for the AI Safety Institute which is to create standards for AI. You know, everybody, including myself is worried about synthetic contents, so we want companies to watermark what is AI generated. Well, what is adequate watermarking? What is adequate red-teaming? So we are going to build a team, the AI Safety Institute, to develop standards so that Americans can know--be safe. We are also investing in scientists and we are investing in policy people at NTIA to help us develop policies for AI. I would just say in this respect I very much am looking forward to working with the Congress. We are doing what we can do, but at the end of the day, Congress needs to legislate as it relates to AI and I look forward to supporting that effort. Mr. Cartwright. And last question, the AI Safety Institute, that will be part of NIST, am I correct in that? Secretary Raimondo. Yes, exactly, yes. Mr. Cartwright. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Secretary Raimondo. Science and Technology. Where we have two Nobel Prize winning scientists. People don't understand how top notched the scientists are at NIST. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you Secretary. Iran hates the United States and our allies, like Israel and Ukraine. And Iran is eating America's lunch. My question is the Department of Commerce plays a key role in enforcing U.S. sanctions on Iran. I am concerned that reports that Iranian drones used in Ukraine were determined to have been built with numerous components from American firms. Tehran and its proxies throughout the Middle East are using drones with American-made technology to attack American personnel and our allies. What is the Commerce Department doing to address the illicit exports to Iran? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. Listen, I share your concern and if you have any ideas of what more we can be doing, I would like to hear them. I really would. When the war broke out, we immediately put export controls in place against Russia with 39 other countries and they were effective. They are effective. Part of the reason we know they are effective is Russia couldn't get our stuff, so they went to Iran and China and now we see what you are seeing. So we continue to tighten, like we are constantly adding entities to our list. With respect to Iran, we put together a task force with the DOJ and DHS to do everything we can to enforce our export controls. I will be the first to admit that there is more work to be done. What I would tell you is we are just throwing-- every tool we have, we are throwing it at the problem, tightening the actual policy controls. Some of the money I am asking for is for export control agents, right? We have to be able to enforce these rules and just stay vigilant on it every single day. Mr. Gonzales. I have some ideas. I would love to be able to visit with you and maybe walk through making some of this come to fruition. Maybe we can follow up with that. Secretary Raimondo. Absolutely. Mr. Gonzales. Great. My next question is I continue to hear concerns from rural communities. My district is larger than the State of Pennsylvania and a large part of it is in rural communities and folks in South and West Texas talk about their potential ability--the communication providers in these areas talk about their potential ability to participate in the agency's BEAD initiative, the lack of it, due to the large size of the areas and that some states will require applicants to serve as well as the challenges delivering services at a very low mandated rate to certain consumers. What has the agency done about these concerns, basically large areas that you are trying to cover? It is very different from an urban area. Secretary Raimondo. So, once again, this is something, you guys are hitting are all the topics that keep me up at night. My job in implementing this $42 billion is to make sure every American has access, everyone. We have never had a task like this before including rural. We are massively focused on rural. That is what the subsidy is for. So we are working very closely with your governor and with the governor's team, using our maps to figure out who is not covered and providing subsidies to companies so that they, in fact, cover everyone including in rural areas. What I can tell you--listen, I do feel confident, based on everything I know that we will get every community, even the most rural. We are going to have to be agnostic. It may be fiber. We have fiber preference, but it may not be. That may not be affordable. And we are going to make sure that everybody has access that is affordable at the end of our implementation. The way it works is every state has to submit a plan. Mr. Gonzales. Sure. Secretary Raimondo. Texas is different than Pennsylvania, different than Kentucky and before we are giving any money to your state, we have to be satisfied that everybody will have access. Mr. Gonzales. Rural broadband is a very serious concern of mine because I feel as if there is a greater divide happening in this country and it has nothing to do with the color of your skin or how much money you have in your bank account. It has everything to do with where you live and that is not fair to many people. Now it is a difficult problem set. It is not an easy wave the wand, throw some money at it and all of a sudden it goes away. But I would be very interested in how do we incorporate technology maybe into speeding up this process. There is a lot of options there. My last question is I want to ask you about--we talked about NIST earlier. I want to ask you about the delays at NIST for certifications through the agency's cryptographic modular validation program, CMVP. NIST is sitting on an enormous backlog, some going as far back as 2021. There are certain components that go into civilian and Department of Defense systems of data security and encryption. What is your plan to address this backlog? Secretary Raimondo. So let me get you a more detailed answered because as a former governor, backlogs drive me crazy. I have got to get you the specifics, but I promise you I will get back to you. Mr. Gonzales. Excellent. Thank you. I appreciate the time and chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Ms. DeLauro is recognized, the ranking member of the full committee. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and at the outset if I might ask unanimous consent to put my opening statement in the record. Thank you.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Ms. DeLauro. And I want to welcome Secretary Raimondo, and I do want to say just a moment before I get to questions that I'm so delighted to have you here today. When the Biden administration took over 3 years ago this Nation really was in the throes of an economic crisis and public health catastrophe. Your leadership, and with the help of this committee, have improved our supply chains, you've invested in our communities, you've increased manufacturing, helped small businesses grow, and through the appropriations process and legislative efforts like the CHIPS and Science Act, infrastructure, really have been an infrastructure that allows us to be able to do what you said at the outset is to be competitive and to make America competitive. Let me just--I think you know what question I'm going to start with first--my hope is is that we'll have a second round--but that is outbound investment. We have talked about this many times. I think the review mechanism is critically important to the nation's security and that American investors are not advancing the military and, as we just pointed out, as you pointed out, technological capabilities of our adversaries. When we spoke at the hearing last year you were discussing the importance of targeting this policy to investments that directly impact our national security. The administration since then has issued an executive order. Create an outbound investment program, prohibit certain U.S. investments in countries of concern involving sensitive technologies and products. It will also require notification for investments involving lower risk products. While I understand Treasury is leading the effort, I understand that the International Trade Administration--ITA-- will provide key support through analysis and industry specific technical expertise. This will be critical to understanding the security risks that are associated with rapidly advancing cutting-edge technologies. The budget requests an increase of 5,000,012 positions within ITA to create this new office, hire experts with the needed technical expertise. As Treasury continues to work on regulations can you describe to what extent ITA has already started supporting implementation of the outbound investment executive order this year in 2024? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. Thank you. Ms. DeLauro. And do you have staff dedicated to this work? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. Yes, we do. So, first of all, thank you for your persistent focus on this issue. It's incredibly important. It relates to what we were talking about. Technology is one thing but we can't let them have our money and know-how. We have decided to focus on semiconductors and quantum and AI to make sure that U.S. money isn't funding those initiatives in China. Like you said, Treasury is in the lead. As I understand it, by the end of this year--by the end of this calendar year the rule we'll be done and so we can really start to implement it. What we're doing now in the meantime is building a team and we have asked for $5 million to continue to study the industry. So Treasury is, obviously, in charge of the finances and which funds and how to do the rule but we are helping them to figure out which pieces of AI should we be most worried about, which kinds of companies should we be most worried about. When we talk about quantum, you know, what does that actually mean? So we're providing, like, the commercial, industrial, technological know-how to match up against Treasury's financial know-how and we're already hard at work doing that. Ms. DeLauro. Let me just--beyond what's included in the budget is there anything else that you can share with us about your resource needs, how ITA will ramp up outbound investment support activities? And given the type of technical expertise required do you expect to be--that hiring will be a challenge? So what are the spaces for you where we might be able to help with? Secretary Raimondo. I appreciate that. It's a few spaces. One is just data. You know, the kinds of investments we're talking about are not in public stock market companies, you know. It's private money. It's hard to track, candidly. So any data that we can get access to to track these sorts of private investments by us and our allies is very important. So some of that is, like, buying data sets, buying IT systems. And then the other thing is people. So we need to attract, like we were talking about before, AI specialists, quantum specialists. Not so much scientists but commercially minded people, like former venture capitalists, for example, which is hard. It is hard. But we have done it in the CHIPS program. We have, former investors and such. I think we can do it in ITA. But that's what we're trying to do and that's the challenge. Ms. DeLauro. There's a final point. How will ITA anticipate and identify technologies and products that may be needed to add to those covered by the program now? You and I have had a conversation in the past about critical minerals, batteries, et cetera, so forth. But what will be the process with ITA of looking at what we should add to this portfolio? Secretary Raimondo. So one of the other budget requests-- and I can't remember the precise number--but we're also asking for additional money for our supply chain management office. I think it's about $12 million that we're asking for in ITA. I will tell you all, members of the committee, when I started as secretary we were using Excel spreadsheets and getting on the phone with companies to do supply chain tracking and now we are building a team. We built a team. I'd be happy to model the product we have built for anybody here. It's a bespoke IT system where we can track and monitor our most critical supply chain vulnerabilities. We need to keep building that. We need to be much more proactive instead of reactive, predicting where we're going to have a supply chain problem, where is China poised to take advantage of us. So that's the direction we're moving into instead of just being reactive--you know, we're out of baby formula on the shelves react. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chair, for the additional time. Much appreciated. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here. The Bureau of Industry and Security is the Commerce Department bureau that enforces export controls, correct? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. Mr. Clyde. All right. According to the guiding principles found on its website the Bureau of Industry and Security should ensure that the regulations it promulgates does not, and I quote, ``impose unreasonable restrictions on legitimate international commercial activity,'' end quote. The Bureau's guiding principles also state that they should avoid regulatory actions that, and I quote, ``compromise the international competitiveness of U.S. industry.'' Now, you're asking for a budget increase for the Bureau of Industry and Security, $32.4 million, and also the International Trade Administration, whose responsibility it is to strengthen international competitiveness of U.S. industry promoting trade and investment, you're asking for $34.5 million dollars for them as well, both increases totaling over $60 million. And, yet, the Bureau of Industry and Security finalized its interim final rule on April 30th of this year that permanently extends the current pause on firearm export licenses, violating both the previously outlined bureau guidelines by severely restricting American firearm, ammunition, and other component manufacturers from acquiring the necessary licenses to export their products for sale. Under this interim final rule the duration of firearm export licenses will be reduced from four years to one with approvals now occurring on a case by case basis. Following implementation of this rule approximately 2,000 active firearm export licenses that were previously approved will be automatically revoked, compelling the affected companies to submit new applications for export licenses. So much for the Paperwork Reduction Act. In fact, the National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates that this could have an adverse economic impact of greater than $250 million for the United States firearms industry, severely hurting the countless firearms industry manufacturers, suppliers, and jobs that are supporting--that are supported across the country. Mr. Chairman, I request unanimous consent to submit to the record this firearm and ammunition industry economic impact report by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Mr. Rogers. Without objection.  GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT Mr. Clyde. Thank you. You know, this rule will cause massive confusion in the market. It will terminate current business. It will damage the goodwill of the brands of firearm manufacturers and it eliminates future business. So, Madam Secretary, $250 million is a huge amount. Would you consider that an adverse economic impact and would you consider that as compromising the competitiveness of the U.S. industry abroad? Secretary Raimondo. Thank you for the question. I will say this. National security has to come before commerce. It's one of the hardest parts of my job. I tell semiconductor companies that they can't sell their chips to China. It denies them revenue. But, first and foremost, it's national security. I want to say I hear you--I hear you and I appreciate your concerns. But the reality is this is a very narrowly targeted change to tighten up our license requirements. It's based upon good data we have around diversion. Guns go one place but wind up in the hands of criminals or drug traffickers or terrorists, and we're denying or making it very hard to sell guns to 36 countries that have unrest, huge drug cartels, all of the--it is not in America's national security interests to export guns that wind up in the hands of criminals that could destabilize those countries or, quite frankly, our own country. I will tell you, every one of those people that had their license revoked can reapply. But it's going to be under stricter scrutiny in light of the evidence we have around diversion. Mr. Clyde. Well, ma'am, I mean, these are vetted countries. You know, obviously, these licenses were approved in the past. Okay. I mean, this is going to cost the United States arms industry a tremendous amount of money. So was there any communication with the White House regarding this rule? Secretary Raimondo. Probably but, no decisions we make have any--if you're insinuating was there any political element to this, absolutely not. We have data from the GAO and other places that say, you know, when law enforcement agencies confiscate guns in these 36 countries in connection with crimes, drug crimes, cartels, terrorists, they're guns that have been diverted. They were sold to a legitimate commercial user and diverted and that's against American national security and that's why we took these steps. By the way, as proof that these are narrowly targeted as everything we do in BIS the restrictions will affect less than 10 percent of all gun exports. So I don't agree with you. I agree--I admit it is some commerce. But I think national security comes first and I don't agree that it's large swaths of commerce. These are narrowly tailored to meet the national security mission. Mr. Clyde. Ma'am, a $250 million economic impact is not narrowly tailored. I, certainly, cannot possibly support this increase in funding when BIS comes out with this particular type of a rule. And I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright, for holding this important hearing and, Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us today and for your service and that of your staff. We interact often with them and the whole operation has been incredibly professional and very helpful. I want to talk briefly about regional tech hubs and appreciate, again, your leadership in this space, which has been extraordinary. But if you could just help articulate. You know, my hope is that we will find ways to have robust, consistent, predictable funding for the regional tech hub program over the next decade. It seems to me that's important not only to aid those areas we're going to invest in but also to attract private capital, something, obviously, you know, a great deal about. I wonder if you could just talk about from the perspective of both achieving the mission and attracting private capital to many of these communities why that robust consistent funding is important to predictability. Secretary Raimondo. Thank you, Congressman. I have to say I can't believe I've gone this far in a hearing without someone asking about tech hubs and here's why. In my entire time in government I've never seen a more popular program on a bipartisan basis in rural communities and, it's unbelievable to me. It's a great program that you created and authorized. We have 400 applications worth about $2 billion. We will have the money to make half a dozen tech hub investments of size, $30 million, $40 million. I wish we could--we have identified--of the 400 we identified 31 that we thought were really the best. Every single one of those is worthy of funding but due to the funding constraints in EDA, we'll do, like, six to 10-ish investments. This is necessary for national security. I mean, I can do everything possible in the world with Bureau of Industry and Security to deny China. The way we will beat China is by out innovating China and that means tapping into the technology, resources, and talent in every nook and cranny of America including, by the way, Chairman Rogers, in coal country and in rural country. Kentucky has a great tech hub proposal. I don't have them all memorized but in all of your districts your states have put in great tech hub programs. Silicon Valley, Boston, New York City, don't have a monopoly on great talent, great ideas, and great technology, and the whole point of tech hubs is to get outside of those communities and consistently fund innovation in America to make us stronger to outcompete the world. So, the budget asks for additional funding for that. I respectfully request that additional funding. It'll make America stronger in every way possible. Mr. Morelle. Well, I appreciate that. I'm not sure if I get points for being the first person to ask but if you want to add points to my ledger that would be great. I wanted to turn quickly to AI. We have talked about it a fair amount. I actually have introduced legislation which would prohibit the disclosure of nonconsensual AI deep fake in pornography which, as it turns out, and this is really troubling, 96 percent of deep fakes online are pornographic or intimate in nature. But what I really appreciate about the AI Safety Institute and NIST is I believe part of this is to look at content authenticity detection, which is really important, so people can be, certain or have some degree of confidence that what they're looking at actually is real and it hasn't been adapted or faked in some way. Could you just talk a little bit about what you anticipate or what you envision NIST doing to be able to identify that? Secretary Raimondo. Yeah, thank you for your legislation. It is really scary and unbelievable to see some of these deep fakes. I'm sure you guys have seen them. So what we're going to do in the budget request for NIST is a couple things. One, develop the science to be able to identify what is authentic versus what is AI generated. But, two, I think we need to get to a place where we--and we will need Congress' help to do this--where we require companies to identify is this AI-generated content or is it real content and they'll do that by some process of water marking. And what we're going to have to do at NIST is figure out what's adequate watermarking. So that it's all about trust. You know, AI is exciting. We can cure cancer faster, create medicine faster. But people have to trust it, and so we're going to develop standards around synthetic content and watermarking so that an individual when they see it will know is it fake or is it real, and that if it's watermarked, fake or real, they can trust in that watermark. Mr. Morelle. I appreciate that. And I know my time is up but I'd also say we need to think about the data sets used to train AI models and I don't think there's enough conversation around that. I'd love to interact with your staff and just get additional thoughts on that. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ellzey. Mr. Ellzey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here today. I'd like to, first, give you a compliment on the Bureau of Industry and Security restricting sale of chips from Intel and Qualcomm to Huawei in response to a letter from Senator Rubio and Representative Stefanik--the turnaround on that was fantastic--as well as using NTIA for $420 million in grants to offset what Huawei has done. They are a real threat and have been for 20 years and I think we're realizing that. So I wanted to start with just a compliment. I want to transition to Taiwan and the South China Sea. Can you describe for me exactly approximately how much of the world's commerce goes through the South China Sea? Secretary Raimondo. Massive amounts. Just 10 seconds on your prior thing. Technically, I'm not allowed to talk about any particular license revocations. However, back to our conversation, Huawei is a threat. AI is our focus. As we get more data around our threats we make changes to tighten the screws including revoking licenses that have been previously given. So without commenting on those two companies specifically I just want to reassure you we're constantly on it tightening screws where we need to including revoking licenses. I don't have a number for you but, I don't know, massive-- -- Mr. Ellzey. It wasn't meant to be a--it's about a third. It's about a third of the world's commerce. Secretary Raimondo. A third, yes. Massive amount of commerce. Mr. Ellzey. And that is right in the vicinity of Taiwan. So could you very briefly describe for me what happens if China invades Taiwan and locks down the South China Sea to American commerce and takes over TSMC? Secretary Raimondo. It would be absolutely devastating. Mr. Ellzey. How devastating? Secretary Raimondo. Well, right now--I'm not commenting on whether that's going to happen, how it's going to happen, if it's going to happen but what I can tell you is right now the United States buys 92 percent of its leading-edge chips from TSMC in Taiwan. Mr. Ellzey. And that's because they're two generations ahead of anything that we can build here in the United States, correct? Secretary Raimondo. No. They are vastly ahead anything we're doing in the United States. However, the announcements TSMC just made in Arizona will be to build two nanometer and three nanometer, which is their most sophisticated stuff. Mr. Ellzey. Got it. But until then they're a strategic asset in Taiwan, which makes it essential for us to defend the South China Sea and Taiwan, not just one place. Would you agree? Secretary Raimondo. I would agree, yes. Mr. Ellzey. Okay. So moving on from that, on the chips issue we're finding that chips from North Korean drones being used by Russia to attack Ukraine have American chips in it--in them. So what is BIS doing to stop that flow? It appears that they can use what we think are harmless commercial grade chips to use for lethal purposes around the world at a time that very--looks very much like 1940. Can we be doing more or are you doing everything you can and some just slipped through? How does that work? Secretary Raimondo. A few things. One, the fact that they have to use chips from breast pumps and refrigerators and such, which is what they're doing, is because our initial controls worked, right. We're denying that sophisticated stuff, which has slowed them down hugely and so they're going to do what you're doing, which is getting, quote/unquote, ``commodity chips'' and jerryrigging their equipment. It's less--and they're having to rely on Iran and China to do this. So that's not good news but it is what it is. So we are doing everything we know how to do as fast as we can with the resources that we have. For example, when we find out that a Chinese company is going around our export controls to Russia we put that company on the Entity List. When we find out--I was telling you--someone before we have created a task force with DHS and the DOJ to help us identify and prosecute countries or companies that go around our export controls. So, listen, if you have ideas of more you think we could do I want to hear them. I think we're doing everything we can with the resources we have. But it's massively frustrating and angering when you see Russia do what they do and work with folks like China to get around our export controls. Mr. Ellzey. I know you're doing the best you can do and especially in the national security realm so I appreciate it. Thank you for your fascinating testimony. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you. First thing, I think you're doing a great job. Keep doing it. You have different areas of--that you're involved in and you're coming together as a team for America and it makes a difference. Firstly, I want--I also want to thank you for designating Baltimore as a tech hub. We're very excited to go after the funds, which total $10 billion over the next five years. Mohan Suntha, who's president and CEO of University of Maryland medical system as well is chair of the Greater Baltimore Committee's board of directors said the application reflected the collective belief in the potential of predictive health technologies to revolutionize our industries and elevate entirely the community. I've spent close to 21 years in Congress advocating for national security. When I was in leadership on the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Chairman, I worked to keep Huawei equipment out of the United States systems. We knew that Huawei was a backdoor threat that could cripple the U.S. if we were ever to put them in an adversarial situation and it almost happened when the governor of Texas brought them into the United States. For a long time we knew China stole from us. They were taking everything from fertilizer recipes to advanced technology. The threats that come from the stealing of U.S. technology is great. Look at China's space program. Made massive advances by stealing from us. In the technology races of today like space exploration, quantum computers, artificial intelligence, and computer chips we have to do everything we can to protect these technologies. We have to protect them from our adversaries and Department of Commerce is on the front line of that. Now, in your ``60 Minutes'' interview a lot of the issues you talked about were alarming and spot on. In our efforts to address competition and threats from the China government we need to make sure the Department of Commerce has the tools and resources like our other front line defender as the Department of Defense. First, we can always give you money and manpower but what technology tools do you need to work smarter like supply chain, mapping, et cetera? Second, how is Commerce working with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to address the law enforcement issues? And, second, what are we talking about here is balance between enforcement and helping the economy. What we have here is a Boeing paradox. Boeing has to sell planes to China but what happens if we're in a situation that's more aggressive with China? Can you talk about how you balance our national security with economic need? Secretary Raimondo. Okay. Mr. Ruppersberger. Did you get all that? Secretary Raimondo. Okay. I'll do my best. First of all, I'm familiar with your tech hub. Doesn't mean it'll get funded but I'm familiar with it. I think it's excellent. Mr. Ruppersberger. It makes me a little excited when you say that. Secretary Raimondo. And the governor has called me numerous times so I got the memo. Secondly, we do need people. Some of it is just human beings to enforcement, right--the conversation we just had. We're trying to cover the world here. So, yes, we work with the FBI. Yes, we work with the intelligence community. Yes, we have several new efforts with the DOJ. The fellow Matt Axelrod who runs enforcement comes from the DOJ. But we do need more manpower, to your point. We also need more IT systems. We need more data sets, the amount of information available, and also we need to use AI. So we need to buy products that are AI enabled that allow us to scour every data set all over the world and every piece of data public and private to tell us what's really going on. So that is what we need. Here's the one thing I would say to you. You mentioned Boeing. We aren't trying to cut off all trade with China. We're not trying to cut off all tech trade with China, right. We're going to continue to sell them and that's good for America's economy--semiconductor chips, all kinds of technology--and the reason is because, they make a lot. They make a lot themselves. They can buy a lot from the rest of the world. We just need to focus on these choke point technologies, things that we have that they can't otherwise get access to, not commodity type goods. And it makes it more doable if you can identify what are the choke points and focus on that and work with our allies. Work with the Japanese and the Dutch, for example, in semiconductors to fully completely deny China, to slow them down, to slow their military down. I think that's important. We need to focus on we're after their military capability. I will tell you, we have controlled almost 700 types of dual use items to Russia to the questions before and we are constantly adding--I think we have added almost a hundred Chinese entities to the Entity List because they are trying to aid and abet Russia going around our export controls. So this really is a hand to hand combat every day. We got to get up and go at it every day and the resources I'm asking for will help us to do a better job. Mr. Ruppersberger. I agree. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary for being here. Secretary Raimondo. Good morning. Mr. Cline. Good morning. I want to talk to you about Bayh- Dole, which generally allows Federal contractors to take ownership of patents on inventions created with federal funding. As you know, the federal government has the power to march in and grant compulsory licenses to third parties in some circumstances. On December 8 of last year, NIST issued a draft framework to provide guidance to federal agencies on what to assess when considering whether to exercise marching authority. That explicitly included price as a factor for the first time since the Act was passed in 1980 with strong bipartisan support. The authors of Bayh-Dole have stated that the law makes no reference to a reasonable price that should be dictated by the government. And, that this omission was intentional. Aren't you concerned that the administration's proposal to consider price as a factor for exercise marching rights will send us back to a time when government-funded research just sat on the shelf, not benefitting anyone? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. So, let me say this, we stand strongly on the side of IP protection. And, the document to which you're referring, is non-binding. It is an interagency memo for guidance, which is just that. All of this is a balancing test. The President has rightly focused excessively on, extremely on bringing down the cost of pharmaceuticals and bringing down the cost of medicine and drugs successfully. But, we don't want to give you any impression, we stand strongly on the side of IP protection. Mr. Cline. Thank you. Let me stay with IP. Over the past decade, standards essential patents, SEPs, have become a focal point of controversy. The European courts, notably in Germany, frequently issue injunctions against U.S. companies for the use of common industry standards, such as WiFi, which do not align with the practices in the United States. These injunctions don't serve to address competitive harms. But, instead, to compel companies to agree to excessively high royalty fees. The recent establishment of the Unified Patent Court in Europe poses an increased risk as its injunctions will have broader implications across multiple countries in Europe. Given the significant impact of these legal standards on U.S. businesses, can you explain the administration's stance on the proposed EU regulation concerning standards essential patents and how it plans to stand up for U.S. companies in the face of challenges posed by entities like Huawei and others who engage in aggressive patent monetization? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. What I can tell you is, we just had Kathi Vidal, who runs the Patent Office in China, focus on many of these issues. And, she was recently in Europe. I have to get back to you with a proper answer. But, I will do it. And, maybe you and Kathi and I could have a phone call and go into the details. Mr. Cline. That would be great. As the President's principal advisor on spectrum issues, NTIA plays a critical role in ensuring that technologies of the future continue to advance. U.S. telecommunications industry is developing and deploying 5G technologies, but is at risk of falling behind our adversaries like China, due to a gridlock on spectrum. Do you agree that the United States must restore the FCC's auction authority, and, when it does so, identify a pipeline at spectrum that can support commercial innovation and U.S. leadership? Secretary Raimondo. I do. Here's what I think, certainly we need to restore their auction authority. I think, this is a balance, which is to say, we support NTIA studying the spectrum, seeing what could be made available. And, looking at maybe spectrum sharing. DoD needs what it needs to do its mission. And, a lot of this spectrum is really important. So, but I strongly support figuring out how we can find some spectrum to advance commercial innovation without ever impairing their mission. And, I think it's possible. By the way, here's what I also think, we can't think of national security so narrowly. I said this before, national security isn't just tanks, missiles, satellites, et cetera. It's also our ability to out compete Huawei. Our ability to out compete China. And so, if you look at the amount of midband spectrum available say in China, versus here, for commercial sector, we've got a lot of catching up to do. So, I think it's complicated. And, I don't want my comments to be interpreted as saying, you know, go take from the DoD whatever we need. But, I do think, it's a discussion we have to have. And, we absolutely need their auction authority reauthorized. Mr. Cline. Thank you. One more. NTIA has approved only four State's BEAD plans so far. Secretary Raimondo. Yes. Mr. Cline. You've testified repeatedly, acknowledging that the underlying statute prohibits NTIA from regulating broadband rates, and you're not rate regulating, not price setting. But, I'm hearing that approval of the plan by my State, Virginia, has been held up, because it declined to just do just that, set prices at NTIA's request. It's been nearly five months since NTIA approved Louisiana's plan, which was submitted at the same time as Virginia's. And, Virginia has still not been approved. There are no remaining outstanding issues, as I understand, with Virginia's plan under the rightful acknowledgment that neither NTIA nor the State, have the authority to set prices, as NTIA is requesting. So, can you commit to approving a state plan that complies with the law's prohibition on rate regulation? And, specifically, approving Virginia's plan as submitted to NTIA? Secretary Raimondo. I cannot commit to the last one. I'll commit to the first one. Mr. Cline. Okay. Secretary Raimondo. Let me say this, these are super complicated. There will be more next week, and more the following week. We're getting our flywheel going. I will look in on Virginia when I go back this afternoon. What I can promise you, is we aren't regulating. We are not telling any State, including yours, if you don't provide it at X dollars, we're not going to, you know, give you the money. But, the statute requires us to have low-cost options. So, we are, obviously, pushing States to make sure they are providing low-cost options. I will tell everyone here that, by the end of this year, by the fall, I'm pushing the team to have all these plans approved. I meet with them every week to say, where are you, and, how to go faster. And, I'll look in on your plan. Mr. Cline. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Ms. Meng. Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, thank you, Secretary Raimondo for your tremendous work and for being here today. I wanted to go back to the citizenship question that was mentioned earlier. As you know well, and you alluded to the 14 amendment of the U.S. Constitution, it states that representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State. I know that you and the public servants who lead the Census Bureau take this mandate from the Constitution seriously. Is there any agency in the Federal Government that keeps track of non-citizens? Secretary Raimondo. You have stumped me, Congresswoman. Ms. Meng. I assume like the U.S.---- Secretary Raimondo. Yes. I mean, not--you know, other--not, certainly not in my permit no--remit, no. Ms. Meng. And, why is the practice of counting every person leaving in each State needed to produce an accurate and full census? Secretary Raimondo. Because, as you well know, and every Governor knows, and I know this from being Governor, the census is just about getting information. Right. So, how much housing is required in a particular State? How many people are going to be in the schools? And, that's why I bristle at any, political interference, frankly, from either side as it relates to the census. It's just the facts, ma'am. So, we have experts collect, as you say, follow the Constitution, every person. Undercounting, undercounting is a problem, because it's an inaccurate picture of what's going on in every State and what kind of public safety services are needed? What kind of educational services are needed? If people are afraid because of their immigration status, to talk to the census counter, then we're not going to get an accurate number. And, that inaccuracy prevents us from doing the best job we can at running government, at the State level and the federal level. Ms. Meng. And, if we were to violate what the Constitution has charged the Census Bureau to do, would that potentially affect the amount of federal funding that a State could receive? Secretary Raimondo. Absolutely, yes. Ms. Meng. Thank you. I wanted to also thank you for your Department's recent action on regulating licenses for firearms experts. I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are extremely concerned, as we are, about the threats posed by transnational criminal networks and adversarial governments. So, I must say that I'm confused by their opposition to their proposed change. I want to ask if this rule will keep American guns out of the hands of drug traffickers? Secretary Raimondo. We hope it will. That's certainly its intention. And, that's how we're going to enforce it. I will say, I was recently in Costa Rica, a region of great instability. And, the President there was--they are a democracy. They are trying to develop their economy. And, that's good for the United States to have an ally with a thriving democracy in that region. Contrast that to say, Ecuador. So, we're doing this, again, not for political reasons, but, for our own foreign policy. It's not in our interest for drug traffickers, terrorists, murderers, people interested in fomenting instability and destroying democracy, to have guns. Ms. Meng. And, will this rule decrease the number of American guns in the hands of foreign terrorists and transnational criminal organizations? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. We believe that it will. Ms. Meng. And, will this rule make our world and our country safer? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. We believe it will. Ms. Meng. And, finally, how will the funding that the Department of Commerce has requested for fiscal year 2025, enable the Bureau of Industry and Security to continue its work of protecting our national security, especially as it relates to gun violence? Secretary Raimondo. We are asking for additional funds for more analysts, more technologists, more datasets, more technology, and more enforcement agents. So, you know, we can have the best policy in the world, but if we don't have enough people to enforce it, we're not going to be effective. Ms. Meng. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the census conversation, I agree, everyone should be counted for the purposes of infrastructure and public safety. But, not for the purposes of representation, either at the State level assemblies or in the House of Representatives, which is currently, it does wag the dog in terms of representation. And so, that's the point of what we're trying to do. Madam Secretary, you and I share the aspirations of reciprocal trade agreements with China. I agree, we can't cut off all trade with China. But, imparting on them the same terms and conditions of contracts and share ratios, access to intellectual property that they put on us when we do business in their country, I think, is important when they do business in our country. So, we'd love to keep those conversations going on offline, if we can. And, figure out how we can help you in that regard. That's a broader conversation. The former program director in me can't help but look at the CHIPS Act as a very massive program that should have program management reviews on a regular basis. This is probably one of the forums where we get to do that. So, I'm going to ask you some questions there's some indexes, SPI and CPI, schedule of performance index, cost performance index. The original budget of CHIPS was roughly $280 billion. And now, we're approaching about the two-year anniversary of the passage of CHIPS. We didn't really have an objective and State goal in terms of dates. But, we all kind of understand that 2027 is an important calendar line in the sand, relative to the highest risk potential of China invading Taiwan. So, with those numbers and that paradigm, how are we doing from a program management perspective? Are you on schedule? Are you on cost? And, before you answer, I want to overlay the feedback that I'm getting from folks in Silicon Valley, also smaller mom and pop shops in Southern California and throughout the country. They don't feel like we're going fast enough. They feel like they are being over regulated. They feel like we are overlying other requirements and specs that have nothing to do with the technology, that have nothing to do with the performance, or maybe in the construction of facilities. There are actual DEI metrics being imparted on these contracts and tracked as conditions of awards. NEPA issues, and environmental qual issues, that continue to just get worse and deeper. There are some companies that are having to retroactively go back and show compliance to Davis-Bacon labor policies that they would not have otherwise had to have done, with construction that would not have been done by outside union labor organizations. You're pushing a lot of smaller companies away, with these regulatory requirements, from participating. This is exactly what we were afraid of happening. I appreciate all the time you spent in the SCIF with me, explaining the nexus to the DoD and making sure that we're satisfying those requirements. I'd like to take that conversation offline and follow up. But, talk about the health of the program in terms of metrics. Are we on schedule? Are we on cost? How do we go faster? These barriers to speed are real. And, how can the contracting officers value speed as much as they value other things maybe, such as DEI or some of these labor policy requirements being enforced? If you can comment on that? Secretary Raimondo. Yes, great. Thank you. First, real quick on reciprocal trade. One of the things that we did recently, was through BIS, was around connected vehicles. Yes, you can't drive your Tesla to the airport in Beijing. Mr. Garcia. Hum. Secretary Raimondo. You can't. You can't drive an American made connected vehicle around certain areas in China. So, what's fair is fair. So, what we are saying is, we are concerned about Chinese connected vehicles on the roads in the United States, not for, tariffs and such, but economic disparities, but data. Think of all the data. Mr. Garcia. Yes, like electric buses being driving around Plant 42 that are made by a Chinese company, would be a problem. This is what we have in our district, right? Secretary Raimondo. Collecting data. Mr. Garcia. Collecting data, yes. Secretary Raimondo. The driver, what they say, where they go, their driving patterns. So, just a second to let you know, our aim trying to move out on some of these reciprocities ideas that we've been discussing to protect Americans. Mr. Garcia. Great. Thank you. Secretary Raimondo. Look on CHIPS, here's what I'll say, and I'll try and do it in 30 seconds. I think, we are on path. That's the bottom line. And, you say we're approaching the 2-year anniversary. I have 6 months before the 2-year anniversary date. So, that's a lot of working time---- Mr. Garcia. Yes. I'll give you that. Secretary Raimondo. Between now and then. Mr. Garcia. Yes. Secretary Raimondo. I started with nothing. I now have 200 people, amazingly talented people. We'd welcome you to come meet them any time. We have put out, I think, $29 billion. This week, we've been on a roll recently. Okay? I know people were frustrated until the beginning this year. In the last three months we have done, I think, seven or eight big deals, putting out nearly $30 billion, all to the leading edge providers. To the conversation we had earlier, TSMC has committed to build three fabs, including two nanometer chip fabs in the United States. Samsung is included, leading edge, plus research and development, plus packaging. Micron will be at scale. So, look, I know I have to go fast. But, it's much more important that I get it right. The metric I look at is, will we be making 20 percent of the world's leading edge chips in the United States by 2030? And, I say, yes, I think, we can. With respect to the smaller companies, it's a challenge. But, we're trying. We have just put out an application for smaller companies to apply. So, I can get you that information. Mr. Garcia. Yes. Secretary Raimondo. Get the word out to your constituents. Mr. Garcia. Yes. Secretary Raimondo. It's harder for little companies to interact with government. That's why we have a specific application. We're going to do another one, a $50 million research and development that only small companies can apply to. With respect to NIPA, work is tough. I have a whole team that is helping companies work through the NIPA issues. We are getting there. But, it's a challenge. Davis-Bacon is in the law. Davis-Bacon is in the statute. We will comply. We are complying. And, I don't think, look, every condition that we are putting in there, some related to workforce, some related to childcare, some related to DEI, I can honestly tell you, Congressman, it's designed to make sure these projects are successful. They need to find workers. Look, if you say to me, what's the biggest risk? It's lack of workers. So, we're pushing these companies to broaden the way they think about workforce, the way they train workforce so they can have the talent they need on the timeline that they need it. So, this is a big discussion and I'd be very happy to follow up with you. Mr. Garcia. Thank you. Fair enough, thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. That concludes the first round of questions for the witness. There is a request for additional questions, so we'll do a second round. But, I ask unanimous consent of all members that we limit remarks to 3 minutes to allow the witness to meet an obligation at noon that she has. So, Madam Secretary, we will get you out of here---- Secretary Raimondo. I appreciate that. Mr. Rogers. In due course of time. I recognize myself for 3 minutes. Let's talk about space business, space commerce. The rapidly growing of thousands of new, small and medium sized satellites being deployed to low earth orbit yearly. This office has been designated as the organization for tracking and managing those assets, those small satellites. There's thousands of them. And so, what will the Space Commerce Unit at the Department of Commerce do to count these satellites? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. There are so many, as you have said. So, we are developing a space situational awareness and traffic coordination program. I think of it as like air traffic control for space. And, we received $65 million last year to develop this. We're requesting another $75 million in this budget to continue that. It's on track. We have an excellent person running the Office of Space Commerce. And, that's our primary focus right now, is developing this tracking system so we can have an awareness of where all of this space satellite activity is. Mr. Rogers. Well, Space Commerce has been given the mandate to begin to track those assets existing, and new ones, to ensure that they don't prevent the deployment of new systems in low earth orbit. And, perhaps more importantly, that they do not inhibit civil and other space satellite deployment, as well as rocket launches, for various NASA missions. Tell us how this is going to happen? This is a big task. Secretary Raimondo. It is a big task. It is a big task. I think, look, space commerce is a burgeoning industry. And, it's critical the U.S. leads, right, in the civilian space areas, commercial space. And so, fundamentally, what we have to do, is make sure the U.S. leads in that area. Developing this space situational awareness system, which we are doing in the space traffic coordination system, enables us to do that by if you keep track of everything, it reduces collisions, it reduces problems, and it creates safety. And, quite frankly, it's an incentive for investors to invest in U.S. commercial space industry if we have this space trafficking system effective. Mr. Rogers. And, one complicating factor is, we're going to de-orbit the International Space Station in 2030. And, many of the commercial providers now on that station, will be looking for a new home in lower orbit, which complicates your chore even more. Is that right or wrong? Secretary Raimondo. That's right. It's a balance that we have to balance these interests. Mr. Rogers. Yes. Well, thank you. Mr. Cartwright. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Raimondo, I want to talk about the United States Economic Development Administration, which is housed in the Department of Commerce. EDA has an important role in spurring job creation and economic diversification in communities that have suffered decline and stagnation as the industrial economy rapidly evolves. That's true in my district. You know that in northeastern Pennsylvania, our economy has been bumping along since the decline of coal mining, since NAFTA, which bestowed benefits and burdens across our nation, but unevenly across our geography. And, we suffered a lot of manufacturing loss in Northeastern Pennsylvania because of NAFTA. And, legislative efforts since then, have not fixed that problem. But, EDA is one of the solutions. And, I'd like to hear--by the way, thank you for visiting Pittston in Northeastern Pennsylvania. You know that Pittston Mayor Mike Lombardo, has done amazing things to bring back that small city. Secretary Raimondo. Yes. Mr. Cartwright. And, we want to do more. But, I'd like to hear broadly, what key economic development needs are you hearing most often as you go around the country visiting places like Pittston? Secretary Raimondo. Yes. I had fun going so I enjoyed the visit. What I hear, and it's across all of your states, it's coal- affected communities, NAFTA-affected communities. Where I'm from in Rhode Island we used to be the jewelry manufacturing capital of the country and it all withered away. So what I hear is a need for U.S. manufacturing. There's something special about manufacturing jobs. They're high paying. They don't require a college degree. There's a job for everyone in the facility. People say, like, why can't we make more in America. That's why it's so exciting for me when I'm out in Arizona where I recently was with TSMC and Intel it's amazing. Tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs are brought about by the CHIPS Act. I hear the constant need for retraining, which is why I created the Good Jobs Challenge when I became secretary. People want to work, and put yourself in the shoes of a 42-year-old woman who's just been a retail clerk her whole career or a waitress and got put out of work in COVID. She can't retire. She wants to work but she needs skills. She needs digital skills or AI skills or something. So a desperate need for retraining and a desperate need to invest in infrastructure that will attract companies, and you see that, in Pittston or wherever. I mean, sometimes you might have a vacant mine or a vacant manufacturing facility. They have to be resuscitated to new uses and that takes money. EDA, by the way, spends money on all of that. We're investing in infrastructure to retrofit these buildings. We're investing in job training. The recompete program is about helping the most distressed communities and those are the ones that are the hardest and they take a lot of investment but it's worth it. Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cline. Mr. Cline. Madam Secretary, I'm concerned about the department's handling of the long-standing issue over imports of Vietnamese plywood into the United States. Two companies with operations in my district have been assessed countervailing duties over imported Vietnamese plywood in 2021 and 2022 even though the department had previously assured importers that plywood imports with a Vietnamese core would not be subject to such duties. The retroactive decision issued in 2023 has had significant negative impacts on U.S. companies which imported this product in good faith and, moreover, these companies have independently audited proof that the plywood they imported originated in Vietnam and not China, which was the target. Yet, the department refuses to consider such proofs and merely relies on the failure of Vietnamese exporters to satisfactorily respond to Commerce questionnaires. So the ultimate issue is where did the product come from, Vietnam or China, and this matter is currently pending administrative review with an interim decision expected by July 30. So and I'd ask you to, hopefully, accept and consider the independent audits to resolve this matter, and if you have any response. Secretary Raimondo. Yes, just a couple of things. This is a quasi judicial process with which I can't really interfere. The concern, which we see a ton of, is China dumps into Vietnam, Vietnam into the United States, and it's an end run around our anti-dumping regulations. But it's appropriate for me to look at it and certainly have my staff reach out to you. We don't want to hurt your local company. We do want to hurt China trying to get around our rules. Mr. Cline. Completely agree. I'd just ask for a fair evaluation of the evidence being put forward. Secretary Raimondo. I will do it. Mr. Cline. Thank you. With regard to counterfeit Chinese vapes--we'll stay with China--in the December 2023 press release announcing FDA and CBP's joint seizure of illegal e- cigs with a retail value in excess of $18 million the FDA said that many of these unauthorized e-cigs were intentionally misdeclared as various items such as toys or shoes and listed with incorrect values. So if shipping containers full of illegal e-vapor products from China are misdeclared at U.S. ports of entry either as to the country of origin to avoid the 25 percent China tariff or as to the product category to avoid the 2.6 e-vapor tariff this would represent criminal violations of custom laws on an industrial scale. But it would also amount to massive fraud on the U.S. Treasury in terms of lost tariff revenues. I'm assuming you're aware of how big this problem is. What steps have you taken with FDA and CBP to address the problem and recover those lost revenues? Secretary Raimondo. Once again, I can get back to you--this is mostly a CBP issue, I will say. I mean, we work closely with CBP. We furnish them all the data that they need and we cooperate with them. But this is--what you're talking about is primarily in their remit. Mr. Cline. All right. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Ms. DeLauro. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With regard to dumping, I think closing the de minimis loophole is something that ought to be considered as well. I think that's within the USTR realm. But with regard to that, and talking about countering unfair trade practices what role does the department have in confronting China's manufacturing dominance through trade policy? And working with the USTR to address trade issues that have concern with allies, partners, and adversaries what--you know, what is--how, if at all, is the department working with USTR on some of these? Secretary Raimondo. We work hand in glove with them on so many issues. I want to say I'm very concerned about this. It's no secret that China's economy is growing slower than it has and that they have wanted to and it's also no secret that their strategy is to crank up production. They now represent about 30 percent of the world's manufacturing output. They could decide to go to 60 percent to keep Chinese people working, which would be disastrous for the global economy. So I worry greatly, Congresswoman, about the possibility that they do that and dump their cheap products, whether it's electric vehicles, legacy semiconductor chips, critical minerals--the list is long if they crank up production and dump it on the world market. So we're working very closely with USTR to try to identify where are we most vulnerable and what actions could we take. One thing specifically that we have done at Commerce we just used the Defense Production Act to do a mandatory survey about legacy semiconductor chips produced in China. We're trying to find out where are these legacy Chinese chips in U.S. supply chains and do we see any evidence of China dropping the price, which would distort the market and make it impossible for U.S. chip companies to compete. So I'm laser focused on that area in particular. Ms. DeLauro. Well, there's the emerging markets as well. They're exporting manufacturing and technical standards for emerging markets and certain technology efforts, as you pointed out, information, communications, advanced manufacturing, and, obviously, you're aware of the challenge and I take it from your comments that other department is preparing and designing what structures you need and, again, what resources you may need to be able to counter, to combat that effort. Secretary Raimondo. That's exactly right. Ms. DeLauro. Just very, very quickly, the $4 million for global markets--the ITA request for that--which markets does ITA see as strategic for this purpose and how will you address it? Secretary Raimondo. Africa. I was just in Kenya. Extremely important. China is all over Africa. We have to show up in certain areas of Southeast Asia. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Clyde. Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, do you think the number of illegal aliens that were counted in the 2020 census had an impact on the apportionment of the House of Representatives that we have today? Secretary Raimondo. I don't think so but I---- Mr. Clyde. You don't think so? Secretary Raimondo. But I don't have a great answer for you. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Can you get me a great answer? Secretary Raimondo. What do you think? Mr. Clyde. I think it did. I think it really did at a--I mean, if we're looking at over 20 million illegals in this country and I think that it has a significant impact. Secretary Raimondo. Yeah. My job, though, isn't--go ahead. Mr. Clyde. Well, let me--you mentioned that the census is counting the whole number of persons in each state. I agree with you. It's what the 14th amendment says. But it also says in section 2 of the 14th amendment when it talks about representatives in Congress it says the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the portion in which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens 21 years of age in such state. Now, I know the 19th amendment added both male and female-- made it both male and female--and the 26th amendment lowered the age to 18. But the 14th amendment still says male citizens is the basis of--excuse me, it says citizenship is the basis of representation. And I'm grateful to take the clarifying action this week to prevent the marginalizing of citizens' voting power by finally requiring a citizenship question on the decennial census and by modifying the House of Representatives apportionment to be based only on United States citizens. I look forward to voting for H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act of which I'm a proud original co-sponsor. Now, can you tell me a little bit about the Census Bureau's annual business survey? What is the cost of that annual business survey and why did it go from five year in 2017 to one year? Secretary Raimondo. I can probably get you the cost but I'll have to get back to you on the exact cost. Mr. Clyde. Okay. That's fine. Secretary Raimondo. I do want to say something to your last question. The census' job is to identify persons living in this country and I know from experience--I lived it--when you start to ask people about their immigration status they then don't answer the door and won't be counted and it will lead to inaccurate data. Mr. Clyde. Ma'am, I appreciate that. But I'm moving on to the Census Bureau's annual business survey. So my next question to you is how much money is spent on follow-up with those businesses that do not initially respond to the Census Bureau's annual business survey? Do you have that? Secretary Raimondo. I don't, but I can get it to you. But a great deal of money. I mean, we try to get everyone to respond. Mr. Clyde. Okay. And how do you determine who you ask? Secretary Raimondo. You'd have to ask the scientists. To be clear, I don't interfere with any of this. This is statisticians figure out what's likely to lead to the best outcomes and I defer to their judgment. Mr. Clyde. Okay. So then I can be assured that you will get me that information? Secretary Raimondo. One hundred percent. Mr. Clyde. Okay. Thank you very much, and I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Ms. Meng. Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to voting against the bill that is called the Equal Representation Act but literally does the opposite, and to pretend that noncitizens do not live in our communities and that's exactly what this bill will do, pretend, will only as you mentioned, Madam Secretary, instill fear, force people into the shadows and take critical Federal funding away from every single state--red, blue, purple, rural, urban, suburban--which that's not the point of the census to count like this. In 2018 the previous administration repeatedly tried and attempted to add a citizenship question to the census, which I'm proud to say that Senator Mazie Hirono and I and others fought against in Congress and was subsequently blocked by the Supreme Court. I wanted to ask a quick question about the Minority Business Development Agency which offers many programs and services that help businesses to grow and be competitive. I represent a diverse district in Queens, New York, where many minority-owned businesses are in many ways the backbone of our community. Secretary Raimondo, how does the fiscal year 2025 budget request ensure that those who most need the MBDA's assistance and resources can continue to access them? Secretary Raimondo. Yeah, thank you. We have asked for an additional $12 million in MBDA to do exactly that. So our mission is to help business owners who are economically and socially disadvantaged including Asian Americans, members of your district--in all of your districts. So we're looking to add more offices, more staff, more service offerings, so we can be more available to these small businesses. Ms. Meng. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ellzey. Mr. Ellzey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, people in the Sixth District we're a very rural district. They're very worried about, in many cases, the debt of our Nation being $34 trillion, and a lot of the budget requests we have asked for--you've asked for here are increases and some new agencies, particularly the supply chain resiliency for $37 million. Offline, not necessarily here, please give me a justification for that and what the Office of Supply Chain Resiliency intends to actually do, because once a bureaucracy grows it's very hard to dial it back whenever it's not needed, I believe, in the market. I'm just curious how this is going to help the market. So later on please send me the answer to that. But I want to talk about China again and the threat that we're facing from four dictatorships, Israel--Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia and the chip issue. You know, it seems like China is controlling all the strings. Everything that they do in this country technologically is a military operation from the CCP and everything that they do is a study on the pattern of life. So everything's got a transponder in it. From the big cranes in the ports to the boxcars they tried to dump which we successfully stopped to the technology that's coming in is a pattern of life study which is what you do whenever you're going to study how to best attack a nation. I believe that we're already in a proxy war with China with them using the cartels to kill 200 Americans every day as an equalizer for their one-child policy which is about to send them into oblivion. Can you describe for me what you think the threat is from the electronics of China in the United States? Secretary Raimondo. A couple of things. One, I was very pleased to see Congress take action on TikTok. That's an example of TikTok being on the phones of, hundreds of millions of--tens of millions of Americans, collecting all that data. So that was one thing. Second, one thing we're doing is looking into electric vehicles--connected vehicles. Chinese electric vehicles on our roads at scale could be collecting massive amounts of data on Americans--who they are, what they say in their car, where they go to, their patterns of driving. So we have opened an investigation at the Commerce Department looking at that. Also, very much looking at cranes. The vast majority of cranes at U.S. ports are Chinese. Cranes are no longer, steel in the air. They're all connected collecting data. So, look, I'd say this is--we are building the capacity of our ICTS unit at the Commerce Department and looking very seriously at all of these connected apps, whether they're games or cars or really anything that collects data on large numbers of individuals--their GPS location, where they are, where they go, their family members. I think that we need to take the threat much more seriously and that's why we are moving out on these things. Mr. Ellzey. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you. In March it was devastating for so many Maryland families and businesses and, I'm sure you know, especially for the Port of Baltimore. Last week, my colleagues and I saw in person the terrific effort underway to clean up and replace this bridge but our state is still feeling many of the ripple effects after the collapse. Secretary, can you describe what your department has done so far to support these Maryland-based businesses? What are the department's plans for the future of this program and how can we make sure Maryland's businesses can make it through this rebuilding process? The Maryland Port of Baltimore is one of the largest ports in the Nation and the entire United States relies on it. Secretary Raimondo. Yeah. Look, my heart is with you and all those businesses and everyone there. I've talked to your governor on numerous occasions about this. By the way, NOAA and the Weather Service and our scientist team were on it right away to provide help in the immediate aftermath. Mr. Ruppersberger. I want to say it's one of the best efforts and, hopefully, it will pull United States together, Republicans and Democrats, for the benefit of our country. Secretary Raimondo. Yes, I agree with that. I agree with that. In any event, we are reaching out. The MBDA and EDA are reaching out to the businesses in that community, working with the governor's office, working with the governor's Economic Development Agency to see what services we can provide to those businesses. I think it's on the books already--I'm going to do an event in Baltimore with the governor, with small businesses. I'm going to go myself just to let them know all the services we have available for small businesses, figure out ways that we can help them get back on their feet. Mr. Ruppersberger. You know, it's going to cost about $2 billion to replace it. But it's a very unique place and affects the Port of Baltimore. So thank you for your cooperation and your involvement, too. Secretary Raimondo. Thank you. Mr. Ruppersberger. I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Morelle. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I can just talk for a moment about quantum technology. I was at a group meeting with some national quantum experts last week and one of them mentioned to me that in 2017 the Chinese used a satellite to send entangled particles between space and the ground. Since then, as I understand it, China has constructed a 2000-mile quantum link between Beijing and Shanghai. Obviously, quantum technology, whether it's communications, computing, et cetera, is a huge leap forward in technology and that we need to be at the leading edge of it. But is there a value in building--should the United States consider a significant national link between major cities that will allow us to use quantum networking? Secretary Raimondo. I'm afraid I would have to research that. A quantum expert I am not. So we can follow up on that. It is an area--look, I'll say a couple things. It's definitely frontier technology which is why we are export controlling seriously. It's up on investment screening list. We have asked in the budget for $68 million, which is an increase of $14 million, at NIST to hire 41 people to develop new standards and create research partnerships for quantum. So we're really leaning in at NIST with universities to push forward on the research whether or not what you say is the right idea. We can follow up. Mr. Morelle. Okay. I'd love to follow up and see if there's some value on---- Secretary Raimondo. But what I can tell you is although I don't know the people at NIST will have an opinion and so we should make that happen. Mr. Morelle. Okay, good. You mentioned earlier a real problem around the chips space, which is workforce and workforce development. Talk to me a little bit about what the department's strategy is to promote workforce development in this space so that we can meet the needs of these businesses that are struggling. Secretary Raimondo. By the way, this is such a huge issue. Yesterday I was with the CEO of one of the biggest construction firms in America. He said that the attrition rate on their projects is 50 percent because they're going to competitors--that they're turning down work because they can't find enough construction workers and his number-one biggest problem is lack of skilled workers. So we're doing a number of things. We're asking every semiconductor company before they get our money to show us their workforce plan. We're giving--as part of the money--the grant that we're giving to chips companies a piece of it is for workforce. So, Intel, all these companies, are getting tens of millions of dollars just to do workforce, and also we're developing a chips workforce center of exellence just to train people. I think this has to be a moonshot. Like, if we succeed--if we fail with this chips effort it's because we haven't taken the workforce stuff seriously enough, which is why we have a whole workforce team that reports to me just to work with colleges, universities, labor unions, high schools, to train people to go to work in the semiconductor industry. Mr. Morelle. And I won't--I'll yield back and say, if I could just comment and you don't have to respond to this, but it does seem to me for all the talk about illegal immigration we have hundreds of thousands of people who would like to come to the United States like my grandparents did to work in the United States to fill critical jobs that we need to be successful. With a low birth rate and maybe if we worked on a reasonable thoughtful immigration policy we could meet some of the workforce challenges that all these companies in construction and health care and hospitality, and the list goes on and on, that we're desperately going to need. So thanks for your comments always and, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rogers. Madam Secretary, you have been very generous with your time and your opinions. Secretary Raimondo. Hopefully not too generous with my opinions. Mr. Rogers. We thank you for giving us this time together. We will look at your budget request in detail as we proceed. So thank you for the work you're doing. Secretary Raimondo. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Lots of good things happening in a difficult world that we all of a sudden realize we live in. So thank you for your work. This concludes today's hearing. We want to thank Secretary Raimondo for being here today with us. Without objection, members may have seven days to submit additional questions for the record. The subcommittee stands adjourned.
