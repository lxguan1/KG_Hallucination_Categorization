________________________________________________________________________
_______
The Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs will hold a
legislative hearing on two bills: H.R. 1208 (Rep. Cole), To amend the
Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the authority of the Secretary of the
Interior to take land into trust for Indian Tribes, and for other
purposes; and H.R. 6180 (Rep. Carl), ``Poarch Band of Creek Indians
Lands Act'' on Wednesday, June 26, 2024, at 10:15 a.m. in 1324
Longworth House Office Building.
Member offices are requested to notify Haig Kadian (Haig.Kadian
@mail.house.gov) by 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, if their
member intends to participate in the hearing.
I. KEY MESSAGES
Pursuant to the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Carcieri v.
Salazar, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) is only
authorized to place land into trust for federally
recognized tribes that can demonstrate that they were
``under federal jurisdiction'' when the Indian
Reorganization Act (IRA) became law in 1934.
H.R. 1208 would amend the IRA to grant the Secretary the
ability to place land into trust for the benefit of any
federally recognized tribe.
H.R. 6180 would treat the Poarch Band of Creek Indians as
covered by the IRA and reaffirm any lands previously taken
into trust for their benefit by the Secretary.
The Secretary's ability to take land into trust removes
land from local control, placing it under federal and
tribal control. Land taken into trust within a community
has implications for taxation, zoning, and other local or
state laws regarding property.
Changing the impact of Carcieri v. Salazar also has
implications for Indian gaming development.

III. BACKGROUND
H.R. 1208 (Rep. Cole), To amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm
the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land
into trust for Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.
H.R. 1208 would amend the IRA \1\ and grant the Secretary the
ability to place land into trust for the benefit of any federally
recognized tribe, not just those considered ``under federal
jurisdiction'' when the IRA became law on June 18, 1934. This would
reverse the 2009 Supreme Court decision Carcieri v. Salazar.\2\ Similar
legislation has been introduced in the past seven Congresses, and the
past ten democratic President's budget requests have included proposed
legislative language to accomplish the same goal.\3\

Land into Trust Authority
Section 5 of the IRA \4\ authorizes the Secretary to take land into
trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe ``in his discretion.'' The IRA
was enacted as a remedy to the allotment policies exemplified by the
Dawes Act,\5\ which resulted in a reduction of Indian land and
continued poverty and poor conditions on reservations, as detailed in
the 1928 Meriam Report.\6\ Land held in trust for individual Indians
and federally recognized tribes is generally immune from state and
local jurisdiction and taxation. Depending on the location of the land
and the date it was put in trust, a tribe may be able to operate a
casino on land held in trust pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act (IGRA).\7\

Currently, there are approximately 56 million surface acres and 59
million acres of subsurface minerals estates held in trust by the
United States for American Indians, Alaska Natives and for federally
recognized tribes.\8\ Lands can be taken into trust through mandatory
or discretionary acquisitions. A mandatory acquisition involves
Congress, or a court order, mandating the Secretary take specific land
into trust for the benefit of a tribe. Discretionary trust acquisitions
involve the Secretary using the authority granted to them under the IRA
to take land into trust on behalf of the tribe.\9\

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has issued regulations outlining
the Secretary's process to take land into trust for individual Indians
or federally recognized tribes.\10\ Applications are often seen as
procedural because they are generally approved irrespective of whether
taking the land into trust would have local, state, or federal tax and
governmental impacts.\11\ There is currently no standard for removing
land from trust if a judicial decision deems the application's approval
unlawful.\12\

The Carcieri v. Salazar Decision and Effects
The Carcieri v. Salazar Supreme Court decision provided a limit on
the secretarial power to take land into trust. Resolving a lawsuit
filed by the Governor of Rhode Island, a 2009 Supreme Court decision
held that the trust land provisions of the IRA may only benefit tribes
that were ``under federal jurisdiction'' on June 18, 1934, the date of
the Act's enactment.\13\ These are generally tribes with reservations
whose lands were allotted under 19th-century laws. Following allotment,
millions of acres of land left Indian ownership. A key goal of Congress
in enacting the IRA was to remedy the land loss by Indians in tribes in
existence in 1934.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ 555 U.S. 379.
\14\ 25 US 5103.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual impact on all tribes since the decision is unknown for
two reasons. First, since 2009, the Department of the Interior (DOI)
has not divulged a list of tribes that were or were not under federal
jurisdiction in 1934. Tribes applying to have land placed into trust
through the BIA's process generally have to prove that they were under
federal jurisdiction in 1934, often defending their history,
membership, and even the tribe's existence in their land-to-trust
applications.
Second, during the Obama Administration, the DOI Solicitor issued
an ``M-Opinion'' interpreting the definition of ``under federal
jurisdiction'' to continue the acquisition of lands for tribes
recognized after 1934. This controversial decision by the Obama
Administration has allowed the Secretary to continue taking lands into
trust for federally recognized tribes but it has also led to ambiguity
and lawsuits.\15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, one land into trust application from the Mashpee
Wampanoag Tribe of Massachusetts for its ``initial reservation'' caused
three lawsuits and three different secretarial decisions across three
different presidential administrations, because the tribe was
recognized in 2007. Local residents disagreed with the 2015 land into
trust decision, as well as plans for a subsequent 400,000-square foot
class III gaming-resort complex, and challenged the decision in federal
court.\16\ They argued, pursuant to Carcieri v. Salazar, that the
Secretary did not have authority to take the land into trust since the
Mashpee tribe was recognized after the IRA's enactment date.\17\ A
Massachusetts district court ruled for the residents; then the
Secretary issued a new decision in 2018 stating that the Secretary
could not take the land into trust. The Mashpee tribe then challenged
the 2018 secretarial decision, and a D.C. district court ruled in favor
of the tribe, resulting in another 2021 secretarial decision declaring
the Mashpee tribe under federal jurisdiction in 1934.\18\ The 2021
secretarial decision was challenged in court, with a Massachusetts
district court this time rejecting the resident's challenge and siding
with the argument based on Carcieri v. Salazar, citing evidence of
Mashpee children attending the Carlise Indian School under the federal
assimilation policy, thus proving the tribe was under federal
jurisdiction before 1934.\19\ This merry-go-round of litigation took
years to complete and ended at the same conclusion as the original 2015
secretarial decision to take the land into trust for the Mashpee.

Local Concerns Regarding Future Land into Trust Decisions and Effect on
Indian Gaming
Some local and state governments have concerns with a ``fix'' to
overturn the Carcieri v. Salazar decision. The National Association of
Counties (NACo) has routinely requested that Congress address the
Carcieri v. Salazar decision as part of a larger ``comprehensive
examination'' centered on reform to the fee into trust land
process.\20\ Land held in trust does not fall under state or local
jurisdiction for law enforcement or taxation. Removing the land from
state or local jurisdiction impacts counties, states, and other local
stakeholders. Generally, these stakeholders are concerned they do not
have enough involvement in the land-into-trust application process,
even though it directly impacts their interests, and quick decision
time frames make it challenging to be included in the process.\21\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2023, the BIA promulgated new land into trust
acquisition regulations where the agency included a process to
determine whether a tribe was ``under federal jurisdiction'' on June
18, 1934, reflecting the Carcieri v. Salazar decision.\22\ During the
rulemaking process, NACo submitted comments requesting the BIA take
into consideration the opinions of state and county governments to
avoid the ``controversy, conflict and costly litigation between tribes
and state and county governments.'' \23\ However, the final rule
published in December 2023 maintained the 30-day comment period for
state and local stakeholders. Changes made in the final rule included:
acknowledgment that the Secretary's policy is favorable towards taking
land into trust for the benefit of tribes; a requirement that the BIA
must issue a decision within 120 days of the application being
submitted; and the acknowledgment of how to determine whether a tribe
was ``under federal jurisdiction'' as ruled in Carcieri v. Salazar.\24\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another change involved the acquisition of land into trust outside
of a tribe's land boundaries. Previously, there was a ``bungee cord''
approach to land as the distance from it to a tribe's reservation
grew--meaning the further from a tribe's preexisting reservation, the
more scrutiny applied to the request. Under the final rule this
approach is no longer taken into consideration. The Secretary now
presumes that the tribe will benefit from the land being taken into
trust.
Any land into trust process changes also have implications for
tribal gaming projects as new gaming projects can only be developed on
certain lands as laid out by IGRA.\25\ Under IGRA, tribes can conduct
gaming activities on ``Indian lands,'' which are defined as
reservation, trust, or restricted-fee land. While IGRA prohibits
gaming-related activities on lands taken into trust after October 17,
1988, various circumstances allow a tribe to circumvent the
prohibition.\26\

Tribal revenues from gaming support the overall well-being of their
tribal community, as required by IGRA.\27\ In 2023, over 200 tribes
owned, operated, or licensed more than 500 gaming businesses in 29
states.\28\ On average, tribal gaming increases employment by 2.4
percent and wages by 5.6 percent on tribal reservations.\29\ However,
this is not the case for every tribe, and successful gaming operations
are highly attributed to the overall support seen in the surrounding
areas.

H.R. 1208 aims to streamline the process of placing lands into
trust for tribes that were federally recognized after 1934. This could
impact areas with tribes that have gained federal recognition more
recently, including but not limited to the impact of potential
expansion of tribal gaming operations.

H.R. 6180 (Rep. Carl), ``Poarch Band of Creek Indians Lands Act''
H.R. 6180 would recognize the Poarch Band of Creek Indians as
covered by the IRA and reaffirm any lands previously taken into trust
for the tribe's benefit by the Secretary as trust land. Any pending
challenges to land taken into trust would be invalid if based upon the
argument that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934.
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians (Poarch Band) is located
approximately 56 miles north of Mobile, Alabama. It is a segment of the
original Creek Nation that resided in Alabama and Georgia. Following
the War of 1812, the Creeks who supported the United States signed the
Treaty of Fort Jackson, ceding their land in Alabama.\30\ In 1836, the
federal government forcibly moved 15,000 Creeks to Oklahoma.\31\ The
Creek Indians who remained in the vicinity of Poarch, Alabama, became
known as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, remaining a cohesive tribal
group. It was not until August 11, 1984, that the BIA recognized them
federally. After recognition, the Poarch Band had their lands in
Alabama and Florida administratively placed into trust by the Secretary
under Section 5 of the IRA.\32\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Litigation regarding Land into Trust in Alabama
As noted above, the Carcieri v. Salazar decision left some tribes
in limbo regarding whether the Secretary was authorized to take land
into trust for them. The Poarch Band is one of those tribes because it
was recognized through the BIA's administrative process in 1984, nearly
50 years after the enactment of the IRA, and the Secretary took land in
Alabama and Florida into trust for the tribe prior to 2009.
According to Poarch Band's testimony at a 2015 hearing, many of its
lands were placed in trust prior to 2009 pursuant to the IRA, and these
trust lands have been developed with the construction of buildings and
businesses, including casinos.\33\ If a court were to decide these
lands are not lawfully held in trust on the grounds the Poarch Band was
recognized after 1934, the lands could lose their trust status,
exposing the tribe to state taxation and civil regulation, which in
turn could lead to the closure of tribal businesses and the dismantling
of facilities. In addition, the tribe's casinos would become subject to
Alabama State law, which could lead to the modification or closure of
the gambling facilities that employ large numbers of people and
generate revenues for the tribe's government.\34\ In 2016, the Poarch
Band of Creek Indians prevailed in the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals, where a unanimous decision concluded that the tribe's
reservation was protected under the IRA and could not be taxed by the
state of Alabama.\35\ However, this decision does not necessarily
prevent further litigation on future parcels of land the Secretary
could take into trust for the tribe.

The Poarch Band currently operates three Class II casinos in

Commissioners, Mayors, City Council Members, and state legislators in
Alabama.\37\ Local support highlights the local effect of these
decisions and the ability for tribes to gain support for land into
trust decisions.

IV. MAJOR PROVISIONS & SECTION-BY-SECTION
H.R. 1208 (Rep. Cole), To amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm
the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land
into trust for Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.
Section 1. Reaffirmation of Authority
Amends the Indian Reorganization Act (25 U.S.C. 5129 et. seq.) to
authorize the Secretary to take land into trust for any federally
recognized tribe. This removes the need for a tribe to be ``under
federal jurisdiction'' on June 18, 1934. The bill would further ratify
any action taken by the Secretary to place land into trust for a
federally recognized tribe and ensure that the decision cannot be
challenged based on the Carcieri v. Salazar reasoning. Additionally, a
provision is included to limit the impacts of this legislation to this
subsection of the IRA only and that any statutory reference to the IRA
is to be considered amended by this legislation.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. HARRIET M. HAGEMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING
Ms. Hageman. Today, the Subcommittee is meeting to consider
two bills. These two bills center on the issue raised in the
2009 Supreme Court decision Carcieri v. Salazar. In that
decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Secretary of the
Interior, or Secretary, is only authorized to place land into
trust for federally recognized tribes that can show that they
were under ``Federal jurisdiction'' when the Indian
Reorganization Act, or IRA, became law in 1934.
First, we have H.R. 1208, introduced by Congressman Cole,
which would amend the Act of June 18, 1934, the Indian
Reorganization Act, to grant the Secretary the ability to place
lands into trust for the benefit of any federally recognized
tribe. This legislation would essentially resolve the decision
of Carcieri v. Salazar, removing the precursor of ``being under
Federal jurisdiction'' when the IRA became law on June 18,
1934.
The second bill on the docket is H.R. 6180, introduced by
Congressman Carl, which would treat the Poarch Band of Creek
Indians as covered by the IRA, and reaffirm any lands
previously taken into trust for their benefit by the Secretary.
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians currently reside roughly
56 miles north of Mobile, Alabama. A segment of the original
Creek Nation, the Poarch Band received Federal recognition in
August 1984 through the BIA's administrative process. After
recognition, the Secretary placed land into trust for the
benefit of the Poarch Band under the IRA. This was, of course,
prior to the Carcieri v. Salazar decision, which has left the
Poarch Band in limbo as a tribe recognized after 1934 with land
in trust status.
The Poarch Band has overcome time-consuming and costly
litigation. In 2016, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the Tribe's reservation was protected under the IRA.
However, this decision does not protect the Poarch Band from
further litigation on any future parcels of land taken into
trust by the Secretary for their benefit.
As this Subcommittee has seen, the ability to have land
placed into trust is a top priority for many tribes and garners
wide support across the board. Yet, there are impacts to local
towns, cities, counties, and states that should be weighed by
the Department of the Interior when placing land into trust.
When the Secretary places land into trust, it is removed
from local control and falls under Federal and tribal control.
This change often has implications for taxation, zoning, and
other local or state laws regarding property. As seen with the
Poarch Band, these implications can lead to litigation, which
is often time-consuming and costly for all of the parties
involved.
I am hopeful that conversations such as the one we will
have today will be a catalyst for a long-term solution across
the board. I want to take the time to thank our witnesses for
being here today, and I look forward to a robust conversation.
The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Minority Member for
her statement.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank
you for holding this hearing. And you can see the interest. We
have standing room only. And it is because it is such an
important issue.
On December 2, 2021, I went to the Floor with this very
same bill as Chair of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples.
And it was important to raise then, as it has been important to
raise every time we re-introduce this bill since that fateful
Supreme Court decision. That bill passed overwhelmingly, and I
look forward to us moving this bill, as well, through this
Congress, because it is such a bipartisan effort to address
this 2009 Supreme Court ruling in Carcieri.
In Carcieri, as we have heard, the Supreme Court decided,
the end of the IRA, the Secretary could take land into trust
only for those tribes that were under Federal jurisdiction in
1934. That decision was harmful. It was disrespectful to
tribes. It essentially said that if you are not federally
recognized, it didn't matter how long you existed, but if we
hadn't done our homework and made all the mistakes that we made
over the years, then you didn't get to re-establish your
homelands.
The ability to take land into trust is essential for tribes
to provide housing, economic development opportunities,
governmental services, and to protect tribal lands and cultural
resources.
The Carcieri ruling upended 75 years of Federal Indian
policy and administrative practices. It created uncertainty.
Because of Carcieri, tribes have had to defend themselves in
court, as we have just heard the Poarch Creek Band has had to
do. DOI has to provide time-consuming and often unnecessary
reviews of a tribe's jurisdictional status, and these are
exactly the kinds of unnecessary and costly steps we should
address, and that is what H.R. 1208 does.
I want to thank both Representatives Cole and McCollum for
their leadership on H.R. 1208 and for their years of leadership
on this. I am an original co-sponsor of the bill. Their
bipartisan work to correct the misguided Carcieri ruling
demonstrates how Democrats and Republicans can work together on
this Subcommittee for Indian Country.
Mr. Cole's bill would simply restore the Secretary of the
Interior's authority to take land into trust for all tribes,
regardless of their date of Federal recognition.
Let's be clear. H.R. 1208 is separate from Indian gaming
law, and does not alter the process for placing land into trust
for gaming. It does not take away state and local governments'
input under existing Department of the Interior's land-into-
trust policies. H.R. 1208 just makes sure there is parity and
equality for all tribes so they can fully realize the benefits
of sovereignty, including through acquisition of trust land.
That means we would not have to enact individual bills to
return land that the U.S. Government systemically removed from
tribes, bills like Representative Carl's H.R. 6180, which
reaffirms the trust status of the lands of the Poarch Band of
Creek Indians in Alabama, Poarch Band of Creek Indians. I
apologize for the inversion earlier.
I believe that we need a clean Carcieri fix. In the 117th
Congress, we had a hearing like this. We passed it out of the
Floor, 302 to 127, just like we did in the 116th Congress.
Congress has introduced legislation for Carcieri in every
Congress since 2009. And I want to thank once again the
Chairwoman and the Chair for allowing this hearing to go
forward so that we can continue that tradition and finally get
it over the finish line.
H.R. 1208 isn't a quick fix, as some have said. Tribes,
Congress, and the Department of the Interior have worked on it
for over a decade. It is past time to do the right thing for
Indian Country. It is our role in Congress to pass legislation
to uphold our treaty obligations and trust responsibility to
tribes. That is how we promote tribal self-determination and
self-governance.
Chairwoman Bryan, I truly appreciated your written
testimony, where you said we receive blessings and blessings we
give back. And I think that is so essential to how we look at
what we are doing here today. I hope we can put politics aside
and move this bill through the Committee swiftly and to the
Floor so we do not need individual bills.
With that, Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Chairman
Westerman for an opening statement.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the
witnesses for being here today.
And as the Subcommittee Chair and the Ranking Member
stated, we are here to look at two different bills, really two
different approaches that would amend the Indian Reorganization
Act to address the 2009 Supreme Court decision Carcieri v.
Salazar. And there is tremendous interest in this, and I think
it is appropriate that we have a hearing.
And if you look at the way this hearing is structured,
there are two pathways: one bill that would do a broad Carcieri
fix, and another bill that would do kind of a more singled-out
approach. And going forward, one way would kind of relieve
Congress from having to deal with it in the future; the other
way would be individual fixes going forward. So, I think it is
good that we have this hearing to bring out differences in the
way to address Carcieri, to hear the concerns, and to figure
out what is best for our country going forward and for all the
tribes involved.
H.R. 1208, sponsored by Representative Cole, would amend
the Indian Reorganization Act to clarify that the Secretary of
the Interior has discretionary authority to place land into
trust for any federally recognized tribe. Currently, a tribe
must be determined to have been under Federal jurisdiction on
June 18, 1934 for the Secretary to take land into trust through
the agency's administrative process.
H.R. 6180, sponsored by Representative Carl, would also
amend the Indian Reorganization Act to confirm the Secretary's
discretionary authority to place land into trust for the Poarch
Band of Creek Indians, both for land already in trust and
future parcels that the Tribe could request the Secretary to
take into trust.
Tribes place land into trust for many purposes, including
for tribal housing, economic development projects, and cultural
and ecological conservation. The trust status gives tribes
confidence that lands will not be transferred without Federal
action. This means tribal homelands that anchor tribal
histories and stories remain a part of their future, as well as
their past.
This Committee has worked to pass various land-into-trust
legislation on a consistent, bipartisan basis, recognizing that
tribes know what benefits their tribal members best. However,
tribal trust land can have implications for local and state
taxation, zoning, and other laws regarding property. Broad
consensus between tribal, state, and local stakeholders on
those issues and on those actions are crucial. It not only
preserves support for placing land into trust, but also
benefits any further development or use of the land.
We have seen many examples of local communities benefiting
from tribal development of trust lands, diversifying economies
and often providing jobs. We have also seen instances where
tribes and local stakeholders are not on the same page,
resulting in costly and lengthy litigation. While consensus
cannot always be reached, it is vitally important that we
attempt to find the best way forward for everyone. This
includes hearing from multiple perspectives on this issue and
how all stakeholders would be affected if either of these bills
became law.
Congress has both plenary power over Federal Indian policy,
as well as the innate authority to define how we delegate power
to administrative agencies. Ultimately, Congress can change
policies and procedures if we think it is in the nation's best
interest.
Again, I want to thank the witnesses for being here to
provide your expertise and testimony on these bills and on this
important topic.
I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Chairman Westerman.
The votes have just been called. I am going to go ahead and
introduce our witnesses, and then we will adjourn for a short
period of time to allow us to go vote, and then we will come
back and continue with the hearing. I am sorry for the
disruption, but we have two different vote series today, so we
have to have one of them this morning.
Very quickly, I now want to introduce the witnesses for our
panel.
Ms. Kathryn Isom-Clause, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington,
DC; the Honorable Marshall Pierite, Chairman, Tunica-Biloxi
Tribe of Louisiana, Marksville, Louisiana; and the Chair now
recognizes Mr. Carl for 1 minute to introduce the witness from
his district.
Mr. Carl. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. It is going to be a
confusing day, I can tell already.

Mr. Carl. I am so pleased to introduce Chairwoman Bryan.
It is truly an honor to have you here today. I haven't had
a chance to speak to you yet. Hopefully, you will hang around a
little while.
Your leadership both on the Tribal Council and as a Tribe
CEO demonstrates your dedication to improving the lives of the
tribal citizens and their families. Your efforts benefit not
only your community, but also contribute significantly to the
well-being and the prosperity of the state of Alabama. And we
appreciate that, we truly do.
We have worked on so many things together, I feel like we
are brother and sister.
Your leadership ensures that the voices of Indian Country
are heard, and that necessary means are taken to safeguard
Native-owned lands and uphold tribal rights. Your presence here
to support this important bill highlights the Tribe's
commitment to economic growth and prosperity for both the
Poarch Nation and for all the Nations.
Thank you for the Tribe's tireless effort and dedication to
make a positive impact on our state economy and lives of the
residents.
I think that is it. Thank you for being here.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Mr. Carl.
Our final witness of the day is the Honorable David
Rabbitt, District 2 Supervisor, Sonoma County Board of
Supervisors, Sonoma, California.
We are going to go ahead and take our recess now, and when
we come back we will have Mr. Carl introduce his bill, and then
we will go directly to the witness statements. Thank you.
The Committee is in recess until we finish our voting,
which will probably be in a half an hour, I believe. Thank you.

Ms. Hageman. The hearing of the Subcommittee on Indian and
Insular Affairs will come back into session, and the Chair now
recognizes Mr. Carl from Alabama for 5 minutes to speak on his
legislation.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. JERRY CARL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA
Mr. Carl. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
My bill is pretty simple. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians
Land Act is a bipartisan, bicameral effort aimed to supporting
the Poarch Creek Band of Creek Indians, allowing them to
exercise their sovereignty for the benefit of future
generations.
This Act is not just about legitimizing, it is about
enabling the Tribe to provide essential government services
effective to the citizens. By clarifying and reaffirming the
Tribe's rights under the Indian Reorganization Act, IRA, this
bill will provide stability and a clear path forward for their
community development.
The Tribe, a federally recognized entity based in Atmore,
Alabama, with over 2,700 citizens, has limited trust lands,
hindering the communities growth. This legislation ensures that
the IRA applies to the Tribe, enhances their ability to improve
essential government services, and treating them on par with
other federally recognized tribes.
This bill is not only about supporting the Tribe, but it is
also about the potential to boost Alabama economy by generating
new revenue and creating thousands of jobs. The Poarch Band
Creek Indian Land Act aims at reaffirming the Tribe's long-
standing trust land and brings parties under the IRA.
Since 2009, the Tribe has faced constant litigation over
the trust land, stalled critical developments in housing,
health care, and essential services. This legislation will
ensure that the Tribe is treated equal and with other federally
recognized tribes, allowing them to better provide for their
community.
The widespread support for this bill at both the local and
Federal level underscores its importance. Local governments,
including Elmore County Commission, Escambia County Commission,
Montgomery County Commission, and others have rallied behind
this bill, highlighting the collaboration and spirit that has
unified backing, driving it forwards. This month the Senate
received a hearing on this revision of this bill, sponsored by
Senator Katie Britt, which was a positive response, further
demonstrating the bill's broad appeal and significance.
With that, Madam Chair, I return my time.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Mr. Carl. We will now turn towards
witness testimony.
Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules,
they must limit their oral statements to 5 minutes. But your
entire statements will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, please press the ``talk'' button
on the microphone.
And we use timing lights. When you begin, the light will
turn green. When you have 1 minute left, the light will turn
yellow. And at the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red,
and I will ask you to please complete your statement.
I will allow all witnesses on the panel to testify before
Member questioning.
The Chair now recognizes Ms. Kathryn Isom-Clause for 5
minutes.
STATEMENT OF KATHRYN ISOM-CLAUSE, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY
FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
WASHINGTON, DC
Ms. Isom-Clause. Thank you. Good morning Chair Hageman,
Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and members of the
Subcommittee. My name is Kathryn Isom-Clause, and I am Taos
Pueblo. I serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy
and Economic Development at Indian Affairs at the Department of
the Interior. Thank you for the opportunity to present
testimony on two bills before the Subcommittee today.
Restoring tribal homelands is one of the Administration's
highest priorities. This Administration has repeatedly stressed
the importance of and need for a Carcieri fix. Since the Fiscal
Year 2022 budget request, the President has proposed a sensible
fix to treat all tribes equally in exercising the fundamental
responsibility of placing land into trust for tribes.
The Carcieri v. Salazar decision upset the settled
expectations of both the Department and Indian Country, and led
to confusion about the scope of the Secretary's authority to
acquire land in trust for all federally recognized tribes. As
many tribal leaders have noted, the Carcieri decision is
contrary to existing congressional policy and subjects
federally recognized tribes to unequal treatment under Federal
law.
Since the Carcieri decision, the Department must examine
whether each tribe seeking to have land acquired in trust under
the Indian Reorganization Act, or IRA, was under Federal
jurisdiction in 1934. This analysis is done on a tribe-by-tribe
basis, even for those tribes whose jurisdictional status is
unquestioned. This analysis is time-consuming and costly for
tribes and the Department. The Carcieri decision makes it
likely that the Department will face costly and complex
litigation over whether applicant tribes were under Federal
jurisdiction in 1934. Overall, it has made the Department's
consideration of fee-to-trust applications more complex, and
created additional burdens.
H.R. 6180 would address the impacts that the Carcieri
decision has had on the Poarch Band of Creek Indians by
ensuring that the Tribe has the ability to restore and protect
their tribal homelands under the IRA.
H.R. 1208 would be a universal legislative solution to the
Carcieri decision for all tribes. The language is identical to
the proposal contained in the President's budget request for
several years. This language would clarify Congress' intention
in enacting the IRA: the acquisition of land into trust for all
tribes.
The Department supports H.R. 6180 and H.R. 1208. Tribal
homelands are at the heart of tribal sovereignty, self-
determination, and self-governance. The ability to restore and
protect tribal homelands is an important part of our trust
responsibility, and has been the policy of the United States
for nearly a full century.
The Department urges Congress to enact a legislative fix to
the Carcieri decision for all tribes to eliminate the need for
each tribe to seek separate legislation.
Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and members
of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide
the Department's views on these important bills, and I look
forward to answering any questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Kathryn Isom-Clause, Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Policy and Economic Development for Indian Affairs,
United States Department of the Interior
on H.R. 1208 and H.R. 6180
Good morning, Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and
members of the Subcommittee. My name is Kathryn Isom-Clause, and I am
Taos Pueblo and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Economic
Development for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior
(Department). Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony on
H.R. 1208, ``To amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the
authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for
Indian Tribes, and for other purposes,'' and H.R. 6180, ``To reaffirm
the applicability of the Indian Reorganization Act to the Poarch Band
of Creek Indians, and for other purposes.''
Restoring Tribal homelands is one of this Administration's highest
priorities. This Administration has repeatedly stressed the importance
of and need for a Carcieri fix. Since the FY 2022 Budget Request, the
President has proposed a sensible fix to treat all Tribes equally in
exercising the fundamental responsibility of placing land into trust
for Tribes.
In Carcieri v. Salazar, the U.S. Supreme Court was faced with the
question of whether the Department could acquire land in trust under
section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) on behalf of the
Narragansett Tribe of Rhode Island for a housing project. The Court's
majority noted that section 5 permits the Secretary to acquire land in
trust for federally recognized Tribes that were ``under Federal
jurisdiction'' in 1934. It then determined that the Secretary was
precluded from taking land into trust for the Narragansett Tribe, who
had stipulated that it was not ``under Federal jurisdiction'' in 1934.
The Carcieri decision upset the settled expectations of both the
Department and Indian Country and led to confusion about the scope of
the Secretary's authority to acquire land in trust for all federally
recognized Tribes--including those Tribes that were federally
recognized or restored after the enactment of the Indian Reorganization
Act. As many Tribal leaders have noted, the Carcieri decision is
contrary to existing congressional policy, and has the potential to
subject federally recognized Tribes to unequal treatment under Federal
law.
Since the Carcieri decision, the Department must examine whether
each Tribe seeking to have land acquired in trust under the Indian
Reorganization Act was ``under Federal jurisdiction'' in 1934. This
analysis is done on a Tribe-by-Tribe basis, even for those Tribes whose
jurisdictional status is unquestioned. This analysis may be time-
consuming and costly for Tribes and for the Department. Although the
Department conducts extensive research into this analysis, if the
Department decides to take land into trust and provides notice of its
intent, the Carcieri decision makes it likely that the Department will
face costly and complex litigation over whether applicant Tribes were
under Federal jurisdiction in 1934. Overall, it has made the
Department's consideration of fee-to-trust applications more complex
and created an additional administrative burden for the Federal
government and Tribes related to decisions taking land into trust.
H.R. 6180 would address the impact that the Carcieri decision has
had on the Poarch Band of Creek Indians by deeming that the Band shall
be considered as having been under Federal jurisdiction as of June 18,
1934, for the purposes of the IRA. The bill would also congressionally
reaffirm previous decisions by the Secretary to take land into trust
for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians under IRA authorities.
H.R. 1208 would be a universal legislative solution to the Carcieri
decision for all Tribes. The language is identical to the proposal
contained in the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2025. This
language would clarify Congress's intention in enacting the IRA--the
acquisition of land into trust for Tribes to secure a land base on
which to live and, through self-determination, to develop in their best
interest.
The Department supports H.R. 6180 and H.R. 1208. Tribal homelands
are at the heart of Tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and self-
governance. The power to acquire lands in trust is an important tool
for the United States to effectuate its long-standing policy of
fostering Tribal self-determination. Congress has worked to foster
self-determination for all Tribes and did not intend to limit this
essential tool to only one class of Tribes. The Department has
consistently expressed strong support for a universal legislative
solution to the Carcieri decision for all Tribes. The President's
budgets for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 have proposed a simple and
clean fix to the IRA to ensure the Secretary has the authority to take
land into trust for all Tribes without the need for a complex review of
whether a Tribe was ``under Federal jurisdiction'' in 1934. The
Department urges Congress to enact a legislative fix to the Carcieri
decision for all Tribes to eliminate the need for each Tribe to seek
separate legislation.
Conclusion
Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Department's
views on these important bills. I look forward to answering any
questions that you may have.
______
Questions Submitted for the Record to Ms. Kathryn Isom-Clause, Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Policy and Economic Development
for Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior
Ms. Isom-Clause did not submit responses to the Committee by the
appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.
Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman
Question 1. Has the Department of the Interior denied a land into
trust application in the past 5 years?
1a) If so, which tribe(s) were denied?
1b) If so, for what reason?
Question 2. Has the Department not issued a positive Carcieri
determination in response to any fee to trust application or any other
requests submitted by a tribe?
2a) If so, for which tribe(s)?
2b) Has the Secretary ever waived the 25 CFR Part 151 regulations
pursuant to 25 CFR 1.2?
2c) If so, for which tribe(s) and when has the Secretary waived the
25 CFR Part 151 regulations for a fee to trust application?
Question 3. Has the Department been able to act more quickly on
land-into-trust applications since the Department finalized 25 CFR Part
151 regulations in December 2023?
3a) If yes, please provide the average number of days it takes the
Department to review land-to-trust applications pre- and post-
rulemaking.
3b) Additionally, please provide the longest length of time it took
for a single application to go through the process pre- and post-
rulemaking.
Question 4. Prior to the Department finalizing the new 25 CFR Part
151 regulations, several tribes requested a requirement that the
Department consult with nearby tribes when an applicant tribe is
seeking the acquisition of trust lands in another tribe's ancestral
territory. This request was not implemented.
4a) Considering the importance this Administration has placed on
consultation with tribes, why did the Department not include this level
of consultation?
Question 5. The new 25 CFR Part 151.11 in the regulations governing
trust acquisitions located outside and non-contiguous to an existing
reservation eliminates the previous requirement that the Secretary
increase scrutiny of a trust application as the distance from a tribe's
reservation increases. The reasoning for the elimination explained in
the preamble of the regulations was that the Department no longer
needed to give greater weight to the concerns of State and local
governments now that the Department is going to presume that any land
acquisition benefits an applicant tribe.
5a) Can you explain whether any tribes specifically asked for the
Department to eliminate this increased or heightened scrutiny for
applications as the distance from an existing reservation increases?
5b) If so, can you tell which tribe(s) asked for this requirement
to be eliminated?
Question 6. The new 25 CFR Part 151 regulations governing trust
acquisitions located outside and non-contiguous to an existing
reservation do not require that the applicant tribe show any ancestral
ties to the proposed trust land.
6a) Can you confirm that the new regulations do not require an
applicant tribe have any ancestral ties to the proposed trust land?
6b) Why does the Department believe that tribes should be able to
acquire trust lands that are outside of their ancestral territories?
6c) Can you also confirm whether the new regulations allow a tribe
to acquire lands outside of the state boundaries in which the tribe is
currently located?
If this is allowed, why does the Department believe that a tribe
located in one state should be able to acquire trust lands in another
state?
Question 7. Some tribes have reached contacted the committee
expressing concern that the new 25 CFR Part 151 regulations fail to
include a requirement that the Department consult with nearby tribes
when an applicant tribe is seeking to acquire trust lands in another
tribe's ancestral territory. The preamble to the new regulations
acknowledges that several tribes made this request to include a
consultation requirement with potentially impacted tribes, but the
preamble does not give a clear reason as to why the Department failed
to include this consultation requirement requested by several tribes.
7a) Given that this Administration seems to constantly talk about
how it consults with tribes more than any other Administration, why did
the Department not include a consultation requirement with nearby
tribes who may be impacted by another tribe's application to acquire
trust lands?
7b) Under these new regulations, would tribes in Oklahoma be able
to obtain trust lands in states like North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia and Florida, where some of those tribes were originally
removed?
7c) If so, would the Department be required to notify and consult
with federally recognized tribes in those states?

Ms. Hageman. Thank you very much. I am going to go a little
bit out of order, and I am going to recognize Mr. Cole from
Oklahoma for 5 minutes to speak on his legislation.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM COLE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA
Mr. Cole. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman and Ranking
Member Leger Fernandez. It is a great pleasure for me to be
back in this hearing room, where I spent a lot of years earlier
in my career. I want to thank the Subcommittee for all its hard
work on behalf of Indian Country, and particularly today for
holding this hearing on my legislation, H.R. 1208, which would
amend the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and affirm the
authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into
trust for Indian tribes.
As many of you know, I have been a champion on this issue
for the past 15 years, since the Supreme Court's 2009 Carcieri
v. Salazar decision. As an enrolled member of the Chickasaw
Nation of Oklahoma, I cannot overstate the importance of tribal
sovereignty and the relationships that members of tribes have
with their land, their identity, and their culture.
Unfortunately, many were forcibly removed to unknown areas
after the Indian Removal Act, which often resulted in residing
in lands that provided no opportunity to prosper. However,
Trust Land does offer tribes the ability to expand economic
development and provide for their people.
Tribes use land in trust to build schools, housing, and
health centers in their communities. In fact, in some rural
areas, Tribal Nations are often the largest employers and
health service providers in the community. That is certainly
true in vast stretches of my district. Tribes also rely on
their trust land to produce both renewable and conventional
energy, as well as use the land for agriculture and production
of various types. In addition, trust land allows tribes to
provide essential government services like tribal police and
courts.
However, in 2009 the Supreme Court uprooted 70 years of
precedent, and turned the entire notion of tribal sovereignty
on its head when it ruled that the Indian Reorganization Act
questioned the authority for the Secretary of the Interior to
take land into trust because the Court interpreted the statute
as only applying to the tribes under Federal recognition when
the law was enacted in 1934.
This decision created two different classes of Indian
tribes: those that can have land into trust and those who
cannot. This two-class system is detrimental to so many Native
communities, as it excludes so many of them from exercising
their legal right to act as a sovereign nation and deal
directly with the United States on a government-to-government
basis.
This decision by the Court makes it harder for tribes to
manage and expand their territory, as well as putting millions
of dollars' worth of trust land in legal limbo. This is simply
unacceptable.
Congress is long overdue to correct the law as the Supreme
Court interpreted it when the Court made the Carcieri decision.
Without a legislative fix, tribes' financial resources will be
drained and spent on litigation and disputes between tribes and
state and local governments.
However, those arguing against the legislative fix claim
that this is all about gaming. Let me be clear: this is false.
In fact, out of the 961 total pending fee-to-trust
applications, only 26 are gaming applications; and out of the
4,349 approved applications from 2009 to 2023, only 48 of them
were for gaming purposes. That is 1.1 percent.
Others claim that trust land is undermining states' tax
base. Again, this is false. Trust land is like all other
Federal pieces of land, like military bases or national parks
that are not subject to state taxation. Impact aid and Payments
in Lieu of Taxes address these shortfalls. In reality, trust
land is only 8.75 percent of the total Federal land base.
At the end of the day, there is no reason to oppose the
Carcieri fix legislation. In fact, Chairman Westerman and
Chairwoman Hageman, if Congress fails to act, the standard set
forth in Carcieri v. Salazar will continue to undermine tribal
sovereignty and devastate economic development in Native and
non-Native communities. Resolving any ambiguity in the tribe's
ability to put land into trust, no matter when they were
federally recognized, is vital to protecting tribal interests
and avoiding costly and protracted litigation.
I truly believe this legislation, as well as H.R. 6180,
introduced with my good friend from Alabama and fellow
appropriator, Mr. Carl, are vital to preserving many Native
American communities, and I appreciate the opportunity to
testify in favor of both these bills.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Chairman Cole, thank you for being here today,
and we appreciate your input and your insight into these
important issues.
The Chair will now recognize the Honorable Marshall Pierite
for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. MARSHALL PIERITE, CHAIRMAN, TUNICA-BILOXI
TRIBE OF LOUISIANA, MARKSVILLE, LOUISIANA
Mr. Pierite. Thank you, everyone. Good morning, Chair
Hageman, Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and members of the
Subcommittee. Thank you for the privilege and honor for me to
testify today in support of H.R. 1208. I am Marshall Pierite,
Chairman of the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana.
The Supreme Court's ruling in Carcieri v. Salazar casts
doubt on the sovereign control of tribal lands, and slowed the
Federal Government's ability to place land into trust for the
benefit of tribal governments. This not only harms the ability
of tribes to provide for the welfare of their tribal citizens,
but it also limits the ability of tribes to bring the benefits
of their economic development activities to their non-tribal
neighbors. Until Congress amends the Indian Reorganization Act
in such a way as to correct the problems created by the
Carcieri decision, the successes and benefits brought on by
strong tribal governments will continue to be significantly
diminished.
After a long history of injustice, the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe
and hundreds of other tribes across the country are utilizing
their own resources to purchase land that has been stolen from
them. But we don't seek to continue the cycle of mistrust,
envy, and hard feelings. Instead, we have forged new, positive
relationships with the local non-tribal communities that have
grown up around us.
The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe has created several economic
development enterprises on our trust land. Because we do not
have a tax base to supply the revenue necessary to provide
governmental services to our people, we operate these
businesses to generate revenue for our tribal government. Using
this revenue, we protect and enhance the welfare and culture of
our tribal citizens and their families. These tribal businesses
also provide major benefits for our non-tribal neighbors, and
revenues for our state and local governments in the region.
Our modest tribal enterprises purchased over $10 million
per year from local, non-tribal vendors, and supply wages in
excess of $26 million per year to our mostly non-tribal
employees. This payroll generates state and Federal employment
taxes and increases the local sales and property tax base.
In addition, we have donated over $7 million to local
charities, and have contributed over $30 million to help the
local parish government cover the costs associated with the
additional demands placed on the community from the increased
economic activity.
When the Tribe began looking at gaming as a means for
economic advancement in the early 1990s, unemployment rates in
Avoyelles Parish were as high as 17 percent, almost twice the
national average at the time. Overnight, we went from a
surviving community to a thriving community. After our gaming
facility opened in 1994, the unemployment rate in Avoyelles
Parish has dropped to about the national average. Home prices
increased, new roads were paved, schools improved, parish
government services expanded, and hundreds of new businesses
sprung up in central Louisiana.
We in Indian Country are working hard to diversify our
economies away from gaming and finding new enterprises that can
provide the revenues we need to support our communities. We
hope to create new manufacturing facilities, enter the software
and service industries, and build new, clean energy projects.
However, we first must repurchase the land that was stolen from
us in order to have a place to build these new economic
development projects.
After 30 years of operation of our gaming facility, our
neighbors and state and local government partners have come to
realize that our success is a big contributor to their success.
For the record, I would like to submit letters and
proclamations from the state of Louisiana and several local
area governments recognizing the benefit of our economic
development activities to their own success and prosperity.
The Supreme Court decision in Carcieri was a major step
backward in the walk towards justice, as well as healing. The
ruling confused both tribal governments and non-Indians alike,
slowed economic growth and job creation, and continued to spawn
legal challenges to the recovery of our ancestral homelands for
the good of the Tribe, for the good of Indian children and
generations yet to come, and for the good of our non-Indian
neighbors and the entire nation.
Congress should act to pass H.R. 1208 to amend the Indian
Reorganization Act to conform to this original intended
purpose. Thank you for your time and consideration and
attention to this matter. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Marshall Pierite, Chairman, Tunica-Biloxi Tribe
of Louisiana
on H.R. 6180
Chairman Hageman, Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and distinguished
members of this Subcommittee, thank you for the privilege and honor of
inviting me to testify today. I am Marshall Pierite, Chairman of the
Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana.
The U.S. Supreme Court's 2009 ruling in Carcieri v. Salazar has
cast doubt on the sovereign control of tribal lands and slowed the
federal government's ability to place land into trust for the benefit
of tribal governments. This not only harms the ability of tribes to
provide for the welfare of their citizens but it also hampers the
ability of tribes to bring the benefits of their economic development
activities to their non-Indian neighbors. Until Congress amends the
Indian Reorganization Act in such a way as to correct the problems
created by the Carcieri decision, the successes and benefits brought on
by strong tribal governments will continue to be significantly
diminished.
Although the Senate failed to take up the measure, I was very
pleased that the 117th Congress passed a ``Carcieri Fix'' bill authored
by Rep McCollum and Rep. Cole by a vote of 302-127. I urge this
Committee to move expeditiously to pass this bill and have the House of
Representative send it once again to the Senate for their
consideration.
While I do not want to dwell on the sad history of injustice
against tribes and Native Americans, it is important to recall this
history to illuminate the justice and healing that tribal land
reacquisition can engender. Every tribe has stories of loss, and every
federally recognized tribe once held title to large amounts of land
that has been stolen from them. Ours is merely one example.
At the time of the Louisiana Purchase Treaty in 1803, the Tunica-
Biloxi Tribe held title to well over 50 square miles of land. By 1980,
however, the tribe controlled less than 200 acres. These lands were
stolen in hundreds of small ways, but one example stands out.
In 1841, Tunica Chief Melacon confronted a local landowner whose
work crew was working to systematically move his fence posts onto
Tunica land. As the Chief protested and began removing the fence posts
the landowner shot Chief Melacon in the head in view of several other
tribal citizens and non-Indians. The common view held at the time by
non-Indians was that Native Americans were savages who did not farm
their land ``properly'' and therefore had no right to keep it. As a
result, the killer was thought to be within his rights and never stood
trial.
Against this history of injustice, the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe and
hundreds of other tribes across the country are utilizing their own
resources to purchase land that has been stolen from them. But, we do
not wish to continue the cycle of mistrust, envy and hard feelings.
Instead, we have forged new positive relationships with the local non-
Indian communities that have grown up around us.
Utilizing our status as a sovereign nation, the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe
has created several economic development enterprises. Because we do not
have a suitable tax base to supply the revenue necessary to provide
governmental services to our people, we need these businesses to
generate revenue for the tribal government so that we may protect and
enhance the welfare and culture of our tribal citizens. These
businesses also provide major benefits for our non-Indian neighbors and
revenues for state and local governments in the region. For example,
our tribal enterprises purchase over $10 million per year from local
non-Indian vendors, and supply wages in excess of $26 million dollars
per year to mostly non-Indian employees, resulting in state and federal
employment taxes of over $2 million per year. In addition, we have
donated over $7 million to local charities and have paid the local
Parish government over $30 million to help cover the costs associated
with the additional demands placed on the community from the increased
economic activity.
When the Tribe began looking at gaming as a means for economic
advancement in the early 1990s, unemployment rates in Avoyelles Parish
were as high as 17 percent--almost twice the national average at the
time. Local governments struggled to provide even the most basic
services, and it looked as if there was nothing on the horizon that
might change the dismal forecast for the area.
Today, I am proud to say that the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe employs over
1,000 people--the vast majority of them non-Indian. After our gaming
facility opened in 1994, the direct and indirect jobs created by the
Tribe caused the unemployment rate in Avoyelles Parish to drop to about
6 percent. Home prices increased, new roads were paved, schools
improved, Parish government services expanded, and hundreds of new
businesses sprung up in Central Louisiana. Of course, our tribal
citizens who had previously suffered greatly from economic hardship
were helped as well, but the full story is one of renewal for the
entire region and all of our citizens and neighbors.
30 years ago, prior to the opening of our gaming operation, the
largest private employer in our area was a textile manufacturing
facility. That facility, along with hundreds of others like it, closed
when U.S. manufacturers found less expensive options overseas, leaving
hundreds of people in Central Louisiana without work. The community was
in great distress and there were no prospects on the horizon with
potential to renew the local economy. Today, I am happy to say that the
Tribe is working with local economic development organizations to
reopen that facility to supply American-made textiles to tribal hotels
and others who have a mandate to buy American-made goods. We will re-
create those lost jobs and use this facility to launch new businesses
and innovations.
My tribe, and hundreds of other tribal governments across the
country, are working hard to diversify our economies away from gaming
and find new enterprises that can provide the revenues we need to
support our communities. We hope to create new manufacturing
facilities, enter the software and services industries, and build new
clean energy projects. However, we must first repurchase the land that
was stolen from us in order to have a place to build these new economic
development projects.
Further, in order to take advantage of the benefits of our
sovereignty, this land must be added back under the federal trust
status from which it was originally removed. Often, purchasing the
tribe's original land is not an option. In some cases, this is because
the tribe was forced to move a long way from their traditional
homelands. In other cases, the current owners are simply not willing to
sell, or the land is no longer suitable for the intended purpose due to
other development, environmental damage, or any number of other
reasons. Regardless of the location of the repurchased land, the
inability of tribes to swiftly have these lands placed into trust by
the U.S. Department of the Interior has dramatically decreased the
ability of tribal governments to create new jobs for our own tribal
citizens and our neighbors. We realize that we cannot fully recreate
what was lost. We can strive, however, to create a better world and
better lives for our children.
In light of the complicated and often brutal history of
relationships between tribes and their neighbors, the level of acrimony
we often hear from non-Indians who are opposed to tribal economic
development projects is not entirely surprising. What I hope all of us
will come to recognize, however, is that tribes and their neighbors are
in this together. I am hopeful that the lessons we are learning today
will yield a new spirit of cooperation, and that non-Indians who are
fearful of tribal economic development will come to realize that what
is good for our tribal communities is good for them as well.
After 30 years of operation of our gaming facility in Central
Louisiana, our neighbors and state and local governmental partners have
come to realize that our success is a big contributor to their success.
To demonstrate this support, I would like to submit for the record
letters and proclamations from the State of Louisiana, and several
local area governments who recognize the benefit of our economic
development activities to their own success and prosperity.
The Supreme Court decision in Carcieri v. Salazar was a major step
backward in the process of justice and healing. The ruling confused
both tribal governments and non-Indians alike, slowed economic growth
and job creation, and continues to spawn legal impediments to the
repatriation of Indian homelands. For the good of tribes, for the good
of Indian children and generations yet to come, and for the good of our
non-Indian neighbors and the nation as a whole, Congress should act to
pass H.R. 1208 to amend the Indian Reorganization Act to conform to its
original intended purpose.

AVOYELLES PARISH POLICE JURY
Marksville, LA
To: The House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indigenous People:
On behalf of the Avoyelles Parish Police Jury, I am writing to
share the profound, positive impact that tribal economic development
has on our community. As a life-long resident of Avoyelles, I have
observed first-hand how the initiatives by the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of
Louisiana have significantly contributed to the economic, social, and
cultural vitality of our region.
Economic development projects led by the Tribe, such as the Paragon
Casino Resort, have become pillars of our local economy. Not only did
it generate substantial revenue, but also create employment
opportunities for hundreds of community members. Currently, the Paragon
Casino Resort employs over 700 individuals, offering stable, well-
paying jobs that support families and stimulate local economic
activity. These jobs are crucial for many, providing a pathway to
financial security and professional growth.
The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe also exemplifies a strong commitment to
social responsibility. Through generous monetary donations, the Tribe
has significantly contributed to our critical infrastructure that
benefits the entire parish.
The Tribe's economic ventures serve as a driving force for broader
regional development. The Paragon Casino Resort, for example, attracts
visitors from across the state and beyond, boosting tourism and
supporting local businesses. Hotels, restaurants, and retail
establishments in the area benefit from the influx of visitors,
creating a ripple effect that stimulates further economic growth and
diversification.
The long-term vision and strategic planning demonstrated by the
Tunica-Biloxi Tribe will ensure that their economic development
initiatives are sustainable and beneficial for future generations.
Their approach not only addresses immediate needs but also lays the
foundation for continued prosperity and community resilience.
In summary, tribal economic development has a multifaceted and
profoundly positive impact on our community. It drives economic growth,
provides vital employment opportunities, supports public services,
enriches our cultural landscape, and creates a spirit of collaboration
and mutual benefit. The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe's dedication to economic
and social progress serves as a model of how strategic development can
uplift and transform a community.
I am confident that the continued success of the Tribe's economic
initiatives will lead to even greater benefits for our community, and I
look forward to supporting and celebrating their efforts in the years
to come.
Best regards,
Darrell G. Wiley,
President

MARKSVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
June 11, 2024
House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples
U.S. House of Representatives
1324 Longworth House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515
Dear Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:
As President of the Marksville Chamber of Commerce, I am writing to
express our strong support for the Carcieri Fix bill (H.R. 1208). This
legislation is crucial for the sustained economic development and
growth of tribal communities, and it holds significant positive
implications for our broader community in Marksville and the
surrounding regions.
Chairman Pierite's upcoming testimony on June 26th is a pivotal
moment for highlighting the far-reaching benefits that tribal economic
initiatives, such as our local casino, bring to our community. The
economic contributions of the tribal enterprises extend beyond the
boundaries of tribal lands, creating jobs, fostering local business
growth, and enhancing the quality of life for residents.
The Marksville Chamber of Commerce has witnessed firsthand the
transformative impact of tribal economic development. The casino has
become a cornerstone of our local economy, providing employment
opportunities for hundreds of individuals, including many non-tribal
members. These jobs offer stable incomes, benefits, and professional
growth opportunities, which are vital for the economic stability of our
community.
Additionally, the casino and other tribal enterprises contribute
significantly to the local tax base. These contributions support public
services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure
improvements, benefiting all residents of our region. The presence of
the casino has also spurred the growth of ancillary businesses,
including hotels, restaurants, and retail establishments, further
diversifying and strengthening our local economy.
In conclusion, the Marksville Chamber of Commerce fully supports
Chairman Pierite's testimony and the passage of H.R. 1208. We urge the
Subcommittee and Congress to recognize the substantial and positive
impact that tribal economic development has on our community and to
support the Carcieri Fix bill.
Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.
Sincerely,
Melissa Goudeau,
President

To Whom It May Concern:
I'm writing this letter in support of The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of
Louisiana. As a lifelong resident and active member of Avoyelles
Parish, I have observed and benefited from the impact that the tribal
economic development has on our community. They have significantly
contributed to the economic, social, and cultural development of our
region.
Through the combination of both Tribal and Paragon Casino Resort,
they have become the pillars of our local economy. This initiative
generates a substantial amount of revenue and employment opportunities
for hundreds of community members. Currently, the Paragon Casino Resort
employs over 700 employees, offering stable, well-paying jobs that
support families and stimulate the local economy.
The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe also exemplifies a strong commitment to
philanthropy and social responsibility. Beyond providing job
opportunities, the Tribe and Paragon Casino have helped to fund many of
our schools' activities such as providing a space for teachers to meet,
offering recognition and prizes for teachers during Teachers'
Appreciation Week, providing scholarships, funds for needed programs in
the schools and assisting to purchase pieces of equipment for our
athletic department. We are so grateful for all that the Tribe and
Paragon Casino have supported the school system with.
In summary, tribal economic development has a multifaceted and
profoundly positive impact on our community. It drives economic growth,
provides vital employment opportunities, and supports public services.
I am confident that the continued success of the Tribe's economic
initiatives will lead to even greater benefits for our community, and I
look forward to supporting and celebrating their efforts in the years
to come.
Sincerely,
Thelma J. Prater,
Assistant Superintendent of Schools

Questions Submitted for the Record to the Hon. Marshall Pierite,
Chairman & CEO, Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana
Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman
Question 1. Your written testimony discussed the complicated
history tribal nations can have with their neighboring localities. You
also mentioned how your tribe has received support from the state of
Louisiana and several local governments recognizing the benefit of the
economic development the tribe has brought to the area.
1a) Can you expand on how your tribe was able to build and maintain
these relationships?
Answer. The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe has built strong working
relationships with the state and local governments through many years
of hard work to establish trust and an understanding of mutual respect.
At every opportunity, we discuss and demonstrate how benefits to the
Tribe result in benefits to our non-tribal neighbors. This has been a
long journey which required tribal and non-tribal leaders to put aside
the long history of injustice, forgive past wrongdoings and recognize
the power of hope and healing.
1b) How can Congress help to promote congenial relationships?
Answer. Congress can do its part by protecting tribal governments
from encroachment from state and local governments and recognizing the
history of how tribes lost their land, while also extolling the virtues
of tribal economic development for the benefits it brings to both
tribal and non-tribal communities. The balance of power between tribes
and their non-tribal neighbors has always been overwhelmingly skewed
toward the non-tribal communities. Congress can provide the necessary
backstop to appropriately balance these rights. Through this renewed
justice, and the power of economic development, tribes can demonstrate
mutual benefits which can then spawn a renewed and positive
relationship. The good news is that we have seen this play out over the
last 30+ years of tribal gaming. The old doubts and fears from the non-
tribal community have proven to be largely unfounded and the benefits
of tribal landownership overwhelmingly positive for everyone. Passing
H.R. 1208 would help in providing a pathway to these more positive
relationships.
Question 2. Are there lands your tribe is currently seeking to have
taken into trust?
Answer. Yes. The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe is continually working to
regain the land that was illegally taken from us. We do so primarily by
buying land from willing sellers and then working to have that land
placed into trust by the federal government.
2a) If so, how long has this process taken and have you seen any
opposition to these applications?
Answer. The timeline for the land to trust process has varied over
the years for numerous reasons--mostly due to backlogs at the
Department that occur when political decisions are made by various
administrations to change the process, increase scrutiny, or reduce or
delay funding for the offices within the department charged with
advising the Secretary on specific land to trust determinations. We are
pleased that the backlog has been considerably decreased and
applications are now being processed in a more timely manner. At points
in our recent history, it has taken many years in the process to gain
trust approval. The Department's new regulations are certain to further
streamline the process.
Question 3. Is there anything else you would like to add to your
testimony on how the Department of the Interior's fee-to-trust process
could be reformed to benefit tribes and state and local governments?
Answer. It is important to note that when a tribe seeks to have the
federal government take land into trust, the tribal government might or
might not have immediate plans for the use of that land. Moreover, in
much the same way that local governments operate, elected tribal
governments might change their land use plans over time. Therefore, it
should be recognized that the request from Mr. Rabbitt in his testimony
to the Subcommittee on this point is largely unworkable. While it might
be possible for tribal and non-tribal area governments to agree on a
path forward for immediate land use planning, such agreements might not
survive local or tribal elections and resulting changes in governing
decisions. Land use negotiations between tribes and non-tribal
governments, therefore, should not be used as a gateway for the federal
government to make land to trust decisions that last in perpetuity. It
is also important to note that when land was stolen from tribes
(sometimes at the end of a gun barrel) tribes were not offered the same
level of comment options as the current DOI regulations provide to
local governments. That said, once justice is restored through tribal
land re-acquisition, local and tribal governments can and do work
together for their and mutual benefit.
Question 4. The new 25 CFR Part 151 regulations governing lands
into trust provide no geographic boundaries within which tribes can
acquire trust lands, fails to include any requirement that a tribe have
ancestral ties to the proposed trust land, eliminates the previous
requirement that the Secretary use heightened scrutiny the further a
tribe goes from its existing reservation to seek new trust lands, and
failed to include a consultation requirement with nearby tribes for any
new trust land acquisitions.
4a) Given this and that Louisiana has 4 federally recognized
tribes, does the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe support the portions of the new
regulations that eliminate the heightened scrutiny for applications
that seek to acquire lands far from a tribe's existing reservation?
Answer. It is important to note that the land that was illegally
taken from tribes is, in most cases, no longer accessible by tribes to
be taken back into possession nor to be taken into trust. Much of what
can be considered ``tribal homelands'' is now developed and might only
be available for purchase in very small parcels if at all. So, in order
for tribes to reestablish a meaningful land base, they must often look
to areas that might not align to what was lost, say, in the 1800s or
earlier. Moreover, federal policy has, over the last 200 years, made a
complete mess of tribal lands. Tribes have not only had their land
stolen, but they have also been moved by force in groups, and their
citizens have been incentivized under false pretense to move
individually, often hundreds of miles away from their traditional
homelands. The use of the term ``ancestral homelands'' is also
problematic as it does not provide a specific time frame for ancestry.
Given that many tribal citizens were forced or coerced to leave their
homes, do these ``new'' areas where they currently reside constitute
``ancestral homelands'' if they have now been there for 50 years, or
100 years? What happens in another 50 years once these families have
been in those locations for 150 years or more. When is an area
considered ``ancestral?''
4b) Would you want the Interior Secretary to be mandated to consult
with you if any other tribe applies for trust lands within your
ancestral territory in the State?
Answer. Of course, the Department should and does take into account
the concerns of other tribes and state and local governments--
especially when taking land into trust apart from an existing
reservation. Tribes and local governments are provided an opportunity
to raise concerns in the trust process. Moreover, as taking land into
trust is a ``major federal action'' other laws apply including the
National Historic Preservation Act which provides rights in the process
for tribes to protect their sacred places on and off current
reservation land.

Ms. Hageman. Thank you for your testimony. The Chair now
recognizes the Honorable Stephanie Bryan for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. STEPHANIE BRYAN, TRIBAL CHAIR, POARCH
CREEK INDIANS, ATMORE, ALABAMA
Ms. Bryan. Good morning Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger
Fernandez, Chairman Cole, and members of the Subcommittee. My
name is Stephanie Bryan, and I am honored to serve as the Chair
and CEO for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians located in lower
Alabama.
We appreciate this opportunity to testify, but most
importantly we thank Congressman Jerry Carl for introducing
this bill. We also thank the counties and cities that border
our trust lands for their partnership and support.
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians has been a leading
advocate to clarify that the Indian Reorganization Act applies
to all federally recognized tribes. We offer our full support
of Chairman Cole's bill, H.R. 1208, which would accomplish this
goal. We will continue to work to pass a national fix, but our
Tribe is taking a parallel approach by working with our
Congressional Delegation to clarify that the IRA applies to our
Tribe.
For decades, Poarch leaders have balanced the desire to
preserve our Tribe's history and culture with the need to
rebuild our community and provide basic services to our
citizens. Today, we are blessed to be able to provide our
tribal citizens and neighbors with essential services that
include police, fire protection, health care, elder care,
education, and infrastructure.
We have made careful decisions about how best to use our
resources and property, but we have limited trust lands, and we
can't meet the growing needs for housing and other basic
services for our citizens. For example, in 2018 it became clear
that we needed to expand our Boys and Girls Club. There was no
more buildable trust land, and we were forced to fill ponds
around the community center on existing trust lands, which
added $1 million to our construction cost.
We are not alone. Tribal governments nationwide have a
shortage of usable trust land, and seek to acquire trust lands
to serve their citizens.
The Supreme Court's 2009 Carcieri decision upended the
Interior Department's land-into-trust process. That decision
placed a cloud of uncertainty over tribal trust lands, impeding
investment and economic development in Indian Country. These
lawsuits have cost American taxpayers a significant amount of
money.
The Interior Department and DOJ have had to defend not only
our trust lands, but also the lands of other tribes. The Tribe
alone has spent more than $10 million to defend ourselves from
legal challenges attacking the status of our trust lands.
Thankfully, every court reviewing these frivolous cases against
us has upheld the status of our lands, which the Interior
Department placed in trust decades ago. However, these lawsuits
have taken a real toll, and that is why our Tribe is seeking a
legislative solution that will provide us with much-needed
certainty.
The bill affirms that the IRA applies to our Tribe, and
brings us into parity with other federally recognized tribes.
This bill has strong support from the Alabama Congressional
Delegation and the cities and counties that surround us. I
respectfully ask the Full Committee to mark up H.R. 6180, and
please pass this bill this year.
On behalf of our Tribe, I am honored to speak to you today,
and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Stephanie Bryan, Chairwoman, Poarch Band
of Creek Indians
on H.R. 6180
Good afternoon, Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger Fernandez, and
Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Stephanie Bryan, and I am
honored to serve as the Chair and CEO of the Poarch Band of Creek
Indians. Thank you for this opportunity to testify today about H.R.
6180, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Lands Act. On behalf of the
Tribal Council, I extend our great thanks to Rep. Carl for introducing
this bill.
History of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians
I want to begin by sharing some history about the Poarch Band of
Creek Indians. ``The Poarch Band of Creeks of today originated in the
aboriginal and historical Creek Nation.'' \1\ At the time of our
Nation's founding, the Creek Confederacy governed an expansive
territory. Creek lands--guaranteed in the Treaty of New York in 1790--
covered most of modern-day Georgia and Alabama, as well as parts of
Florida. That territory was reduced twice via treaty over the ensuing
two decades, and then again as a result of the War of 1812, when the
Creek Confederacy was divided between those who joined with the British
and those who remained friendly to the United States. After the war,
however, the United States continued to recognize land rights of Creeks
who had allied with it. In 1814, the United States granted those Creeks
the right to occupy individual reservations in Southern Alabama under
the Treaty of Fort Jackson.\2\

(Operations), U.S. Dep't of Interior, to Assistant Secretary--Indian
Affairs, on Recommendation and Summary of Evidence for Proposed Finding

pursuant to 25 C.F.R. Sec. 83, at 3 (Dec. 29, 1983).
\2\ 7 Stat. 120 (Aug. 9, 1814).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little time passed before the United States' policy toward the
Creeks began to change. In 1817, Congress provided that fee simple
patents to Creek reservation lands should be issued upon the death of
the original reservation grantees. Moreover, in what came to be known
as the Trail of Tears, the United States decided to pursue a policy of
forced removal of the Creeks and other tribal nations in the South and
Eastern United States. Thousands of Native children, women, and men
died on these forced marches to the Indian Territory--which is now the
state of Oklahoma. Our Tribe avoided this fate. Like other Indian
nations located in the South and East today, we were able to do so only
by fleeing into remote homelands.
Specifically, our tribe found refuge and settled on the McGhee
reserve, located now in the Community of Poarch, Alabama. A Creek
leader, Lynn McGhee, had been granted a reserve pursuant to the 1814
Treaty. Under the terms of the Treaty, McGhee and his descendants
retained the right to the reserve as long as they occupied it and were
to be ``protected by and subject to the laws of the United States.''
\3\ This land was ``technically individually owned.'' \4\ ``n
practice,'' however, `` were usable by the entire
community'' that ``settled there'' during the removal era.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike other Creek reservations established in the wake of the War
of 1812, the McGhee reserve was held in trust and never fee patented.
As noted, in 1817 Congress passed a statute that generally removed
Creek reservations from trust status. McGhee, however, had been unable
to enter his claim for a reservation before the deadline set by the
1814 Treaty of Fort Jackson because of a war injury. For this reason,
Congress subsequently acted specifically on behalf of McGhee, granting
him the right to select a reservation under the terms of the 1814
Treaty after the deadline. In so doing, Congress opted not to subject
the McGhee reserve to the 1817 Act.
In the early 1900s, the Department of Justice confirmed the McGhee
reserve's trust status. Specifically, in 1912, the federal government,
acting in its role as trustee, sued a timber company for trespass on
the McGhee reserve. This action was accompanied by a series of internal
memoranda within the Department of Justice, which analyzed whether the
land remained in trust and concluded that it did.\6\

Johnson, at 6-7 (Apr. 23, 1913).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite this confirmation of trust status, the Government Land
Office improperly issued a fee patent to the McGhee heirs in 1924.
However, because these fee grants were unlawful, they did not erode the
protections owed to our Tribe. Later analysis by the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs concluded that the descendants of McGhee ``who to this
day occupy his reserve continue to be `protected by and subject to the
laws of the United States.' '' \7\

In 1984, after years of living in obscurity and abject poverty, the
Reagan Administration reaffirmed the status of the Poarch Band of Creek
Indians as a federally recognized Tribe. The United States acknowledged
that Poarch has been an autonomous, distinct tribal community for
centuries, that we have maintained governing authority over our tribal
citizens, and that our citizens descend from a historical Indian Tribe.
We remain based on the McGhee reserve, which was never
disestablished.\8\

Our Tribe is also a successor to the pre-Removal Creek treaties and
as such we have at all times since then enjoyed a treaty relationship
with the United States. Our ancestors were part of the Creek Nation
before the removal era. We were recognized by the United States as
autonomous, and our ancestors signed the pre-removal Creek treaties as
a subset of the Creek Confederacy.\9\ The Department of the Interior
has accordingly recognized that we are a ``successor of the Creek
Nation of Alabama prior to its removal.'' \10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledgement as a federally recognized Indian Tribe was a
turning point for our government. In 1984, we began working with the
Interior Department to establish a small land base for our community.
Using authority provided in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the
Tribe worked with Interior to place approximately 389 acres of fee
lands into trust from 1985 to 1995. The majority of these trust lands
(229.5 acres) were approved by Interior on April 18, 1985.\11\

(50 Fed. Reg. 15502 (April 18, 1985)), and Poarch Band of Creeks-
Establishment of Reservation: Correction (50 Fed. Reg. 19813 (May 10,
1985)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past four decades, Poarch Creek leaders have balanced the
preservation of our Tribe's history and culture with the need to
rebuild our community. Today, we are blessed to be able to provide our
tribal citizens and neighbors with essential services, including
functioning infrastructure, police and fire protection, healthcare, and
eldercare.
The Tribe has developed positive working relationships with our
neighboring counties of Elmore, Escambia, and Montgomery. We have
engaged in dozens of MOUs and intergovernmental agreements with these
and other local governments that have helped upgrade fire and rescue
stations, conduct miles of road repairs and upgrades including lighting
installations, provide resources to improve health care and education,
and much more. We are also the first responders for 15 miles north and
south of the Reservation on Interstate 65. These agreements and
services far exceed revenue from any potential tax receipts these
neighboring governments would receive if our lands remained in fee. As
Alabama Natives and Alabama Neighbors, we are driven to give back to
these communities by our belief that working together and giving back
makes us all stronger, together. We are proud that our neighboring
Counties, mayors, and state representatives have pledged their support
for H.R. 6180, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act. Attached to
my written testimony is a letter of support from our neighboring local
governments.
We have been able to improve the economic condition of not only
Poarch, Alabama, where we are headquartered, but also in other parts of
the State. Our Tribe operates more than 40 companies that do work
worldwide and generate 9,000 jobs. I am proud to say that we generate
more than 4,000 jobs for families in Alabama. Beyond these enterprises,
we also welcome people to visit our lands, especially the Magnolia
Branch Wildlife Reserve, which welcomes 30,000 visitors annually. It is
one of the prettiest places you can imagine to go fishing, tubing,
horseback riding, and camping.
We honor our blessings by giving back to local non-profits and
community organizations. We donate nearly $8 million annually to local
governments, educational institutions, health care systems, and other
philanthropic causes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to
give back to the State of Alabama with a $500,000 donation to the
Alabama Department of Health for COVID-19 vaccine storage and
administration. In fact, knowing how important protecting rural Alabama
is to us, the State asked us to run clinics to vaccinate rural
Alabamians.
We have made careful decisions about how to best use our resources
and property. However, we have a limited land base, and at this point,
we are no longer able to meet the growing housing and many other needs
of our nearly 2,900 citizens. For example, when it became clear we
needed to expand our Boys and Girls club in 2018, we were forced to
fill in the ponds around our community center at a cost of more than $1
million because there was no more buildable trust land.
As our population ages, the Tribal Council has prioritized
providing the best healthcare and eldercare available. We have an
Assisted Living Facility (ALF) but will soon need a nursing home. We do
not have the current land available to provide this service, and the
passage of H.R. 6180 will allow us to make this dream of a nursing home
a reality. As our community grows, enhancing our governing land base is
a not only a need, it is a must.
We are not alone. Tribal governments nationwide have a shortage of
usable land, and many--like us--have made land restoration a priority.
The Indian Reorganization Act: Restoration of the Tribal Government
Land Base
Congress has repeatedly examined the history of tribal government
land tenure, documenting impacts of the federal policies of Removal,
Allotment and forced Assimilation, and Termination, all of which
displaced many tribal governments, leaving some tribes completely
landless. Former Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Chairman Byron
Dorgan acknowledged that ``Tribes ceded close to 200 million acres of
land during the treaty-making and removal periods prior to 1881. Tribes
lost an additional 90 million acres through the Allotment period
between 1881 and 1934.'' \12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The late Professor William Rice testified that:
By 1934, Indian landownership had been reduced . . . to
48,000,000 acres. But this did not tell the whole story. Even
these shocking figures were misleading. Of the 48,000,000
remaining acres, some 20,000,000 acres were in unallotted
reservations, another 20,000,000 acres were desert or semi-
desert lands, and some 7,000,000 were in fractionated heirship
status awaiting sale to non-Indians.\13\

\13\ See The IRA--75 Years Later: Renewing our Commitment to
Restore Tribal Homelands and Promote Self-Determination, S. Hrg. 112-
113 at 14 and fn.12 (June 23, 2011) (statement of Prof. William Rice,
citing Indian Affairs Committee hearings on the ``Wheeler-Howard Indian
Reorganization Act'') (online at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/
CHRG-112shrg68389/pdf/CHRG-112shrg68389.pdf).
The policy of forced Allotment and Assimilation (1881-1934) sought
to destroy tribal governments by mandating the division of communally
held tribal government homelands to individual tribal members. After
allotments were made, remaining Indian lands were deemed ``surplus''
and opened to settlement. As noted above, the Allotment policy resulted
in the taking of more than 90 million acres of Indian lands, and led to
the checkerboard landownership of many tribal communities and the land
fractionation problems that continue to this day. Allotment and
Assimilation also devastated tribal government economies, tribal
culture, and Indigenous social systems.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Allotment and its authorized takings of ``surplus'' Indian
lands stripped tribal governments of untold natural resources. In
addition, the policy of Assimilation authorized the government to take
Indian children from their homes, forcing them into federal boarding
schools where they were forbidden from speaking their language or
practicing their religion. We commend the Committee for advancing S.
1723, which would establish a Truth and Healing Commission on Indian
Boarding School Policies, and strongly support its final passage.
Since the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in Carcieri v. Salazar,
this Subcommittee and your Senate counterpart have also frequently
examined the history, purposes, and impacts of the Indian
Reorganization Act of 1934 (``IRA''). The primary purposes of the IRA
were to put a stop to the unilateral allotment of Indian lands and to
authorize the Interior Department to rebuild the tribal government land
base.\15\ Section 5 of the IRA provides:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 5101 et seq.
The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, in his
discretion, to acquire through purchase, relinquishment, gift,
exchange, or assignment, any interest in lands, water rights or
surface rights to lands, within or without existing
reservations, including trust or otherwise restricted
allotments whether the allottee be living or deceased, for the
purpose of providing land for Indians.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5108.
The IRA also sought to limit the often-unchecked authority of the
Interior Department over local tribal government decision-making. To
reverse the Allotment policy's efforts to undermine Tribal governments,
Section 16 of the IRA sought to empower Tribes to organize their own
governing structures by establishing Tribal constitutions and bylaws
that fostered the enactment and enforcement of Tribal laws to govern
their lands.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ See The IRA--75 Years Later: Renewing our Commitment to
Restore Tribal Homelands and Promote Self-Determination, S. Hrg. 112-
113 at 15-16 (June 23, 2011) (statement of Prof. William Rice, quoting
Indian Affairs Commissioner and architect of the IRA, John Collier, in
his testimony before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in the run-
up to passage of the IRA: ``Paralleling this basic purpose [of
reversing the allotment system] is another purpose just as basic. The
bill stands on two legs. At present the Indian Bureau is a czar. It is
an autocrat. It is an autocrat checked here and there by enactments of
Congress; but, in the main, Congress has delegated to the Indian Office
plenary control over Indian matters. It is a highly centralized
autocratic absolutism. Furthermore, it is a bureaucratic absolutism.'')

CHRG-112shrg68389.pdf).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For 75 years, from 1934 to 2009, the Department of the Interior
restored approximately 8 million acres of tribal government fee lands
into trust status. Interior Departments of presidents of both political
parties used the IRA to place land into trust for federally recognized
Indian tribes regardless of whether they were formally acknowledged as
a tribe before or after 1934. Tribes have used their trust lands to
build schools, health centers and housing to serve their communities.
These lands are also used for tribal enterprises to promote economic
development in mostly rural communities that are all too often
underserved and overlooked.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ There is a common misperception that the Interior Department's
fee to trust process serves to expand Indian gaming. The IRA authorizes
Interior to place tribal government-owned fee land into trust and
nothing more. Nothing in the IRA authorizes or regulates Indian gaming.
The question of whether Indian trust lands are eligible to be used for
gaming is governed solely by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the
National Indian Gaming Commission and Interior Department regulations
developed to implement that separate law. Admittedly, some Tribes do
submit land into trust applications for gaming purposes. However, those
relatively few applications must not only meet the requirements of the
IRA's Part 151 regulations to have land placed into trust, but they
must also separately meet the requirements of the Interior Department's
Part 292 IGRA regulations in order to use the lands for gaming
purposes. As former Assistant Secretary Kevin Washburn noted, of the
1,300 trust acquisitions submitted to Interior from 2008-2013, fewer
than 15 were for gaming purposes. See testimony of Kevin Washburn
before the House Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Indian and
Alaska Native Affairs, at 2 (Sept. 19, 2013) (online at https://
naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/washburn testimony09-19-
13.pdf).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2009 Carcieri v. Salazar Decision and its Impacts
The Supreme Court, in Carcieri v. Salazar, reversed these 75 years
of practice and precedent. The Court tied the Interior Secretary's IRA
Section 5 authority to place land into trust for Indian tribes to the
Act's definition of ``Indian'', which provides that:
The term `Indian' as used in this Act shall include all persons
of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian
tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are
descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing
within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and
shall further include all other persons of one-half or more
Indian blood.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5129 (emphasis added).
The Court held ``that the term `now under Federal jurisdiction' in
 unambiguously refers to those tribes that were under the
federal jurisdiction of the United States when the IRA was enacted in
1934.'' However, Court's decision provided no guidance to determine the
meaning of the phrase ``under federal jurisdiction'', and nothing in
the text of the IRA or its legislative history defines that phrase.
In the first Carcieri-related hearing before Congress, former
Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Dorgan acknowledged--``I just
want to say that I am concerned about the court's decision in Carcieri
and the impact it may have on those tribes that were recognized after
1934. I believe that Congress will likely need to act to clarify this
issue for tribes and to ensure that the land in trust process is
available to all tribes regardless of when they were recognized.'' \20\
He predicted that the decision could impact hundreds of tribes by:
slowing the land-into-trust process; leading to costly litigation over
the status of Indian lands; complicating criminal jurisdiction in
Indian Country; hindering economic development; and creating two
classes of Indian tribes.\21\ Sadly, each of these predictions have
come true.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Costly and Time-Consuming Litigation
We know the effects of the Carcieri decision all too well. Our
Tribe has been forced to defend the status of our trust lands in
several federal court cases. In 2013, the State of Alabama relied on a
Carcieri-based argument in seeking to enjoin federally approved gaming
on Poarch Creek trust lands. The United States, while not named as a
defendant in the proceedings, filed amicus curiae briefs in support of
the Tribe's successful motion to dismiss the case and again when the
State unsuccessfully appealed dismissal of its claims to the Eleventh
Circuit Court of Appeals.\22\ While both the trial and appellate courts
rejected the State of Alabama's Carcieri challenge, the Tribe was
forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and the federal
government was forced to devote limited funding an attorney resources
to secure that result.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\22\ Alabama v. PCI Gaming Auth., 801 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, the Tribe was forced to file its own federal lawsuit in
2015 in response to the Escambia County, Alabama, tax assessor's
attempt to assess state taxes on Poarch Creek trust lands in erroneous
reliance on the Carcieri decision. The Tribe again prevailed before the
federal district court and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, with
the United States filing an appellate amicus curiae brief in support of
the Tribe's position.\23\ And once again, Poarch Creek and the United
States were forced to devote limited, valuable time and financial
resources to litigating spurious claims that resulted directly from the
uncertainty generated by the Carcieri decision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\23\ Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Hildreth, 656 F. App'x 934
(11th Cir. 2016).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are but two examples. We have seen specious Carcieri
arguments raised in numerous other cases filed in state and federal
courts, many of which have nothing whatsoever to do with the trust
status of Poarch Creek lands, but where the Carcieri argument is
nonetheless raised either out of lack of understanding or in an attempt
to extort an unwarranted settlement from the Tribe.
The impacts of Carcieri of course go far beyond our Tribe. Many
dozens of cases making Carcieri-based arguments have been filed in
federal and state courts by state and local governments and individuals
throughout the United States. In addition, the Interior Board of Indian
Appeals has been bogged down for more than 15 years now with Carcieri-
related challenges to the BIA's IRA fee to trust decisions.\24\ It is
difficult to fathom the hours and legal fees related to these cases,
not only to the tribal governments forced to defend the attacks on
their land, but also to the teams of attorneys at the U.S. Department
of the Interior's Solicitor's Office and the U.S. Department of
Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thankfully, every court reviewing the issue has upheld the Interior
Department's decisions to place our land in trust. However, these
lawsuits have taken a toll, and that is why our Tribe is seeking a
legislative solution that will provide us with long needed legal
certainty.
Two Classes of Tribes
In addition, as Senator Dorgan anticipated, the Carcieri decision
has created two classes of tribes: those able to prove that they were
``under federal jurisdiction'' in 1934, and those that cannot. This
result directly conflicts with Congress' 1994 amendments to the IRA,
which mandated that all federally recognized Indian tribes be treated
the same for all purposes under the Act.
The 1994 amendments were passed in direct reaction to efforts at
the Bureau of Indian Affairs to use Section 16 of the IRA to classify
Indian tribes as being either ``created'' or ``historic''. Senator John
McCain, then Vice Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee,
offered the amendment, in part, in response to the BIA's treatment of
the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona. In his floor statement that led to
passage of the amendment, Senator McCain shared the following:
According to the Department, created tribes are only authorized
to exercise such powers of self-governance as the Secretary may
confer on them . . .. I can find no basis in law or policy for
the manner in which section 16 has been interpreted by the
Department of the Interior . . ..
The recognition of an Indian tribe by the Federal Government is
just that--the recognition that there is a sovereign entity
with governmental authority which predates the U.S.
Constitution and with which the Federal Government has
established formal relations. Over the years, the Federal
Government has extended recognition to Indian tribes through
treaties, executive orders, a course of dealing, decisions of
the Federal courts, acts of Congress and administrative action.
Regardless of the method by which recognition was extended, all
Indian tribes enjoy the same relationship with the United
States and exercise the same inherent authority. All that
section 16 was intended to do was to provide a mechanism for
the tribes to interact with other governments in our Federal
system in a form familiar to those governments through tribal
adoption and Secretarial approval of tribal constitutions for
those Indian tribes that choose to employ its provisions.
Clearly the interpretation of section 16 which has been
developed by the Department is inconsistent with the
 policies underlying the IRA, which were to
stabilize Indian  governments and to encourage self-
government. These policies have taken on additional vitality in
the last 20 years as the Congress has repudiated and repealed
the policy of termination and enacted the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act and the Tribal Self-
Governance Demonstration Project. The effect of the
Department's interpretation of section 16 has been to
destabilize Indian tribal governments and to hinder self-
governance of the Department's unilateral and often arbitrary
decisions about which powers of self-governance a tribal
government can exercise.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ 140 Cong. Rec. 11234 (May 19, 1994).
Senator Inouye, then-Chair of the Committee, who also co-sponsored
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the amendment, made the following statement to clarify its purpose:
ur amendment will correct any instance where any federally
recognized Indian tribe has been classified as `created' and
that it will prohibit such classifications from being imposed
or used in the future. Our amendment makes it clear that it is
and has always been Federal law and policy that Indian tribes
recognized by the Federal Government stand on an equal footing
to each other and to the Federal Government . . .. Each
federally recognized Indian tribe is entitled to the same
privileges and immunities as other federally recognized tribes
and has the right to exercise the same inherent and delegated
authorities. This is true without regard to the manner in which
the Indian tribe became recognized by the United States or
whether it has chosen to organize under the IRA. By enacting
this amendment to section 16 of the IRA, we will provide the
stability for Indian tribal governments that the Congress
thought it was providing 60 years ago when the IRA was
enacted.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\26\ 140 Cong. Rec. 11235 (May 19, 1994).
The amendment, enacted on May 31, 1994, added subsections (f) and
(g) to the Section 16 of the IRA. Subsection (f), titled ``Privileges
and Immunities of Indian Tribes'' prohibited all federal agencies from
promulgating regulations or making decisions ``that classifies,
enhances, or diminishes the privileges and immunities available to the
Indian tribe relative to other federally recognized tribes by virtue of
their status as Indian tribes.'' Subsection (g) accomplished this same
goal, but retroactively, by proclaiming that any regulation or
administrative decision that treated tribal governments in a disparate
manner ``shall have no force or effect.'' \27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\27\ P.L. 103-263 (May 31, 1994), codified at 25 U.S.C.
Sec. 5123(f), (g). Given the background of Section 16 of the IRA
detailed by Professor Rice, it is beyond comprehension why or how the
Interior Department undertook this effort.
One of many tragic results of the Carcieri decision is that it has
breathed life back into this misguided argument that Tribal governments
are either ``historic'' or ``created''. Former Assistant Secretary for
Indian Affairs, Kevin Washburn, testifying in his capacity as a
Professor of the University of Iowa College of Law, attempted to refute
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
this line of thinking:
Since the 1990s, there has been a requirement that each year
the Federal Government publish the list of tribes that are
recognized. It would have been nice if we had had that in 1934.
That would have saved a lot of this work for tribes. But the
fact is there is no tribe that exists today that did not exist
in 1934. We don't create tribes out of whole cloth in this
country. We spend a lot of time working on the reformation of
that tribal recognition process, and those tribes have always
existed and so they deserve to have land if they have existed.
So, I would respectfully urge the Committee to try to move H.R.
375 through the House.\28\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Attempts to Address the Carcieri Decision
In the wake of the Carcieri decision, the Interior Department was
forced to make determinations of whether a Tribe that filed an IRA
application to place land into trust was under federal jurisdiction on
a case-by-case basis. Tribal governments were given little guidance
about what factors would be considered in this determination.
To provide Tribes and the public with some guidance, the Interior
Department's Office of the Solicitor issued an official M-Opinion on
March 12, 2014, that provided a framework of how the agency would
determine whether an Indian tribe was ``under federal jurisdiction'' in
1934 for purposes of the administrative fee to trust process. The M-
Opinion set forth a two-part test. The first factor requires a
sufficient showing that ``the United States had, in 1934 or at some
point in the tribe's history prior to 1934, an action or series of
actions--through a course of dealings or other relevant acts for or on
behalf of the tribe or in some instance tribal members--that are
sufficient to establish, or that generally reflect federal obligations,
duties, responsibility for or authority over the tribe by the Federal
government.'' The second question is to ``ascertain whether the tribe's
jurisdictional status remained intact in 1934.'' \29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\29\ The Meaning of Under Federal Jurisdiction for Purposes of the
Indian Reorganization Act, M-37029 at 19 (Mar. 12, 2014).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the M-Opinion provided some needed transparency to the land
into trust process post-Carcieri, it required extensive analysis and
work by attorneys and historians from both the applicant Tribe and the
Interior Department. Some ``under federal jurisdiction'' determinations
took years to achieve. Often, when a land into trust decision was
finalized pursuant to the M-Opinion, the Tribe had to wait additional
years for the land to be placed into trust by wading through the
federal court process. However, federal courts have generally upheld
Interior's determinations pursuant to the 2014 M-Opinion.
On March 9, 2020, then-Solicitor Daniel Jorjani issued a new M-
Opinion withdrawing the 2014 M-Opinion, replacing it with two
memoranda. The first examines the recognition and jurisdiction elements
of the phrase ``any recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction''.
The second established a four-part test that replaced the test
established in the 2014 M-Opinion. Step 1 acknowledged that if Congress
enacted a law after 1934 making Section 5 of the IRA applicable to the
Tribe, then no ``under federal jurisdiction'' determination would be
necessary.\30\ In the absence of post-IRA legislation, Step 2 required
a Tribe to show evidence that it was subject to ``the federal
government's administration of its Indian affairs authority with
respect to that particular group of Indians.'' If there is sufficient
evidence ``presumptively demonstrat'' federal jurisdiction, the
trust acquisition may proceed. Step 3 required a Tribe to show that it
was recognized prior to 1934 and remained under federal jurisdiction in
1934. Examples meeting Step 3 include ``ratified treaties still in
effect in 1934; tribe-specific Executive Orders; tribe-specific
legislation, including termination legislation enacted after 1934,
which acknowledges the existence of a government-to-government
relationship with a tribe at the time it is enacted.'' \31\ If a Tribe
did not meet Steps 1-3, Step Four asks whether the ``totality of an
applicant tribe's non-dispositive evidence . . . is sufficient to show
that the tribe was `recognized' in or before 1934 and remained `under
federal jurisdiction' through 1934 [notwithstanding gaps in the
historical record].'' Step 4 also stated that applicant tribes
recognized after 1934 or acknowledged after 1978 under the
administrative procedures at Part 83 could also show evidence of
``political-legal `recognition' in or before 1934.'' \32\

Regulatory Improvements to the Land into Trust Process
Recognizing the limited shelf life of Interior M-Opinions, in
October 2021, the Interior Department initiated an effort to amend its
Part 151 regulations that implement the IRA's Section 5 land into trust
provision. On December 12, 2023, the Interior Department published a
final rule to amend these regulations governing the discretionary
acquisition of tribal fee to trust applications at 25 C.F.R. Part
151.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\33\ Land Acquisitions, 88 Fed. Reg. 86,222 (Dec. 12, 2023) (to be
codified at 25 C.F.R. pt. 151).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first substantive update of the administrative Tribal
fee into trust process since 1995. The regulatory changes streamline
the land into trust process by establishing a 120-day deadline for the
Department to make a final determination on trust land applications.
Importantly, the new regulation establishes criteria for a Tribal
Government's eligibility to use the regulation by clarifying the
Department's process to determine whether a Tribe was ``under federal
jurisdiction'' in 1934, as required by the Supreme Court's Carcieri
decision.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\34\ In October 2021, Interior held Tribal Leader consultation
sessions that discussed the need to improve the administrative process
to restore tribal homelands. On March 28, 2022, the Department released
draft revisions to Part 151, and held four Tribal Leader consultations,
which led to a proposed rule that was published on December 6, 2022.
The Interior Department held several consultations on the proposed
rule, and accepted verbal and written comments through March 1, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Tribe truly appreciates the Interior Department's efforts to
improve the administrative land into trust process, and we fully
support these changes. While the updated regulations make the process
for a Tribe to prove that it was ``under federal jurisdiction'' much
clearer, the updated process still requires teams of attorneys and
historians from both the Tribe and the Interior Department to navigate
through the regulatory process. If the prior M-Opinions are any
indication, even the streamlined process could take years to come to
resolution.
In addition, we remain concerned that the regulations will be the
subject of future litigation. Just as the Department's recent land into
trust decisions made pursuant to the various M-Opinions have been
challenged in court, decisions made pursuant to the updated regulations
will likewise be challenged. The ensuing legal process will also take
many years to achieve a final ruling. The legal challenges will most
likely start at the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, which is already
backlogged with dozens of tribal trust land acquisition appeals and
faces multiple administrative judicial vacancies. Claims will then have
to wind their way through the federal district and appellate courts,
again consuming countless hours and resources.
As a result, our Tribe is taking what for us is a new approach to
addressing our government's need for additional trust lands by working
with our congressional delegation and nearby local governments to gain
support and passage of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Lands Act,
which would clarify that our Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in
1934 for purposes of the IRA. Our approach is consistent with the
Interior Department's updated land to trust regulations and past and
recent precedent in Congress.
Section 151.4(b) of Interior's updated regulation clarifies that if
Congress enacted legislation after 1934 making the IRA's land into
trust provisions applicable to a specific Tribe, no ``under federal
jurisdiction'' analysis is needed. Section 151.4(b) of the final rule
provides,
(b) For some Tribes, Congress enacted legislation after 1934
making the IRA applicable to the Tribe. The existence of such
legislation making the IRA and its trust acquisition provisions
applicable to a Tribe eliminates the need to determine whether
a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\35\ 88 Federal Register 86251 (Dec. 12, 2023).
While new to our Tribe, this approach simply follows the approach
that Congress has taken since the 1970s for Tribes that were restored
to federal recognition through an act of Congress.\36\

Legislative Efforts to Address the Carcieri Decision
February 24, 2024, marked the 15-year anniversary of the Carcieri
decision. Congress has considered national Carcieri fix bills every
year for the past 15 years.\37\ With some minor differences, each of
these bills sought to amend the IRA to eliminate the phrase ``under
federal jurisdiction'' and clarify that the IRA's land to trust
provision applies to all federally recognized Indian tribes. The House
of Representatives passed a national Carcieri fix in the 116th and
117th Congresses with broad bipartisan support each time under
suspension of the rules.\38\ However, those bills did not reach final
passage.

The Poarch Band of Creek Indians has been one of the leading
advocates for a national ``Carcieri fix.'' Today, I again offer our
full support for Chairman Cole's bipartisan bill, H.R. 1208, which
would accomplish this goal.
In the 118th Congress, however, we are taking a parallel track
similar to the strategy taken by dozens of Tribes who have worked with
their congressional delegation to enact bills to mandate fee-to-trust
actions, reaffirm trust lands, or clarify that the IRA applies to their
individual tribe.\39\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are grateful to Rep. Carl for introducing the Poarch Band of
Creek Indians Lands Act, H.R. 6180, which would clarify that the IRA's
land-into-trust process applies to our Tribe. H.R. 6180 will enable us
to work with the Interior Department and local governments restore and
protect our lands to meet the acute needs of our growing community.
This bill is targeted and tailored, and it has the strong support of
the Alabama congressional delegation and the cities and counties
surrounding our trust land, including Elmore County, Escambia County,
and Montgomery County.
I respectfully ask the full Committee to bring H.R. 6180 to a
markup and advance the bill to final passage in the 118th Congress. On
behalf of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, I am honored to speak to
you today, and I am happy to answer any questions. Thank you.

In Support of Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act--Legislation
to clarify the Land Into Trust Process for the Poarch Band of Creek
Indians
October 12, 2023
To: Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives
RE: Support for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act
On behalf of the undersigned, we write in strong support of the
Poarch Band of Creek Indians Parity Act, legislation to clarify the
Land Into Trust Process for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians (Tribe.)
The Tribe is a major economic driver in our counties and cities and
throughout Alabama, and employs over 3500 Alabamians, 90 percent of
whom are not Tribal members. Additionally, with over 2,700 enrolled
Poarch Creek tribal members who are citizens of our state, we feel a
duty to do our small part to ensure the Tribe can exercise its inherent
sovereignty to provide for future generations.
This legislation is necessary because the Supreme Court ruled in
2009 that the Department of Interior's (DOI's) tribal fee-to-trust
authority is limited to only those tribal governments that were ``under
federal jurisdiction'' as of June 18, 1934, the date of enactment of
the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). DOI has struggled to consistently
define the term ``under federal jurisdiction.'' The term ``under
federal jurisdiction'' is not defined in the IRA and there is no
legislative history to discern congressional intent of the term. Since
2009, DOI has relied on multiple Solicitor M-opinions to determine
whether a tribe is under federal jurisdiction. This ambiguity has made
the process subject to litigation based on unfounded legal claims and
has resulted in heavy legal/administrative burdens for tribes. As such,
the Tribe has been subjected to unnecessary litigation over the status
of its lands since 2009. Further, the U.S. must commit significant
resources from the Departments of Justice and Interior to do archival
analysis, legal research, and litigation support for these decisions at
great taxpayer expense.
Fortunately, the Tribe has prevailed in these cases, but these
constant attacks have taken an unnecessary toll on the Tribe--stalling
development for improved housing, health care, and other essential
services to the community. The Tribe is a great community partner, and
it is important that we support their efforts to correct this legal
ambiguity. This legislation would allow the Tribe to strengthen its
capacity to better provide for its nation and the surrounding
communities. We offer our full support of the Poarch Band of Creek
Indians Parity Act.

Questions Submitted for the Record to the Hon. Stephanie Bryan, Tribal
Chair & CEO, Poarch Creek Indians
Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman
Question 1. Your written testimony described your tribal history in
the state of Alabama and the tribe's current relationships with many
local governments. Can you expand on how your tribe was able to build
and maintain these relationships?
1a) How can Congress help to promote congenial relationships
between tribes and localities?
Answer. When we first went through the Interior Department's land
into trust process, our Tribe did not have much in the way of
resources. Over the years, as our economy developed and the Tribe's
enterprises grew and diversified, we were able to strengthen our
relationships with nearby counties and local governments, entering into
dozens of MOUs and intergovernmental agreements as noted in my written
statement. However, far too many tribal governments lack resources to
meet the most basic needs of their citizens. As a result, they are not
able to help their neighboring state or local governments.
One proposal that would help foster relationships between tribes
and local units of government would be to include tribal trust lands in
the Payment In Lieu of Taxes (``PILT'') program. Congress established
the PILT program in 1976 to help local governments offset losses in
property taxes due to the existence of nontaxable Federal lands within
their boundaries. PILT payments are made annually for tax-exempt
Federal lands administered by Department of the Interior agencies,
including the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation. In
addition, PILT payments cover Federal lands administered by the U.S.
Forest Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Utah
Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission.
Many local government concerns with tribal government land-into-
trust applications relate to potential losses of tax revenue. Including
tribal trust lands in the PILT program would resolve these concerns.
While Indian trust lands are not public lands owned by the United
States, the government does hold legal treaty and trust obligations to
make existing Indian lands livable homes to tribal citizens and to help
restore the tribal government land base.
Question 2. You mentioned in your testimony that several litigation
challenges continually use the Carcieri decision reasoning, even after
cases have been resolved.
2a) Is there any litigation still ongoing?
2b) If so, what is the status of the litigation?
Answer. Fortunately, our Tribe, often with the support of the
federal government, has been successful in defeating most Carcieri-
based arguments in court during the early stages of litigation. We have
also settled a handful of lawsuits where Carcieri arguments were raised
in connection with alleged injuries involving our various businesses
and facilities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has
already rejected challenges to the status of our trust lands on two
separate occasions. See Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Hildreth, 565
F. App'x 934, 942-44 (11th Cir. 2016); Alabama v. PCI Gaming Authority,
801 F.3d 1278, 1291-93 (11th Cir. 2015). The United States filed brief
in support of our Tribe in both of these cases, expending valuable
federal resources.
The only ongoing litigation where a Carcieri challenge has been
raised is a lawsuit brought by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation challenging
our right to develop our trust land in Wetumpka, Alabama. The United
States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama dismissed all
of Muscogee's claims against our Tribe and the United States in March
2021, but Muscogee has appealed that ruling to the Eleventh Circuit
Court of Appeals. Muscogee's Carcieri claims ignore the two prior
decisions on this now well-settled legal question, and further prove
our point that our Tribe will be forced to litigate these baseless
legal claims time and again without enactment of H.R. 6160. And
Muscogee's lawsuit, which names various federal officials and entities
as defendants, has forced the federal government to once again expend
taxpayer funds to relitigate this twice-decided issue. After Muscogee
filed its appeal, our two tribal nations engaged in a lengthy mediation
process in an effort to amicably resolve the dispute, but it proved
unsuccessful, and the appeal is moving forward. The only question on
appeal is whether the Poarch Band of Creek Indians can be sued in
federal court without our consent; the district court dismissed
Muscogee's claims without even needing to reach the Carcieri argument.
All appellate briefs have been filed, and oral argument before a panel
of the Eleventh Circuit is set for September of this year.
Question 3. In your written testimony, you mentioned that your
tribe is looking to develop a nursing home but needs additional land.
3a) Are there lands your tribe is seeking to have taken into trust
currently?
3b) Have you seen any opposition to these applications?
Answer. Currently, we do not have any pending trust land
applications due to the concerns the Tribe has regarding the definition
of ``under federal jurisdiction'' in 1934. As previously stated the
Poarch Band of Creek Indians has already spent millions of dollars
defending our existing trust lands. While we are confident that our
Tribe qualifies to have land taken into trust under current law, as the
federal government has repeatedly concluded, we are equally confident
that any trust land application by our Tribe will lead to costly,
extended litigation that will frustrate the purpose and value of any
potential trust acquisition. Until the Department of Interior's
authority to take land into trust for our Tribe is unequivocally
affirmed, we cannot risk facing additional costly challenges that may
arise due to the lack of clarity on the definition of `under federal
jurisdiction' as required by the Indian Reorganization Act.
Question 4. Is there anything else you would like to add to your
testimony on how the Department of the Interior's fee-to-trust process
could be reformed to benefit tribes and state and local governments?
Answer. As noted in my written testimony, the Poarch Band of Creek
Indians generally supports the amendments to the Part 151 regulations.
We support the clarification to the process for a Tribe to prove that
it was ``under federal jurisdiction.'' However, as noted below, upon
further review of new Part 151.11, the Tribe does not support the
elimination of the ``bungee cord'' approach, which had been employed
since at least 1995.
Question 5. The new 25 CFR Part 151 regulations governing lands
into trust provide no geographic boundaries within which tribes can
acquire trust lands, eliminates the previous requirement that the
Secretary use heightened scrutiny the further a tribe goes from its
existing reservation to seek new trust lands, and failed to include a
consultation requirement with nearby tribes for any new trust land
acquisitions. In fact, the regulations do not even require the
Department to notify a tribe if another tribe applies for trust lands.
The Interior Secretary would be able to review such an application with
complete discretion and no requirement to notify or consult affected
tribes.
5a) Does Poarch Band support this part of the new regulations that
eliminate the heightened scrutiny for applications that seek to acquire
lands far from a tribe's existing reservation?
5b) Would you want the Interior Secretary to be mandated to consult
with you if any other tribe applies for trust lands within your
ancestral territory in Alabama?
Answer. The updated regulations to Part 151.11, now listed under
the question ``How will the Secretary evaluate a request involving land
outside of and noncontiguous to the boundaries of an Indian
reservation?'', eliminate the requirement that as the distance between
the applicant-tribe's reservation and the land sought to be placed in
trust increases, ``the Secretary shall give greater scrutiny'' to
application.
As noted in my written testimony, our Tribe appreciates the
Interior Department's efforts to improve the administrative land into
trust process. We generally support the changes at Part 151.4 to
clarify the process for a Tribe to prove that it was ``under federal
jurisdiction.'' However, upon further review of new Part 151.11, the
Tribe does not support the elimination of the requirement that the
Secretary give greater scrutiny to off-reservation land into trust
applications as the distance between the applicant tribe's current
lands increases, also known as the ``bungee cord'' approach, which had
been employed since at least 1995.
Yes, we would want the Interior Secretary to consult if any other
tribe applied for trust lands within our ancestral territory in
Alabama. Failure to require consultation with nearby federally
recognized Indian tribes has been a long-standing gap in the fee to
trust process. While the regulations in place from at least 1995 to
2024 required Interior to provide notice and comment to state and local
governments, it did not provide similar outreach to federally
recognized Indian tribes that have existing trust lands nearby the
proposed land into trust application and have never required meaningful
consultation with nearby federally recognized Indian tribes.

Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Ms. Bryan. The Chair now recognizes
the Honorable David Rabbitt for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. DAVID RABBITT, DISTRICT 2 SUPERVISOR,
SONOMA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, SONOMA, CALIFORNIA
Mr. Rabbitt. Chair Hageman, thank you very much. Ranking
Member Leger Fernandez, thank you, as well. And members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to participate in
today's hearing. My name is David Rabbitt. I am an elected
supervisor from Sonoma County, California and current Chair.
The testimony that I am delivering is on behalf of the National
Association of Counties, or NACo, which represents America's
3,069 counties, nearly 40,000 county elected officials, and
over 3.6 million county employees. I am an active member of
NACo, formerly serving on its board of directors, and have been
a leading voice in county and tribal relations.
Incidentally, I am from Sonoma County, a county that has
five federally recognized tribes. A sixth is also looking to
move into the county. Three of those tribes currently operate
casinos: two within the county, one within the Bay area. But I
will say this, that we have agreements with all five of our
federally recognized tribes, and that is what I am here today
to hope that you also agree that that is a great way to go
forward.
Counties play, as you know, a critical role in everyday
life of the nation's residents. Strong intergovernmental
partners, county support, government-to-government relations
that recognize the unique role and interests of tribes, state,
counties, and other local governments, all to protect the
members of our communities.
It is incumbent upon Congress to fix the long-standing
systemic defects in the Department of the Interior's broken
fee-to-trust process. And to be clear, we believe that any
Carcieri fix or any legislation that would restore the Interior
Secretary's authority to take land into trust for tribes must
be coupled with much-needed, long-overdue reforms in the
Federal Government's deeply flawed trust land decision-making
process.
Unfortunately, the so-called clean Carcieri fix would do
nothing to repair the underlying problems in the trust land
system, and would only serve to exacerbate and perpetuate the
inherent conflict and fundamental flaws of the current process,
a process, incidentally, that is broken for all parties: tribes
and local governments.
Existing Federal laws and regulations simply fail to
address the off-reservation impacts of tribal land development,
including casinos, and particularly in those instances of local
land use and health and safety regulations.
Trust acquisitions often increase demands for critical
county services and resources such as law enforcement, fire
protection, transportation, and water, without providing any
mitigation for these impacts. Not only is mitigation ignored in
the fee-to-trust process, a county's capacity to address the
impacts is reduced by eliminating the land from the local tax
base.
Nonetheless, although trust acquisitions often result in
significant off-reservation impacts, the Department of the
Interior does not provide impacted local governments and
communities with sufficient notice or meaningful opportunity to
comment regarding fee-to-trust applications. Furthermore, the
Department does not accord county concerns in off-reservation
impacts adequate weight in the land-to-trust process.
The Federal process is also flawed in that it does not
provide an avenue for tribes to engage in good faith
discussions regarding mitigation of environmental impacts of
tribal development, nor is there any incentive for tribes to
enter into mitigation agreements with local governments. It
should be noted that an approach that encourages the
intergovernment agreements between tribes and local governments
affected by fee-to-trust applications is required and working
well under recent California State gaming compacts.
Again, in Sonoma County we entered into a comprehensive
intergovernmental agreement to create an over 500-acre homeland
for the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians, and supported legislation
by Congressman Huffman to take that land into trust.
Not only does such a collaborative approach offer the
opportunity to streamline the application process, it can also
help us ensure that success of the tribal project within the
local community. The establishment of a trust land system that
incentivizes intergovernmental agreements between tribes and
local governments is at the heart of NACo's fee-to-trust reform
recommendations.
I would like to take just a few minutes to talk about that
further. I can tell you personally I am an architect by
profession, therefore, involved in development. And every
development has an impact, an off-site impact, especially the
smaller pieces of land, lands where that development occurs.
And it is incumbent upon the developer, or the applicant, or
the owner of that property to make sure that they are
mitigating those impacts to the best extent possible. You can't
eliminate everything, but you certainly can mitigate it. And I
think, if you don't, what you end up doing is pushing that can
down the road. And, unfortunately, I think what we have seen in
the past is that many times leads to litigation.
Some people think, by having these intergovernmental
agreements beforehand, that that would delay a process. I
personally believe, and by evidence with our experiences in our
county believe, that actually it would speed the process
because you would eliminate the chances of having litigation in
the future over things that weren't transparent or fully
explained prior.
I think it is really just sitting down with each other,
like most things are, communicating with one another. We
totally understand and respect the sovereignty of the Tribal
Nations. We can't dictate what is going to be built on those
properties, but we can talk about how people will come and go
from those properties. We can talk about what water will be
used for those properties. We can talk about how the fire
services, the law enforcement services, and so on and so forth.
And I very much appreciate the board's willingness to hear
me out today. And certainly, there is more within the written
testimony.

Prepared Statement of the Hon. David Rabbitt, Supervisor, Sonoma
County, California on Behalf of the National Association of Counties
(NACo)
on H.R. 1208 and H.R. 6180
Thank you, Chair Westerman, Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger
Fernandez, and Members of the Subcommittee, for the opportunity to
testify today. My name is David Rabbitt, and I am a County Supervisor
in Sonoma County, California and am actively involved in and formerly
served as a member of the Board of Directors of the National
Association of Counties (NACo). This testimony is submitted on behalf
of NACo, which has been a leader in pursuing federal laws and
regulations that provide the framework for constructive government-to-
government relationships between counties and tribes.
Established in 1935, NACo is the only national organization
representing county governments in Washington, DC. Over 2,600 of the
3,069 counties in the United States are members of NACo, representing
over 80 percent of the nation's population. NACo provides an extensive
line of services including legislative, research, technical and public
affairs assistance, as well as enterprise services to its members.
I am also an active member of the California State Association of
Counties (CSAC), which was founded in 1895, and is the unified voice on
behalf of all 58 of California's counties. The primary purpose of the
association is to represent county government before the California
Legislature, administrative agencies, and the federal government. Along
with NACo, CSAC has been a leader in actively pursuing federal policies
aimed at fostering productive tribal-county relationships.
Counties play a critical role in the everyday lives of our nation's
residents. Many county responsibilities are mandated by both the state
and the federal government. While county responsibilities differ
widely, most states grant their counties significant authority to
fulfill public services. These authorities include construction and
maintenance of roads, bridges and critical infrastructure, assessment
of property taxes, record keeping, administering elections, and
overseeing jails, court systems and public hospitals. Counties are also
responsible for child welfare, consumer protection, economic
development, employment and workforce training, emergency management,
land use planning and zoning. As strong intergovernmental partners,
counties support government-to-government relations that recognize the
unique role and interests of tribes, state, counties and other local
governments to protect all members of our communities and provide
governmental services and infrastructure beneficial to all.
At the outset, I'd like to take this opportunity to reaffirm NACo's
absolute respect for the authority of federally recognized Indian
tribes. We reaffirm our support for the right of tribes to self-
governance and recognize the need for tribes to preserve their heritage
and to pursue economic self-reliance. Furthermore, NACo recognizes the
disparity and inequity caused by the Court's 2009 decision in Carcieri
v. Salazar and believes that it continues to be the responsibility of
Congress to pass legislation that would put all federally recognized
tribes on equal footing relative to the opportunity to have land taken
into trust.
At the same time, it is absolutely essential that Congress fix the
long-standing, systemic defects in the Department of the Interior's
broken fee-to-trust process. To be crystal clear, we believe that any
Carcieri fix--that is, any legislation that would restore the Interior
Secretary's authority to take land into trust for tribes--must be
coupled with much-needed, long overdue reforms in the Federal
Government's deeply flawed trust land decision-making process.
Unfortunately, a so-called ``clean Carcieri fix,'' such as the one
embodied in H.R. 1208, would do nothing to repair the underlying
problems in the trust-land system and would only serve to perpetuate
the inherent conflict of the current process--a process, incidentally,
that is broken for all parties, tribes and local governments.
Notably, recent action taken by the U.S. Department of the
Interior--namely a series of updates to the Bureau of Indian Affairs'
(BIA) fee-to-trust regulations found at 25 CFR Part 151--did nothing to
repair the underlying flaws in the trust acquisition system. Rather,
the Department's new regulation, which went into effect in January
2024, further undercuts counties' already limited ability to
participate in the fee-to-trust process. Of paramount concern to
counties, the rule does not adequately account for--or include any sort
of mechanism to address--the significant impacts to local governments
and communities that often occur as a result of major tribal
development projects, including casinos.
The Deficiencies of the Current Trust-Land Process
The fundamental problem with the trust acquisition process is that
Congress has not established objective standards under which any
delegated trust-land authority is to be applied by the BIA. The
relevant section of federal law, Section 5 of the Indian Reorganization
Act of 1934 (IRA), reads as follows: ``The Secretary of the Interior is
hereby authorized in his discretion, to acquire  any
interest in lands, water rights, or surface rights to lands, within or
without reservations . . . for the purpose of providing land to
Indians.'' 25 U.S.C. Sec. 465.
This general and undefined congressional guidance, which was
codified 90 years ago, has resulted in a trust-land process that fails
to meaningfully include legitimate interests, provide adequate
transparency to the public, or demonstrate fundamental balance in
trust-land decisions. The unsatisfactory process, which is governed by
the BIA's Part 151 regulations, has created significant controversy,
serious conflicts between tribes and states, counties and local
governments--including litigation costly to all parties--and broad
distrust of the fairness of the system. Tribes deserve an efficient and
predictable trust acquisition process that is not continually bogged
down by controversy and legal action. Likewise, states and counties
also deserve a process that considers their legitimate governmental
interests.
With 574 federally recognized tribes across the United States, no
two fee-to-trust applications are alike. In California, we see this
diversity firsthand with over 100 federally recognized tribes, all of
which have unique cultural history and geography. The diversity of
applications and circumstances across the country reinforces the need
for both clear, objective standards in the fee-to-trust process and the
importance of local intergovernmental agreements to address specific
concerns.
Notably, many California tribes are located on ``Rancherias,''
which were originally federal property on which landless Indians were
placed. No ``recognition'' was extended to most of these tribes at that
time. Therefore any Carcieri-related legislation must address the
significant issues raised in states like California and many others
across the country which did not generally have a ``reservation''
system and that are now faced with small Bands of tribal people who are
recognized by the federal government as tribes and who may seek to
establish large commercial casinos. In particular, legislation must
ensure improved notice to counties and define the standards by which
property can be removed from local jurisdiction. Moreover, requirements
must be established to ensure that the significant off-reservation
impacts of tribal projects are fully mitigated.
It should be noted that many of the deficiencies in the trust-land
process were reaffirmed in a quantitative analysis of all 111 fee-to-
trust decisions by the Pacific Region BIA Office between 2001 and
2011.\1\ The analysis found that BIA granted 100 percent of the
proposed acquisition requests and in no case did any Section 151 factor
weigh against approval of an application.\2\ The analysis further found
that because of the lack of clear guidance and objective criteria,
Pacific Region BIA decisions avoid substantive analysis in favor of
filler considerations and boilerplate language.\3\

he regulations provide wide discretion to the decision maker
because the criteria are not specific, and BIA has not provided
clear guidelines for applying them. Given the wide discretion
that exists and the increased scrutiny that the land in trust
process has come under with the growth of Indian gaming, it is
important that the process be as open and transparent as
possible.\4\

Unfortunately, the fee-to-trust process remains broken as community
concerns are ignored or downplayed, applications are rubber-stamped at
a 100 percent acceptance rate, and tribes and local governments are
forced into unnecessary and unproductive conflict.\5\ Moreover, the
deficiencies in the process could soon be amplified by the recent
revisions to BIA's Part 151 regulations, which further streamline the
fee-to-trust process by eliminating certain criteria and establishing
several new presumptions of approval. Additionally, the new regulations
establish a 120-day time frame for a Tribe to receive a final fee-to-
trust decision. Currently, this process takes 958 days, on average, and
while counties agree this is simply too long for Tribes to wait for a
decision, 120 days is not a sufficient amount of time for BIA to
comprehensively review and evaluate the impacts of an application.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While there are a number of major flaws in BIA's fee-to-trust
process, one of NACo's central concerns is the severely limited role
that state and local governments play. The implications of losing
jurisdiction over local lands are very significant, including the loss
of tax base, loss of planning and zoning authority, and the loss of
environmental and other regulatory power. Yet, in practice, state,
county and local governments are afforded limited, and often late,
notice of a pending trust land application, and, under the Part 151
regulations, are asked to provide comments on two narrow issues only:
1) potential jurisdictional conflicts; and, 2) loss of tax revenues.
Moreover, the notice that local governments receive typically does
not include the actual fee-to-trust application and often does not
indicate how the applicant tribe intends to use the land. Further, in
some cases, tribes have identified a non-intensive, mundane use, only
to change the use to heavy economic development, such as gaming or
energy projects, soon after the land is acquired in trust.
One measure of the severe dysfunction is that local governments are
often forced to resort to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to
ascertain if a trust application or a petition for an Indian lands
determination--a key step in the process for a parcel of land to
qualify for gaming--has been filed with the BIA. Again, despite the
significant impact on counties, and the relevant information they hold,
local governments do not receive notice of the filing of either a trust
application or Indian Lands determination. Although trust applications
are often deemed incomplete by the BIA, it is during this time that
counties and tribes are best positioned to collaboratively address any
concerns before receiving formal notice of a complete application and
be given 30 days to decide whether to support or oppose the project.
The lack of consultation is even worse with Indian lands
determinations, as counties are not notified of the requests and are
not allowed to comment or otherwise invited to participate in the
process. These processes must include local participation in order to
ensure that there is a complete factual basis upon which objective
decisions can be made.
While the Department of the Interior has acknowledged the increased
impacts and conflicts inherent in recent trust-land decisions, its new
regulations do not strike a reasonable balance between tribes seeking
new trust lands and the states and local governments experiencing
unacceptable impacts. Indeed, the notification process embodied in the
new Part 151 regulations is insufficient and falls far short of
providing local governments with the level of detail needed to
adequately respond to proposed trust-land acquisitions. This point was
included as a ``Recommendation for Executive Action'' in the GAO
Report, as the Interior Secretary was recommended to direct BIA to
revise trust regulations and ``guidelines for providing state and local
governments more information on the applications and a longer period to
provide meaningful comments on the applications'' \6\ Regrettably,
the 2024 regulations do not embody this important recommendation and
state and local governments continue to have only 30 days to provide
comments on a pending fee-to-trust application.

Carcieri v. Salazar--An Historic Opportunity
On February 24, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark
decision on Indian trust lands in Carcieri v. Salazar. The Court held
that the Secretary of the Interior lacks authority to take land into
trust on behalf of Indian tribes that were not under the jurisdiction
of the federal government upon enactment of the IRA in 1934.
Because the Carcieri decision definitively confirmed the
Secretary's lack of authority to take land into trust for post-1934
tribes, Congress has the opportunity not just to address the issue of
the Secretary's authority under the current failed fee-to-trust system,
but to reassert its primary authority for these decisions by setting
specific standards for taking land into trust that address the main
shortcomings of the trust land-process.
In the 15 years since this significant court decision, varied
proposals for reversing the Carcieri decision have been generated, some
proposing administrative action and others favoring a congressional
approach. Today's hearing, like several hearings before it, is
recognition of the significance of the Carcieri decision and the need
to consider legislative action.
We believe that the responsibility to address the implications of
Carcieri clearly rests with Congress and that a decision to do so in
isolation of the larger problems of the fee-to-trust system would
represent an historic missed opportunity. Indeed, a legislative
resolution to Carcieri that keeps the current trust-land system in
place will be regarded as unsatisfactory to counties, local
governments, and the people we serve. Rather than a ``fix,'' such a
result would only perpetuate a broken system, where the non-tribal
entities most affected by the trust acquisition process are without a
meaningful role. Ultimately, this would undermine the respectful
government-to-government relationship that is necessary for both tribes
and neighboring governments to fully develop, thrive, and provide
critical services to the people dependent upon them for their well
being.
Accordingly, our primary recommendation to the Subcommittee and
Congress is this: Do not advance a congressional response to Carcieri
that allows the Department of the Interior to continue the flawed fee-
to-trust process. Rather, Congress should make meaningful,
comprehensive reforms to the trust-land system that reflect the right
to self-governance of our Tribal neighbors and which address the
legitimate concerns of counties and other key stakeholders.
NACo believes that the Carcieri decision presents Congress with an
opportunity to carefully exercise its constitutional authority for fee-
to-trust acquisitions and to define the respective roles of Congress
and the Executive Branch in trust-land decisions. Additionally, it
affords Congress with the opportunity to establish clear and specific
congressional standards and processes to guide trust-land decisions in
the future. A clear definition of roles is acutely needed regardless of
whether trust and recognition decisions are ultimately made by
Congress, as provided in the Constitution, or the Executive Branch
under a congressional grant of authority.
As we have urged for years, we respectfully ask Members of this
Subcommittee to employ a comprehensive approach to addressing the
implications of the Carcieri decision and the deficiencies in the trust
land process, , namely: 1) the absence of authority to acquire trust
lands, which affects post-1934 tribes, and, 2) the lack of meaningful
standards and a fair and open process, which affects states, local
governments, businesses and non-tribal communities. As the Subcommittee
considers potential Carcieri legislation, it should undertake reform
that is in the interests of all affected parties--both Tribes and non-
Tribal governments alike.
Legislative Recommendations
1. Require Full Disclosure and Fair Notice and Transparency from
the BIA on Trust Land Applications and Other Indian Land Decisions. The
Part 151 regulations are not specific and do not require sufficient
information to be furnished to affected parties regarding tribal plans
to use the land proposed for trust status. As a result, it is very
difficult for those parties (local and state governments, and the
public) to determine the nature of the tribal proposal, evaluate the
impacts, and provide meaningful comments.
Federal law should require BIA to ensure that tribes provide
reasonably detailed information about the intended uses of proposed
trust land, not unlike the public information required for planning,
zoning and permitting on the local level. This assumes even greater
importance since local planning, zoning and permitting are being
preempted by the trust land decision; accordingly, information about
intended uses is reasonable and fair to require.
Legislative changes need to be made to ensure that affected
governments receive timely notice of fee-to-trust applications and
petitions for Indian land determinations in their jurisdiction and have
adequate time to provide meaningful input. Indian lands determinations,
a critical step for a tribe to take land into trust for gaming
purposes, is conducted in secret without notice to affected counties or
any real opportunity for input. As previously indicated, counties are
often forced to file a FOIA request to even determine if an application
was filed and the basis for the petition.
Notice for trust and other land actions for tribes that go to
counties and other governments is not only very limited in coverage,
the opportunity to comment is minimal; this must change. A new paradigm
is needed where counties are considered meaningful and constructive
stakeholders in Indian land-related determinations. For too long,
counties have been excluded from providing input in critical Department
of Interior decisions and policy formation that directly affects their
communities. NACo believes counties should be provided 120 days to
respond to land in trust applications and request that BIA provide a
response explaining the rationale for acceptance or rejection within 90
days.\7\

county-platform-and-resolutions
2. Establish Clear and Objective Standards for Agency Exercise of
Discretion in Making Fee-to-Trust Decisions. The lack of meaningful
standards or any objective criteria in fee-to-trust decisions made by
the BIA has been long criticized by the U.S. Government Accountability
Office and local governments. As previously indicated, BIA requests
only minimal information about the impacts of such acquisitions on
local communities and trust land decisions are not governed by a
requirement to balance the benefit to the tribe against the impact to
the local community. As a result, there are well-known and significant
impacts of trust land decisions on communities and states, with
consequent controversy and delay and distrust of the process.
Furthermore, the BIA has broad authority and discretion to make
acquisition decisions in favor of tribes, an authority that was
affirmed and further broadened through BIA's recent Part 151 revisions.
To reasonably balance the interests of tribes and local governments,
Congress should provide the Executive Branch with clear statutory
standards that take into account the legitimate interests of both
parties. However any delegation of authority is ultimately resolved,
Congress must specifically direct balanced standards that ensure that
trust land requests cannot be approved where the negative impacts to
other parties outweigh the benefit to the tribe.
3. Tribes that Reach Local Intergovernmental Agreements to Address
Jurisdiction and Environmental Impacts Should Have a Streamlined
Process. The legal framework should encourage tribes to reach
intergovernmental agreements to address off-reservation project impacts
by providing a streamlined fee-to-trust process when such agreements
are in place. Tribes, states, and counties need a process that is less
costly and more efficient. The virtually unfettered discretion
delegated to the BIA by virtue of the Part 151 regulations, along with
the lack of clear standards, almost inevitably creates conflict and
burdens the system. A process that encourages cooperation and
communication provides a basis to expedite decisions and reduce costs
and frustration for all involved. Furthermore, counties oppose any
federal actions that limit our ability to reach mutually acceptable and
enforceable agreements and/or provide critical services to our
communities.
It should be noted that an approach that encourages
intergovernmental agreements between a tribe and local government
affected by fee-to-trust applications is required and has worked well
in recent California gaming compacts. Not only does such an approach
offer the opportunity to streamline the application process, it can
also help to ensure the success of the tribal project within the local
community. The establishment of a trust-land system that incentivizes
intergovernmental agreements between tribes and local governments is at
the heart of NACo's fee-to-trust reform recommendations and should be a
top priority for Congress.
4. Secretarial Determination Regarding Off-reservation Impacts--
While there are many examples of successful collaboration between
tribes and counties, neighboring governments will not always see eye-
to-eye on major development projects. Therefore, in cases in which
tribes and counties are unable to reach enforceable mitigation
agreements with respect to potential trust acquisitions, legislation
should require the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a
comprehensive analysis of all anticipated off-reservation impacts in
direct consultation with the state and affected local government(s). In
turn, and as a condition of approving a trust acquisition, the
Secretary should be required to certify that the applicant has taken
steps to ensure that all significant jurisdictional conflicts and
impacts--including increased costs of local services, lost revenues,
and environmental impacts--have been mitigated to the maximum extent
practicable. Counties believes that this type of Secretarial
determination must be part of any Carcieri/fee-to-trust reform package.
Conclusion
Congressional action must address the critical repairs needed in
the fee-to-trust process. Unfortunately, legislation currently pending
in the U.S. House (H.R. 1208) fails to set clear standards for taking
land into trust, to properly balance the roles and interests of tribes,
state, local and federal governments in these decisions, and to clearly
address the apparent usurpation of authority by the Executive Branch
over Congress' constitutional authority over tribal recognition.
We ask Members of the Subcommittee to incorporate the
aforementioned reforms into any legislation that addresses the Carcieri
decision. Counties' proposals are common-sense reforms, based upon a
broad national base of experience on these issues that, if enacted,
will eliminate some of the most controversial and problematic elements
of the current trust land acquisition process. The result would help
states, local governments and non-tribal stakeholders. It also would
assist trust land applicants by guiding their requests towards a
collaborative process and, in doing so, reduce the delay and
controversy that now routinely accompany acquisition requests.
Thank you for considering these views.

Questions Submitted for the Record to the Hon. David Rabbitt,
Supervisor, Sonoma County Board of Supervisors
and Member of National Association of Counties
Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman
Question 1. Can you expand from your testimony on how
intergovernmental mitigation agreements between tribal and local
governments have benefited land-into-trust projects? And have you seen
a specific benefit to tribal gaming projects that include these
intergovernmental mitigation agreements?
Answer. In Sonoma County and other jurisdictions, the development
and approval of intergovernmental mitigation agreements have greatly
benefited land-into-trust projects, particularly in the case of
proposed gaming operations. While I describe in greater detail Sonoma
County's experience in this regard (please see the answer to question
2), to follow are a number of examples in California that illustrate
how mitigation agreements have yielded favorable outcomes. In all cases
in which county and tribal leaders have come together, the result has
been enhanced respect and renewed government-to-government
partnerships.
In Yolo County, the Board of Supervisors has a long history of
working with the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation to ensure adequate services
in the area where the tribe's casino is operating. In addition to
reaching an agreement for the mitigation of off-reservation impacts
resulting from the tribe's casino expansion and hotel project, Yolo
County has entered into agreements with the tribe to address impacts
created by other tribal trust-land projects in the county.
In southern California, numerous tribes in San Diego County have
worked with the county sheriff's department on law enforcement-related
issues in communities where tribal casinos are located. Additionally,
San Diego County has entered into agreements with several tribes to
address transportation impacts created by various land-into-trust/
casino projects.
On a broader scale, San Diego County and the Santa Ysabel Band of
Digueno Indians reached a comprehensive agreement back in 2005 that
paved the way for the tribe to construct a new large-scale gaming
complex. The tribe's chairman hailed the agreement as a model for
future pacts between tribes and government entities.
In northern California, Humboldt, Placer, and Colusa Counties have
memorandums of understanding in place with various tribes to address
law enforcement-related issues. In the case of Humboldt County, the
Board of Supervisors also signed agreements with several tribes
regarding the operation of a court facility/sub-station and library.
Additionally, Humboldt County and several tribes have agreed to a
cooperative approach for seeking federal assistance to increase water
levels in nearby rivers, and have reached accords with regard to road
improvements.
Madera and Placer Counties also have reached comprehensive
agreements with the tribes that operate casinos in their communities.
While these intergovernmental agreements provide differing approaches
to mitigating off-reservation impacts of Indian casinos, each is
effective in addressing the unique concerns of the community in
question.
Finally, in Santa Barbara County, a tribe that completed a
significant expansion of an existing casino negotiated with the county
a mitigation agreement to address ingress/egress and flood control
issues that arose as a result of the casino's expansion. Santa Barbara
County and the tribe continue to address impacts caused by the tribe's
development of its trust land on a case-by-case basis, reaching
intergovernmental agreements where possible.
The takeaway is that intergovernmental partnerships--memorialized
by cooperative agreements that address the specific impacts of tribal
development projects--benefit tribes, counties, and local communities
and facilitate the fee-to-trust process by helping parties avoid costly
litigation.
Question 2. During your testimony, you mentioned your county has
had successful intragovernmental projects with tribes due to the
presence of information up front during the land-into-trust process.
2a) Please share with the committee specific examples of successful
intergovernmental projects that have benefited from an open exchange of
information that you were involved in, or you are aware of.
Answer. Sonoma County has five federally recognized tribes within
its boundaries: the Dry Creek Rancheria; Lytton Rancheria; Federated
Indians of Graton Rancheria (FIGR); Kashia Band of Pomo Indians; and,
the Cloverdale Rancheria. Except for Cloverdale Rancheria, all of these
tribes have federally established reservation lands, or ``trust
lands,'' within Sonoma County.
Three of these tribes have intergovernmental agreements with the
County intended to mitigate the off-site impacts of various on-
reservation development projects. These intergovernmental agreements
also address other important issues. The agreements reflect a mutual
understanding of the importance of addressing the impacts of tribal
development projects while furthering respectful and mutually
beneficial government-to-government relationships.
In the case of the Dry Creek Rancheria, the Tribe operates the
River Rock Casino near Geyserville, CA. On February 28, 2023, the Board
of Supervisors approved an amended and restated Memorandum of
Understanding (MOA) between the Tribe and the County. The financial
terms under the restated MOA provide for an annual baseline payment of
$750,000 to offset the costs related to County services impacted by
operations on the Dry Creek Rancheria.
With regard to The Lytton Rancheria, the Tribe does not operate a
gaming facility in Sonoma County, but does possess a reservation of
over 500 acres outside the Town of Windsor. A tribal housing
development project is currently under construction, with a winery and
resort development planned for the future. The County entered into an
MOA with the Lytton Rancheria on March 10, 2015 to establish a
framework for government-to-government relations, address the impacts
of the proposed residential housing development, and establish
parameters and processes for addressing the impacts of potential future
tribal development.
Finally, the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria currently
operate the Graton Casino located in Rohnert Park. On June 6, 2023, the
Board of Supervisors approved an Amended and Restated Intergovernmental
Mitigation Agreement (IMA) between the Tribe and the County. The IMA
provides $14,500,000 per year, adjusted annually for CPI, to mitigate
impacts of the gaming facility in a number of key areas, including:
law, justice and public safety; health and human services; traffic,
transportation, and road maintenance; affordable housing; greenhouse
gasses and air quality; fire and emergency services; groundwater and
water conservation projects; tourism impacts; and, socioeconomic
impacts.
2b) Are you aware of any tribal gaming projects that have benefited
from this way of operating, and, if yes, how did that benefit the
project?
Answer. As previously indicated, the Federated Indians of Graton
Rancheria currently operate a casino in Rohnert Park. According to the
Tribe's leadership, the revenue from the gaming project allows the
Tribe to provide programs and services to Tribal Citizens to help them
realize their dreams of self-sufficiency. Absent transparency and
cooperation at the local level and without a mitigation agreement in
place that offsets impacts on public services, projects such as the
Graton Casino typically face increased scrutiny and community
skepticism, if not widespread opposition from local government and
community stakeholders. Based on our experience in Sonoma County, we
strongly believe that tribes--and the projects they operate--as well as
local governments and the surrounding community greatly benefit when
intergovernmental partnerships result in agreements that recognize the
impacts of developments projects.
Additionally, and expanding upon the aforementioned Yolo County
example, I'd note that the County and the Yocha Dehe tribe did not
always have a positive and productive working relationship. Rather, the
parties remained at odds for years over the tribe's proposed Cache
Creek Casino Resort expansion project. After much negotiation, however,
the parties entered into an agreement that allowed the project to move
forward. The comprehensive agreement addresses a number of key issues,
including the mitigation of gaming-related impacts, including language
addressing transportation needs, law enforcement, and fire and
emergency services.
Question 3. You testified during the hearing that state and local
governments would prefer a 120-day window to submit comments during the
land-into-trust process. Could you elaborate further on the benefits of
a longer comment period?
Answer. Many fee-to-trust acquisitions--particularly for large-
scale economic development projects--result in significant impacts to
the surrounding community. Accordingly, it is essential that counties
thoroughly consider and examine the potential ramifications of any
tribal development project, particularly as it relates to the health,
safety, and welfare of community members.
I'd note that as part of the typical zoning, planning, and
permitting process at the local level, counties are responsible for
conducting public outreach and engagement in order to determine how
proposed development projects will impact the community. In doing so,
counties must consider a whole host of issues, including land-use
compatibility, ingress-egress, jurisdictional matters, transportation,
environmental impacts, and many other issues. This process is highly
complex and takes time.
As I indicated in my written testimony, federal law should require
the BIA to provide jurisdictional governments with detailed information
regarding proposed trust land acquisitions, not unlike the public
information required for local planning, zoning and permitting. This
assumes even greater importance since local ordinances and laws are
ultimately preempted by trust-land decisions. In order to provide
counties, our jurisdictional partners, and local communities with
sufficient opportunity to evaluate potential impacts in their entirety,
NACo policy calls for 120 days for parties to review and comment on a
pending fee-to-trust application.
Question 4. Is there anything else you would like to add to your
written testimony on how the Department of the Interior's fee-to-trust
process should be reformed to benefit tribes and state and local
governments?
Answer. For 15 years, tribes and counties--along with other
stakeholders--have been urging Congress to address the implications of
the Carcieri v. Salazar decision. It is long past time for lawmakers to
act.
Moving forward, Congress must pass a single legislative remedy that
accomplishes two essential objectives: put all tribes on equal footing
as it relates to the opportunity to have land taken into trust; and,
establish a fair and balanced trust-land system that takes into account
the legitimate interests of local governments and the communities they
serve.

Ms. Hageman. Thank you very much. We appreciate your
comments and your insight, as well as your personal experience.
I will now recognize Members for 5 minutes of questioning,
and I will start with me.
Since the Carcieri decision was issued in 2009, it has been
unclear how many tribes could be affected by that decision. And
I think for policymakers it is helpful to know the breadth of
this particular problem. I am going to direct this question to
Ms. Isom-Clause.
Does the Department know how many federally recognized
tribes would not be considered ``under Federal jurisdiction''
pursuant to the Carcieri decision?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Thank you for the question, Chair Hageman.
We look at these tribe by tribe, so we don't have kind of
one centralized list that would have all of that. It is a very
fact-intensive and specific dive into the complicated history
of the relationship between----
Ms. Hageman. So, even after 15 years, the Department has
not yet determined how many of our 574 recognized tribes would
be impacted by this decision?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Well, I would also say all tribes are
impacted by this decision, because every tribe is required to
go through this analysis. Some may have kind of more clear
facts and some have more complicated facts, but there is always
an expansion of government resources, tribal resources, and
risk of litigation. So, everyone is impacted. Some have more
complicated histories that take longer to wade through.
Ms. Hageman. OK. What type of land-into-trust applications
tend to draw the most concern or opposition?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Well, we have we have heard from the
Supervisor that gaming applications tend to draw more concern.
But I will note that the majority of fee-to-trust applications
are on reservation, non-controversial, and it is only a tiny 1
to 3 percentage, at most, that are gaming.
Ms. Hageman. But you would agree that the gaming projects
are the ones that tend to be the most controversial.
Ms. Isom-Clause. In some cases they are. And when there are
comments, there is an additional review process.
I want to separate out the fee-to-trust process and gaming,
because the fee-to-trust process is an entirely separate
process. If a tribe wants to take land into trust for gaming,
there is a separate process to go through to determine whether
that land is eligible for gaming. That is another comment
period. There is another NEPA review. So, the fee-to-trust
process is one opportunity for comment; the gaming process is
an entirely different one.
Ms. Hageman. And Mr. Rabbitt, I would like to follow up on
the testimony that you were providing near the end there. You
mentioned the success of intergovernmental mitigation
agreements in California related to gaming compacts. Can you
expand on how this approach has been beneficial?
Mr. Rabbitt. Oh, yes, like I said, we have five agreements.
We have agreements with all five within our county.
There is one within my district, the Federated Grayton
Tribe Rancheria, with a large casino. But prior to that casino
and that land being taken into trust, we did have an agreement
with the Tribe to identify certain known impacts,
transportation for instance, and there was an agreement with
our local transportation authority to make sure that we had
access to the property. Groundwater was a concern, residents
around the site had very shallow wells and spotty groundwater.
So, we had independent, third-party folks come in to
monitor that groundwater to make sure there are no impacts in
the future, but it is just those kinds of things that we put in
place prior that made for a much smoother process and, quite
honestly, alleviated the concerns around the neighborhood and,
I think, made the project that much more successful.
Ms. Hageman. OK. So, you would agree that, with these kinds
of mitigation agreements, it tends to allow for the process to
move forward more quickly as the community itself can
understand what the benefits may be?
Mr. Rabbitt. That has always been my experience. And,
again, as an architect, I can tell you that if someone is going
through and wanting to build something that everyone is up in
arms with, you are more likely to have a slower process, you
are more likely to end up in litigation than if you go through
and actually meet with people prior and come to an agreement
about what that should be.
Ms. Hageman. What happens in those circumstances when a
mitigation agreement cannot be reached between a tribe and a
local government?
Mr. Rabbitt. We totally think that there should be a
Secretarial determination to make sure that those impacts were
properly mitigated. We just want to be part of that
conversation. We want to have that opportunity, and we think it
needs to be a meaningful time frame to make sure that we can
opine and run that by all the different districts, perhaps,
that are also going to be putting services forward.
For instance, in the casino that I mentioned, law
enforcement was not part of the Tribe's purview, nor was the
fire department. So, those were important agreements to get
into place prior to having thousands and thousands of people on
a piece of property----
Ms. Hageman. Well, just very, very quickly, the Department
of the Interior recently updated its Part 151 regulations
governing the fee-to-trust process. Do the revisions address
any of the issues that counties and localities have raised
about the fee-to-trust process over the years?
Mr. Rabbitt. As quickly as I can, I would say no.
Ms. Hageman. OK. I will now recognize the Ranking Member
for 5 minutes of questioning.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
Chairman Pierite and Chair Bryan, I want to ask a couple of
questions about the fact that there are issues that were raised
about the importance of communication, collaboration, and
input. Can I ask each of you if, in the fee-to-trust
applications you have engaged in, did you go through those
kinds of interactions and feedback with local governments and
with interested parties?
We will start with Chair Bryan.
Ms. Bryan. Yes, we have actually engaged with those
counties any time they have a comment period to go through if
you put land into trust, so they have an opportunity to voice
their concerns or any questions they may have.
But I will tell you from our experience, we have almost
given back $37 million to local communities. We know what it is
like not to have much. So, it is important for us to give back.
And it has always been a goal for me, as a leader, to work
collaboratively together with the counties, the cities, and the
state because we are a part of those communities. And if we
work collaboratively together, and we have MOUs with the
various counties, and we also have their support of Montgomery
County, Elmore County, Escambia County, the cities where we are
located. So, we have definitely improved that communication and
that ability to work with the surrounding areas.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you.
Chairman Pierite?
Mr. Pierite. Yes, Tunica-Biloxi went through the same
process. Early on, we established the collaboration, as well as
cooperation, and having an understanding on what gaming will
bring to not only Tunica-Biloxi, but of Avoyelles Parish, as
well as central Louisiana, the jobs that we create.
And this is not only about developing our understanding
about job creations, it is about providing hope, providing a
purpose not only for the tribal community, but for the overall
community, and developing and building that understanding we
have done at a very early stage.
And our relationship with central Louisiana of the non-
tribal community is part of our extended family and vice versa.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you, and I think that the
letters of support that you have submitted exemplify that.
And I think it is really important that these bills we are
talking about today aren't about what the process should be. If
I am understanding it, the bills we are talking about is that
your 2 tribes and all the 548 tribes should be treated equally,
right?
Is that how you see the bills that we are addressing today,
that you want to be able to go through the same process as
every other tribe when you are seeking to take land into trust,
Chairman?
Mr. Pierite. Yes, ma'am. That is accurate. We are in
support of a full Carcieri fix for all 574 tribal governments,
and as well as the Acts the Congress, not to put an emphasis on
the 1 percent that is for the gaming and that is land into
trust for gaming, but the 99 percent. That is what the emphasis
should be on. That is where the focus should be on, because
that 99 percent can be utilized for advanced manufacturing, for
textiles.
If you look at the lay of the land over the last 30 years,
Tunica-Biloxi just celebrated 30 years in gaming. But at the
same time, during the 30 years, over 11.2 million jobs,
advanced manufacturing jobs, left the United States.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Right.
Mr. Pierite. Thousands of textile jobs left the United
States. Tribes can bring them back.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you. I think that both of the
tribal leaders' testimony today, which are the most important
ones that we must listen to, actually emphasize the need to
take into land for other purposes and this addresses that.
Ms. Kathryn Isom-Clause, I was just out meeting with Taos
Pueblo. Will the passage of this bill change any of the laws
and regulations regarding land into trust for gaming?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Thank you for your visit to Taos Pueblo,
first of all. I am glad you were able to be there.
No, this will not change any of the fee-to-trust
applications. It is only a threshold question of whether the
Secretary has authority to take land into trust for a tribe. If
so, then we can proceed through the entire regulatory process
it takes.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. And I have run out of time, but I
wanted to just get this $10 million for just one tribe on
litigation. Will the passage of these bills save the Department
money?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Yes.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you, and I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Carl
for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Carl. Thank you.
Chairwoman Bryan, three quick questions. It is rapid fire
here, so get ready.

Mr. Carl. I keep hearing ``gaming'' popping up here. Are we
talking about gaming on our bill that we are looking at, H.R.
6180?
Ms. Bryan. Absolutely not. This is about parity and all
tribes being treated equally, actually.
I think, as the Interior stated, there is IGRA that you can
go through for the gaming process. And we heard from the
champion on this Carcieri fix, Congressman Cole, that it is
about 1 percent that is to do with gaming.
Mr. Carl. Right.
Ms. Bryan. Less than 1 percent. So, this is not to do with
gaming.
Mr. Carl. When you look at Poarch Creek, and I have been a
County Commissioner for 8 years, so I understand the permitting
process, I understand your developments on the properties that
we are talking about here. I just want to say it is always
first class. You all are a five-star Michelin group. Everything
you all do is first class or not at all. What you all do for
our community is priceless. And I am not talking about just
community, I am talking about the entire state. Most people
don't realize how many different companies actually have sprung
from a simple group of folks in Atmore, Alabama that has
remained simple, and I think that is very important. They have
not forgotten everyone in the process.
Could you elaborate on how the Poarch Creek bill will
enhance the Tribe's ability to serve the community?
Ms. Bryan. It would actually give us the ability to place
land into trust for housing, for a nursing home to take care of
our elders who sacrificed all those years that didn't have
much. That would allow us an opportunity to meet the demanding
needs of our community going forward.
Mr. Carl. And you all do an incredible job. I came and saw
the Boys and Girls Club situation 2 years ago, 3 years ago.
And, of course, I have been there for several situations.
Ms. Bryan. That services over 500 children, and only 10
percent are tribal members.
Mr. Carl. Yes.
Ms. Bryan. It services the community, not just the Poarch
Band of Creek Indians.
Mr. Carl. And Atmore is a very small community. It truly
is, the city of Atmore itself. And I know how you work with the
County Commission and the city there.
Can you discuss the relationships the Tribe has developed
with the county bordering the trust lands, which would be
Mobile County, obviously, Escambia County, Washington County?
Ms. Bryan. Absolutely. We have given to the counties
financially. We have MOUs with them. But most importantly, we
collaborate together to use our tribal dollars along with the
county dollars to help with infrastructure, to maintain roads,
build roads. We have a great relationship with the counties.
And I will tell you this. The letters of support that are a
part of the written testimony, you will see that those counties
are so grateful and appreciative because we do help provide
fire protection, drug task force, we support the drug task
force, we are also working with them on some issues that all of
America is facing, which are mental issues. We are actually in
the process of helping build, hopefully, a rural hospital. We
are trying to collaborate together to build a rural hospital
because with the old one, the maintenance fees are so
exorbitant. So, we are in the process of actually working to do
those types of things within our communities and counties.
Mr. Carl. So, just for the record, I have been working with
the County Commission there in Escambia County. We were going
to replace a bridge, Poarch Creek stepped up, they are going to
actually put the money up with a little bit of help, I hope,
from my folks. But we were able to shift that county money that
was earmarked for that, actually, to another road project. So,
I know the county is happy. They should be.
And our rural health care in America as a whole is
horrible. But again, I know Poarch Creek well enough. They are
not going to let the health in that area go down. And we do
have some problems there and, of course, the whole county, so I
appreciate any help you all are willing to step up on the
health care portion with the hospitals.
With that, Madam Chair, I turn back. Thank you.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Mr. Carl. The Chair now recognizes
Representative Radewagen for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I would like
to yield my time over to the Chairwoman.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you. I would like to get into a bit more
detail about the nature of the Carcieri fix that we are talking
about, and I would like to direct my questions to Chairman
Pierite, as well as Tribal Chair, Ms. Bryan.
Mr. Chairman Pierite, do you think legislatively reforming
the fee-to-trust process along with a Carcieri fix would
benefit both tribes and local communities? And if so, how?
Mr. Pierite. It would benefit both tribes. But the Act
today is for a legislative fix, a Carcieri fix for all tribes.
And I don't want to be on record leaving any tribes behind.
Everything we do, we have to do as a family. Because yes, we
are 574 distinct tribes, individually tribes, but we are one
tribal family, we are one Indian Country. And by having a clean
Carcieri fix, it will allow us to simplify the process of
getting land into trust, and bringing land into trust will
allow us to get ahead of the game as far as economic
opportunities.
I mentioned before about the United States being the
greatest country in the world, but the biggest assets in the
United States are the 574 tribal governments, because those 574
tribal governments, working together with a united effort, can
bring manufacturing back to this great country.
And, again, I mentioned 11.2 million jobs have migrated
over the last 30 years. And we have not only positioned
ourselves to fill that gap, but again, it is not only about job
creation, it is about building hope for the next generation.
It is also about establishing passion, establishing
purpose, aligning purpose for our next generation of workers,
that they have purpose for it to become who they choose to
become by creating that hope, believe in that dream, and having
that ability to put the land into trust, having the ability to
work with Congress, work with the local as well as state
agencies to provide economic opportunities for all, not just
for tribal employees or tribal citizens.
Ms. Hageman. But for the local communities, as well?
Mr. Pierite. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Hageman. OK. And Ms. Bryan, could you please address my
question as to whether reforming the fee-to-trust process along
with the Carcieri fix, how would that benefit both tribes and
the local communities?
Ms. Bryan. I do want to be clear that the Poarch Band of
Creek Indians, we have been very supportive of a national fix
for 15 years since the decision was made. And we are very
supportive, and we will continue to be very supportive.
But Congress has passed bills that address certain tribes,
so we took the parallel approach to do a Poarch-specific bill
because the national fix continues to get stalled, and hasn't
passed for 15 years. So, that is the reason why.
This is nothing new to Congress. They have passed
individual bills before for tribes. So, we decided that, now
that we have the support of our Alabama Delegation and all the
great things that we are doing, we have diversified our
portfolio with over 40 different companies that has nothing to
do with gaming.
And we have been afforded those opportunities because we
have worked with our state, we have created jobs, have
contracts with NASA, Department of Defense. So, we just want to
remove the cloud that is over the Tribe of uncertainty because
of the Carcieri decision. So, this will be very helpful for us
to remove that cloud of uncertainty and provide benefits that
we need for our people.
Ms. Hageman. OK. Thank you.
The Chair now recognizes Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon for her 5
minutes of questioning.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Madam Chair, and good
morning, everybody here.
Deputy Assistant Secretary, to what extent has the Carcieri
decision increased the need for the Department to defend land-
into-trust decisions in the Court?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Thank you for the question.
We know that at least 12 Federal court cases have been
brought, and over 20 cases before the Interior Board of Indian
Appeals since the Carcieri decision. And as we know, Federal
court litigation can take years, maybe 2 years, maybe 10 years.
And the IBIA also can take up to 5 years to issue a decision,
which can then be appealed to Federal court and be another case
for us to litigate.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Have the tribes reported to the
Department that they are facing more litigation challenges
since this case?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Yes, absolutely.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. And are there any concerns that H.R.
6180 or H.R. 1208 could lead into unintended consequences?
And what recommendation, if any, does the Department have
for either bill?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Thank you for the question.
The Carcieri fix would restore the status quo that was
working for 75 years, and it would be returning to settled
expectations. So, we don't foresee any consequences that would
not be intended, but merely a settling of expectations again.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. And you don't have any recommendation
for any of those bills?
Ms. Isom-Clause. We just support both bills.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. So, no amendments to any of them?
Ms. Isom-Clause. No, no amendments. Thank you.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. I was reviewing, and I would like to
know how the Department of the Interior sought to address the
concerns of state and local governments who believe, whether
rightly or wrongly, that they do not have enough involvement in
the land-into-trust application process.
Ms. Isom-Clause. Well, as we have mentioned here, we have
recently gone through a rulemaking process with the 151
regulations. We received hundreds of comments on those, all of
which were addressed as part of the process, and many were from
states and local communities about our process.
We made changes from the proposed rule to the final rule
based on those comments. We kept in a comment period, a
notification and comment period, even for on-reservation
acquisitions, just to ensure that everyone is able to be heard
when they need to be. If those comments are submitted, we will
consider them.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. I will have a question for Supervisor
Rabbitt.
How will having more information up front about the land
acquisition application benefit both tribes and counties during
the Part 151 process?
Mr. Rabbitt. I am sorry. Having more information?
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Yes.
Mr. Rabbitt. Oh, I think having more information and,
really, having that communication is vitally important.
And I do recognize that, and again I have made mention of
my own county, that individual counties and individual tribes
certainly do have excellent relationships. You have heard some
of those examples here today. But, unfortunately, it is not
universal, and Congress does have a unique opportunity to fix a
broken process and encourage successful intergovernmental
mitigation agreements and, I think, also streamline the
process.
Honestly, by fixing one word I don't think you take care of
half of the problem that is in front of you, and I do think
that our county is a good example of having those
relationships, having those intergovernmental agreements in
place, and having successful projects and successful tribal
projects because of it.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. You said in your testimony that any
legislation to restore the Interior Secretary's authority, and
I quote, ``much-needed, long-overdue reforms in the Federal
Government, deeply flawed trust land decision-making process.''
Could you elaborate on this and discuss some of the proposals
you believe Congress should enact to reform the land trust
process?
Mr. Rabbitt. I think part of that is some of the noticing
requirements. Even with the 151 changes that were made, they
are really not transparent. They really don't give enough
notice.
We would need to reach out not just to the community, but
to the districts that might be involved: fire districts, water
districts, whomever they might be that might be impacted or
affected by taking that land into trust. They should have an
opportunity to provide some input on that and for the Secretary
to take that all into consideration.
But with the short time period, the lack of transparency,
counties are sometimes, honestly, the last to know. And we just
believe that we need to be at the table, having a conversation,
understanding what these impacts are all about.
And I will be honest. In our county, and I can't speak for
all counties, and I know I am here as a NACo representative, it
is not always about the money. There are those services that
still need to be provided, and there are the impacts that need
to be mitigated, and the two don't always go hand in hand, but
they need to be taken into consideration.
We have had successful projects because we sat down and had
those agreements beforehand. It is great that the tribes in our
county volunteered to do that, but right now there is no
requirement for the tribes to sit down and do that, or for the
counties, for that matter. And we just think here is an
opportunity, and we have been saying this for 15 years as well,
because we totally accept the fact that the Carcieri is a
broken system and it creates, unfortunately, two classes of
tribes, and that is all wrong. We would love to see it fixed,
but we would like to see it fixed with the additional
conditions that really encourage that conversation, that
collaboration, all the things that we talk about that have
happened, but just make sure that we can encourage that and
have that be universal across the country.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Supervisor.
My time expired, I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Chairman
Cole for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Cole. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and it is very
generous of you. Again, thank you for allowing me to
participate in your hearing today.
Chairwoman Bryan, let me ask you. And you alluded to this,
but I am going to ask you to think a little more broadly about
the total cost that the Tribe absorbed through the Carcieri
since the Carcieri decision in terms of, obviously, the cost of
legal representation, but also delayed projects, things that
weren't done that could have been done. Do you have any kind of
estimate for what that has done to the Poarch Creek Nation?
Ms. Bryan. I will tell you, I have with me our Attorney
General. The $10 million that I shared with you, it is probably
more than that, I would say, because of the hours that our
Attorney General, I don't know how many hours she has logged,
but we have several attorneys that in-house have had to work on
this to take away from those resources that we needed to
address internally for our tribal government. We had to pull
our attorneys off and put them on these cases because it was
that important to our Tribe.
And that $10 million, every day that is what motivates me,
is helping people improve their quality of life and giving them
opportunity, giving them the tools that they need and
opportunity for advancement. So, that $10 million would have
done so much for our community, it would have saved a lot of
time from our legal department. We would have used that $10
million, we are in the process of building an elder care center
where we feed our elders lunch. So, that $10 million could have
done a lot for our members and our citizens.
Mr. Cole. And these are costs you would not have had, had
it not been for the Carcieri decision. In other words, you
weren't expending these kind of resources before that decision
in 2009.
Ms. Bryan. No, sir, we weren't.
Mr. Cole. So, that is why the system is broken, in my view,
Madam Chair. It is really a court decision that has caused the
problem.
Ms. Bryan. It has cost the Federal Government, taxpayers'
dollars, too, as well, because Department of the Interior,
Department of Justice, you know, they have to travel. They have
to have attorneys work on it, travel to the 11th Circuit. So,
it is costing tribes and the Federal Government a lot of money
on these frivolous lawsuits.
Mr. Cole. Let me go, if I may, to Deputy Assistant
Secretary, I hope I get it right, Isom-Clause.
Ms. Isom-Clause, would you have a rough estimate of how
many cases have been brought contesting BIA trust acquisition
approval because of Carcieri?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Yes. Thank you for the question,
Representative.
Our rough estimate is at least 12 Federal court cases and
over 20 cases before the IBIA have been brought since the
Carcieri decision.
Mr. Cole. And when you get into one of these suits, and I
know some of them are still ongoing, but how long does it take
you to actually work through that and come to a settlement, on
average?
Ms. Isom-Clause. At minimum, 2 years. We know it has been
up to 10 years in some cases, and that is in Federal court. And
in the IBIA it can be up to 5 years for the court to issue a
decision, which can then be followed by a challenge in Federal
District Court if the agency's decision is upheld.
Mr. Cole. And is there any way you could tell us how did it
work pre-Carcieri and post-Carcieri?
How much more difficult, if at all, it made it for the
Department to come to relatively speedy decisions in these
matters?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Sure. I mean, it is difficult to estimate
exactly the time because it varies so much. But typically
through the process we go through title reviews, environmental
reviews, regulatory reviews, and then we add on this extra
layer of a legal review of whether a tribe is under a Federal
jurisdiction. So, that is researching the tribe's history and
documents, maybe going back to the tribe for more information,
which can take some months to get through that process. And
then, as you have mentioned, tacking on added litigation on the
back end.
Mr. Cole. I am trying to remember, Madam Chair, and I would
need to check this out, but the Indian Reorganization Act, I
think, listed fewer than 200 tribes that were recognized at the
time. I recall it being more like 130. So, if there are 570-odd
tribes out there, we put a lot of people that for years had
been moving land into trust operating under one set, and this
was precedented under Democrats and Republicans, there was no
difference, the Secretary was moving along. So, this is one
where the Supreme Court really did throw a wrench in the works,
so to speak, and made it very difficult.
I just want to end with this. I think you could multiply
what these tribes have gone through dozens, if not hundreds of
times, that other tribes have dealt with this. Again, it wasn't
broken before. I don't think this fixed it, it made it a lot
worse. And we can look at other things, but I think we ought to
look at restoring what existed and worked before, and did not
cost tribes huge delays and millions of dollars' worth of
litigation, and not to mention the uncertainty that comes when,
literally, you are contested as to whether or not your land is
actually protected or not.
With that, thank you again for the hearing. I really,
really appreciate it. Thank you for allowing me to participate.
I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Chairman Cole, you make a compelling case, and
your insight and history has been invaluable today.
Mr. Cole. Thank you.
Ms. Hageman. So, thank you for being willing to join us. I
know that you have other commitments, and in fact, I believe
you are chairing another Committee right now, as we speak.

Mr. Cole. Yes, I am.
Ms. Hageman. So, you are kind of magical, too, which is
always nice.
The Chair now recognizes Chairman Westerman for 5 minutes
of questioning.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and to the
witnesses, and I also wanted to thank my friend, Chairman Cole,
for taking time out of a very, very busy schedule this week. We
have three appropriation bills on the Floor, but you know this
issue is important to him because he took time to come over to
the Natural Resources Committee to be involved, as he has been
very involved all along.
Ms. Isom-Clause, over the past decade there have been some
that have questioned whether there are standards or limits on
the Secretary's authority to place land in trust, pursuant to
the Indian Reorganization Act. In previous years, the
administration has pointed to its 151 regulations.
So, my question to you: Are there statutory limits on the
Secretary's authority to place land into trust for tribes?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Well, the IRA, of course, authorizes the
Secretary to take land into trust. It is not a limit, but an
authorization. And then our regulations provide the guidelines
of all of the factors that need to be met in terms of
documentation and legal reviews and regulatory reviews. So,
that kind of provides our limits and how we look at
applications.
Mr. Westerman. But can't regulations change from
administration to administration?
And aren't these really self-imposed regulations?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Yes, they can change, and the Department
issues the regulations. So, yes, we impose them on ourselves.
Mr. Westerman. So, could the Department change the
regulations and do a better job now than what is being done?
Or do you think there needs to be a bigger fix by Congress
for the Department to be able to do their job correctly?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Thank you for the question.
Our testimony today is focused on Carcieri, which we hope
it can be separated from the land-into-trust process by just
kind of knocking out this threshold question of the Secretary's
authority.
We did just go through a process to update our 25 CFR Part
151 regulations, which has taken place over the last few years.
It has involved many tribal consultations and public comment
periods, many, many comments that we received from local
communities, states, and tribes, and we did our best in taking
that all into account and trying to streamline the process and
make it more efficient and better overall for tribes.
Mr. Westerman. Talking about making it more efficient, how
were concerns from states and local communities taken into
consideration during the land-to-trust process?
Ms. Isom-Clause. States and local communities are given 30
days of notice and opportunity to comment, and any of those
comments that are submitted are taken into account as part of
the application.
Mr. Westerman. I guess it can be a broad range of comments
and issues. Are there requirements for the Department to take
local concerns about zoning, land use, or other similar issues
into consideration?
Ms. Isom-Clause. Yes, that is specifically part of the
regulations, that we do take that into consideration.
And, again, the vast majority of land-into-trust
applications are not controversial. They are often on-
reservation, consolidating tribal land holdings. So, kind of
clarifying jurisdiction and making tribal governance simpler
because consolidating their tribal homelands can make
jurisdictional boundaries a little clearer.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you.
Supervisor Rabbitt, the Department is supposed to provide
notice to impacted state and local governments when fee-to-
trust applications are submitted. In your experience, what has
this actually looked like in practice?
Mr. Rabbitt. Honestly, a fire drill. Thirty days is a very
short period of time.
And, again, it is not just the county proper itself,
because it is also those districts that serve that land. So,
then we have to reach out to those districts in order to get
them to be able to give feedback. Like you, we are a public
body, and we need to take that information back not just from
staff, but actually from the public. It is their land, as well,
at that point in time, and getting that information back from
the boards of those different districts.
So, 30 days, in my opinion, and I think in the counties'
opinions, is woefully inadequate. We would love to see
something more like 120. And I think it is one of those things
where if you go slow to go fast, that you actually will have a
better project, long term, if you make sure that you compile
all the comments thoughtfully and not just rushed in and
boilerplate it down, or comments that may go above and beyond
even the scope of the project, but just wanting to cover those
topics. And I think 30 days is just inadequate, 120, 90,
whatever. Whatever can be more reasonable in terms of getting
that information would be beneficial.
Mr. Westerman. It almost seems like a process where the
Department moves slow, but wants everybody else to move fast.
Mr. Rabbitt. That happens.
Mr. Westerman. Yes. I yield back.
Ms. Hageman. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the
Ranking Member for a UC request.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Madam Chairwoman, thank you.
I ask unanimous consent to submit into the record the
Department of the Interior's new land acquisition regulations,
which I would note were developed over a year of seeking input
from state, local, and tribal governments.
Ms. Hageman. So ordered. Thank you.

Ms. Leger Fernandez. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent
to enter into the record the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which
sets the standards for conducting gaming on tribal lands, just
to clarify that that is indeed a separate standard, and
separate from the issue of whether all tribes should be treated
with parity in this process.
Ms. Hageman. So ordered. Thank you. Without objection.

https://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II24/20240626/117352/HHRG-

Ms. Hageman. I want to thank the witnesses for your
valuable testimony, and I also want to thank the Members and
those folks who waived on today and joined us for your
questioning, as well. This is an important issue that I think
we need to be addressing these long-term challenges and see if
we can find some resolution for all of our tribes.
The members of the Committee may have some additional
questions for the witnesses, and we will ask you to respond to
these in writing if they are submitted.
Under Committee Rule 3, members of the Committee must
submit such questions to the Committee Clerk by 5 p.m. on
Monday, July 1, 2024, and the hearing record will be held open
for 10 business days for these responses.
If there is no further business, without objection, the
Subcommittee stands adjourned.

ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION

Mr. Brad Mehaffy, REM
NEPA Compliance Officer
National Indian Gaming Commission
1441 I Street, N.W., Suite 9100
Washington, DC 20005
Re: Proposed Approval of a Management Contract for the Expansion of
Existing Gaming Facility by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians,
Wetumpka, Alabama
Dear Mr. Mehaffy:
On October 3 2006, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(ACHP) received the additional documentation regarding the referenced
undertaking. ACHP requested this information in response to your
notification that the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was
reviewing the Poarch Band of Creek Indians' (Poarch Band) proposed
management contract for expansion of the existing gaming facility on
Hickory Ground, a property listed in the National Register of Historic
Places. Based upon this documentation, it is apparent that activities
undertaken by the Poarch Band prior to the completion of the review
required by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) have adversely affected the National Register-listed property.
According to the documentation provided, the Poarch Band sponsored
extensive investigations and ultimately data recovery at Hickory Ground
between 1988 and the present. The investigations included
archaeological site identification surveys within the approximately 16-
acre trust property and the approximately 5-acre tract of fee land. As
a result, a multi-component archaeological site, Hickory Ground, was
delineated, boundaries expanded, and finally, extensive archaeological
data recovery was undertaken, including the removal of numerous human
burial. As we understand, the recovered remains, artifacts, and site
documentation are in various stages of analysis and curation by the
Poarch Band's consultants.
Regrettably, the archaeological surveys and data recovery were not
carried out in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. Since the
Section 106 process must be initiated by a Federal agency prior to the
initiation of project activities, it is unclear why the applicant, a
tribe with a tribal historic preservation office approved by the
National Park Service pursuant to Section 101(d)(2) of the NHPA,
proceeded with project planning and archeological investigations. As
you know, the Federal agency must consult with the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO), any Indian tribes that attach religious
and cultural significance to historic properties affected by the
undertaking, and other appropriate stakeholders, and provide adequate
notification to the public in carrying out the steps of the Section 106
review.
Based on the information provided, there was no Federal agency
review of the archaeological investigations carried out by the Poarch
Band; no consultation with the Alabama SHPO prior to excavation of the
portion of the site on fee lands, and no consultation with any other
Indian tribe, particularly the Muscogee Creek Nation. The initial
notification of the ACHP (see 36 CFR 800.6(a)(1)) did not occur until
after the destruction of the site. Furthermore, there is no indication
that the public has been notified about the nature of the undertaking
and its effects on historic properties (36 CFR 800.3(e)).
In your correspondence, you indicate that the Poarch Band completed
more than 90% of the archaeological data recovery within the area of
potential effect for the proposed project. In the initial letter to the
ACHP regarding this project, you invited us to participate in
consultation to resolve the potential adverse effects of the
undertaking. You have also indicated that NIGC intends to invite the
Alabama SHPO to participate in any further Section 106 consultation,
and have outlined steps NIGC will take to complete the Section 106
review process for any areas where there has been no land disturbance.
NIGC has indicated that it proposes to develop a memorandum of
agreement with all parties following consultation.
Please note, however, that Section 110(k) of the NHPA requires that
Each Federal agency shall ensure that the agency will not grant
a loan, loan guarantee, permit, license, or other assistance to
an applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of
section 106 of this Act, has intentionally significantly
adversely affected a historic property to which the grant would
relate, or having legal power to prevent it, allowed such
significant adverse effect to occur, unless the agency, after
consultation with the Council, determines that circumstances
justify granting such assistance despite the adverse effect
created or permitted by the applicant (16 U.S.C. 470h-2(k)).
While NIGC has provided documentation regarding archaeological work
conducted to date, we have no indication of NIGC's views regarding the
applicability of Section 110(k) and no record of the views of the
Alabama SHPO and others, specifically the Muscogee Creek Nation
regarding this matter. In accordance with Section 800.9(c)(2 of the
ACHP's regulations, NIGC must determine whether or not the Poarch
Band's actions were undertaken with the intent to avoid the
requirements of Section 106. If NIGC determines that this did occur,
NIGC should notify the ACHP and provide documentation specifying the
circumstances under which the adverse effects to the historic property
occurred and the degree of damage to the integrity of the historic
property. This documentation must include any views obtained from the
applicant, SHPO, and other parties known to be interested in the
undertaking. Within thirty days of receiving such information, unless
otherwise agreed to by NIGC, the ACHP will provide the agency with its
opinion as to whether circumstances justify NIGC granting its approval
to the applicant and any possible mitigation of the adverse effect. If,
after considering the views of the ACHP, NIGC determines to grant its
approval, NIGC should consult further with the ACHP and other
consulting parties to conclude a memorandum of agreement for treatment
of the remaining effects to historic properties resulting from the
project.
Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter
further, please contact Valerie Hauser, Native American Program
Coordinator.
Sincerely,
Don Klima,
Office of Federal Agency Programs

Re: Coalition of Large Tribes Opposition to H.R. 6180/S. 3263
Dear Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, Chair Westerman, and
Ranking Member Grijalva:
The Coalition of Large Tribes (COLT) is an intertribal organization
representing the interests of the more than 50 tribes with reservations
of 100,000 acres or more, constituting more than 95% of Indian lands in
the United States and encompassing approximately one half of the Native
American population. We write now to voice our opposition to H.R. 6180/
S. 3263. As an organization representing multiple tribes, we are
concerned that this legislation wrongfully seeks to benefit one tribe
and will set a precedent that harms hundreds of others. For this
reason, we oppose this proposed legislation.
To be sure, how to address the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in
Carcieri v. Salazar has generated a good deal of debate and controversy
over the last 16 years. While many may disagree on how to effectuate a
proper Carcieri fix, we believe strongly that the solution is not
singling out one tribe for favorable treatment to the detriment of
others. The Court's Carcieri decision affects a multitude of tribes,
and yet this proposed legislation seeks only to help the tribe that
already has the most resources. No doubt, should this proposed
legislation become law, the multitude of other tribes excluded from
this legislation--whose need for a Carcieri fix is much greater--will
be left at a significant disadvantage. The passage of single-tribe
legislation will inevitably diminish the political will to achieve
additional Carcieri fixes, and it sets a precedent that will require
every affected tribe to seek to address Carcieri through individual
legislation. There is no justification for passing a one-off piece of
legislation to help the wealthiest of tribes when Indian Country and
Congress should be working together towards a solution that will help
all tribes affected by the Court's decision in Carcieri.
Second, the passage of this legislation would also set a dangerous
precedent for sacred sites by rewarding the tribe that has used gaming
as a weapon to destroy and desecrate the burial grounds of other tribes
and, in doing so, incentivize more such acts in the future. There are
many tribes negatively impacted by Carcieri that have not engaged in
violations of federal law and have not defiled sacred sites listed on
the National Register of Historic Places. Thus, if any tribe is to be
rewarded in such an exclusive manner, it should not be the tribe whose
course of conduct violates some of the most fundamentally basic moral
codes understood by sister tribes throughout Indian Country.
Finally, while we can all agree that a Carcieri fix is essential,
the desecration of Hickory Ground in Wetumpka, Alabama, serves to
demonstrate why any proposed Carcieri fix legislation must include
protections for sacred sites located within the historical homelands of
removed tribes. The heresy of Hickory Ground was shocking and
demoralizing. It would be beyond shameful to create a law that invites
the destruction of a Native sacred site protected on the National
Register of Historic Places to happen again. Thus, any proposed
legislation seeking to address Carcieri must provide removed tribes
with the ability and authority to protect their sacred sites and the
burials of their relatives within their homelands. We all agree that
gaming is a critical form of economic development that supports tribal
sovereignty and tribal self-governance. No one wants to stand in the
way of a tribe's ability to engage in gaming. But there is no need for
any tribe to engage in gaming on another tribe's burial ground. Thus,
protections to prevent repeating what happened at Hickory Ground are
critical to any proposed Carcieri fix legislation.
Thank you for considering the position and perspective of COLT. We
hope you will move away from H.R. 6180 and S. 3263 and instead focus on
legislation that will benefit all tribes in Indian Country, not one,
and that you will include protection for sacred sites in any land
legislation. This is the unanimous policy of COLT and we hope you
afford our views of our broad consensus the weight they deserve.
Sincerely,
Hon. Marvin Weatherwax, Jr.,
Chairman, and
Member, Blackfeet Tribal Business Council

Re: U.S. Department of Interior (HCRS) letter 712
Dear Sir:
Application is hereby made for funds from the Historic Preservation
Discretionary Fund Grant-in-Aid program. This application should be
considered under Category #1 as the proposed undertaking both assists
in preserving part of a historic district of Native Americans and
results in the direct participation of Native American Groups.
Hickory Ground (1-Ee-89) is of major importance in the history of
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. It has supplied many of the important
leaders in Creek history. One of particular note was Alexander
McGillvray.
``O-Che-au-po-fau''; from the Muskogean ``Oche-ub'', a hickory
tree, and ``po-fau'', in or among, called by the traders ``Hickory
Ground'' (Owen 1921:1088). Hickory Ground was located on the east bank
of the Coosa River, south of the present-day Wetumpka approximately two
miles above the French Fort Toulouse (Pickett 1962:229,343,357; Owen
1921:1088; Hemperly 1969:224; Brewer 1955:25; Swanton 1952:162).
Hickory Ground was an Upper Creek town and by tradition was
originally inhabited by the Coosa or Abihkas (Corkran 1967:307; Owen
1921:1088; Swanton 1922:242). It was here that Lachland McGillvray
married Sehoy Marchand in 1745, and established a trading house (Brewer
1955:15; Debo 1967:38; Swanton 1922:242). Lachland and Sehoy were the
parents of Alexander McGillvray an important Creek leader having
special trade relationships with the Panton Leslie and Company trading
house in Pensacola.
With the French established at Ft. Toulouse McGillvray's residence
at Hickory Ground was the center of Spanish, French, British and
American intrigue. Don Pedro Olivier, a frenchman in the Spanish
Service, spent many months at Hickory Ground (Debo 1967:52; Pickett
1962:413). Hickory Ground was loyal to the British during the
revolutionary war, and was a place of refuge for many loyalists (Brewer
1955:25-26; Corkran 1967:307-308). President Washington sent Col.
Willett to Hickory Ground to encourage Alexander McGillvray to come to
the capitol at New York for treaty negotiations (Brewer 1955:27; Pound
1951:58). Hickory Ground was visited by Benjamin Hawkins, the first
american agent to the Creeks, many times (Pound 1951;111; Hemperly
1969:224; Owen 1921:1088; Swanton 1952:154).
During the Creek War of 1813-1814, Otchiapofa was listed as a
hostile Creek town, and was visited by Tecumseh. Here he was able to
enlist more followers (Halbert and Ball 1969;68,79,99-100; Pickett
1962:511). As a hostile Creek town Hickory Ground was not un-noticed by
Andrew Jackson. The Jackson Trace was opened primarily so Jackson could
move his army to Hickory Ground (Brewer 1955:15; Pickett 1962:592).
From the above it is apparent that Hickory Ground was involved in
nearly all the major historic events in the southeast before the
removal of Creeks from Alabama in 1836. With the proper techniques and
data recovery methods Creek involvement in these events can be studied.
More importantly the effects of these activities upon the Creek Nation
can be understood. Hickory Ground has the potential of measuring
changes in the political, social, and economic structures of the Creek
people in pre-removal times.
As outlined by the Secretary of the Interior this project is
designed to meet the general and specific standards for acquisition as
applies to this particular site.
THE USE OF THE LAND
Acquisition of the property is principally a protection measure.
Acquisition will prevent development on the property. All historic
structures on the site have been destroyed. What is left consists of
below surface remains. Through proper archaeological methods and
techniques these below surface features can reveal a tremendous amount
of information about the Creek way of life in the late 1700's and early
18OO's. Upon gaining fee-simple title to the land as called for in this
proposal plans will be developed to minimize continued destruction of
the archaeological resources. Prior to any type of development of the
property a scientifically sound archaeological program will be
conducted to mitigate or minimize effects upon the historic resources.
The property will serve as valuable resource for cultural
enrichment of Creek people. The site can serve as a place where classes
of Creek culture may be held. The Creek people in Oklahoma pride in
heritage and ties to original homeland can only be enhanced. There is
still an existing Hickory Ground tribal town in Oklahoma. They will be
pleased to know their home in Alabama is being preserved. The site may
serve as an open air classroom where Creek youth can learn of their
heritage. Interpretive programs can be developed around the vast array
of history connected with Hickory Ground. The Creek Nation East of the
Mississippi, Inc. (Poarch Band of Creeks) has already conducted CETA
sponsored training in archaeological methods for Creek youth. The
Hickory Ground site will continue to enhance their understanding of
their history, without excavation.
SPECIFIC STANDARDS OF PROTECTION
For most cases land in the hands of Realtors and developers is
viewed from the prospective of income producing property. At this
location in order to have a commercial development the land will have
to be cleared and leveled. In order to halt the destruction planned for
the site and insure against future destruction funds for acquisition of
fee simple title are requested.
As the landowner is very much interested in developing the property
for commercial purposes it is felt acquisition of fee simple title is
necessary to prevent destruction of the site. The land was scheduled
for commercial development. Plans for development called for
construction of Recreation facilities and multi-family dwellings.
To the immediate east of the property is existing commercial
property. These commercial properties include a Hardees and local
restaurant. To the immediate south ajoining the land of the site, a
contract has been entered into with an option to by agreed upon between
Aeronov Corporation and the landowner, Mr. W.D. DeBardeleben. This
agreement is based upon Aeronov's plans for construction of a Kmart
store upon the property.
Mr. Gary Skaret and the landowner have plans for constructing
apartments for low-income and handicapped persons upon the land to the
immediate west of the proposed Kmart and to the immediate south of the
Hickory Ground site.
From the forgoing it is evident that the surrounding area, and
indeed the land, the site itself, is prime development land and may
very well be bulldozed and cleared soon.
The property is in the process of being nominated to the National
Register of Historic Places. The Alabama State Historic Preservation
Officer has determined the property eligible and the required forms are
now being processed by the Keeper of the National Register.
Project does conform to Secretary of Interior Standard for Historic
preservation projects. Specific end products of the project is to
provide protection for a particularly important site in Creek History,
while providing a foundation for innovative educational programs.
Hickory Grounds may also be a place where Creeks from Oklahoma may
return and visit their ancestral home.
Upon approval of the proposal the site will be maintained almost
entirely by minority groups. One half the appraised value will be
donated to Creek Nation Foundation, Inc. in Oklahoma. The grants-in-aid
proposal is designed to be awarded to Creek Nation East of the
Mississippi, Inc. (Poarch Band of Creeks). Both are Native American
groups. The Creek Nation Foundation, Inc. represents western Creeks
that were removed to Oklahoma from Alabama. While Creek Nation East of
the Mississippi, Inc. (Poarch Band of Creeks) represents a group of
Creeks that were excluded from removal and remained in Alabama in the
Mobile Region.
Under this plan the property will be jointly owned by both groups
of Creeks. They will be equally responsible for the protection and care
of the site. This is an opportunity for the Creek people to enter into
cultural resource management by guarding and preserving a site directly
connected with their culture history.
The significant aspect of this project is the protection by
acquisition of a historic Creek site by Creeks. Archaeological
resources, directly related to Native Americans have for the most part
been managed and investigated by non-Native Americans. This is an
opportunity for Native Americans to manage their archaeological
records. Presently on staff with the Creek Nation East of the
Mississippi, Inc. (Poarch Band of Creeks) is Larry D. Haikey who has a
Master's degree in Anthropology. Mr. Haikey is well trained and aware
of the proper management of archaeological resources. He will act as
advisor to the tribal councils on plans for permanent protection of the
site.
Time for complete acquisition of the site is not expected to take
longer than forty-five days. This time schedule includes time necessary
for mailing contracts between Oklahoma and Alabama. Both tribal groups
will have adequate time for review by respective lawyers and approval
of council meetings.
The Creek Nation East of the Mississippi, Inc. (Poarch Band of
Creeks) agrees to the provisions of covenants and letter of agreements.
They are also aware of the information needed for an acquisition
Project Completion Report. A detailed completion report will be the
responsibility of Creek Nation East of the Mississippi, Inc., and will
be done by Mr. Haikey as a part of his normal job activities, at no
cost to the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS)
Project.
Consultant and technical assistance will be in the nature of legal
services. The property deed and other agreements will need to be
legally sound with respects to the by-laws and intents of the
corporations. These legal services will be the responsibilities of the
respective tribal groups.
Mr. John Charloe, Attorney for Creek Nation Office of Justice, will
handle legal matters for Creek Nation Foundation, Inc. in Oklahoma.
Mrs. Hollis Geer, Legal Services Corporation of Alabama, will handle
matters for Creek Nation East of the Mississippi, Inc. Technical advice
concerning the site as to maintaining its archaeological integrity will
be handled by Larry Haikey and other archaeologists with interest in
Creek cultural history.
Hickory Ground fits in a historic preservation district which
includes the area of Wetumpka, Alabama. There have been numerous maps
of Creek sites referenced in historic documents as being located in
this area (Swanton 1922; Owen 1921). Swanton (1922) provides numerous
maps of Creek Tribal town locations at various times in their history.
One, (Appendix A) is partially reproduced for enclosure with this
proposal, it shows the location of Hickory Ground as concerns this
project and in the time period for which the site has been dated. As is
evidenced by the other town locations on the map the area was heavily
populated by Creek in the pre-removal period. Some of the other towns
have been located and are on record in Alabama archaeological site
files. An item of importance concerning Hickory Ground is the immediacy
of its near destruction. The others that have been located are not as
close to destruction at this time.
A matter of great importance about this project is the involvement
of Creek People through their government in the management and
protection of their archaeological resources. It can be safely said
that anthropology and archaeology have had a bad name among Native
American groups. This has stemmed from the archaeologists being more
concerned in the research potential of the sites rather than the
significance as they relate to Native Americans. The excavation and
research has been carried out without very much returned to the Indian
community, causing Native Americans to distrust the motives of
archaeologists.
The Creek Nation is attempting to take an active role in management
of their cultural resources. In the winter of 1978 and 1979 the Creek
Nation East of the Mississippi cooperated with the University of
Alabama in Birmingham on an archaeological excavation to test an area
of burial remains. Attention was called to the site after treasure
hunters removed a couple of burials.
In the summer of 1979 the Creek Nation East of the Mississippi
conducted a CETA Title VI training program in archaeology. The main
emphasis of this program was to train young Creek people in the proper
techniques of archaeology. It was hoped that some of these young people
would continue into the field and help preserve Creek archaeological
resources.
Destruction of archaeological resources in Alabama adversely
effects the profession of Archaeology, while destroying the cultural
history of Creek people. There is an increased recognition in the field
of archaeology of the need for Native Americans and archaeologists to
work together in the cultural resource management area (Lipe 1977:22-
23; Schiffer and Gumerman 1977:586). Creek People feel that this
proposed project would do a great deal toward bridging the
communication gap between archaeology and Native Americans.

Re: H.R. 6180
Dear Chair Westerman and Ranking Member Grijalva:
As the Principal Chief of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, I write to
formally submit my Nation's Written Testimony for the record in
opposition to H.R. 6180. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation opposes this
legislation for five reasons: (1) the legislation will selectively help
one Tribe to the detriment of others; (2) the legislation rewards one
Tribe for conduct that is morally reprehensible and violative of the
cultural code all other sister tribes collectively abide; (3) the
legislation encourages other Tribes to engage in similar immoral
conduct, creating a significant threat that more sacred sites will be
destroyed in the homelands of forcibly removed Tribal Nations, (4) the
advocacy for this legislation has been predicated on lies and
falsehoods, and (5) the legislation would effectively grant a people
``successor in interest'' status to treaties that an entirely separate
Tribal Nation signed with the United States. For these reasons, we
oppose H.R. 6180. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation advocates for a clean
Carcieri fix for all Tribal Nations that empowers removed or displaced
Tribal Nations to protect their sacred sites in their homelands.
The advocacy for the advancement of H.R. 6180 is full of
falsehoods, and we are providing documentation that demonstrates the
nefarious and misleading nature of Poarch's propaganda. As detailed in
this testimony, the land Poarch is asking Congress to confirm as their
trust lands is the homeland of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, including a
ceremonial site and burial ground for one of Muscogee (Creek) Nation's
tribal towns, Hickory Ground. Poarch is not part of the Muscogee
(Creek) Nation and they are not successors-in-interest to our treaties.
They descend from individuals who willfully divorced themselves from
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in the early 1800s in exchange for land in
southwest Alabama, where they historically lived. Ironically, several
of the treaties Poarch seeks to claim as their own are treaties the
Muscogee (Creek) Nation was coerced into signing with the United
States, in part, because Poarch's ancestors fought with Andrew Jackson
against our ancestors. Having betrayed us, they relinquished their
affiliation with the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, avoided removal, and
received land grants near Tensaw, Alabama.
Poarch's attacks on the Muscogee (Creek) Nation continue today, not
by use of bayonets, but by bulldozers and backroom casino deals. Their
claims to our lands are both legally and morally indefensible. They are
not us.
We hope that by submitting this testimony, we can give a voice to
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and Hickory Ground, urging you to seriously
consider the egregious, immoral and unlawful activities that H.R. 6180
would condone.
I. The Legislation Will Selectively Help One Tribe to the Detriment of
Others
First, there can be no question that the Supreme Court's decision
in Carcieri v. Salazar has prevented many Tribal Nations from taking
land into trust. While trust lands can be used for economic
development, the primary purpose of the United States holding lands in
trust on behalf of tribes is to protect, preserve and restore tribal
homelands, including those of cultural and historical significance. The
Muscogee (Creek) Nation supports a clean fix to address Carcieri, but
opposes H.R. 6180 which singles out one Tribe at the expense of others.
We have spoken to many Tribes who fear that if legislation is passed
for one specific Tribe--instead of all Tribal Nations throughout Indian
Country--it will set a harmful precedent that will require Tribes to
get similar legislation in order to protect or restore their own tribal
homelands.\1\ This would not only be burdensome to Congress, it would
create two classes of Tribes--those with the resources to advocate for
legislation to address the negative impacts of Carcieri and those
without. Should this proposed legislation become law, the multitude of
other Tribes excluded from this legislation--whose need for a Carcieri
fix is much greater--will be left at a significant disadvantage. A
congressional policy should not be established where the wealthiest
Tribes get to cut the line with a one-off piece of legislation, while
the Tribes who need the most help are left stranded. Indian Country and
Congress should be working together towards a solution that will help
all Tribes affected by the Court's decision in Carcieri.

clean Carcieri fix are attached as an appendix to this testimony.

II. The Legislation Rewards Conduct that is Morally Reprehensible
Second, even if helping one Tribe to the detriment of others could
somehow be justified, Congress should never condone, legitimize, or
excuse taking land into trust to desecrate the sacred site and burial
ground of a separate Tribal Nation. It contradicts the primary purpose
established in the Indian Reorganization Act for taking lands into
trust, as well as the treaty rights of numerous removed Tribal Nations.
It would also undermine efforts by the rightful successors to those
sacred lands and burial grounds from taking action to protect and
preserve these critical sites.
The Poarch Band purchased Hickory Ground, a sacred site and
ceremonial ground of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in present-day
Wetumpka, Alabama that we were forced at gunpoint to abandon during
removal and were subsequently denied the right to preserve, protect, or
even visit for over 150 years after. Poarch could only purchase this
sacred site within our treaty territory and homeland because Poarch
received a taxpayer-funded historic preservation grant. Poarch received
this federal grant because they promised to protect and preserve the
Hickory Ground cultural and ceremonial site on behalf of the Muscogee
(Creek) Nation. In its application for federal funds to buy Hickory
Ground, Poarch stated that its ``cquisition of the property is
principally a protection measure.'' \2\ Poarch further stated that its
``cquisition would prevent development on the property.'' Indeed,
Poarch told the federal government that if the government gave Poarch
money to purchase Hickory Ground, then:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Poarch's application for the federal funds used to purchase
Hickory Ground is attached as an appendix to this testimony.
The property will serve as a valuable resource for the cultural
enrichment of the Creek people. . . . The Creek people in
Oklahoma pride in heritage and ties to their original
homeland can only be enhanced. There is still an existing
Hickory Ground tribal town in Oklahoma. They will be pleased to
know their home in Alabama is being preserved. . . . The
Hickory Ground site will continue to enhance their
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
understanding of their history, without excavation.
Poarch proclaimed that ``estruction of archaeological resources
in Alabama . . . destroy the cultural history of Creek people.''
Ultimately, Poarch told the federal government that its acquisition of
Hickory Ground was ``necessary to prevent destruction of the site.''
Consequently, Poarch successfully bid to receive federal funding to
purchase Hickory Ground.
But just as soon as the federal government placed our sacred site
in trust for the Poarch, Poarch proceeded to illegally disinter our
ancestors' remains and cultural artifacts. After breaking their promise
to preserve the grounds to create space for a bingo hall, they
eventually ruined Hickory Ground by bulldozing the site for a 26-story
multi-million dollar luxury casino hotel and resort. All in all, Poarch
removed 57 of our relatives from their final resting place. Poarch
placed their remains in garbage bags and sent them off to be stored at
a university. Our ancestors have never been returned and many remain
stored in a garden shed and in boxes at a university because Poarch
refuses to allow them to be repatriated. All of this was done over the
strenuous objections of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and in violation of
numerous laws, and contrary to universal principles of human decency.
Poarch has yet to be held accountable for its heinous, reprehensible
conduct, and now brazenly seeks to be rewarded for their behavior
through a Congressional act. Although gaming is a critical component of
tribal self-determination, allowing one Tribal Nation to engage in
gaming on another Tribal Nation's burial ground flies in the face of
the protections afforded when lands are placed into trust.
III. The Legislation Encourages Others to Follow in Poarch's Footsteps
Indeed, enacting this legislation would condone Poarch's behavior
and encourage others to follow in Poarch's footsteps. The roadmap
created by this legislation would be very clear to any group of people
living in the historical treaty territory of a removed Tribal Nation.
H.R. 6180 would encourage groups of people claiming Native ancestry to
do the following:
Step One: Claim to be a tribe based on the fact that
current members of the group descend from one or more
individuals who politically divorced themselves from a
historic Tribal Nation;
Step Two: Ask for federal preservation funds to buy one of
the removed Tribal Nation's historic sites and burial
grounds--under the pretenses that you will protect it;
Step Three: Petition the federal government to make you a
tribe (and thus become a federally recognized tribe);
Step Four: Desecrate the sacred site and exhume the
removed Tribal Nation's ancestors to build a multi-million
dollar casino; and
Step Five: Use the millions of dollars in revenue made
from the casino built on burial grounds to lobby Congress
for legislation entitling you to take more land into trust
within the removed Tribal Nation's historic treaty
territory with no provisions that protect sacred sites or
Native burial grounds.
The five-step plan laid out by Poarch is immoral, to be sure. But
the incentive to make money is real, and thus the roadmap laid out by
Poarch is likely to be repeated by others. There is no need to allow
Poarch to complete step five of their roadmap/plan. Doing so will
undoubtedly encourage others to follow suit.
IV. The Advocacy for This Legislation is Based on Lies and Falsehoods
In addition to having legitimate policy, legal, and historical
concerns with H.R. 6180, we have grave moral concerns that Poarch is
disseminating statements that are demonstrably and purposefully false.
While policy and legal disagreements are common and to be expected
throughout the legislative process, we feel compelled to warn you that
the papers in support of H.R. 6180 being pushed by Poarch are
predicated on lies. Among them are the statements below in a white
paper circulated to the members of your committee.
``Unbeknownst to the Tribe at the time of purchase,
archaeological evidence later suggested the presence of a Creek
ceremonial ground on property . . . .''
False. As discussed in greater detail above, Poarch knew they were
purchasing a ``Creek ceremonial ground'' before they purchased Hickory
Ground. When asking the federal government for funds to purchase the
site, Poarch told the federal government the site was a sacred
ceremonial ground, and that they would protect it. Specifically, before
purchasing the site, Poarch told the federal government:
``Hickory Ground (1-Ee-89) is of major importance in the
history of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.''
``The property is in the process of being nominated to the
National Register of Historic Places.''
``In order to halt the destruction planned for the site
and to insure  against future destruction, funds for
acquisition of fee simple title are requested.''
``Acquisition of the property is principally a protection
measure.''
``Acquisition would prevent development on the property.''
``The property will serve as a valuable resource for
cultural enrichment of Creek people. . . . The Creek people
in Oklahoma pride in heritage and ties to original
homeland can only be enhanced. There is still an existing
Hickory Ground tribal town in Oklahoma. They will be
pleased to know their home in Alabama is being preserved. .
. . The Hickory Ground site will continue to enhance their
understanding of their history, without excavation.''
``Hickory Grounds may also be a place where Creeks from
Oklahoma may return and visit their ancestral home.''
A trained anthropologist would ``act as an advisor to the
tribal councils on plans for permanent protection of the
site.''
``Destruction of archaeological resources in Alabama . . .
destroy the cultural history of Creek people.''
Poarch acquisition is ``necessary to prevent destruction
of the site.''
``In order to halt the destruction planned for the site
and to insure against future destruction, funds for
acquisition of fee simple title are requested.''
Poarch is telling this Committee that Poarch purchased Hickory
Ground without the knowledge that Hickory Ground was ``a Creek
ceremonial ground,'' but that is a blatant lie. Hickory Ground's
significant cultural status was not ``unbeknownst'' to Poarch. Poarch
knew about Hickory Ground's significant cultural status, and Poarch
used that knowledge to convince the federal government to give it
federal preservation funding on the pretense that Poarch would protect
it.
``Muscogee has chosen to ignore what sovereignty means as it
works to undermine tribal sovereignty in its attacks on the
Poarch Band of Creek Indians.''
False. Muscogee (Creek) Nation is not attacking tribal sovereignty.
Tribal sovereignty is the inherent right to exercise your treaty right
to self-govern as a Tribal Nation. Tribal sovereignty is not the right
to lie and destroy the sacred site of a separate Tribal Nation.
Muscogee (Creek) Nation's fight to protect the Nation's sacred sites
and burial grounds does not violate tribal sovereignty; it affirms it.
The sovereignty of Tribal Nations flows from our culture, and when we
destroy it for profit--as Poarch has done--we undermine it. Indeed,
Poarch's conduct threatens the inherent sovereignty of all Tribal
Nations.
``A federal district court already dismissed Muscogee's
lawsuit.''
Misleading. While the United States District Court, Middle District
of Alabama, dismissed the Nation's lawsuit, the Court's dismissal was
not based on the merits of the Nation's claims, and the case is
currently before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The District
Court determined Poarch officials could not be held liable for their
violations of federal law based on a rarely applied and questionable
Supreme Court decision known as Coeur d'Alene--a case that most lower
courts no longer follow since it allows state and tribal officials to
violate federal law with impunity. There is a good chance the Eleventh
Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the lower court's outlier of a
ruling, and there is no reason to let Poarch off the hook before the
Nation has had its day in court.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ We note that the Department of the Interior (DOI) is a
defendant in the lawsuit, and further, that the DOI did not mention
this fact when testifying in favor of H.R. 6180, a bill that would
absolve the DOI of a claim brought against the agency in a federal
lawsuit.
``Nevertheless. the Tribe took great care to leave the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ceremonial grounds undisturbed.''
False. Poarch did not leave Hickory Ground ``undisturbed.'' Poarch
brought in bulldozers and razed the ground. Poarch dug up 57 of our
relatives and put their bodies in garbage bags and plastic bins in a
storage shed. Poarch broke the promises it made in its federal
application for grant funds and instead of protecting Hickory Ground,
Poarch built a 246 million dollar casino on top of it. This is not
leaving Hickory Ground ``undisturbed.''
``Prior to the archaeological study, there was no visible
evidence of a Creek ceremonial ground at the site.''
False. Archaeologist David Chase of Auburn University discovered
the Hickory Ground site in 1968 and due to its archaeological and
historical significance, it was placed on the National Register of
Historic Places on March 10, 1980. In its application to the federal
government for the money Poarch needed to purchase the site, Poarch
told the federal government it wanted to buy the land because it was
Hickory Ground, and Poarch intended to protect it. Perhaps Poarch
believes that constructing a narrative that the burials of Mvskoke
ancestors were not visible prior to Poarch's digging will somehow
exonerate Poarch for its actions, but the truth is that Poarch knew it
was buying a culturally significant and historic site and used the
land's status as a basis for asking the federal government for the
funds Poarch needed to buy it.
``In accordance with our laws and traditions, any remains
discovered outside of the ceremonial grounds were interred
adjacent to the site with prayer and ceremony in April of
2013.''
False. First, the entire site of Hickory Ground Tribal Town is a
ceremonial site. It is not clear what Poarch means by stating that
remains were ``discovered outside of the ceremonial grounds'' since the
relatives whose remains Poarch exhumed were buried at the Hickory
Ground Tribal Town and within the ceremonial grounds, the site Poarch
used federal preservation funds to purchase. Perhaps Poarch has drawn
some sort of artificial boundary line around the areas where Poarch
disturbed graves, but that line has no basis in Mvskoke culture or
history. Burials were disturbed in all parts of the Hickory Ground
Tribal Town.
Second, less than one week prior to the ``burial'' Poarch refers to
in April 2013, Muscogee (Creek) Nation and Mekko Thompson wrote to
Poarch, asking them to hold off on ``burying'' Mekko Thompson's
ancestors until Hickory Ground could consult and provide guidance on
the proper way to rebury the ancestors Poarch wrongfully exhumed.
Instead of repatriating Mekko Thompson's relatives to him, Poarch put
them in the ground pursuant to what Poarch calls a ``ceremony.'' It is
hard to imagine what Poarch considers to be a ``ceremony'' or what kind
of ``prayer'' Poarch offered in burying Mekko Thompson's relatives
without his consent or involvement. Furthermore, Auburn University has
confirmed--during the course of the current litigation--that not all of
our relatives have been reburied by Poarch. Instead, several remain at
Auburn, but Auburn won't return them to us because of active litigation
and Auburn says Poarch has taken the position that our relatives should
not be returned to us. Poarch has their billion dollar casino. The
least they could do is release the collections at Auburn and allow us
to rebury our relatives and their belongings in accordance with Mvskoke
culture and ceremony.
``The Poarch Tribe voluntarily agreed, without compensation, to
preserve and protect the northern 17 acres of the trust
property . . .''
Misleading. The fact that Poarch, in 2017, agreed to preserve a
portion of the property is misleading because, in applying for the
funds to buy the site in the first place, Poarch promised to protect
the entire site. They received federal taxpayer funds in exchange for
their promise to protect the entire site. Why, in 2017, should they
expect to receive compensation to do something they promised to do in
exchange for federal taxpayer dollars in 1980?
``The Tribe has complied with all applicable federal, historic,
and cultural preservation laws pertaining to this property.''
False. This is the subject of the current lawsuit, and no decision
on the merits by a court of law has yet to be issued. But even without
a court decision determining whether Poarch complied, federal agencies
noted almost two decades ago that Poarch was violating federal cultural
preservation laws. For instance, on November 14, 2006, the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) noted that ``there was no
Federal agency review of the archaeological investigations carried out
by the Poarch Band'' and ``no consultation with any other Indian tribe,
particularly the Muscogee Creek Nation'' in violation of the National
Historic Preservation Act. Indeed, the ACHP inferred that ``Poarch
Band's actions were undertaken with the intent to avoid the
requirements of Section 106.'' This is not compliance.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ The Letter from ACHP to National Indian Gaming Commission NEPA
Compliance Officer (Nov. 14, 2006), is attached herein in the appendix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. The Legislation Seeks to Backdoor Poarch into ``Successor in
Interest'' Status for Muscogee (Creek) Nation's Treaties
Despite claiming to be a successor in interest at the hearing and
in its written testimony, Poarch is not a successor in interest to any
of the treaties the Muscogee (Creek) Nation signed with the United
States since, at the time of signing, Poarch did not exist as a tribe,
entity, or even an organized group. The fact that a group of people
claiming Creek ancestry organized themselves and asked to become a
tribe in 1980 does not automatically qualify them to be a successor in
interest to the treaties the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has signed.
In fact, historically, the people who today call themselves
``Poarch'' chose to politically divorce themselves from the Muscogee
(Creek) Nation. When Andrew Jackson sought to exterminate the ``Upper
Creeks'' (citizens of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation who had not
intermarried with whites and who opposed removal and slavery), Poarch's
ancestors teamed up with General Jackson and assisted in his attempts
to wipe out the full-blood Muscogee (Creek) Nation citizens. In
exchange for supporting Andrew Jackson, they were given land grants in
and near Tensaw. Indeed, the Department of the Interior's
acknowledgment recommendation and evaluation states that Poarch's
ancestors fought on the side of Andrew Jackson during the ``Creek
War.'' See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Memorandum on recommendation and summary evidence for proposed finding
for Federal acknowledgment of the Poarch Band of Creeks of Alabama
pursuant to 25 C.F.R. 83 (Dec. 29, 1983) at 13, https://www.bia.gov/
sites/bia.gov/files/assets/as-ia/ofa/petition/013_prchcr_AL/013_pf.pdf
(``many of the present group's ancestors, including Lynn McGhee,
received grants for their land in the Tensaw area from the United
States for their support in the Creek War.''); see id. at 16 (``the
lands they chose were . . . close to the Tensaw/Little River area'').
By agreeing to stay, and by accepting these land grants, they gave up
all political rights they had previously held as Muscogee (Creek)
Nation citizens. To be clear, by betraying our Nation and fighting on
the side of the United States against our Nation, they were allowed to
avoid the violent, forced removal our Nation suffered on the Trail of
Tears. Having betrayed and divorced themselves from our Nation, they
have no right to claim any interest in the treaties we signed with the
United States.
It is, therefore, disturbing that H.R. 6180 goes beyond simply
stating that the Poarch Band shall be considered as under Federal
jurisdiction in 1934 (they were not). The bill also ratifies and
confirms all lands taken into trust prior to enactment, including those
outside of Poarch's geographic area and within the treaty territory
homelands of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Should Poarch ever receive
legislation allowing lands to be taken into trust, the legislation
should limit that authority to the geographic area their federal
recognition was predicated on. When the individuals who called
themselves ``Poarch Creek'' submitted an application to become a Tribe
in 1980,\5\ they were very explicit in telling the federal government
that their ancestral ties to the Southeast are limited to the areas
surrounding Tensaw and Atmore in present-day southwestern Alabama.
Poarch's federal acknowledgment recommendation and evaluation states
that the individuals who identify as Poarch have ``lived in the same
general vicinity in southwestern Alabama within an eighteen-mile radius
for a time period beginning in the late 1700s to the present.'' \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Poarch initially submitted its application under the name ``the
Muscogee Nation east of the Mississippi. Inc.''
\6\ U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Memorandum on recommendation and summary evidence for proposed finding
for Federal acknowledgment of the Poarch Band of Creeks of Alabama
pursuant to 25 C.F.R. 83 (Dec. 29, 1983) at 2, https://www.bia.gov/
sites/bia.gov/files/assets/as-ia/ofa/petition/013_prchcr_AL/013_pf.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.R. 6180 attempts to put land into trust for the Poarch Band
outside of their historical territory and within the historic treaty
territory of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Given Poarch's horrific track
record and atrocious treatment of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation's sacred
sites, there is no reason to give Poarch carte blanche ability to take
more land into trust within our Nation's historic boundaries. Indeed,
doing so would violate the treaties our Nation signed with the United
States. The United States has treaty trust duties and responsibilities
to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. One of those duties is the duty to
uphold, protect, and preserve the sacred sites our Nation was forced to
leave behind when we were forcibly removed from our homeland on the
Trail of Tears. That treaty and the trust duty the United States owes
to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation supersedes the Poarch Band's desire to
expand gaming operations within our Nation's homelands and to the
detriment of our cultural history.
VI. Conclusion
Ultimately, Poarch's destruction of Hickory Ground in Wetumpka,
Alabama, demonstrates why removed or displaced Tribal Nations must be
empowered to protect the sacred places and ancestral burials they were
forced to leave behind. The destruction at Hickory Ground is
heartbreaking and demoralizing. When the law allows for a self-
identified group of people to take control of the sacred sites and
burial grounds that were never theirs, and empowers that group to
subsequently excavate graves and desecrate those sites, it fails every
removed or displaced Tribal Nation in America. Comprehensive
legislation is essential to ensure all Tribes can restore their land
base without concern for the destruction of their most sacred sites. We
cannot afford to let the destruction of another Native, historic,
sacred site to take place. Thus, any proposed legislation seeking to
address Carcieri must provide removed Tribes with the ability and
authority to protect their sacred sites and the burials of their
relatives within their homelands.
The Muscogee (Creek) Nation stands ready to work with all of Indian
Country and Congress to achieve a clean, comprehensive Carcieri fix
that applies to all Tribal Nations and empowers Tribal Nations to both
restore their land base and protect sacred sites within the homelands
from which they were forcibly removed.

House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs
1324 Longworth House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515
Re: Testimony for the Record--H.R. 1208 (Cole), To amend the Act of
June 18, 1934
Dear Chairwoman Hageman and Ranking Member Fernandez:
I write on behalf of Artichoke Joe's, a California cardroom,
located in San Bruno, California to offer testimony for the record
regarding H.R. 1208, a bill with the stated purpose of ``reaffirming''
the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust
for Indian Tribes. The intent of the 73rd Congress in enacting Section
5 of the Indian Reorganization Act and the legal effect of the
provision have been misunderstood and misapplied. The problem is
conflation of two very different types of dominion over land, one,
landowner title to land, and the other, governmental jurisdiction over
land.
There is a common misconception that when the federal government
takes off-reservation land into trust for a tribe, the tribe not only
obtains title to the land but also gains jurisdiction over the land.
However, that has never been the law.
Under well-established principles governing our federalist system
of dual levels of government, a state has primary jurisdiction over all
lands within its borders except (1) those lands over which the federal
government reserved jurisdiction when it admitted the state into the
Union, (2) those lands purchased by the federal government for the
erection of needful buildings with the consent of the Legislature of
the state in which the land lies (pursuant to the Enclaves Clause), and
(3) those lands over which the state Legislature has ceded jurisdiction
and the federal government has accepted jurisdiction pursuant to 40
U.S.C. Sec. 3112.
Absent one of the three exceptions, when the federal government
acquires title to land within a state, all it acquires is the title to
the land, not legislative jurisdiction over the land. The federal
government is well aware of these principles. A well-known GAO
publication states, ``Acquisition of land and acquisition of federal
jurisdiction over that land are two different things.'' GAO, Principles
of Federal Appropriations Law, 3rd Ed. 2008, Vol. III, Ch. 13, p. 13-
101. The Supreme Court has held that the federal government cannot
strip states of jurisdiction, calling such attempt an act of
``disseisin.'' Fort Leavenworth Railway Co. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, 538
(1885). Thus, the federal government has no power to divest a state of
its territorial jurisdiction once bestowed. Hawaii v. Office of
Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.S. 163, 176 (2009) quoting Idaho v. United
States, 533 U.S. 262 (``he consequences of admission are
instantaneous, and it ignores the uniquely sovereign character of that
event . . . to suggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish what
has already been bestowed.'')
This law applies to Indian lands the same as to non-Indian lands.
See, for example, Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Comm., 302 U.S. 186 (1937);
and Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 647 (1930). Also compare
Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60 (1962) [Alaska could
enforce state anti-fish-trap law on Indian reservation over which
federal government did not reserve jurisdiction on state's admission]
to Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 369 U.S. 45 (1962) [Alaska
lacked jurisdiction to enforce state anti-fish-trap law on Indian
reservation over which the federal government did reserve jurisdiction
at time of state's admission.]
As in Metlakatla Indian Community, most Indian reservations were
established before admission of the state in which they sit, and thus
fit the first exception as lands over which the federal government
reserved jurisdiction upon admission of the state. However, that is not
the case with lands procured by a tribe today. When a tribe acquires
title to land that has been under state jurisdiction, the tribe obtains
title but the state retains its jurisdiction. The tribe has no
jurisdiction unless and until the state cedes it.
Although these principles are foundational to our federalist system
and well-established, the Department of Interior seems to have violated
them in adopting regulations pursuant to section 5. In 1965, the DOI
adopted a regulation (25 USC Sec. 1.4) which provides that none of the
laws of any State or political subdivision limiting, zoning, or
otherwise governing the use or development of any real property held in
trust by the US for Indians shall be applicable to that land. More
recently, the section 151 regulations assume that when land is taken
into trust for a tribe, whether on-or off-reservation, all state and
local law is preempted.
Such a jurisdictional shift was never intended by the 73rd Congress
and is not consistent with the Constitution. And this mistaken
application of Section 5 is the root of the problem with off-
reservation acquisitions. The mistaken belief that there is a shift in
jurisdiction means that taking land into trust upends existing controls
and existing communities.
H.R. 1208 is likewise based on this misunderstanding of the law and
would exacerbate the problem. It seeks not only to allow land to be
taken into trust for tribes but is based on the assumption that once
land is taken into trust, the state loses jurisdiction over Indians on
the land and state laws restricting gambling conducted by the Indians
on the land are no longer applicable to the land. Thus, H.R. 1208 would
allow off-reservation casinos to proliferate.
Before referring out H.R. 1208, we respectfully suggest that the
committee address this issue and clarify that Section 5 of the IRA
allows the federal government only to take title to land into trust and
does not affect the federal and state jurisdiction over the land. In
specific, Congress should clarify that taking land into trust is not
intended to infringe on states' rightful jurisdiction over the lands
taken into trust.
We appreciate your consideration of these comments.
Sincerely,
Alan Titus

UNITED INDIAN NATIONS OF OKLAHOMA
RESOLUTION NO. 2024-02
A Resolution in Support of a Carcieri Fix for all Tribal Nations--not
one--and, in Support of the Inherent Right of all Removed Tribal
Nations to Protect their Sacred Sites in their Homelands.
WHEREAS, the United Indian Nations of Oklahoma (UINO) is an
organization established to protect the inherent sovereignty and self-
determination of all Tribal Nations based in Oklahoma; and
WHEREAS, UINO seeks to safeguard the laws and treaties that benefit
Tribal Nations and tribal citizens and to help improve government-to-
government relations among Tribal Nations in Oklahoma and the United
States; and
WHEREAS, UINO strives to protect the ceremonial, cultural, religious
rights and access and usage of sacred sites of its member Tribal
Nations; and
WHEREAS, nearly all of the member Tribal Nations in UINO were forcibly
and violently removed from their historic homelands; and
WHEREAS, because so many of UINO's member Tribal Nations were removed
from their homelands, UINO commands a unique understanding of the
importance of protecting the right of removed Tribal Nations to protect
their sacred sites in the homelands from which they were removed; and
WHEREAS, UINO understands the role the Supreme Court's decision in
Carcieri v. Salazar has played in preventing numerous Tribal Nations
from fully exercising tribal sovereignty and engaging in economic
development to sustain tribal self-governance; and
WHEREAS, the passage of single-Tribe legislation to address Carcieri
will inevitably diminish the political will to achieve additional
Carcieri fixes, and will set a precedent that will require every
affected Tribe to seek to address Carcieri through individual
legislation, including those without the resources to do so; and
WHEREAS, UINO believes that if any legislative fix to Carcieri is to be
passed, it must be for the benefit of all Tribal Nations--not just one;
and
WHEREAS, although gaming is a critical component of tribal self-
determination, there is no need for any Tribal Nation to engage in
gaming on another Tribal Nation's burial ground; and
WHEREAS, a federally recognized tribe obtained ownership of another
tribe's sacred burial site and violated a written promise to preserve
and protect this site by removing and storing ancestral remains in
boxes on shelves to make way for construction of a casino; and
WHEREAS, if any Tribe were to be rewarded in such an exclusive manner,
it should not be the Tribe whose course of conduct violates some of the
most fundamentally basic moral codes understood by sister tribes
throughout Indian Country; and
WHEREAS, passing any legislation that does not address these injustices
will condone and incentivize more such desecrations; and
WHEREAS, the desecration of Hickory Ground in Wetumpka, Alabama, serves
to demonstrate why any proposed Carcieri fix legislation must include
protections for sacred sites located within the historical homelands of
removed Tribal Nations; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UINO declares that any proposed
legislation seeking to address Carcieri must provide removed Tribal

Submission for the Record by Rep. Grijalva
Statement for the Record
USET Sovereignty Protection Fund
on June 26, 2024 Legislative Hearing on H.R. 1208 and H.R. 6180
Chair Hageman, Ranking Member Leger-Fernandez, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony on
H.R. 1208, ``To amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the
authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for
Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.'' This bill would address the
long-standing inequities caused by the U.S. Supreme Court's 2009
decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, where the Court interpreted the Indian
Reorganization Act (IRA) to require a Tribal Nation to have been
``under Federal jurisdiction'' when the IRA was enacted in 1934 to be
eligible to acquire trust land.
USET Sovereignty Protection Fund (USET SPF) is a non-profit, inter-
tribal organization advocating on behalf of thirty-three (33) federally
recognized Tribal Nations from the Northeastern Woodlands to the
Everglades and across the Gulf of Mexico.\1\ USET SPF is dedicated to
promoting, protecting, and advancing the inherent sovereign rights and
authorities of Tribal Nations and in assisting its membership in
dealing effectively with public policy issues.

I. Consistent Support by USET SPF for Carcieri Fix
Because of where we are located, our member Tribal Nations were the
first to contend with 17th and 18th-century local colonial governments
and distant European nations at the onset of colonization in North
America. We engaged in treaty-making with both the British Crown (in
addition to other foreign governments) and the nascent American
government. Our relationship with the U.S. government involves a
lengthier history of destruction, destabilization, termination, and
assimilation than the Tribal Nations of many other regions throughout
the country. Indeed, our region served as a ``testing ground'' for some
of the most horrific and shameful federal policies visited upon Tribal
Nations and Native people. While all Tribal Nations are working to
rebuild in the wake of destructive federal policies and actions, many
USET SPF Tribal Nation members are doing so from positions of greater
and more extensive loss of population and natural and cultural
resources. In spite of this, our story is one of triumph, as we have
persevered over the last 400+ years against the greatest of odds and in
the face of a centuries-long campaign to eradicate our people and
governments.
One great consequence of this long relationship with the United
States has been the steady loss of our Tribal Nations' lands, including
through often-forced or coerced treaties and other takings. Indeed,
USET SPF-member Tribal Nations retain only small remnants of our
original homelands today. As a result, although the trust land
acquisition authority of the IRA is deeply important to all of Indian
Country, it is of particular significance and importance to our 33
Tribal Nation members.
During the 15-year period of time since Carcieri, the number of
acres of homelands returned to Tribal Nations has lagged because of the
burdensome hurdles caused by Carcieri, and the costs to Tribal Nations
and the Department have skyrocketed--taking away from other important
Indian Country issues requiring our attention. This is all avoidable
with a simple Carcieri fix.
USET SPF has consistently advocated for a Carcieri fix for all
Tribal Nations in the 15 years since the disastrous Supreme Court
decision. Included in our advocacy, we have submitted testimony to
Congress supporting legislation to resolve this issue, including but
not limited to detailed written testimony submitted in the last 10
years in 2019, 2017, and 2015, and we have already prepared a support
letter for this Congress's Carcieri fix legislation. We will not
restate the points made in that testimony here, but rather we will
focus on the topics central to this Carcieri hearing.
It is long past time that Congress cross the finish line in
enacting this commonsense piece of legislation, which contains the two
features necessary to restore parity to the land-into-trust process:
(1) a reaffirmation of the status of current trust lands; and (2)
confirmation that the Department has authority to take land into trust
for all federally recognized Tribal Nations. USET SPF extends its
gratitude to Rep. Tom Cole for his continued introduction of bi-
partisan legislation that would right this wrong, and, once again, we
urge the House Committee on Natural Resources and the whole of Congress
to take immediate action on H.R. 1208.
II. This Bill Would Narrowly Correct the Court's Mistaken Reading of
the IRA in Carcieri
A. The U.S. Supreme Court's Decision in Carcieri Undermined Congress's
Intent in Enacting the IRA
Section 5 of the IRA authorized the U.S. Department of the Interior
(Department) ``to acquire, through purchase, relinquishment, gift,
exchange, or assignment, any interest in lands, water rights, or
surface rights to lands, within or without existing reservations,
including trust or otherwise restricted allotments, whether the
allottee be living or deceased, for the purpose of providing land for
Indians.'' \2\ The IRA provided that title to such acquired lands
``shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the
Indian Tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired, and
such lands or rights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.''
\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5108.
\3\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5108.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Supreme Court in Carcieri was tasked with construing potential
temporal limitations of the Department's authority to acquire land in
trust for Tribal Nations under the IRA.\4\ The Court determined that a
Tribal Nation seeking to acquire land in trust under the IRA must meet
an IRA definition of ``Indian.'' \5\ The decision in Carcieri was
limited to a statutory analysis of the meaning of ``now'' in the phrase
``now under federal jurisdiction'' in the first IRA definition of
``Indian.'' \6\ The Court held that a Tribal Nation meeting that
definition must have been ``under federal jurisdiction'' when the IRA
was enacted in 1934.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 379 (2009).
\5\ Id. at 393 (citing 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5129).
\6\ Id. at 382.
\7\ Id. at 395. Nowhere in its decision did the Court hold a Tribal
Nation must be federally recognized in 1934 to acquire land into trust
under the IRA. Instead, Justice Breyer in his concurrence indicated a
Tribal Nation may have been under federal jurisdiction in 1934
regardless of whether the federal government understood it to be
federally recognized at that time. Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 379,
397 (2009) (Breyer, J., concurring). He also stated that the IRA
``imposes no time limit upon recognition.'' Id. at 398. Justice Breyer
explained that sometimes ``later recognition reflects earlier `Federal
jurisdiction.' '' Id. at 398-99. The Department has confirmed that a
Tribal Nation need not have been federally recognized in 1934.
Memorandum from Solicitor to Secretary re The Meaning of ``Under
Federal Jurisdiction'' for Purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act,
23-26 (Mar. 12, 2014), available at https://www.doi.gov/sites/
doi.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/uploads/M-37029.pdf. Courts have upheld
this confirmation. See, e.g., Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde
Community v. Jewell, 830 F.3d 552, 565 (D.C. Cir. 2016). It is
important not to conflate the two terms--``under federal jurisdiction''
and ``federal recognition''--which are distinct legal concepts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This decision has since significantly undermined restoration of
Tribal Nations' homelands, costing Tribal Nations and the Department
valuable time and money to establish a Tribal Nation's 1934 ``under
federal jurisdiction'' status prior to acquiring trust land for that
Tribal Nation, in direct contravention of Congress's goals when
enacting the IRA. As discussed below, Congress in enacting the IRA
intended to address historical takings of Tribal Nations' lands by
providing a legislative tool to aid in reacquiring Tribal homelands.
B. The Pending Legislation is Narrow and Would Fix the
Misinterpretation
H.R. 1208 would resolve this problem by clarifying that, beginning
when the IRA was enacted, ``Indians'' are defined to include ``all
persons of Indian descent who are members of any federally recognized
Indian Tribe,'' removing the phrase ``now under Federal jurisdiction''
entirely. This amendment to the IRA would be effective as if included
at the original date of enactment of the IRA, and it would confirm
actions already taken by the Department pursuant to the IRA to the
extent they are challenged based on whether an Indian Tribe was
federally recognized or under federal jurisdiction in 1934.
III. All Tribal Nations Deserve Access to Tools for Rebuilding
Homelands
A. The United States Has a Long History of Taking Tribal Nations' Lands
and Resources
Although the United States has always recognized Tribal Nations as
inherently sovereign political entities--at least in words--it has
taken actions throughout time to diminish our sovereign rights and
authorities, including with regard to our land holdings and other
resources. It is through this diminishment that the United States has
amassed its land base, wealth, and power.
Federal Indian law sits atop the ``Doctrine of Discovery,'' which
colonizers long used to justify taking Indigenous peoples' lands and
resources.\8\ In 1493, Pope Alexander VI declared that all land not
inhabited by Christians was available for ``discovery'' and
colonization.\9\ The doctrine was incorporated into American
jurisprudence within the ``Marshall Trilogy'' of U.S. Supreme Court
cases establishing the foundations of federal Indian law.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Pope Alexander VI, Inter caetera  (May 4, 1493).
\9\ Pope Alexander VI, Inter caetera  (May 4, 1493).
(``e, of our own accord, . . . give, grant, and assign to you and
your heirs and successors, kings of Castile and Leon, forever . . . all
islands and mainlands found and to be found, discovered and to be
discovered . . . .'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utilizing the Doctrine of Discovery, the United States took the
vast majority of Tribal Nations' lands and resources. The land base
that compromises the modern-day United States of America was, and
remains, Tribal homelands. The United States' territory covers a
cumulative area of approximately 2.274 billion acres.\10\ Of this, as
of 2018, only 100 million acres (4.4%) was recognized by the United
States as Tribal land, and just over half of that meager amount--56.2
million acres--was held in trust by the federal government for the
beneficial occupancy of Tribal Nations and Tribal citizens.\11\ The
total amount of land held in trust thus represents just 2.47% of the
United States' overall territorial holdings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The federal government has sought to seize control of Tribal lands
and resources in primarily one of two ways: through relocation of
Tribal Nations to new land bases, sometimes hundreds of miles away,
often with limited natural resources and development potential; or by
authorizing Tribal Nations to remain in our ancestral homelands but
with a diminishment in size of Tribally-held territory and usually in
the least agriculturally productive area of those lands. The United
States' acquisition of Tribal Nations' lands and resources came as a
result of often forced cessions, coercion, and theft. Later,
acquisitions came through the gradual deterioration of federal policies
toward Tribal Nations from those grounded in mutually respectful
political negotiations to those that unilaterally sought the outright
taking of our lands and resources, assimilation of our people, and
termination of Tribal sovereignty and culture.
Over time, the original understandings of Tribal sovereignty
recognized in the U.S. Constitution were maligned by federal power
positioning and the insidious expansion of the philosophical
underpinnings of the Doctrine of Discovery into American jurisprudence.
For example, the U.S. Supreme Court wrongly came to interpret the
Indian Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution to
mean that Congress has so-called ``plenary power'' over Indian affairs
to act as it sees fit with regard to Tribal Nations and our rights.\13\
This concept was neither intended nor advanced in the Constitution or
by its drafters, but rather it is a legal fiction created by the
colonizer's own courts to facilitate taking Tribal Nations' lands and
resources and prevent our rightful exercise of inherent
sovereignty.\14\ As an outgrowth, according to Supreme Court precedent
that has evolved to serve the interests of the United States as
colonizer, even Tribal homelands and other rights protected via
treaties may be unilaterally abolished if done so clearly and
explicitly by Congress.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ See, e.g., Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S.
163,192 (1989) (citations omitted) (``he central function of the
Indian Commerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary power to
legislate in the field of Indian affairs.''); Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock,
187 U.S. 553, 565 (1903) (``Plenary authority over the tribal relations
of the Indians has been exercised by Congress from the beginning . . .
.'').
\14\ See Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 318-331 (2023)
(Gorsuch, J., concurring).
\15\ See, e.g., Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians,
526 U.S. 172, 202 (1999) (citation omitted) (``Congress may abrogate
Indian treaty rights, but it must clearly express its intent to do so .
. . .''); Washington v. Wash. State Com. Passenger Fishing Vessel
Ass'n, 443 U.S. 658, 690 (1979) (``Absent explicit statutory language,
we have been extremely reluctant to find congressional abrogation of
treaty rights.''); United States v. Santa Fe Pac. R.R. Co., 314 U.S.
339, 353-54 (1941) (requiring a ``clear and plain indication'' of
congressional intent to extinguish Tribal rights, as ``an
extinguishment cannot be lightly implied in view of the avowed
solicitude of the Federal Government for the welfare of its Indian
wards'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, the territorial jurisdiction of Tribal Nations is confined
to a mixture of reservation, restricted fee, and trust land.\16\ We are
forced to operate within the federally imposed Tribal land system
(i.e., reservation and trust land held for our ``beneficial
occupancy''), but our interests and practices extend beyond these
boundaries. For instance, Tribal Nations are intimately tied to
countless sacred and culturally significant sites whose importance
almost defies comprehension. They hold the bones of our ancestors,
connect us to our origin stories, are sites of ceremony and spiritual
presence, and grow our medicinal plants and traditional foods, and, in
some cases, the places themselves are alive and deeply respected as
such. Yet, Tribal Nations continue to fight to preserve our interests
beyond the reservation system and to regain our stolen lands, which are
central to our existence as peoples and as governments in service to
our communities. All the while, the United States has profited from the
vast natural resources and essential environmental, agricultural, and
cultural knowledge that Tribal Nations have cultivated over countless
generations of intimate connection to our ancestral lands.\17\

or ``TEK,'' of Indigenous peoples).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Against this historical and ongoing backdrop, the unjust nature of
the Carcieri decision becomes even more clear.
B. Congress Enacted the IRA to Rebuild Tribal Homelands
The IRA, enacted in 1934,\18\ was designed in part to provide
powerful tools to protect and rebuild Tribal Nations' land bases
following nearly 200 years of systematic dispossession, from which
Indian Country is still reeling, so that Tribal Nations may exercise
jurisdiction over our land and provide for our people.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stat. 984 (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5101 et seq.).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A central feature of the IRA intended to strengthen Tribal Nation
self-government and self-sufficiency was Section 5, discussed above and
interpreted in Carcieri, aimed at rebuilding Tribal Nations' land
bases.\19\ Additionally, in order to maintain and protect lands already
held for Tribal Nations, the IRA also prohibited any further allotment
of reservation lands,\20\ extended indefinitely the periods of trust or
restrictions on individual Indians' trust lands,\21\ provided for the
restoration of surplus unallotted lands to Tribal Nation ownership,\22\
and prohibited any transfer of restricted Tribal Nations' or individual
Indians' lands, with limited exceptions, other than to the Tribal
Nation or by inheritance.\23\

\22\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5103(a).
\23\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5107.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congressional representatives who debated and discussed enactment
of the IRA uniformly understood that one of the main purposes of the
IRA was to provide a mechanism whereby the Department could acquire
land into trust for Tribal Nations.\24\ Congress designed the IRA not
only to ``prevent further loss of land'' but also to acquire additional
land for Tribal Nations, as congressional representatives understood
``prevention is not enough'' to undo the problems caused by past
federal Indian law and policy.\25\ The Supreme Court later emphasized
that Congress understood when enacting the IRA that the goal of self-
government for Tribal Nations could not be met without ``put a
halt to the loss of tribal lands.'' \26\

Collier).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Congress Should Fix Carcieri To Benefit All Tribal Nations and to
Carry Forward Its Own Mandate to Treat Federally Recognized
Tribal Nations Equally
The Court's decision in Carcieri undermines Congress's intent in
the IRA to right past wrongs by providing tools to rebuild homelands.
The burdens of the Carcieri decision impact all Tribal Nations.
Removing the burdensome process of receiving a positive Carcieri
determination from the Department before acquiring land into trust will
benefit all Tribal Nations and further Congress's original goals when
it enacted the IRA in 1934.
Additionally, Congress made clear when it amended the IRA in 1994
to add the ``privileges and immunities'' clauses that departments and
agencies of the federal government must not make any decisions ``with
respect to a federally recognized Indian tribe that classifies,
enhances, or diminishes the privileges and immunities available to the
Indian tribe relative to other federally recognized tribes by virtue of
their status as Indian tribes.'' \27\ We call upon Congress to carry
its own mandate forward by removing barriers so that all federally
recognized Tribal Nations may utilize the benefits of the trust
acquisition provisions of the IRA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Tribal Nations Acquire Land into Trust So That We May Exercise
Jurisdiction Over Our Lands, Not to Establish Casinos Wherever
We Acquire Trust Land
A. United States Federal Indian law requires Tribal Nations to Request
the U.S. Hold Title to Our Lands in Trust so We May Exercise
Jurisdiction Over Them
Territorial jurisdiction is a bedrock principle of sovereignty, and
Tribal Nations must exercise such jurisdiction in order to fully
implement the inherent sovereignty as self-governing political entities
that we possess and to serve our people. Just as states exercise
jurisdiction over their land, Tribal Nations must also exercise
jurisdiction, thereby promoting government fairness and parity between
state governments and Tribal Nation governments.
However, the legal doctrines that have developed through federal
Indian law hamstring Tribal Nations' exercise of jurisdiction over our
own territories. Tribal Nations are generally recognized to have
jurisdiction--albeit limited--over our ``Indian Country.'' \28\ While
Indian Country includes lands within a Tribal Nation's reservation,\29\
Tribal Nations seeking to reclaim territorial jurisdiction over land
must often do so through the arduous and protracted process of trust
acquisition.\30\ Yet, even trust acquisition is paternalistic, in that
it requires the federal government to hold title for the benefit of the
Tribal Nation as a ``beneficial occupant.'' \31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\28\ See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1304.
\29\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1151.
\30\ See Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian
Tribe, 498 U.S. 505, 511 (1991).
\31\ 25 U.S.C. Sec. 5108.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At base, a Tribal Nation's request to the United States to take
land into trust for the Tribal Nation's benefit is simply a common
prerequisite under the United States' own laws that allows a Tribal
Nation to exercise its own sovereign powers over its lands and people
to keep them safe--and even that exercise of jurisdiction is still very
limited. Tribal Nations' trust acquisition requests are far from
nefarious, and instead they are a simple attempt to take our rightful
place in the American family of governments and work within the
restrictive framework set out for us by United States courts and laws.
B. Acquiring Land Into Trust Does Not a Casino Make
The trust acquisition process under the IRA and the Department's 25
C.F.R. Part 151 (Part 151) implementing regulations and guidance is
onerous, even if one removes the current requirement to submit evidence
to demonstrate a Tribal Nation was ``under federal jurisdiction'' in
1934 as required by Carcieri. This trust acquisition process is
separate and apart from the process spelled out in the Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act (IGRA) and the Department's 25 C.F.R. Part 292 (Part
292) implementing regulations for establishing that land is eligible
for gaming.
The Department's Part 151 process is arduous, time-consuming,
costly, and extremely rigorous for the Department as well as Tribal
Nations, and neither undertakes a trust acquisition application
lightly.\32\ Included as one of many hurdles within the Department's
analysis of the criteria under Part 151 is a legal determination of
whether the Department has statutory authority for the trust
acquisition.\33\ At present, as part of this determination when the
trust acquisition is to take place under the IRA, the Department
conducts a legal analysis regarding whether the acquisition complies
with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the IRA in Carcieri. This
legal examination involves a fact-specific review of a Tribal Nation's
and its people's relationships with the United States throughout
history.\34\ The Department consults heavily with the Office of the
Solicitor regarding this analysis, and a Tribal Nation submits a
significant amount of evidence to show it meets the legal standard of
having been under federal jurisdiction in 1934.

However, when a Tribal Nation seeks to game on land, there are
completely separate criteria and procedures that must be met under IGRA
and Part 292.\35\ The general rule under IGRA is that gaming is
prohibited on land acquired into trust after IGRA was enacted in
1988.\36\ Thus, as a starting point, land taken into trust now is not
eligible for gaming. There are very limited instances when the
prohibition does not apply, including when the trust land is within or
contiguous to a Tribal Nation's 1988 reservation \37\ or certain former
reservation land,\38\ when lands qualify for an ``equal footing''
exception available to Tribal Nations,\39\ or when the state's governor
is involved in the decision to permit gaming under the ``two-part''
exception.\40\ These narrow allowances are meant to either keep gaming
contained to a Tribal Nation's reservation as it existed when IGRA was
enacted or to put Tribal Nations who suffered especially difficult
inequities on equal footing with other Tribal Nations. The ``two-part''
exception, while less limited by a Tribal Nation's ties to land, is
only possible when a state is supportive of the gaming.

Each exemption or exception to the general gaming prohibition
requires submitting significant amounts of evidence to the Department
to demonstrate the land meets the very high legal standards to be
eligible for gaming under IGRA and Part 292. And the starting point of
the analysis is the general rule that the newly-acquired trust land is
not eligible for gaming because it was acquired after IGRA's enactment.
The Department makes a gaming eligibility determination if a Tribal
Nation's trust acquisition states it seeks to acquire the land for the
purpose of gaming, and therefore the record of decision to acquire land
into trust for the purpose of gaming will encompass both the IRA trust
acquisition decision and the IGRA gaming eligibility decision. Even so,
it is often a completely different attorney in the Department's Office
of the Solicitor conducting the gaming eligibility determination under
IGRA and Part 292 than the attorney conducting the trust acquisition
determination under the IRA and Part 151. Should a Tribal Nation later
decide to game on land it has acquired into trust, the National Indian
Gaming Commission rather than the Department makes the gaming
eligibility determination under the standards of IGRA and Part 292,
often through approval of a gaming ordinance, but the legal standards
and evidentiary burdens remain just as high.
Any concern that a Tribal Nation acquiring land anywhere into trust
will automatically be able to game on that land is not grounded in
reality or truth, but this misinformation is being used as a fear
tactic to the uninformed ear. The process of receiving approval to game
on land acquired into trust is extremely burdensome, costly, and
difficult.
Indeed, as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Kathryn
Isom-Clause explained during the hearing, only a very small
percentage--about one to three percent at most--of trust acquisition
requests are made for the purpose of gaming. Most others are made for
the simple need to establish territorial jurisdiction, as described
above.
V. Tribal Nations May Choose to Exercise Our Sovereign Authority to
Enter Into Cooperative Agreements with States, But This Must Be
Our Choice
There are many positive effects of Tribal Nations entering into
cooperative agreements with local governments, including related to
provision of emergency services, and many Tribal Nations do enter into
such agreements. By investing our own resources in state and local
governments' services, we are able to help ensure the quality of
services. However, we stress that it is imperative such agreements are
not a prerequisite to acquisition of trust land.
There is no language within the IRA that supports such a
requirement.\41\ And, for the limited percent of trust acquisitions
that are for gaming purposes, IGRA specifically prohibits states from
imposing any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon Tribal
Nations.\42\

Instead, Congress understood when it enacted the IRA that returning
Tribal Nations' lands to our territorial ownership, control, and
jurisdiction may have some negative impacts on surrounding state and
local governments. However, the IRA's trust acquisition provision was
meant to undo past unjust and ineffective federal Indian laws and
policies that often benefited non-Indians. In enacting the IRA,
Congress upheld its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations by
prioritizing our interests, even if state and local governments may
occasionally experience side effects stemming from its application,
including a loss of jurisdiction or tax revenue.\43\ In fact, Congress
noted in Section 5 of the IRA that lands acquired into trust ``shall be
exempt from State and local taxation''--thereby stating with clarity
its understanding that local interests may be harmed but that such harm
is nonetheless necessary.\44\ Additionally, prior to enactment,
congressional members discussed in great detail the resulting removal
of trust land from state taxation, knowingly moving forward with
enactment.\45\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\43\ Since 1977, the Department has issued billions of dollars in
Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) to local governments that help offset
losses in property taxes due to the existence of nontaxable federal
lands within their boundaries. However, while PILT payments are made
for lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National
Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service (part of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture) and for Federal water projects and
some military installations, lands held in trust for Tribal Nations are
not currently eligible. USET SPF believes that PILT (or a PILT-like
mechanism) for lands put into trust could help remove opposition to the
restoration of Tribal homelands while also easing the perceived burdens
of and impacts to local government as a result of lost tax revenue.

Government And Economic Enterprise, 73rd Cong. 28 (1934) (Statement by
Commissioner Collier).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department has built into Part 151 procedural mechanisms to
consider local government interests and provide those governments
commenting opportunities. For trust acquisitions pursuant to the IRA,
the Department must notify the state and local governments having
regulatory jurisdiction over the land to be acquired and consider their
feedback.\46\ Each notified party is given 30 days to provide written
comments regarding potential impacts on regulatory jurisdiction, real
property taxes, and special assessments.\47\ Part 151 also calls for
compliance with NEPA.\48\ As part of its Environmental Compliance
Review under NEPA, the Department provides state and local governments
with an extensive opportunity to comment and then considers comments
received. These commenting opportunities and commenting periods are
more than sufficient, especially when considering that no commenting
opportunity is provided to Tribal Nations when states take actions that
affect us.

Rather than focusing on the bad things states and local governments
fear might happen if Tribal Nations acquire our land into trust, we
should be focusing on all the good that does happen when Tribal Nations
have success in rebuilding our homelands. USET SPF does not dismiss the
fact that trust land acquisition can have a range of impacts on local
communities in the area in which the land is located--but it should not
be forgotten that these are often the same communities that benefited
by gaining control of Tribal Nations' lands as a result of policies the
IRA was intended to reverse. And it should be noted that, when Tribal
Nations are able to exercise jurisdiction over our lands, surrounding
communities and the United States as a whole benefit from the economic
prosperity generated. Additionally, many Tribal Nations enter into
agreements whereby we provide emergency and other essential services
not just to our own lands but also to surrounding communities--seeking
to ensure the safety of all.
VI. Conclusion
USET SPF thanks the Subcommittee for taking the time to conduct
this oversight hearing. The importance of the IRA and its trust
acquisition authority to Tribal Nations cannot be overstated. Full and
equitable access to the IRA's trust acquisition authority is absolutely
fundamental to our ability to thrive as vibrant, healthy, self-
sufficient governments within the United States. The United States took
an important step in the right direction when it enacted the IRA to
help restore Tribal Nations' stolen homelands, and Congress must act
now to remove the faulty barrier to the IRA's implementation erected by
the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri. USET SPF hopes this testimony
has been helpful in illuminating that the IRA's underlying goals and
the tools it gave us must be protected and strengthened as we continue
to improve federal Indian law and policy and, through it, the lives of
our people.
