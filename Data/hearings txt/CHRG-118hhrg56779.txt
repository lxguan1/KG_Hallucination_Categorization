Chairman Good. The hearing on the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to call a recess at any time. Mr. Hartogensis, as you near the end of your 5-year term as the Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, the day has come for--finally come for appropriate oversight and accountability. The 31 million Americans with private pension plans deserve to hear from the top government official responsible for safeguarding their retirement. The PBGC was created to be the insurance company for private pension plans. If the employer is unable to payout the benefits by the time a worker retires, that worker should have confidence that he or she will still receive their benefits because of the PBGC's protection. Under the law, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was created to be self-sustaining, meaning that it should operate under Congress's oversight, but independent of taxpayer funds. The pension insurance in PBGC operations is supposed to be funded primarily through employer premiums not covered by the U.S. Treasury. However, this all changed under the Biden administration. The so-called American Rescue Plan Act gave a 91-billion- dollar bailout to the failing multi-employer pension fund. The need for the bailout underscores the ongoing mismanagement of funds at the PBGC. Mr. Hartogensis, your time at PBGC has been marked by waste, fraud, and neglect. In disbursing funds made available to you by the American Rescue Plan, PBGC sent almost 127 million dollars to fund pensions for nearly 3,500 dead people. This happened under your watch, despite the Office of Inspector General's warning to cross check these payments with the Social Security Administration's death master file. Then you refused to claw back or collect those funds. In January and February, Chairwoman Foxx and I sent you letters detailing the Committee's concerns and seeking answers from PBGC. Unfortunately, the responses that were received from your agency were inadequate and failed to provide clear answers. I hope you will take the opportunity today to be more forthcoming and come clean about PBGC's implementation of the American Rescue Plan and its inexcusable payments to multi-employer pension plans for dead people. I think we can all agree this should come as no surprise that dead people do not need pension checks. Additionally, the PBGC has also looted the Treasury of over 4.6 billion dollars by intentionally lowering interest rate data below the statutory limit. This willful misuse of data is another afront to taxpayers and goes against the PBGC's initial evaluation and calculation which stated that, ``PBGC does not have the authority to provide a different rate or bifurcate the statutorily mandated interest rate.'' Finally, while PBGC has loosely handled taxpayer dollars by bailing out failed multi-employer pension plans, it has given no such relief to businesses with solvent plans. Single employer programs have consistently paid high insurance premiums and consistently avoided insolvency. The single employer pension surplus is 44.6 billion. I think it is time to come to the table with policymakers and legislators to reward these plans for their good stewardship by lowering premiums. For many to achieve the American dream of a comfortable, and secure retirement, they need to rely on personal savings, social security and a pension. Sadly, the government today poses a threat to all three. Biden inflation is devaluing personal savings. Social Security faces a 23 percent benefit cut if Congress does not act to make it solvent. The security of pension programs is at the mercy of bureaucrats like those at PBGC. Retirement security is quickly eroding thanks to bureaucrats like yourself. We must hold these retirement promises made to the 31 million Americans with pension plans without sacrificing the promises made to the other 310 million Americans. Today that means embracing accountability and oversight, and with that, I yield to the Ranking Member for his opening statement.   Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I totally agree with oversight, but from a completely different perspective. It may not be surprising. Thank you, Director, thank you for your service. Thank you for being here today and thank you for the job you have done under extremely difficult circumstances. When President Biden came into office, he inherited a multiemployer pension system on the brink of collapse. Many plans were failing, and some like Central States, were projected to run out of money in the next few years. More than 1 million folks who spent their careers working in trucking, construction and other back breaking industries, were at risk of losing nearly everything they worked so hard to save for their families and for themselves. At the same time, PBGC insurance program backstopping these plans was heading toward insolvency in 2026. That was before you became Director. If plans failed, and the PBGC backstop was not there, these retirees would have, as the Director has said in his written testimony, received pennies on the dollar. It was not just retirees who were threatened by this crisis. Active workers were contributing to failing plans without any real help for their retirement, and without commensurate benefit once they retired. Due to the underlying pension rules, employers in failing plans were having trouble getting access to credit, and having their creditworthiness questioned, threatening their businesses and their employees and the retirees. Let us be clear, if the multiemployer pension crisis went unaddressed, it would not have been just workers, retirees, and employers who would have been harmed. Taxpayers were also on the hook. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among those to note that the downstream impact of plans failing, and the multiemployer pension system collapsing, would be an increased reliance on social programs and declining tax revenue. According to one estimate, it would cost the Federal Government at least 170 billion dollars over 10 years, just in lost tax revenue, and increased spending on social programs, if you had done nothing, and stayed with the status quo. The picture was bleak and rapidly getting worse. Fortunately, President Biden and congressional Democrats made it a priority to solve the multiemployer pension crisis as quickly as we could in a financially responsible way. The American Rescue Plan Act established a Special Financial Assistance program that provided sufficient assistance to failing plans to fully protect participants' and our economy. It earned pensions benefits. The SFA program was widely supported by a very diverse coalition of stakeholders, including the AFL-CIO, AARP, UPS and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. How often does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO come together to work on problem solving? That was successful because of that broad coalition. It also included scores of employers, businesspeople, small and large. They wanted to do what they were required to do and also be able to attract and retain good employees with reasonable retirement benefits. To date the SFA program has saved over 775,000 pensions, and protected 3,000 American businesses, and it is still going. Unfortunately, although impacted workers, retirees and employers reside in states represented by both political parties, not one congressional Republican voted in favor of the American Rescue Plan. Some of my colleagues continue to disparage the SFA program. Accountability? Yes. PBGC deserves credit for effectively and expeditiously implementing the SFA program and being responsive to issues raised by its Office of Inspector General regarding the program's operation. One such issue, which I suspect we will hear today, already heard about it from my Republican colleagues, pertains to the increased SFA amount of 127 million that Central States received. First, as the Director notes in his testimony, his written testimony, that PBGC did not make any payments to deceased individuals. Let me repeat that. The PBGC did not make any payments to deceased individuals. No Inspector General report has alleged that it has. Second, I understand that PBGC has addressed this issue on a going forward basis and is working with plans that receive SFA to see if anything needs to be fixed retroactively, and obviously prospectively. Third, in respect to the Central States issue specifically, the Biden administration's announcement from last week should pave the way for the 127 million to be returned to the U.S. Treasury. That 127 million will be returned to the U.S. Treasury. I join with Ranking Member Scott in applauding the Biden administration's announcement, and their continued responsible stewardship of the SFA program. With the Special Financial Assistance Program, President Biden and congressional Democrats delivered a historic solution to an urgent crisis for American workers, retirees, employers, taxpayers, and business owners. I want to thank the Director and the hardworking folks at the PBGC for their efforts to implement and administrate the SFA program. I want to congratulate you for your dedication to solving this difficult problem, and I look forward to a productive discussion, and yield back.   Chairman Good. Thank you to our Ranking Member. Pursuant to Committee Rule 8-C, all members who wish to insert written statements into the record may do so by submitting them to the Committee Clerk electronically in Microsoft Word format by 5 p.m., 14 days after this hearing, which is April 3, 2024. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 14 days to allow such statements and other extraneous materials referenced during the hearing to be submitted for the official hearing record. I will now turn to the introduction of today's distinguished witness. Today we have with us Hon. Gordon Hartogensis, who is the Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, which is located here in Washington, DC. We thank the witness for being here today, and we look forward to your testimony. Pursuant to Committee rules, I would ask that you limit your oral presentation to a 5-minute summary of your written statement I would like to remind the witness to be aware of your responsibility to provide accurate information to the Committee. I recognize Director Hartogensis for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON HARTOGENSIS, DIRECTOR, PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTEE CORPORATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. Mr. Hartogensis. Can you hear me now? There we go. Thank you, Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the important work of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to protect millions of workers and retirees in multi-employer pension plans who face significant cuts to their retirement benefits. Before the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, our multi-employer insurance program covering 11 million workers and retirees was facing a solvency crisis. The failures of numerous and larger multi-employer plans were imminent, and those failed plans would have turned to PBGC for financial assistance. PBGC's multi-employer insurance program had a small asset base, and little premium income. Those plan insolvencies would have exhausted the assets of our insurance program in 2026, leaving retirees in failed plans with only pennies on the dollar. Before ARP, workers and retirees in more than 200 severely underfunded, multi-employer plans faced the loss of pension benefits they earned and needed to support them and their families in retirement. They live and work all across the country in industries that include transportation, manufacturing, printing, services, construction, fishing and hospitality. These plans are headquartered in 31 states including Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Florida, and Tennessee. The risk of widespread plan insolvencies, and steep increases in pension costs threaten the viability of many of the tens of thousands of companies that participate in multi- employer plans, most of which are small businesses. The economic shocks resulting from the pandemic made the crisis even more acute. Implementation of SFA is PBGC's highest priority. Working closely with our board agencies we moved expeditiously and responsibly to implement this unprecedented program. PBGC is committed to effective stewardship of taxpayer funds and has identified and implemented ongoing improvements to the SFA program to further that goal. It is important to note that under this program PBGC does not make any payments to individuals living or deceased. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any of the applicant plans intentionally misled PBGC. PBGC has addressed OIG's recommendations and are resolving the issue of inaccurate participant census data in SFA applications. PBGC strongly supports payment of any SFA amount that was paid based on inaccurate census data. In November 2023, we took steps to remove deceased participants from the census data of current and future SFA applications by expanding census data requirements for all plans, applying to SFA, and by matching this data against the Social Security Administration's full file of death information. PBGC is now conducting full census data audits using the SSA's full death file for plans that previously received SFA. This process requires that plans verify the SSA death record matches and determine how many beneficiaries or deceased participants should be reflected in the calculation of the amount of SFA to which the plan is entitled. Working with our executive branch partners, we are implementing a repayment mechanism for any SFA amounts that were paid based on inaccurate census data. Central States is currently working cooperatively with the Department of Justice Civil Division to agree on the terms and conditions of repayments of the 127 million dollars and are optimistic that repayment will be complete in the very near term. As a result of the ARP's Special Financial Assistance Program, PBGC is providing crucial, financial relief to struggling multi-employer pension plans, ensuring that millions of America's workers, retirees and their families received their hard-earned pensions. To date, PBGC has approved approximately 53.6 billion dollars in SFA to 71 plans that cover around 776,000 workers, retirees and beneficiaries. We are prepared for the work ahead to complete the application and approval process for the remaining eligible plans. The SFA program has turned around the crisis that threatened the retirement security of millions of workers and retirees. Now, through this program, the workers, retirees, and beneficiaries of SFA eligible plans can rely on receiving their pension benefits far into the future. This concludes my remarks. Thank you again, and I am happy to answer your questions.   Chairman Good. Thank you. Under Committee Rule 9, we will now question witnesses under the 5-minute rule. I will wait to ask my questions at the end, and then I will therefore recognize Mr. Walberg from Michigan for 5 minutes. Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. Hartogensis for being here. It gives us a chance to seek for the truth, find answers because I am hearing things that I do not perceive to be as accurate to my understanding. Coming from Michigan and having met with countless number of Central State's pensioners, as well as employers, I understand the real-world consequences that would have taken place had the fund gone under. However, we in Congress are charged with being responsible stewards of taxpayer money, and taxpayers who did not participate in the pension have now been asked to take care of footing the bill to prop it up, so learning that the PBGC issued Central States 127 million dollars overpayment based on data that included dead participants, data that the PBGC did not doublecheck, I would consider that negligence. Let me ask you this question. On February 9th, PBGC said that it could not recover it is special financial assistance overpayments, yet on March 14th, the Department of Labor posted a statement that says plans must repay overpayments made based on dead participants on the multi-employer plan census rolls. Could you please explain by PBGC's response differs from DOL's statement, and what is the PBGC's current stance on whether it will recover the 127 million? Mr. Hartogensis. Okay. I will start with the second question first. Our current stance is that we are committed to recovering 127 million as well as any other money that was paid to any other plan for the, you know, for the same reason. Stepping back a bit. When we, you know, back in 2021, when we were charged with implementing the SFA program, we went through a process where we had--the law gave us 120 days to listen to stakeholders, to come up with ideas of standing up the program, write the regulations, come up--get those regulations through, you know, Board and OMB approval, and then get the program going. It was, the program was designed to get up and running very quickly because we, you know, we were in the middle of a multi- employer crisis. There were many plans that had gone insolvent. People had--participants had taken benefit cuts. There were plans where the participant had taken steep cuts under---- Mr. Walberg. I am certainly aware of that. Mr. Hartogensis. We--as we went to stand up the program, we looked at how what data could we use to cross check in that data, and it made the most sense at the time to look at government data that the 5,500 in premium filings that had been reported to us before the enactment of ARP. The idea is to make sure that they--we are looking at data that cannot be changed after the enactment. We then we stood up the program. At the time the complexity of using the social security death master file is that plans themselves did not have access to that data. Fast forward when our IG asked us to use the social security death master file, you know, to you know, to basically cross check the information, we agreed to do that. We ran into a--and we fixed the problem going forward. We ran into a legal snag in terms of going backward. The legal snag was our Office of General Counsel in concurrence with the-- Mr. Walberg. They told you--you have been told now to pay it back. Mr. Hartogensis. What is that? Mr. Walberg. You have been told now to pay it back. Mr. Hartogensis. Yes---- Mr. Walberg. Have you started discussions with the Central States about how they are going to return the taxpayer money? That is my key question. Mr. Hartogensis. We--the legal snag that we ran into was that our Office of General Counsel said that we could not directly, ourselves, recoup that money, the 127 million dollars. What we did is we worked, we reached out to executive branch partners, and the Department of Justice, Department of Labor, and worked with them to find a collaborative solution where we could in fact recoup the money. Mr. Walberg. What I understand now, and I have 8 seconds, but so far you have approved 53.6 billion in special financial assistance? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Walberg. What are you doing to ensure the same error was not also made with respect to the other payments that were previous? It does not look like we are learning from it. We are still expending. Mr. Hartogensis. What we have done is--so for the payments that have gone before, what we have done is, at this point, we have actually reached out to all the plans, so in total 67 plans have been paid special financial assistance, before we started doing a full death master file scrub, if you will. One of those is Central States. There are 66 others. Mr. Walberg. Mr. Chair, I know my time is over, and we will look for further background information on it because this just is not cutting it. The answers here and saying that we did not pay out to dead people, and now seeing that we are going forward still doing it is a concern. Thank you, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Walberg. I will now recognize Mr. Courtney from Connecticut for 5 minutes. Mr. Courtney. Thank you. Mr. Hartogensis: You cannot hear me? Okay. Is that better? Ms. Foxx. Yes. Mr. Hartogensis: No problem. Chairman Good. Mr. Courtney. Mr. Courtney. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Madam Chairwoman for getting the audio where it should be, and to our witness for being here today. When we talk about what is not cutting it, this Committee actually going back, really to the twenty-teens, has been the place where the multiemployer pension crisis has been playing out year in and year out. I think it is important for the record to reflect that in 2014 there was an attempt, and it was well-intentioned. The multiemployer pension assistance bill was enacted to try and give the multiemployers what was hoped for, flexibility to try and rescue their financial crisis. As your chart on page 2 of your testimony pretty powerfully demonstrates, is that it really was not cutting it. I mean these plans were still sort of cascading in a negative direction, and the authorities that were given in that 2014 law, which basically allowed plans to cut benefits to retirees. I mean that--actually was where the burden hit, was actually retired workers who had paid in faithfully to their pensions, had negotiated in good faith over the years, giving up wage increases, et cetera. Clearly with COVID, as your chart shows, I mean we had to act, or these plans just would have gone belly up. I mean your testimony is that if we had done nothing, it would have been 2026 before we would see sort of large numbers of bankruptcy. Is that correct? Mr. Hartogensis. That is correct, 2026 was the projected insolvency of the PBGC, based on large insolvencies at Central States and other plans. Mr. Courtney. Which would have affected single employer plans as well as multi-employer plans. I mean it just would have been---- Mr. Hartogensis. Well, it would not have. The two programs are legally separate. Mr. Courtney. Separate. That is right, thank you. Okay. That is good to get that clarification. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who came forward to support the ARPA bill and this program, they actually took a look at the question of taxpayer impact, and their estimate was is that if again, the catastrophe had happened, and the multi-employer plans would have been basically bankrupt, that the impact in terms of taxpayers would be 170 billion dollars. That was a conservative estimate in terms of just payments for social assistance programs. Is that correct? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Courtney. If you evaluate what the choice was before Congress, and your agency, the fact is that the ARPA was the more cost-effective solution in terms of rescuing these plans, and not putting the hardship on retirees. Is that also correct? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think it is a combination of the stress on social safety net, the social safety net. Then the human toll of people losing their pensions, and then bankruptcies by employers. I think there are a lot of, there are a lot of collateral damage would have happened. Mr. Courtney. I know Ranking Member reiterated twice in his opening remarks that no payments were made to estates of deceased retirees directly from your Agency, and in fact, the money is still being--is still held within the Central States plan, is that correct? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, it is. Mr. Courtney. This is not a situation where, you know, sometimes Social Security overpays a recipient at time of death, maybe a month or two where they have to claw it back. I mean this is really a negotiation that is happening between the Federal Government and the Central State plan in terms of recoupment. Is that? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. It is. That 127 million dollars is in a ``lock box,'' so to speak, and we are currently negotiating with them over the return. Mr. Courtney. Again, it is really just a question of who is got the lines of authority on the Federal Government side, so it is the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor that are the primary entities that are engaged in that recoupment? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. They are right now. The main, the lead is the Department of Justice at this point. Mr. Courtney. You totally cooperated with the Inspector General's Office once they flagged, or identified this issue? Maybe with your assistance, identified this issue? I mean this has not been a contested process. Mr. Hartogensis. No. Not at all. We cooperated immediately, and we fixed the problem going forward as quickly as possible because that was the priority. To kind of stem the problem as quickly as possible, and then work with our executive branch partners on recovering going backward, which was more complicated. Mr. Courtney. I mean based on what your data shows, this has been a win/win for the taxpayer. It has been a win/win for the retiree, and it has been a win/win for the employers. Again, despite the best efforts that Congress made in 2014, which was not working, this really ended up, again, rescuing the financial security of hundreds of thousands of Americans and their families, and protected this program in terms of its future existence. With that, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Courtney. I now recognize Chairwoman Foxx for 5 minutes. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am really deeply disappointed that it took dogged work from Chairman Good and me to get you and the Department of Labor to see reason, and to recover the Federal payments for dead people. It is outrageous that this took any time whatsoever, and that PBGC did not immediately own up to its mistake and recover taxpayer funds. In your comments you talked about getting the money out to the pension people, and you talk about their being taxpayers, but this money is coming from other taxpayers who do not have the benefit in many cases, of having a pension. You are worried about that. I support what my colleague from Michigan was talking about. You say you have paid out the 62 plans. Did you follow the rules on those other 62 plans that were in place that you failed to follow on the Central States, or are you going to get the money back that has been improperly paid there probably? Mr. Hartogensis. We are going to get the money back on all of them. That is---- Mrs. Foxx. Okay. Well, my question is why did you not follow the plan to begin with? You had rules on what you were supposed to do, and you ignored them. Mr. Hartogensis. Are you speaking about the 2018 OIG report? Mrs. Foxx. Well, yes. You did not follow what the rule was for how to do this for looking at the death rolls. Why did you not do that? What was your interpretation that allowed you to ignore that? Mr. Hartogensis. We first of all standing up this program in 2021 was an unprecedented program. When we looked at it there was a recommendation from our IG to use the social security death master file in our regular financial assistance programs, those are direct payments to beneficiaries. This program was not as easy to use that because the plans themselves don't have access to that file. For us to require them to use it, they could not do it. If we cross checked with that they would have all failed because we would have found dead people they did not find. When our IG recommended that we do it, we said okay. We will work and make this program better. As an improvement, what we had to do was we had to get their census data ahead of time, have a pre- application process, cross check it. Mrs. Foxx. You were supposed to do that at the beginning. My understanding was that you were supposed to do that before you turned out the money. I understand you have said census data is just one of the multiple factors that contributed to the imprecision of assumptions, so participant rolls and census data from multi-employer pension plans are fact, not assumptions. I am asking you what authority did you have for the novel interpretation that payments for dead people were actuarial assumptions? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, there was no blueprint for standing up this program. In fact, we used the data that we had. Our IG did not recommend that we cross check with the social security death master file until March 2023. Almost 2 years into the running of the program, and it was recommended as an improvement to the program, and we agreed, and we said we will improve the program. We, you know, made efforts to agree with the recommendations from the IG going forward. Then looking backward, it was more complicated to retroactively fix this, and audit the plans and recover the money. Mrs. Foxx. Well, in your opening statement it sounded like a lot of excuses for what has happened with the PBGC, and thankfully the IG was on top of this, and found 127 million dollars that belonged to the taxpayers of this country, not just the people that were getting it. We want the PBGC to do what it is supposed to do, and follow the rules in the future. We want you to go back to these other plans, which you indicated earlier that where you did not follow the rules either. It is important. This money is important. We should not be--you all acted like 127 million dollars was not significant. Do we have a commitment from you that you are going to pay attention to all of the money? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, absolutely. You do have a commitment, and 127 million dollars is very significant to us. It is important to the reputation of the PBGC and the program, and we intend to go after all of the money. Mrs. Foxx. Mr. Chairman, one quick point of personal privilege please. We have two guests in the room that I would like to recognize, Sarah Holland, who is the Principal Clerk for the North Carolina Senate, and Julie Bradburn, the Counsel for the Rules Committee are here. They are visiting with our parliamentarian, and attending, and I thank you for your indulgence. Thank you so much. Chairman Good. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. We will now recognize Mr. Norcross from New Jersey for 5 minutes. Mr. Norcross. Thank you, Chairman. Director, can you remind us of what year you were appointed to your position? Mr. Hartogensis. 2019. Mr. Norcross. Who was President at the time? Mr. Hartogensis. President Trump. Mr. Norcross. Okay. For the record, because apparently we are missing some of this. Did you make any payments to dead people? Mr. Hartogensis. No. Mr. Norcross. Any pensions? No. I did not think so. We are looking at 127 million. Myself, Ranking Member Scott, back in the 116th Congress served on a Joint Commission of Multiemployer Pensions, along with many others who brought incredible testimony about the complexity of the multiemployer system, a system that employed a--previous to that point, and had looked at ways of how we could fix the system that had inherent problems. I might remind people on this Committee that multiemployers are very different than a single employer. A single employer defaults, it goes under, it is pretty simple. The multiemployer system was set up so groups of employers could gather together to cover their employees. Unlike other systems, if an employer of the group would go bankrupt, the other employers picked up the unfunded balance. Let me repeat that. No government within themselves picked up when another employer went under. That is a fundamental issue of a multiemployer plan, and one of the complexities. It also has saved thousands of employer plans over the years. However, there were major issues with the returns and things that went on after this. At the end of the joint session there were recommendations made that were not enacted. Then came ARP, and what we saw because through no fault of their own, employees put aside their wages into a pension system that was collapsing. PBGC had indicated that if things continued the way it was then in 2026 the system would then collapse. Is that your understanding? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. It would have. Mr. Norcross. Then in fact, I think Bobby Scott actually came up with a study that close to 170 billion dollars of direct cost to our economy would go along with that. I think that was low, and that could be much higher. There was 127 million in question whether or not it should have gone because of the use of an improper data base. That has now been corrected. That has now been pointed out, which is exactly what should have been done. You are not going to get an attaboy for using the other system, but it was fixed. The money is coming back, is it not? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, it is. Mr. Norcross. Okay. In your time that serving in PBGC, have you ever had a pensioner call you up and say, ``Do not send me my check. I do not deserve it?'' Mr. Hartogensis. It has not happened yet. Mr. Norcross. Has not happened yet. Do you think it might happen? Mr. Hartogensis. Probably not. Mr. Norcross. I do not think so either. This is about helping ordinary Americans, the ones who want to work their lives, play by the rules, and have a little nest egg at the end. That is what we are talking about here. They want to turn this into something it is not, and that is incredibly hurtful. If you sat through the hearings that Mr. Scott and I did, to hear when a person loses their pension, which is their lifeline, something that they saved for their entire life. The sense that workers in both blue and red states got pension checks, did they not? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Norcross. Okay. I am just trying to understand where the hell this hearing is going, other than the money is going to get paid back. It was identified, and we are following the rules. The fact of the matter is, there is still a lot of people out there in systems that are going to be helped by the SFA, are they not? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Norcross. Okay. It might sound a little rhetorical, which is what I think this hearing is, a little rhetorical. Instead of trying to band together to help those who are retiring, that cannot go back out to work necessarily. I want to thank you for what we are doing to fix the system, what you are doing to get the money out each and every day, and most importantly, that together for pensioners whose money was saved because of what we did in Congress, I think it is incredibly important to point out. I implore to this Committee to remember that, and I would like a point of personal privilege to point out we have Michael Scott, who testified a while back in with the NCCMP, and we have Jared Karbowsky from NECA who was instrumental in helping get these along, and just many people in this room helped us help those pensioners. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Norcross. We will now recognize Ms. McBath from Georgia for 5 minutes. Mrs. McBath. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and thank you, Director, for being here with us as well. I am glad to be here today to discuss one of congressional Democrats' and President Biden's greatest achievements, savings the pensions, and the hardworking earned retirements of over a million working families in this country. Working families that have done everything right, and they have contributed to their pensions for years, they deserve the peace of mind that what they have worked so hard for is safe. Today's hearing just really gives us an opportunity to raise awareness about this incredible achievement. When you spend enough time in Washington, or even listening to the news, it is very, sometimes it is just very disheartening to hear about at times the lack of progress, but this was different. Saving the pensions of so many Americans, this was truly a great achievement. We got to ensure that over a million people that we have sworn to protect and to serve, will be able to enjoy their golden years at home, and I am one of those too that looks forward to receiving a pension. Will be able to, you know, to spend their golden years with their families in comfort, and not have to worry about being forced to go back to work at the age of 70, or possibly lose the house that they raised their kids in, and that is truly not lost on me. The White House and Congress, we understood this urgency, and the magnitude of the crisis, in particular, coming through COVID19, and we sprang into action, and we passed the American Rescue Plan. Unfortunately, some of our congressional Republicans opposed this effort, and failed to protect hardworking Americans and their retirement security. If this was just about union members, as some have suggested, who let me be clear, also deserve our support, and should not be wrongly vilified the way that they have been before this Committee time and time again, then why did the United States Chamber of Commerce support it? You may hear differently from my colleagues today, but employers strongly supported these provisions of the American Rescue Plan, and we should not forget that. According to them, without Federal assistance, there would have been 1.3 million Americans who would have seen their retirement benefits cut by as much as 98 percent within the next few years. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record two endorsement letters signed by dozens of companies, including UPS, who has a big presence in my district in Georgia, and throughout the entire State of Georgia. I am proud to represent this company, and the workers who get up every single day, and they move this country forward. UPS was one of the leading voices urging Congress to address the multiemployer crisis. In 2018, they testified before us here in Congress, and mentioned that UPS began contributing to multiemployer pension plans and contributes 2 billion dollars per year to 27 different plans across the country. UPS understood what was at stake, and for years they were demanding that Congress act, and I am so grateful that we did. Chairman Good. Without objection.   Mrs. McBath. Director, can you talk about the importance of the American Rescue Plan Act to employers like UPS, and all the other employers that have worked so hard to help support their employees? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. What the, you know, the SFA program as part of the American Rescue Plan Act did was it provided stability for employers that use union labor. Those that contribute to multiemployer plans. There was a real risk of insolvency of these plans, which creates withdraw liability. It creates a bill coming due, and that withdraw liability and it creates an overhang, so for a lot of employers it makes it harder for them to borrow money because the banks when they are looking at making a loan to them, see this huge obligation that is growing and growing from having to contribute to these insolvent plans. It becomes harder for them to get loans, and a lot of small and large businesses that cannot get loans when they otherwise would have been able to, and it creates bankruptcies in some cases. I mean there is a lot of collateral damage that was avoided by rescuing the multiemployer pension system. Mrs. McBath. Is there anything going forward you believe that we here in Congress can do to continue to make sure that we are sufficiently supporting families and our workers? Mr. Hartogensis. I think there is the possibility for future reforms to the multiemployer system. The ARP, you know, through the SFA program within ARP was designed to essentially rescue the program for 30 years, but looking out beyond that, there are reforms that we could work on with you that, you know, some things that came out of the 2018 Joint Select Committee, and other efforts that could make it even more solvent. Mrs. McBath. Thank you so much. I yield back. Chairman Good. The gentlelady's time is expired. I now recognize Ms. Hayes from Connecticut for 5 minutes. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Director, were you finished with your answer to the last question? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Absolutely. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Well, my remarks are similar to many of my colleagues, so your answer probably would have probably answered my questions as well because the efforts by House Democrats to save multiemployer pensions are important, and they bear repeating. I actually am happy that we are holding this hearing, so that the American people can really, truly appreciate and understand all of the work that we did to make sure that their pensions remain solvent, and that these plans that they paid into they could expect a return on them. The challenges facing multiemployer pension systems are not new. Democrats in the House and Senate passed the American Rescue Plan, which created the Special Financial Assistance Program, and provided the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with the resources to save the multiemployer pension programs. Without the American Rescue Plan, nearly 1 million workers and retirees could have seen their pensions and benefits that they earned and contributed to disappear. In rescuing these failed pension plans, we saved at least 170 billion dollars over 10 years in lost tax revenue, and increased spending to care for retirees. Again, not a single Republican supported the American Rescue Plan. My question to you is how would the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic have looked if the Special Financial Assistance Program had not been established? Mr. Hartogensis. I think No. 1, as I commented in my previous answer, there would have been more bankruptcies of small businesses. I think there would have been a lot of retirees that would have lost their pensions, or been stuck with severe cuts, and I think there would have been more draws on the social safety net programs. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I mean what I try to do on this Committee, a lot of our work is supporting employers, but also making sure that we are mindful of the needs of employees. We have to balance our legislation to make sure that we are meeting the needs of everyone that we serve. The multiemployer pension crisis harmed not only retirees and businesses, but also active workers. For instance, employers in failing plans like the Central States pension fund, were making pension contributions for active workers who would never receive a benefit equal to what they paid, and that's just unfair. A 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report found workers were less likely to stay with their employer when they understood their pension would be less than expected. Director, can you explain how the multiemployer pension crisis negatively impacted workers, and additionally, how are workers today benefiting from the Special Financial Assistance Program? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think that you, it is obviously it is a retention problem if you are earning a pension, and the you know, the pension is, you know, 20 percent funded, or you know, you get to the point where you do not believe the money is going to be there when you retire, so you are less likely to stick with that company, or stay with that union, or pay into that pension plan. Mrs. Hayes. Right. I guess I would say that the people who rely the most on their pension plans are generally people who have no other income sources, or are planning for retirement and looking at every dollar that they've paid in. We are not talking about the wealthiest people who do not care what they are going to collect in retirement. We are talking about people who work every day, who pay into these pension programs, who understand at the time they are hired what their pension portfolio will look like, and make intentional investments into these programs throughout their entire careers with the expectation that they will get that money back when they retire. I am very proud of the work that we did as House Democrats to save those pension plans, and ultimately protect the retirement of American workers. With that, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, and we will now recognize my friend from Virginia, Mr. Scott, for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Director, as I understand it the plans were entitled to support from the Rescue fix based on the number of participants they had. Is that right? Mr. Hartogensis. That is right. Mr. Scott. Some of those participants may have died recently unbeknownst to the plan. Did the plans have access to data to get the most recent update, and when you are talking about tens of thousands of people, did the plans have access to data that could have revealed the number of people that have died? Mr. Hartogensis. The plans have access to private sector death audits, which are not as accurate as the Social Security full death master file. Mr. Scott. They got--some got a little more than they were entitled to. Now, the 170 million dollars that is frequently talked about, that was, as I understand it, it was about one third of 1 percent of the total payment to the plan. Is that right? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. The Central States payment was .35 percent. Mr. Scott. Okay. You have, as I understand it, fixed this by requiring all future applications to send you their list of participants that you can run through the Social Security system to get any recent deaths, and cover this problem? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, we have. Mr. Scott. You are working to get information from those plans that have already been helped to make sure that they were not overpaid by running their lists through the Social Security system to get the most accurate data? Is that right? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. We are looking back at all of those plans. Mr. Scott. Okay. We have fixed it prospectively, and we are working retroactively to fix this problem? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, we are. Mr. Scott. Okay. We have heard a lot about the 170-billion- dollar cost, not to the economy generally, but to the Federal budget based on decreased tax revenue and increased social safety net if we let these plans fail, and that is without considering the pain suffered by people who lose their pensions, by businesses going broke trying to keep the plants afloat. Small towns suffering by decreased real eState taxes, banks suffering by people not being able to pay their loans, 170 billion dollars in the first 10 years, and a lot more after that. What was the cost of fixing the problem? Mr. Hartogensis. Our latest projection is 79.7 billion dollars. Mr. Scott. Less than half of the cost of doing nothing, and avoiding all of that pain? Is that right? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Scott. Okay. We have obviously been focused on the impact on the pensions themselves. What impact would the failure of these plans have on businesses? Mr. Hartogensis. The, like in my earlier remarks, they would have trouble getting loans. That is the biggest problem. The overhang and withdrawal liability from insolvent or declining multiemployer plans would make it hard for them to get loans, which could, which would rescue them if these businesses got into a pinch. Mr. Scott. The banks would know that they have a potential liability more than they would ever be able to pay. Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Scott. Their loan would be behind that, so they are not credit worthy, so the businesses could not operate as a normal business because they cannot, if they ever had a shortfall in cash-flow, they cannot borrow money? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. That is probably why there was Chamber of Commerce support for this. Mr. Scott. Chamber of Commerce supported the plan? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Scott. How many businesses have you saved already? Mr. Hartogensis. I think it is about 3,000 businesses that are involved with the 71 plans that were approved. Mr. Scott. Do you expect more businesses to be saved as you go forward? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Scott, and now we will recognize our Ranking Member from California for 5 minutes. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, thanks again for being here. Just to followup on the excellent 5 minutes by my friend from New Jersey, who has a lot of experience in this field. You were nominated by the ex- Republican President for this position, correct? Mr. Hartogensis. Um-hmm. Mr. DeSaulnier. You were confirmed by the Republican controlled Senate, Senator Hatch I believe was the Chair of Committee of Jurisdiction. Is that correct? Mr. Hartogensis. It was, yes. That is correct. Mr. DeSaulnier. You were confirmed by the Republican majority. This is the same time, just if memory serves me, that that same majority passed the largest tax cut for the top 1 percent in the history of the country, and that money is all it turns out, according to the CBO, has not trickled down, has not gone out in the economy. It has largely been retained by that group. That is just an editorial comment from me. We have talked a lot about the top line members. We have got lots of stories to this Committee, and from the Select Committee. Testimony about individual people, individual stories. Those numbers. I read about a couple, a truck driver in North Dakota, who said, well, what am I going to do if I do not have my retirement? Another freight truck driver in the Midwest who said how am I going to get a job in my 70's or 80's driving a truck when I need to get a knee replacement? I cannot make my mortgage. Tell me what is the average that these people are getting in pension benefits, in a year based on what you did, and what the average would be if you did not have done what you did? Mr. Hartogensis. Okay. We--let us take Central States, for example. The truck drivers, I think the average across the board is about $16,000.00 a year in terms of the pension benefit that they would have gotten. For long-term workers it is close, it is somewhere between $25,000.00 and $30,000.00 a year. That is the approximate range. Mr. DeSaulnier. Let us, maybe we can give you a few minutes here, or moments, to just we have reiterated this over and over again about some of the accusations about mismanagement about paying checks to deceased people. Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. DeSaulnier. Do you want to add anything either on that, on what you did as you look back on it, and anything that has come up in this hearing that you would like to clarify further about what your actions were able to accomplish given, that you approach this from my view, from being very, very fiscally responsible? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think to add to your comment that you said, I mean this program has gone out to help people in the $15,000.00 to $30,000.00 a year pension range. These are hardworking folks. I think the one takeaway from the theme of this is No. 1, the SFA Program, the PBGC did not make any payments to participants, so there has been some press that we are--the program has been used to pay dead people. That is not true at all. All the money from this program has gone to plans based on a 30-year projection. We do understand that the way the program was set up, if we knew 3 years ago what we know now, we would have used the Social Security death master file from the get- go. It is a more accurate data base. We did not, our IG flagged it for us in 2023. We have fixed this, you know, we fixed our procedures and our review process to use the social security death master file going forward, so any improvements and any approvals going forward will be using that. We ran into some complexities in terms of going backward, and recovering the money, which should be recovered for the taxpayer. We believe that we have got it fixed. We have worked with the Department of Labor and Department of Justice, and we believe we have a solution and we will be able to take care of it in the near term. Mr. DeSaulnier. Wonderful response, the IG and you working together to correct something that was identified with no loss. Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Mr. DeSaulnier. You inherited all that situation, correct? Mr. Hartogensis. The multiemployer crisis? Mr. DeSaulnier. Um-hmm? Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. I, when I came in I think my first year the net position of the multiemployer program was about negative 65 billion dollars. Mr. DeSaulnier. I might add, this is something that the Select Committee put a lot of time into but was a national problem. I know Western States, for instance, I am a former Teamster, you know, the different financial situations for different parts of the country and plans are interesting to look back at. This was all inherited in a very difficult, complex situation that you fixed, so thank you. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you to the Ranking Member. We will now recognize Mr. Banks from Indiana for 5 minutes. Mr. Banks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here today. From time to time, I hear from constituents who these days are concerned with high interest rates, and what that is doing to the value of their pension plans. I am wondering if you can talk about how can policymakers like us provide solutions, and work with you to address some of those concerns that employers and constituents have about the value of their pension plan due to high interest rates? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, that is a great question. I think high interest rates actually have been generally a good thing for defined benefit pension plans. The way that the liabilities are measured, the higher interest rates shrink the calculation of the liabilities. It makes the plan more solvent. In fact, as a very recent study, the multi-employer pension system, including the SFA Rescue is now about 89 percent funded. It has improved the funding ratios, and it has actually made defined benefit pension plans easier for employers to offer, because they essentially, they can lay off the liabilities hedge more easily with fixed income because they can get more return for the money. Mr. Banks. You are talking about pension smoothing? What does that mean, and what is the difference between pension smoothing for multi-employer plans versus single employer plans? Mr. Hartogensis. That is a good question. The idea of pension smoothing is that as interest rates kind of they go up, they go down, you know, if you look back to between the early 2000's to, I guess 2021, interest rates were very low, near zero. The idea behind that is to because the way that calculations are done within defined benefit pension plans, for the purposes of, I guess funding, like the funding rules that the Congress passes on them. Smoothing means you can kind of look back at average rates over a longer period of time, so that the calculations that happen do not jump up and down as quickly. They are more gradual. Then obviously when rates rose more recently, the smoothing makes that rise in rates as it is appreciated by pension plans more gradual. Mr. Banks. What happens when rates go down? Mr. Hartogensis. It is the same thing. Mr. Banks. It is good for high rates, but when the rates go back down. Mr. Hartogensis. It keeps the calculation of rates, you know, higher for longer, and then they fall more slowly. Mr. Banks. Okay. Interesting. Just last week the DOL confirmed that the Central States pension plan must pay back the excessive funds they received through the American Rescue Plan's Special Financial Assistance. Have you seen any pushback from Central States to pay back those funds? Mr. Hartogensis. No. I have not, and I believe we have been working with our executive branch partner agencies to recover that money, and actually think that that is going to be paid back in very short order. Mr. Banks. Why did the Executive Director of Central States pension plan ask the DOL if it was lawful to repay PBGC under ERISA? Mr. Hartogensis. That was a fiduciary concern. The idea being that they were concerned that if they paid back the 127 million dollars out of plan assets, there could be lawsuits from participants saying why did you give our money away. The fiduciary regulator over pension plans is the Department of Labor, so for them saying you can do this, this is rightful, it removes a roadblock, that was helpful. Mr. Banks. What is your message to American taxpayers who are concerned about having to bailout another multi-State pension plan on the horizon, as they watch this situation of bailing out Central States? How do you explain that to taxpayers? Mr. Hartogensis. Are you talking about just the 127 million? That issue, or the entire program? Mr. Banks. Well, all the above. I mean the precedent that we are setting and the bailout. I mean how do you explain that? What would be your message to taxpayers why that is fair? Mr. Hartogensis. I think first of all, in terms of just the 127 million dollars that we acknowledge that that is if we had to do it over again, we would have done it differently, and we are taking all steps to correct that, and the taxpayers have a right to expect us to do that, and we are going to do it. As far as the entire program, I would say that this is a unique case where a series of things led to a crisis that was so great it was going impact large parts of the country, communities all over the place. You know, in many, many different states, and the collateral damage was going to be so large that it was going to be detrimental. That is why there was, you know, kind of support from the Chamber of Commerce, as well as from labor groups. I would say that the main focus should be let is make sure this does not happen again. Chairman Good. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired, and we now recognize Ms. Manning from North Carolina for 5 minutes. Ms. Mannings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I was first elected to Congress, one of the most pressing issues facing us was the impending collapse of several multiemployer pension plans and the potential insolvency of the PBGC. Had the plans failed, millions of hard-working Americans would have had their financial security pulled out from under them. Thankfully, congressional Democrats took action. I was proud to vote for the American Rescue Plan, legislation which saved pension plans in danger of collapse. Every single one of my colleagues across the aisle voted against this vital legislation. We have heard a lot about Central States from them today, but they are focusing only on one part of it. Let us talk about Central States itself. We are talking about a plan with over 357,000 participants, including 11,700 in North Carolina, the State where I reside, and over 1,000 participating businesses. It was projected to run out of money in 2025. Can you talk about Central States, and about how important the plan is to the system no matter how far it reaches? Mr. Hartogensis. It is enormous. I would say, you know, in responding to Congressman Scott's question. He asked me how many employers are there? There is 3,000. I think over a 1,000 of those are in Central States alone. There are a lot of employers, including UPS, and a lot of different companies that use trucking services. They would and we have looked at what states do the retirees reside? It is actually across the country. I mean that, you know, those 357,000 people, they retire, they are all over the place, so it would have impacted communities all across the country, as well as those thousands of employers. Ms. Manning. I imagine the Central States' failure was not helpful--potential failure, or looming failure, was not helpful in terms of PBGC's overall financial position. Is that right? Mr. Hartogensis. That is an understatement. Ms. Manning. Okay. I am sure you and your team have dealt extensively with Central States over the years. Can you talk about the peace of mind that everybody must now feel now that their plan has been saved? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I would say to all of the participants in the Central States plan, I think they all can rest assured that they, you know, thanks to this, the ARP program, the SFA program, their plan is solvent, at least through 2051, and it depends on how things go, and they manage things, but perhaps even further. Ms. Manning. Hopefully there will be other people sitting in these seats dealing with that issue in 2051. I just wanted to bring a broader picture to the Central States discussion, and I am thankful that President Biden and congressional Democrats acted to save Central States, and other plans. Are there other steps that we should be considering to protect against the kind of crisis that Central States experienced? Mr. Hartogensis. There are. The way to look at it is that you know, this is a rescue program that takes us through the end of 2051. After that, there is certain reforms that could be made that would make the system more stable. You could look at--you could look at funding, you could look at the guaranty, you could look at premiums. There are a lot of different levers that you could look at, and we would be happy to work with Congress to come up with ideas that would extend the theoretical solvency of the entire system way beyond. Ms. Manning. Thank you. With that, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, Ms. Manning. With that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes. I would like to take a few moments in our final question time here, Mr. Director, to focus on the stewardship of taxpayer resources, and the service that is provided to those we are obligated to serve, and of course, this should be a primary concern for every government agency and department. The White House tasked all agencies to begin scaling back telework policies after they, the White House, finally recognized the pandemic was over. I would note that my office never instituted telework policies, not in D.C., not in our District, but in the President's State of the Union address in March 22, 2 years ago, he pled to the vast majority of Federal workers will once again work in person. In April of last year OMB ended maximum telework policies and sent further instructions for agencies to develop plans to increase in person work. Approximately how many employees do you have? Mr. Hartogensis. We in our headquarters, we have got about 1,000 Federal employees, and about 800 contractors. Chairman Good. Okay. Those 1,000 Federal employees, how many of those employees, or what percentage would you say have agreements to work remotely? Mr. Hartogensis. I would say the vast majority of them do. Actually, let me correct that. Remotely is completely wrong, I thought you meant telework. Remotely it is a small percentage. Chairman Good. All right. Telework? Mr. Hartogensis. Telework--it is the majority of them. Chairman Good. Why would they work telework instead of coming in the office? Mr. Hartogensis. Why would they want to telework? Chairman Good. Well, why would they--why would we have them do that? Why are they not coming to the office? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think during the pandemic we went through a couple years where---- Chairman Good. That has been gone for a few years, so why would they be teleworking today? Mr. Hartogensis. We--No. 1 reason in the last year, in 2023, we actually moved our headquarters, so we moved into more expensive real eState on 1200 K Street to less expensive, and as we have moved we settled into a new building, there have been some growing pains in the new building, and having flexibility has allowed us to get some of the kinks out of it. Chairman Good. At 1,000 employees you would say virtually all of them, or almost all of them, or what number telework versus coming into the office every day? Mr. Hartogensis. Well, all of them come into the--virtually all of them come into the office sometime. Chairman Good. What does that mean? Sometime? Mr. Hartogensis. Meaning they have different telework requirements. Some of them come in 4 days a week, some of them 3 days a week. Chairman Good. How many will you say come in 4 days a week out of 1,000? Is that true that a significant number come in 4 days a week instead of five? Mr. Hartogensis. I would say that is a small percentage. Chairman Good. Okay. What percentage come in maybe just 1 day a week, or not at all? Mr. Hartogensis. I would say probably a larger percentage are coming in but doing more telework. Chairman Good. Okay. We still have most employees not coming in to work enough in the office. How about yourself? How often do you come into the office to work physically in the office? Mr. Hartogensis. I am in the office on average every other week. Chairman Good. I am sorry? Mr. Hartogensis. I guess, 5 days out of every ten. Chairman Good. Half the time you come into work. Mr. Hartogensis. Half the time. Chairman Good. The Office of the Advocate's annual report gives a concerning review of the customer service you provide, or do not provide, to plan sponsors. The report says plan sponsor complaints consistently involve repeat long-standing issues, such as case review delays, absence of oversight and management, communication lapse, departmental coordination issues, and overall lack of transparency by the Agency's processes and procedures. Could this be at all related to telework policies, which are no longer justified, certainly from a virus standpoint? Mr. Hartogensis. I think you have to look at where the plan sponsor's advocate is coming from. This is our interaction with plan sponsors during events like bankruptcies or distrust terminations, and these are times when they are looking for the PBGC to assume the liabilities of an---- Chairman Good. I am going to interrupt you for a second and claim the time just because I only got a minute left, but suggest that we can do a better job of servicing those we are responsible to serve without having our whole team come into work every day I think is questionable. The last thing I just want to ask you. Open Books reported back in October that during your time at PBGC you spent 14 million dollars on new furniture for 1,000 employees, which is $14,000.00 per employee, 14 million dollars for new furniture for 1,000 employees, most of which who do not come to work, physically anyway, so they do not need furniture at the office, presumably. That is $14,000.00 per employee. I mean $1,400.00 per employee might be understandable if they were all coming to work, $14,000.00 for employee. Can this expense be justified? Mr. Hartogensis. That number is a little bit misleading. At our headquarters, we've got as I said, 1,000 employees and 800 contractors. If you divide by 800 instead of 1,000, or 1,800 instead of 1,000. Chairman Good. That would make it like $8,000.00 per employee. Mr. Hartogensis. It is actually, the number is closer to $7,400.00 per employee, which is---- Chairman Good. Most of whom do not come into the office. Mr. Hartogensis. Less than the average government baseline benchmark is around $9,000.00, so we were below the benchmark. I want to make one other point is that that furniture purchase was not a redecoration, we moved. We actually moved from an old headquarters to a new headquarters. In that move we saved 3 million dollars a year on rent, which over a 15 year lease is 45 million dollars. Chairman Good. My time is expired, so with respect for the Committee I need to go ahead and thank you for your comments, and now we will go to our Ranking Member for his closing remarks. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you again, Director, and to all your staff for an excellent, excellent presentation today, and a great job. Just if anybody's watching, if they are wondering the Director's background, no one would accuse you of being a socialist if I, as I have been accused of being a socialist. In addition to who nominated you, and who confirmed you, you got a bachelor's degree from Stanford in computer science. You have got a master's degree in technology and management from Columbia University, and you went out and started businesses in the tech field. If anyone is watching, that is who the director is, and I appreciate your problem solving, your intellect, and your honesty here today. It shows that we can get things done when we have divergent party affiliations and ideology. If we work to the common good of what how do we solve difficult problems? Obviously, in a difficult situation, remind people that this is the recent, the last 4 years were all part of an international pandemic. You went in, in this instance, and solved something with the Biden administration with us that was lacking a solution prior to an international pandemic. Last, just on the conversations with real people. I mean we tend to forget about this here in Washington. The real people who would have suffered if you had not done what you did. We have talked about that. President Biden and congressional Democrats recognize the urgency and magnitude of the multiemployer pension crisis, and took as I said, historic action in the American Rescue Plan Act to solve it. Even though many of their constituents would be harmed if plans failed, and the system collapsed, not a single Republican colleague voted for that legislation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation quickly and effectively implemented the Special Financial Assistance Program and took steps to improve its administration. So far, the PBGC has approved SFA applications from 71 plans, saving over 770,000 pensions and protecting 3,000 businesses to date. There is more to come. As I have said multiple times today, there are real people, real Americans, behind the pensions we have saved. Kenneth Lee Edmundson wrote to the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans that, quote, from Mr. Edmundson, ``The loss of my pension would force my wife and I to sell our house. Along with this expense, and our medical bills over and above what our health insurance covers. I have to take medications to prevent a stroke from a blot clot, and also medication to control heart rhythm. I worked many long hours for 32 years and drove in all types of weather and road conditions, sacrificing time away from my family. Thinking it would be worth it because of the pension income I would receive on my retirement. If I lost my pension, it would be devastating, just trying to survive extremely conservatively would be impossible. Are we going to be put in a situation deciding between groceries and medications? We are innocent victims of all this, we just want what we earned.'' End quote. Again, I want to thank you all. You are not bureaucrats; you are public servants. I am grateful for your service and thank you for what you accomplished. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you, Ranking Member. Mr. Hartogensis, thank you. I recognize myself for closing remarks. Thanks for taking the time again to appear before the Committee and answer our questions. Unfortunately, I remain convinced that the PBGC is the poster child for bureaucratic incompetence and gross mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. It is clear that PBGC needs to crack down the way on the way it administers the Special Financial Assistance Fund to ensure that there are not any other million dollar mishaps, or billion dollar interest rate blunders. Ten years ago, Congress created the Office of the Advocate to scrutinize PBGC practices, and be a liaison for plan sponsors. The Office of the Advocate has offered dozens of recommendations over the years to improve services and management. After a decade of watching recommendations go unnoticed, this year's annual report reiterated the need for a change in leadership. The report recommends the creation of a CEO position to provide daily oversight and management of PBGC's senior leaders. This is something I believe Congress should take seriously, as we look for legislative solutions following this hearing. We need to ensure that PBGC never needs a taxpayer bailout again. We need to ensure all government employees are showing up to work and providing excellent services to Americans. We need to assure that those in leadership are committed to following the letter of the law. We need to adjust premium rates to accurately reflect the risk associated with pension plans. I think your Agency certainly has its work cut out for it, and this Committee is certainly going to do its job, and be watching this very closely. Again, we thank you for your time, and without objection, there being no further business, the Committee stands adjourned.
