The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:15 a.m., in Room 2175, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Bob Good (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Good, Walberg, Allen, Bean, Burlison, Chavez-DeRemer, Foxx, DeSaulnier, Courtney, Norcross, Wild, Mrvan, McBath, Manning, and Scott. Staff present: Annmarie Graham, Deputy Communications Director, Mindy Barry, General Counsel; Sheila Havenner, Director of Information Technology, Alex Knorr, Legislative Assistant; Georgie Littlefair, Clerk; CJ Mahler, Professional Staff Member; Hannah Matesic, Deputy Staff Director; Audra McGeorge, Communications Director; Carson Middleton, Staff Director; Jacob Pletcher, Staff Assistant; Kelly Tyroler, Professional Staff Member; Seth Waugh, Director of Workforce Policy; Maura Williams, Operations Manager; Gavin Anderson, Intern; Illana Brunner, General Counsel; Ni'Aisha Banks, Staff Assistant; Nikita Chellani, Intern, Daniel Foster, Senior Health and Labor Counsel; Carrie Hughes, Director of Health & Human Services Policy; Cira Vera, CHCI Intern; Jessica Schieder, Economic Policy Advisor; Dhrtvan Sherman, Research Assistant; Raiyana Malone, Press Secretary; Madeline McBride, Grad Intern; Brashanda McCoy, CBCF Intern; Marie McGrew, Press Assistant; Veronique Pluviose, Staff Director; Isabella Sanchez, Intern and Banyon Vassar, Director of IT. Chairman Good. The hearing on the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions will come to order. I note that a quorum is present, and without objection, the Chair is authorized to call a recess at any time. I thank everyone for being here today. I hope our members enjoyed, and our staff a particularly long district work period over the last 6 weeks. I have heard a lot from my constituents about the issues that impact their everyday lives. High gas prices, housing, utility costs, food inflation, and fears of an economic downturn, all top of the list, and give working Americans a real concern about their economic insecurity. With costs for everything rising under the policies of the Biden Harris administration, it is important for Congress to look at ways to lower costs for American families. With constituent concerns top of mind, we meet today to discuss the bedrock law that helps provide economic security, stability and protection to a majority of the people we serve because it protects employee benefits. Specifically, we will discuss the value of employer sponsored healthcare benefits under the Employment Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. In the 50 years that ERISA has been the law of the land, it has helped incentivize employers to offer healthcare benefits that cover over 153 million Americans, or roughly half the population. ERISA works because of its preemption clause. As a conservative, you will not often hear me say I support Federal preemption of State law, but in this instance, ERISA's effect is to alleviate the burden of government on employers, which actually helps workers. Without ERISA preemption of State law, the patchwork of State regulations would hamper a business's ability to offer uniform coverage options. Imagine being relocated within the same company to a different State. It happened to me several times, and having to navigate an entire new system of healthcare regulation. Thanks to ERISA we can avoid that disaster. Employers can simply comply with the protections outlined in ERISA and provide healthcare to employees around the country. According to a Society for Human Resources Management Survey, 90 percent of workers consider healthcare to be an extremely important, or very important benefit. Another survey, by Protecting Americans Coverage Together found that 93 percent of Americans are satisfied with their employer sponsored coverage. With stats like that, it seems hard to believe that there are politicians who want to dismantle ERISA in favor of government run healthcare. Private health insurance is at risk due to the push of the left for Medicare for All. The Biden Harris administration wants to make private healthcare unaffordable and unattainable, so that Americans think that they have no choice but to support government run plans. They have saddled employer sponsored healthcare with more regulations and have removed viable coverage options like association health plans and short-term, limited-duration plans. The Democrats misnamed, Inflation Reduction Act, shifted billions of Medicare dollars to fund failing Obamacare plans. Now, Democrats plan to extend expanded premium tax credits beyond 2025 at a cost of 335 billion dollars. I do not think they understand that using tax dollars to pay for certain American's healthcare costs is robbing Peter to pay Paul, and actually makes healthcare less affordable for everyone. It costs the government over $1,000.00 more per patient per year to place someone on an Obamacare plan, than on employer sponsored insurance plan. Beyond Obamacare, the proposal from this administration Democrat nominee, Kamala Harris, are somehow even more radical. Vice President Harris has explicitly endorsed Medicare for All, a plan which calls for the elimination of private health insurance. This would prevent over half of America from keeping the plans they have now, and that they overwhelmingly prefer. A single payer system would mark the end of ERISA as we know it, and cost taxpayers an estimated 32 trillion dollars. Worse, her plan provides taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal immigrants. If the government has any legitimate responsibility in healthcare, it should at least be to benefit its own citizens. Before I close, I want to take a moment to play a video from the Washington Post that highlights just how real this threat to ERISA is.  Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. Chairman, a point of order here please. Mr. Chairman, point of order please. Chairman Good. Thank you to our staff. It is interesting-- we just had the Vice President in her own words without any commentary. For some reason, some members did not want anybody to hear that. It is very interesting. What she said---- Mr. DeSaulnier. Okay, a point of order please. Chairman Good. The gentleman is not recognized. She says under my plan of Medicare for All, private insurance companies will be able to provide coverage if they play by our rules. Although she tries to moderate and disguise her position by acting like private insurance companies can keep functioning as normal, does anyone really think they will get better healthcare when they are playing by Kamala Harris' rules. The Democrat plan is to make private healthcare unaffordable, and ultimately non-existent. One way to do this is to provide artificially, and temporarily lower cost government provided healthcare to drive providers out of the market, but everything the government does ultimately costs more, especially with the initial costs of the exploding debt that causes higher taxes and higher inflation. Every government expenditure either causes higher taxes, higher inflation, or debt exploding to the taxpayers. At a time when many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and personal savings rates are near historic lows, rising healthcare costs are driven by government interventions are unmanageable. Permitting ERISA plans room to expand and innovate is the solution. Now it is time for Congress to work to strengthen ERISA and employer sponsored health benefits for the next 50 years and beyond. With that, I now yield to the Ranking Member for his opening statement.  Statement of Hon. Bob Good, Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Over the last six weeks, I heard a lot from my constituents about the issues that impact their everyday lives. High gas prices, housing and utility costs, food inflation, and fears of an economic downturn all top the list and give working Americans a real concern about their economic insecurity.

Now, it is time for Congress to work to strengthen ERISA and employer-sponsored health benefits for the next fifty years and beyond. ______ Mr. DeSaulnier. Just a question to the point of order is a question of the relevance of the video in particular. It is more of a political statement, and I know that there is some license here in Congress for that, but that was extreme in the 10-years I have been here in Congress. Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate there are--there is work we can do with ERISA, clearly, but being as partisan as you just introduced this, and using absolutes about every time there is a tax increase, every time the government spends money it leads to all of these horrible things. This is a mixed market economy, capitalistic economy, and it requires rules and guidance that we all come to agreement on to make it work, including unfortunately, some of the worst aspects of human nature's greed, and lack of ethics, and we are going to talk about that a little bit today, for instance with MultiPlan. In the spirit I think we have had for the last 4 years when we have been on this Committee, I appreciate our differences, but that was a rather extreme opening comment in my perspective. To the witnesses, thank you for being here. All of your perspectives are valuable. We appreciate it at this important hearing on ERISA. When ERISA was enacted in 1974, Congress made its intent clear. The law's primary purpose is to ``protect the interest of participants in employee benefit plans, and their beneficiaries.'' To that end, ERISA established crucial consumer protection standards, provided remedies to workers whose claims are denied, or whose plans are mismanaged, and required fiduciaries to act solely in the best interest of the plan participants. As our Subcommittee discusses ERISA today, it's vital to keep this fundamental purpose at the forefront. It is about consumers. We must also keep in mind the urgent need to improve the efficiency of our health care system. Our country currently spends more than 17 percent of our gross domestic product, over 4.5 trillion on health care, far more than our peer countries. Workers and consumers are increasingly shouldering their costs through rising premiums and deductibles. Our health outcomes are among the worst in the developed world. In the other developed countries, they have a form of universal health care, so everyone can get quality health care. Different versions in different countries allow for the private sector to participate in it. They have better outcomes, longer lifespans. The healthcare system is plagued by numerous challenges and inefficiencies, including, excuse me, the lack of price transparency, the excessive fees charged by self-dealing third-party administrators and pharmacy benefit managers, and the escalating cost of medical care and prescription drugs. As the New York Times has documented, companies like MultiPlan and major third-party administrators make huge profits by charging high fees to employers, short-changing health care providers, and leaving workers on the hook for exorbitant medical bills, and yes, frequently their actions lead to death. This is not an efficient use of our health care dollars, which is why Ranking Member Scott and I have written to the Department of Labor in support of their oversight on these practices, and more funding for them so they can do a reasonable job. I sincerely hope my Republican colleagues will consider joining us to address these issues, including by supporting adequate funding for the vastly under-resourced Employee Benefit Security Administration and extending the bipartisan No Surprises Act implementation fund, which expires at the end of the year. Despite the challenges we continue to face, it is also important to acknowledge the significant progress we have made in recent years. The Affordable Care Act has provided preventative health services at no cost, protected tens of millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, and allowing young people to remain on their parents' health plans until they turn 26. The American Rescue Plan Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, strengthened ACA premium tax credits. The tax credits reduced monthly costs for low-income individuals and provided premium relief to millions affected by the subsidy cliff, particularly self-employed, small businesspeople. Just yesterday the Biden administration, Biden-Harris administration, finalized landmark new rules that will benefit compliance with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equality Act, and ensure that behavioral health needs are treated fairly by insurers and in health plans. While these reforms have strengthened workers' benefits, and improved the efficiency of our health care system, I am concerned by the proposals to take us backward. For instance, one of our biggest recent successes in that Biden-Harris administration, for the first time recently completed negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, to reduce drug prices for nearly 9 million Medicare beneficiaries, while slashing seniors' out of pocket costs by 1.5 billion dollars in 2026 alone. Despite these historic savings, the Republicans' extreme Project 2025 policy agenda proposes to repeal this program, and instead put billions in the pocket of big pharma. I am a recipient of one of those ten drugs. When I first got it to save me from stage 4 cancer, it cost as much as $500.00 a day. Now, next, thanks to this, and the pressure we put on them, it is close to what the European Union charges of under $90.00 a day. In Australia it costs $37.00 a day. American taxpayers are subsidizing lower costs in other developed countries. Rather than roll back our historic progress, this Committee should move forward with House Democrats' legislation to extend drug price negotiations beyond Medicare and save billions for workers and businesses with private health insurance. While we may not agree on every issue, I hope that today will be a robust discussion of the future of employer-sponsored coverage, and how we can collaborate across the aisle to address the challenges we face and get rid of the inefficiencies and the greedy profit-taking by some of private sector entities. I yield back.  Statement of Hon. Mark DeSaulnier, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions As a point of order, I question the relevance of that video in particular.

Our third witness is Mr. Anthony Wright, who is the Executive Director of Families USA in Washington, DC. Welcome, Mr. Wright. Our final witness is Dr. Paul Fronstin, who is the Director of Health Benefits Research for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, EBRI, am I saying that right, in Washington as well. Thank you, Dr. Fronstin. We thank the witnesses for being here today, and we look forward to your testimony. Pursuant to Committee Rules, I would ask that you limit your presentation to a 5-minute summary of your written statement. I would also like to remind the witnesses to be aware of their responsibility to provide accurate information to this Subcommittee, and we will now recognize Ms. Shuman for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MS. ILYSE SCHUMAN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, HEALTH AND PAID LEAVE POLICY, AMERICAN BENEFITS COUNCIL, WASHINGTON, D.C. Ms. Schuman. Chair Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and distinguished Subcommittee members, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the American Benefits Council. Employers play a critical role in the healthcare system, providing health benefits to nearly 180 million Americans. In sponsoring these benefits, employers have made significant contributions not only to the health and well-being of working families, but to taxpayers, the economy, and the healthcare system as a whole. For 50 years ERISA, and ERISA preemptions specifically has been the cornerstone of the employer sponsored health benefits. America's employers recognize that their investment in health coverage is an investment in their workforce, and in their business success, and working families and voters recognize its value too. According to polling data from the Winston Group on behalf of the Alliance to Fight for Healthcare, more than three-quarters of registered voters expressed satisfaction with their employer-sponsored health coverage, far preferring it to a stipend to shop in the individual market, and in even more stark preference over a system where employers do not provide health benefits at all. Employer-sponsored health benefits yield a significant return on investment to the Federal Government and taxpayers. For every dollar of Federal expenditure for the tax exclusion of employer sponsored health benefits, employers pay more than $5.00 in benefits. It would cost said taxpayers substantially more to provide the same level of health benefits through a direct government program. With a vested interest in securing the health and well- being of their employees, far from being mere payers that just sign checks for health benefits, our member companies employes have been innovators in market driven approaches to provide high value benefits. Our member companies also clearly understand that their innovation and ability to provide affordable, high-quality health coverage, are built on the foundation of ERISA, by enabling self-funded multi-State employers to offer uniform benefits to their employees nationwide. However, ERISA preemption is under assault, as states seek to impose their own requirements on self-funded group health plans. Without ERISA uniformity, these plans will be extraordinarily difficult to administer, forcing employers to offer different benefits to their employees based on their location. ERISA's 50th anniversary comes at a critical time to convey this important message. I also want to stress that employers are deeply concerned about overly burdensome Federal health plan regulations that add cost and complexity, but without commensurate value to either plan sponsors or employees. I also want to stress that employers are deeply concerned about rising healthcare costs, fueled by a lack of transparency and competition. While employers continue their innovative efforts to lower cost, Federal legislative solutions are needed to create a more competitive and transparent healthcare marketplace. 90 percent of voters with employer sponsored coverage agree that it is important for Congress to take action this year to lower healthcare costs. There are solutions at hand. The Council strongly supports the lower cost, more transparency, including its PBM provisions, and more than 80 percent of voters agree that it should be a priority for Congress to pass price transparency legislation. The Healthy Competition for Better Care Act is critical that with growing market power, large hospital systems are able to demand higher and higher prices and impose anti-competitive contracting restrictions that stifle competition. The Council urges the Committee to pass the Healthy Competition for Better Care Act. Allowing hospital facility fees to be charged for telehealth appointments is precisely the type of payment distortion and obtuse billing practice that increases costs for patients and payers. Voters agree by an overwhelming margin of 8 to 1, that patients should not be charged for this. The Council urges the Committee to approve the Transparent Telehealth Bill's Act to address the concern. On this 50th anniversary of ERISA, the message is strong and clear from employers, employees and voters about the significant value of employer sponsored health coverage, that is built on their foundation--is the call for Congress to take action this year to lower healthcare costs. These steps rely on and must be taken in concert with the uniformity ERISA preemption affords. 50 years after this landmark legislation was enacted, these provisions are even more important today. I appreciate the opportunity to testify.   Chairman Good. Thank you. I now recognize Ms. Wade for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MS. HOLLY WADE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS RESEARCH CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C. Ms. Wade. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of NFIB, I appreciate the opportunity to testify. Small businesses are the foundation of the U.S. economy, but unfortunately in recent years, the small business half of the U.S. economy has been significantly impacted by inflation, along with significant challenges in attracting qualified applicants for open positions. Operating a business in these conditions is particularly difficult for small business owners. Most small business owners compete for talent by offering competitive wages and attractive benefits. Health insurance is one of the most popular, but costly benefits offered by about 30 percent of small employers. However, escalating health insurance costs add to the inflation pressures many business owners face. These higher costs limit their ability to compete in the marketplace. The relationship between small businesses and health insurance has been a long-standing challenge for owners, whether they offer or do not offer the benefit to their employees. 63 percent of all employers believe that providing health insurance to recruit and retain employees is very or moderately important to them. Almost all, 94 percent of small employers find it challenging to some degree to manage the costs of providing employer-sponsored health insurance. The cost of health insurance continues to rank as the most burdensome issue for small business owners, a ranking it has held since 1986. Currently, 41 percent of small business owners reported as a critical issue in operating their business. The average cost of individual health insurance plan has increased 112 percent in the last 20 years for small employers. The average deductible for those policies has increased by 194 percent. Small businesses are not only paying significantly more for their health insurance, but their deductibles are more costly as well. In response to these escalating costs, the offer rate among small businesses has declined from 42 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2023. Lack of insurance options, and affordability issues create significant headwinds for small business owners, and that most of them find the benefit important in retaining current employees and recruiting applicants. Broken down by employers who do and do not currently offer health insurance, 94 percent of owners who currently offer, believe that it is important, and 58, over half, percent of owners who do not currently provide health insurance find it important in those aspects of retaining and retention of employees. Almost two-thirds of non-offering small employers say that the health insurance is too expensive for them to offer it as a benefit. Most small business owners are offering health insurance purchase fully funded plans in the small group market. However, the small group market has experienced a sharp decline in issuer participation, and overall membership. Down 7.4 percent from 2022 to 2023, ending the year with 8.5 million participants. This decline is driven primarily by the escalating cost of insurance. The coverage options in this market have declined. Alternatives, like those provided under ERISA framework become vital. Recent reports point to an increase in the percentage of small firms offering health benefits through a level funded plan, for instance. As we mark the 50th anniversary of ERISA, it is an opportune time to reflect on the rule that employer provider coverage has played in the U.S. and on small businesses. While most small firms remain fully insured, ERISA protections have been crucial in ensuring that even the smallest businesses can offer health benefits to their employees, while having the flexibility and predictability to design benefits in a way that works best for them. Moving forward, ERISA should be protected and strengthened to empower those small businesses with greater coverage choices under this framework, enabling them to offer valuable benefits that will contribute to their growth, stability and success in the U.S. economy. Some policy solutions to strengthen small firm's coverage choices; allowing small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together to achieve savings through economies of scale, protect small business's access to stop loss insurance, re-evaluate and right size mandates that drive up premium costs, and promote price transparency and price certainty. We thank the Committee for its vital work in the past year, expanding coverage choices for small businesses under ERISA, and look forward to partnering with you to continue building on this law's success. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify for you today.   Chairman Good. Thank you. I will now recognize Mr. Wright for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MR. ANTHONY WRIGHT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FAMILIES USA, WASHINGTON, D.C. Mr. Wright. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Good, Ranking Member Scott, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and members of this Committee. My name is Anthony Wright. I serve as the Executive Director of Families USA, a national health care consumer advocacy organization. I appreciate the opportunity to testify on behalf of consumers and workers on the 50th anniversary of ERISA, which is an excellent excuse to have some cake, but also to reflect on the employer-sponsored coverage, and its State, which is the pillar of our healthcare system that covers 60 percent of the Nation, 164 million Americans, including two-thirds of them in self-insured plans under ERISA. Workers with on-the-job benefits often consider themselves lucky to have group coverage, having a large employer share in the cost of coverage, and negotiate for the best quality and cost. They increasingly need help to access basic benefits, or key consumer protections, and most of all on affordability. Only Congress can provide that help. Since ERISA's broad State preemptions significantly diminish states' ability to innovate and improve healthcare quality, access, and affordability. Limiting states from even enacting modest efforts, like requirements to contribute to State health payment data bases for greater price transparency. Therefore, it is Congress that needs to be vigilant and proactive in updating ERISA, and other Federal laws, to improve health access and affordability. That is why Families USA, over the last many decades, has supported the many congressional actions to improve ERISA, such as COBRA, HIPAA, mental health parity and the Affordable Care Act. The most recent example is the No Surprises Act, which bans surprise bills. Prior to that, 33 states passed their own protections, but they did not apply to millions of their residents in self- insured plans. Congress should continue to take steps that supplement State action, whether on the unfinished work on surprise ambulance bills, or on filling holes on ERISA's standards and patient protections. For example, should all large employers be required to provide the same essential health benefits that small employers give their workers? Some states are now working to update and improve their essential health benefit standards to better meet consumers' needs. The Federal Government should follow. Similarly, only Congress could provide relief to those in self-insured plans who need more comprehensive remedies for denials of medically necessary care. Another issue, when consumers have these or other problems, no one knows where to go for help. I mean no one. While 40 percent of the Nation are in these self-insured plans, in a recent KFF survey, zero percent of respondents guessed that their plan was regulated by the Federal Department of Labor. Congress should ensure that the Department has the adequate staffing and resources to ensure proper oversight of ERISA plans and their finances, to take complaints, and to support consumer assistance programs to help people navigate our complex health care system. Ultimately, the biggest issue for ERISA plans is the biggest issue in all of health care: affordability. No one is insulated from high health care costs, not even large employers and their workers. Inflated and irrational health care prices are putting Americans' health and financial security at risk. More than 100 million Americans are saddled with medical debt. Half of all Americans report foregoing medical care due to cost, and a third of Americans indicate that the costs of medical services interfere with securing basic needs, like groceries and rent. Over the past 25 years, the cost of family employer-based plan has increased from $6,500.00 to almost $24,000.00. The worker's share of premium and out-of-pocket costs has risen dramatically as well. In 2007, 60 percent of individuals in employer-based coverage had minimal deductibles under $500.00. Now 60 percent have deductibles over $1,000.00. For most low-wage workers, that means they have to pay more than what they have in the bank before most of their coverage even kicks in. For workers and employers alike, as we see today, rising healthcare costs have become unsustainable. Fortunately, Congress has the opportunity to take action to improve health care affordability, including addressing the underlying market failures that drive rising health care costs, ensuring price transparency, site-neutral payments, and other reforms advanced by this Committee in the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act. Broadening the prescription drug cost containment policies in the Inflation Reduction Act into the commercial market, so that we have more discounts for more drugs for more people. Taking timely access to extend enhanced tax credits to prevent dramatic premium spikes if they are allowed to expire next year and instituting and updating caps on out-of-pocket costs, both for prescription drugs and generally. Thank you again, for the opportunity to join in today's discussion on the ways to build on the foundation of ERISA to improve access to affordable coverage to everyone, including workers and their families. I yield back.   Chairman Good. Thank you. I will now recognize Dr. Fronstin for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF DR. PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR, HEALTH BENEFITS RESEARCH, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, D.C. Mr. Fronstin. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, my name is Paul Fronstin. I am the Director of Health Benefits Research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Established in 1978, EBRI is committed to data dissemination, and policy research in education on financial security and employee benefits. Consistent with our mission, EBRI does not lobby or advocate specific policy recommendations. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. Employers' commitment to worker health established its roots in the late 1800's. Examples of health programs include the mining, lumbering and railroad industries. Employers had a practical interest in their workers' health. During World War II, employers began to offer more formal health insurance. Because employer contributions to insurance did not count toward wage controls, health insurance became an attractive means to recruit and retain employees. Employers today offer health coverage because of their belief that offering has a positive impact on the overall success of the business, and ERISA's preemption of State law has created an environment of national uniform standards for employee benefit plans, thus giving employers the regulatory means to continue to offer health benefits as they do today, yet there have been questions along the way as to whether employers have reached the tipping point with health benefits. Predictions have been made that employers would stop offering coverage. In this testimony, I examine how the availability of employment-based health coverage has been changing, by examining employer sponsorship of coverage, as well as employee eligibility for coverage. There is no comprehensive dataset that allows us to go back to the days of ERISA. However, the percentage of the population with employment-based health benefits can be tracked. It was at or near 70 percent between 1970 and 1989, between 1989 and 2007 it varied between 62 and 68 percent. Since then, it has varied between 58 and 62 percent, with 61 percent in 2022. The declines in coverage often coincided with relatively high increases in premiums, though there were years when the correlation was far from perfect. The more recent stability in premiums coincided with stability in the percentage to population with employment-based health coverage. In 2022, employment-based health coverage continued to be the most common source of health coverage. When examining data since 1996, the percentage of employers offering health benefits was at a near record low in 2023. However, it is important to put this in context. Small employers are in large part responsible for the decline in coverage, and most employers in the U.S. are small. Just about every employer with 100 or more employees offer health benefits today. Despite the overall decline and the percentage of employers offering health coverage, the percentage of workers eligible for health benefits has been mostly constant since 1996. The eligibility rate has not changed much because the majority of workers are employed by large firms. Workers have historically rated their health coverage as favorable and continue to do so. Just over one-half are extremely, or very satisfied with their current plan, and one- third is somewhat satisfied. Only 12 percent say they are not at all satisfied, and these figures are essentially unchanged since the late 1990's. ERISA effectively preempts State and local regulation of self-funded health benefits. The scope of this has generated some degree of debate. Proponents of ERISA preemption point to the creation of a uniform and predictable regulatory environment for employers, while detractors believe that State and local governments ought to have a great role in pursuing healthcare reform, beyond their current ability to regulate health insurance. On Thursday, EBRI is releasing the findings from a series of focus groups, with benefits decisionmakers of large employers. Three main themes emerged from these discussions. First, under ERISA preemption, there is a uniform landscape of regulations, rather than a patchwork of different State level regulations, which makes it possible for an employer operating in more than one State to administer and offer benefits equitably to their employees. Second, ERISA preemption reduces administrative costs, thus enabling employers to deliver richer benefits and lower cost coverage to their workers. Third, ERISA preemption fosters innovation that would otherwise be stifled by different states requiring different coverages or administrative rules. Employers remain committed to providing health benefits to employees and their families. If ERISA preemption were eroded, however, benefits executives worry about higher costs for providing health benefits. Chairman Good, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today. My colleagues and I look forward to working with you and members of the Committee in the future. Thank you.   Chairman Good. Thank you. Under Committee Rule 9, we will now question witnesses under the 5-minute rule, and I will wait to ask my questions at the end, and therefore, recognize Mr. Walberg from Michigan for 5 minutes. Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the panel for being here. The Employer Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, enacted in 1974 is a cornerstone of American labor law that has profoundly shaped the landscape of employer sponsored insurances we have all mentioned today. ERISA has played a vital role in elevating the quality of employer sponsored insurance over the past 50 years. It has empowered workers, retirees, and others to make informed decisions about their health and retirement benefits, ensuring that their needs are met throughout their careers, and into retirement. ERISA has not only contributed significantly to the stability and security of millions of working families, but also brings tremendous values to taxpayers and the economy overall. Thank you to the witnesses for being here to help commemorate ERISA's 50th anniversary. Mr. Chairman, I do not see any balloons in the room, but we probably should have had some, though we do have some hot air, I guess, in the room. Ms. Schuman, thank you for being here. In what key ways has the healthcare industry changed since the passage of ERISA in 1974? Ms. Schuman. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. The healthcare industry has changed dramatically in the past 50 years. It has certainly become more complex and consolidated, but it has also become more innovative, and a lot of this innovation has been enabled and fueled by ERISA, and the employer innovation that that enables and fuels. Mr. Walberg. Let me jump on that and ask you to suggest some top recommendations that you might give to Congress on how ERISA can continue to protect employer's ability to offer high- quality and affordable health benefits. Ms. Schuman. Well, first of all let me thank you by recognizing the connection between ERISA and the ability of employers to offer affordable, high-quality coverage. That is predicated on ERISA and ERISA preemption, and the ability to offer affordable high-quality coverage to their employees nationwide. My top recommendation for you on how ERISA can continue to protect employer's ability to do so, is to protect ERISA preemption, mindful of expanding efforts at the State to erode that. Congress does need to do more to address the lack of transparency and competition in the healthcare marketplace that are driving higher costs for employer sponsored coverage, and those two can and must be taken in step, protecting ERISA and ERISA preemption, and at the same time taking action to lower healthcare costs. Thank you. Mr. Walberg. Thank you. Ms. Wade, could you discuss the challenges small employers face when they try to offer coverage to their employees, and what kinds of innovative coverage models would make it easier for small businesses to offer health coverage, and also if you would comment on how expanding access to association health plans would help small businesses to offer coverage? Ms. Wade. Certainly. Thank you for the question. For small firms, they are challenged in a whole myriad of ways, one of which is whether they offer health insurance at the beginning of operating their business as an employer firm. The challenge of costs and affordability is impacting their ability to construct competitive packages to attract talent, to retain their current employees. One of the key components for small business in the affordability aspect, is allowing a diverse array of plans and structures and the benefit to offer their employees that makes sense to them. More transparency in the cost part of it but offering more plan designs that makes sense for them to offer to their employees. Association health plans, the way it is constructed is very specific and confined, and restricted to a lot of small business owners currently. Expanding the availability of Association health plans to a larger population would allow them to purchase in economies of scale that are more afforded by large firms and will give them a competitive leg up from their current status right now in being able to afford. As I mentioned in my statement, those who are not able to afford health insurance and offering currently are looking to do that. They want to be able to compete for talent and retain current employees, so many of them are hoping that in the future the affordability will be more manageable, and that they will be able to offer the benefit to their employees because they know that that is the second most valuable, outside of wages, for competitive structure of that. Mr. Walberg. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. We will now recognize Mr. Courtney from Connecticut for 5 minutes. Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To the witnesses, you know, Mr. Fronstin I think did a really nice job about going back to the origins of employer-sponsored insurance that the World War II decision to make the value of those plans tax- exempt, really has been sort of foundational. Again, I would just like to ask all the other witnesses, the simple question yes or no, do you think Congress should reduce the tax-exempt status of health care--employer-sponsored health plans? Ms. Schuman. Absolutely not. Mr. Courtney. Ms. Wade. Ms. Wade. Absolutely not. Mr. Courtney. Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright. Given that it is a foundation for 60 percent of people to get coverage, no. Mr. Courtney. Again, the reason, and as a former employer, is that if Congress made that move, it basically would add to the taxable income of all the employees of Ms. Wade's membership, as well as Ms. Schuman's membership. Unfortunately, this is a very relevant issue in 2024. Project 2025, which is the document generated by the Heritage Foundation, with dozens of former Trump officials, Russell Vought, the former budget director of the Trump administration, also the Chair of the Republican National Committee's Platform Committee, again, in that package in Project 2025, it proposes to cap the tax exclusion below 100 percent, which is a tax increase for workers of employee-based, employer-sponsored plans. The Republican Study Conference, which again is closer to home here in the House, about 70 percent of the membership of the majority caucus issued their 2025 budget document earlier this year, which proposed the same thing. Again, if you look at the history surrounding this issue, Milton Friedman, the Godfather of conservative economics, wrote an essay. Mr. Fronstin is probably familiar with it, How to Fix Health Care Costs, where he proposed eliminating the tax-exempt status of employer sponsored insurance. This year, in 2024, given the fact that we have Project 2025, which again, has got the fingerprints of the former President's former employees, as well as people working on his campaign, proposing to cap the tax exclusion, as well as the Republican Study Conference doing exactly the same thing. When we are talking about threats to employer-sponsored insurance in 2024, that is really the elephant in the room in terms of making sure that the foundational cornerstone that created employer-sponsored insurance, back during World War II remains intact. I can say this as somebody who when we passed the Affordable Care Act, and Ms. Schuman knows this, it included a Cadillac tax, which we furiously were succeeded in terms of delaying the impact of that for 10 years after the law passed. Then finally, in the House, with a bill that I was the lead sponsor, and had great bipartisan support, stripped that from the law by a vote of 419 to 6. There is strong bipartisan support for maintaining the tax-exempt status of employer- sponsored insurance. However, that is very much, very, very much at risk in terms of just the positioning of different forces, think tanks and other groups, that really want to go at this. Which again, if you go back and read the Godfather, Milton Friedman's economic treatises on this, I mean that is a, you know, just a fundamental tenant of a lot of conservative economists in this country, which is that that's really the source of a lot of the problems for the costs of health care insurance. Mr. Wright, you mentioned the fact that the Inflation Reduction Act last August 15th during the recess, announced the first ten medications, in terms of the negotiated prices. 80 percent cut in cost of some of those very high-cost, high- utilized medications in Medicare. We have a bill, the Lowering Drug Costs for American Families Act, which would extend the benefits of that negotiation to employer-sponsored plans, or individual plans, optional. Do not have to do it if you do not want it, but can you, from Families USA, would that help small employers as well as individuals get the benefit of lower costs, which are driving higher premiums? Mr. Wright. The short answer is, yes, that individuals, businesses, insurers, other payers, are all struggling with the cost of high inflated and irrational health prescription drug prices. Using the authority of negotiation that is in the Inflation Reduction Act to extend those discounts, not just to the Medicare program, but more broadly in the commercial market, would be a big boon, and start to chip away at the affordability issues that people have at the pharmacy, and when paying premiums. Mr. Courtney. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. We will now recognize Mr. Allen from Georgia for 5 minutes. Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and first, just quickly, my position on employer health insurance or ERISA. We can always have a government program in this country, but we need to give the business community the flexibility to provide the best coverage at the best value for their employees. The business community will figure this out. My position is to give this coverage the same waivers that the Affordable Care Act gave to unions and the faith-based company--faith-based part of the healthcare industry, so that we can get totally away from Federal regulatory issues dealing with ERISA, as far as compliance, and all the costs, and everything that is being added to that. I also want self-employed people to be able to participate in ERISA. We do not have time to discuss that today, but I would like your written response to that idea as far as going forward and how to solve the tremendous cost increase in health insurance. In recent years, another matter is growing adoption of so- called alternative funding programs and employer sponsored plans. Some stakeholders have suggested that AFP vendors divert employees into their programs, and push employers to adopt discriminatory benefit designs that single out medicines that treat specific conditions. They suggested this type of action could violate ERISA and HIPAA compliance. Representative McBath and I recently sent a letter urging the Department of Labor to investigate the prevalence of AFPs in the employer sponsored health coverage market, and asked the DOL to take action to prevent these predatory practices. Ms. Schuman, how well do you think employers are aware of potential ERISA compliance risks with AFPs? Have you provided any education about compliance risk to member companies? Ms. Schuman. Thank you for that question, Congressman. The Council's membership typically rely on traditional PBM and drug payment models, so members have not raised AFPs as an issue that I am aware of, and the Council has not actively addressed AFP with its members. It does sound like this is certainly a concerning practice, but I said it has not been brought to our attention by our membership. Certainly drug costs are a big concern for our members, and just want to take this opportunity to again offer my support for the great bipartisan work of this Committee already in the Lower Cost More Transparency Act, to bring more transparency and oversight of PMBs in an effort to do that. Mr. Allen. Well, it is a long and frustrating fight to get your medications approved through the PBM step therapy process. It often results in missed days of work, and a worsening of their condition. The lack of transparency, as you mentioned, PMB practices makes it difficult for employers to assess whether the administration of drug benefits aligns with their employees' best interest and well-being. Many people I represent in the Georgia's 12th District, experience these same frustrations, which is why I am proud to cosponsor the Safe Step Act, which would ensure employer health plans, including their contracted PBMs, offer an expedient and medically reasonable step therapy exceptions. Dr. Fronstin, how would legislation such as Safe Step Act help people with chronic conditions, who are covered by the ERISA plan? Mr. Fronstin. I have not studied the Safe Step Act, specifically, but it sounds like it would streamline prior authorization process, and speed up the process again for certain medications, when all the medications are not working as expected. Mr. Allen. What can be done to help employers navigate the complex benefit structures, pharmacy networks, and formularies that are obscured by the PBM incentives? Mr. Fronstin. PMB incentives are complex, and I think building an employee benefit program is complex as well for many employers, even large employers, and sometimes beyond the expertise of many benefit managers. That is why they use consultants, use ERISA attorneys. They often learn from each other at conferences. There are some purchasing coalitions that employers have joined to help them navigate a complex healthcare system, and provide them some leverage. Mr. Allen. Thank you. I am out of time. I have additional questions I would like to submit for the record. With that I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. Without objection.  Chairman Good. I now will recognize Ms. Manning from North Carolina for 5 minutes. Ms. Manning. Thank you. With regard to the antics at the top of this hearing, I did not realize we were playing campaign ads here. In fact, I thought there were ethics rules that separate our official acts from campaigning, and if I had known, I certainly would have brought a few campaign ads of my own to play. I would like to turn to the actual subject of this hearing, and I want to start by thanking our witnesses for being here, to celebrate the anniversary of ERISA. It is the essential cornerstone of our Nation's health care policy, and the consumer protections Congress has passed to strengthen it, such as the Affordable Care Act, have ensured better outcomes for millions of Americans. Sadly, for almost 15 years, the Republican Party has waged an all-out war on the ACA, and the landmark consumer protections it has enshrined into law for millions of working people in this country. These include protections for more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, requiring coverage of contraceptives, prohibiting charging women higher premiums than men for the same coverage and so much more. In April of this year, 62 percent of the public had a favorable opinion of the ACA, and these protections are critical to my constituents and frankly, they are critical to my family. I have a daughter who has a serious pre-existing condition, a chronic illness that thankfully is successfully treated with a biologic that would cost her $23,000.00 every month, if not for the protections of the ACA. I am grateful that we passed the IRA, which will finally allow our government to negotiate over some of the most expensive prescription drugs available, and I am also astonished that the Republicans continue to push for the repeal of the ACA. In fact, Project 2025, Trump's Project 2025, lays out a plan for undermining and destroying the ACA. Project 2025 has a detailed plan from a right-wing think tank for the next Republican administration. Mr. Wright, let me ask you about this. One of the key policies of Project 2025 is to separate the subsidized ACA insurance market from the non- subsidized insurance market. Can you explain what this would mean for Americans left out of the ACA's protections? Mr. Wright. I think the things that we would be concerned about is the loss of consumer protections and ultimately coverage for millions of Americans who depend on that coverage, that would have--losing those protections, and for some would be a problem. Losing the coverage would also have a destabilizing impact on the overall market because those who are no longer covered would be left in a smaller and sicker risk pool, and thus have ever increasing premiums as a result. The loss of consumer protection would be broader than that, and that would be the concern, whether it is access to basic essential health benefits, or as you mentioned, an issue with regard to being able to get the care that you need, regardless of pre-existing condition. Ms. Manning. For example, it could cause the loss of protections for people like my daughter, who have a pre- existing condition, as do millions of Americans across the country. Is that correct? Mr. Wright. That is correct. Ms. Manning. Thank you. Overall, would this reduce American's health care costs, or increase them? Mr. Wright. As I mentioned, the destabilizing effect would not be just an impact on the people who would lose the subsidy, or lose the coverage, but also have a broader impact on the system as a whole, in terms of leaving people in a smaller and sicker risk pool, with higher premiums. Yes. Ms. Manning. To put it plainly, it could increase health care costs overall. Is that correct? Mr. Wright. Yes. Ms. Manning. Project 2025 also calls for keeping ``anti- life benefits'' out of benefits plans, including coverage for abortion care, and I assume, including coverage for contraception or birth control, and this is actually written in the plan, including costs for surrogacy. Mr. Wright, could you speak to the benefits that reproductive care coverage has had for Americans? Mr. Wright. It is critical that people have the ability to plan and start families when and how they want them, but also to get the prenatal and postnatal care to have healthy babies, and children, and adults. This is critical, especially now that we are in a maternal--we have a maternal mortality crisis, and so those kinds of services are incredibly important to make sure that we deal with both disparities and the overall quality of care. Ms. Manning. Thank you. I have more questions. I will submit them in writing. Thank you very much. Mr. Wright. Thank you. Chairman Good. Thank you. We will now recognize Chairman Foxx from North Carolina for 5 minutes. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. It is a very important issue to the majority of people in this country, particularly those who are covered by employer sponsored healthcare. Ms. Schuman, your written testimony highlights anti- competitive contracting terms, such as all or nothing, and anti-steering clauses, which prohibit a plan sponsor from contracting with a business associate's competitors or using providers outside of a business association's network. How did these restrictions affect plan benefit design and cost? Ms. Schuman. Well, thank you very much for that, for that question. As large hospital systems have increasingly acquired other hospitals and physician practices, these healthcare systems dominate the market, and they use their market power to push out lower priced, higher quality competitors. One of the ways that they can do that is through these anti-competitive contracting terms, that they demand are included in contracts with health plans, insurers and third-party administrators. These anti-competitive contracting terms come in several forms, anti-steering, or anti-tiering provisions, that prevent employers from utilizing value-based design to direct employees toward lower cost, higher quality providers, or all or nothing clauses, for example, that would require the health plan to contract with all affiliated facilities and providers, including lower quality ones. These contract provisions are designed to do one thing, to limit access to lower cost, high quality care, and to tie the hands of employers in their efforts to promote more value driven care. That is why the Council is so strongly supportive of the Healthy Competition for Better Care Act, that would restrict these anti-competitive provisions, and urges the Committee to approve it. Thank you. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. You just answered my second question. Ms. Wade, the Affordable Care Act does not require employers with fewer than 50 employees to offer health coverage to their employees, and yet NFIB reports that many employers still choose to offer coverage. Can you discuss the benefits for small employers, and their employees of offering employer- sponsored health benefits? Ms. Wade. Certainly. NFIB, we have surveyed our members periodically over the years, and with the tight labor market that they are experiencing now, but have been for years, the ability to offer health insurance as the primary benefit outside of wages is incredibly important to many of them in attracting talent and retaining current employees. The availability, the affordability, of this benefit for them being able to have a large choice of benefit structures to offer their employees is critical for them in those purposes of retaining talent and recruiting for open positions. This is one of the main hurdles that they face in offering the benefit, is cost. We survey our members, and they tell us that in the next five to 10 years, most of them are very concerned about their ability to keep the affordability aspect of offering the benefit to their employees, and so they are concerned whether they are going to be able to offer the benefit going forward. They are concerned about their ability to compete for talent in their workforce. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you. Dr. Fronstin, your written testimony states that ERISA's preemption of State law created an environment of national uniform standards for employee benefit plans and allows employers to continue to offer health benefits. What would health benefits look like today without ERISA? Mr. Fronstin. That is a really interesting question. I think if you go back before ERISA, employers offered coverage for business reasons, to be competitive in the labor force. Just about every large employer still does. Some small employers do, and if you ask the employers, small employers that do so, they are doing so for business reasons, to be competitive in the labor market. They are concerned about employee health and their productivity. I do not know that if we did not have ERISA it would look any different than that. I think ERISA certainly has enabled employers, perhaps large employers to--made it easier to offer benefits across State lines, but I still think they believe in the reasons why they offered benefits to begin with, which is to be competitive in the labor market, and to invest in worker health. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. My time is expired. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. Pursuant to previous order, the Chair declares the Subcommittee in recess, such to the call of the Chair. We will plan to reconvene promptly in 5 minutes at 11:25. Thank you, so the Subcommittee stands in recess.  Chairman Good. The Subcommittee will now come to order following a recess. I will now recognize Ms. Hayes from Connecticut for 5 minutes. Ms. Hayes. Thank you. Thank you to our witnesses for being here today. I also want to just thank my colleague, Ms. Manning, who left, for bringing up the idea about the ethics separation on Committee. I was in the back and saw how this Committee opened, and that is not the way we should be doing our work, and she brought up the ethics guidelines, which I think would be a real issue, except that the people of Virginia's 5th have already worked that out for us. While hardworking American people are struggling to afford medications, drug companies are reporting billions in profits. According to Protect Our Care, in the first 3 months of 2024, 15 of the biggest drug companies reported nearly 173 billion in revenue, and nearly 29 billion in net profits. In 2022, I voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which empowered Medicare for the first time in history, to negotiate lower drug prices for millions of seniors. The ten drugs selected for the first round of negotiations accounted for over 55 billion dollars in total Part D gross prescription drug costs in 2023. These negotiations resulted in a reduction of 38 to 79 percent on the selected drugs. Mr. Wright, in Project 2025, and what we have heard from many Republicans on this Committee, there have been calls for repealing the Medicare drug price negotiation program. What consequences will seniors face if the Inflation Reduction--if that portion of the Inflation Reduction Act is repealed? Mr. Wright. Thank you for the question. I think there will be impacts to both the individual beneficiaries, and to the program as a whole. Individual beneficiaries are getting the benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act of an overall cap on prescription drugs of $2,000.00, access to free vaccines, a cap on $35.00 for insulin, but more they are getting the benefit of getting the negotiated discount rate when they go to the pharmacy, especially if they are under insured. If that was to be repealed, those benefits would--those direct-to-consumer benefits would go away, but also would be the savings to the Medicare program and would have a problematic impact on the solvency of Medicare and the trust fund. Ms. Hayes. Thank you. We are seeing that even with these negotiations, these companies are still putting up record profits. House Democrats are looking to expand the drug pricing negotiation program to private healthcare markets, like those covered under ERISA. Could you explain how applying the prices secured through the Medicare drug price negotiation program will reduce costs for millions of Americans with private health insurers? Mr. Wright. To the extent that the Medicare, and the government is using its purchasing power to negotiate discounts, it makes sense that those discounts should be applied to the broader public, whether through including in the commercial market that would help bring down the premiums that payers pay, whether employers, union trusts, or individuals who pay out of pocket for premiums. Ms. Hayes. Well, will this also have a benefit on the employer? Mr. Wright. As I said that it would be since the employer is often the one that is paying the main premium often with a shared cost by the worker, it would have a benefit for both, the employer and also the worker, whether the share of premium, or as the ability to have those wage increases in other ways. Ms. Hayes. Both the employer and the employees would benefit from negotiated drug prices, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Thank you so much for being here. Mr. Wright. Thank you. Ms. Hayes. The Inflation Reduction Act dramatically lowers costs by requiring drug companies to provide rebates when they raise list prices faster than inflation limits--then inflation. Limits total out of pocket costs through Medicare Part D at $2,000.00 annually, and caps insulin costs at $35.00 per month, but it is imperative that we pass legislation that would expand the drug price negotiation program, and the inflation rebate savings to ensure that individuals with private health coverage also benefit. Can you just speak in my last 40 seconds, about how we are talking a lot about Medicare Part D, and people who participate in these programs would benefit. How would this expand to everyone that would benefit from this type of work? Mr. Wright. I think the more we can do to expand these benefits broader than the Medicare program, that would be a direct benefit to consumers. At the pharmacy, this is one of those monthly costs people feel every time they go to the pharmacy, but also even for folks who do not use prescriptions because it is the premiums everybody pays. Ms. Hayes. Thank you. As we are talking about rising inflation, and the cost of living, the amount that families are paying should be considered as we are thinking about these things, and this is something that will definitely help. Thank you so much, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. We will now recognize Mr. Burlison from Missouri for 5 minutes. Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Fronstin, in your written testimony you said that small employers have been responsible for the decline in the number of employers that are offering health benefits. What has happened to cause that to occur? What steps can we take so that small employers are wanting to offer those health benefits? Mr. Fronstin. Yes. Keep in mind that small employers were never as likely to offer health benefits as large employers, and there is clearly an affordability issue there. Mr. Burlison. It is just a complexity--part of being a small business, right? Mr. Fronstin. I think the complexity part comes in because a small business, you do not have as many people that you could allocate these responsibilities to. You can certainly hire a broker to help you navigate the health insurance part of it, but that is just one more piece when you are potentially starting a business. I think the challenge with small businesses is that we have done surveys that are dated, right, about 20 years ago, where we asked small businesses that did not offer coverage why, and whether they thought it had a negative impact on their business. For the most part they did not. If you cannot convince them, and the NFIB was asked a similar question like that recently. If you cannot convince these businesses that not offering it has a negative impact, I think it is going to be very tough to convince them to offer, even if premiums were more affordable, they are just not focused on it. Mr. Burlison. I had a whole list of questions, and I am going to kind of go a little--I am going to wax philosophically here if that is okay. I am reflecting on the fact that in American at one point employers created pensions, right? They managed those pensions, and over time, decades, they became unsustainable, they became a liability. There was a lot of uncertainty with those, that sometimes you would have people that would lose out because their employer might go belly up and now their pension is gone. The result was this institution created a tax incentive for individuals, or created a mechanism so that employers can offer IRAs, can offer 401K's, that put the money in the hands of the individual. Let me choose where their investments are going, let them choose that. Could something like that be done with health insurance, where the Federal Government is giving the same tax benefits, but encouraging the employer to provide a benefit that the employee then takes, and takes control of? Mr. Fronstin. You could do that now by existing rules with individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements. Employers can give workers money, a tax-free basis, let them go buy insurance on their own. It is not a very popular benefit. I think at most there are different estimates, on how many people are in such an arrangement. They are all small, right, maybe-- -- Mr. Burlison. It is not--I have not heard of it, so it is very under-utilized? Mr. Fronstin. Maybe a million people are in such an arrangement, but I do not think we know exactly. I have seen numbers of 200,000, maybe 400,000, you add in independents, you could double that number, so that is like where the million estimate comes from. We have asked large employers about it. Some of them we have asked about it to see if this is something they would be interested in, did not even know about it. I think the NFIB survey asked about it as well, and it was a lack of familiarity there. I do not remember the specific numbers. Mr. Burlison. Um-hmm. Being a former State legislator, I saw firsthand how a lot of employers were happy to move to an ERISA plan to escape all of the State regulations. The health and the mandates on what they have to provide care for, and I can only imagine how difficult that would be to go if you were occupying or had employees in multiple states. What--let me ask this, what else can we do, for example, to ramp up that individual program for small business owners. I know that we have got the association opportunities as well. Is there anything else that you can see? Mr. Fronstin. I am not--I do not know to what degree--small business. You have got two kinds of small businesses, both those that offer coverage, those that do not. I do not know that those that offer coverage are going to go in that direction, if they are already committed to offering coverage. While you have seen some erosion, it has not been very large erosion. I think this would be more appealing to employers, small employers that did not offer coverage as a way just to give their employees some tax-free benefit. Mr. Burlison. Has--Ms. Schuman, have these associated plans, these plans that where you are grouping people based on association, have they experienced any savings? Ms. Schuman. Well, you know our member companies are primarily large, multi-State employers that provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to their employees, so it is just not as---- Mr. Burlison. This may be a question Ms. Wade can answer. Ms. Schuman. Yes. I think. Chairman Good. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Burlison. She can answer. Chairman Good. We would like her to submit that written for the record. Thank you, I apologize. I now recognize Ms. Wild from Pennsylvania for 5 minutes. Ms. Wild. Thank you. Mr. Wright, I have a particular interest and concern about the role of private equity in health care, and I do see in your written testimony that you mention the role of private equity in health care, and I want your opinion on a couple of things in a minute, but just for the benefit of people who might not understand what private equity is, and tell me if I am incorrect about anything that I say. Basically, this is private investors who contribute capital, but they leverage their investment with a whole lot of debt, and in the case of health care, they may use and likely do use physical assets, whether it is hospitals, buildings, or whatever, as collateral for that debt. Then they have to pay off the debt, which to my mind means they probably have to generate a whole lot of revenue in order to keep up with payment of that debt. Have I stated it correctly so far? Mr. Wright. Yes. Ms. Wild. Okay. Thank you. I have read that private equity has invested nearly a trillion dollars in the health care system in the United States since 2006. That means private equity collectively, and would it be a fair statement that when a consumer, a patient goes to a health care provider, goes to a hospital, that the chances are they do not know much about the ownership structure of the hospital, or the health care place? Mr. Wright. That is a fair statement. Ms. Wild. Okay. It is not like there is a big plaque on the side that says owned by private equity investors, so and so, and so and so. Okay. There has been a number of studies, including one by Harvard Medical School about the fact that private equity actually results in higher prices to consumers, that more profitable services are often performed, but do not match either the need for them, or the benefit that they would convey, surprise medical bills. Then, one study, the Harvard one in particular, found significantly worse outcomes for patients, particularly Medicare patients in private equity locations. My question to you after all that is, what can Congress do to manage this problematic role of private equity in our health care system? Mr. Wright. Thank you for the question. I think there is a number of things that Congress can do. It is an issue of concern. We have seen a lot of money come in from private equity. It has certain incentives that are not necessarily aligned with community health and more for short-term profit, even in some cases, stripping the assets of institutions to get the most value, or at least short-term value from them. I think there needs to be some transparency in this regard, just to even know when these transactions are happening. It has been actually surprising how quickly these ownership relationships have changed, even in the last five, 10 years, whether it is to medical groups, or in certain parts of our health system, and so having greater transparency of ownership, particularly with private equity would be important, and also oversight over the actual transactions themselves, whether by the FTC, the DOJ. I know states are introducing laws to have oversight by State Attorney Generals, multiple states had bills this year. I believe one is on the California Governor's desk, and I think it is a concern because the growing body of literature is that private equity is associated with higher costs--the growth and ownership of private equity is associated with higher costs, and in fact, a lower quality, and even closures, depending on the business model. Ms. Wild. My understanding is that so far at least, it is a relatively small percentage of health care systems in the United States that are owned by private equity, but would it be fair to say that struggling hospitals, for instance, in smaller communities might be more susceptible to a private equity buyout or takeover? Mr. Wright. I think that is certainly true, and it is becoming a big percentage in certain pockets of our system where those investors are seeing the opportunity to extract more dollars out of our health system. Ms. Wild. Can you elaborate on that? What do you mean? Mr. Wright. Whether it is on ambulances, whether it is in certain specialties, whether it is in certain areas. Ms. Wild. Okay. Mr. Wright. Like if you look at overall, it is a relatively small percentage, but in certain markets or certain areas that is a problem. Ms. Wild. Got it. You were not talking about geographic areas, you were talking about areas of medicine or services provided. One of the things I read was that the higher risk, more specialized areas of medicine are more susceptible to private equity takeovers. Mr. Wright. That is right. Ms. Wild. Is that fair to say. Thank you. I think it is a huge problem. I hope that we can address it in the coming years in Congress, and I think that it is a problem that is going to continue to grow unless we reign it in. Thank you for your information. Mr. Wright. Thank you. Ms. Wild. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. I recognize now Mr. Bean from Florida for 5 minutes. Mr. Bean. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you, and good morning HELP Committee. What an honor to be here, and to our distinguished panelists, it is great to see you. Since the COVID pandemic the rise of telehealth has taken American by storm, and it is a popular option for many, many Americans, and there is a convenience factor, it is all kind of things. Now, we are seeing that it is not as affordable as you would think. You would think with innovation and with the efficiency of telehealth it would be a much less expensive option, one of which, one of the problems is different fees that providers and facilities are putting on telehealth visits to make it just not as affordable as it could be. Ms. Schuman, you have mentioned it in your testimony. I want you to talk about it. Is it a problem? I am considering, this is just between you and I, I am considering doing a bill to limit fees, and add-ons, which sometimes Americans are confused, and I would be confused if you get a bill from a doctor, but then get a bill from a hospital, then you will get a bill from somebody else facilitating it. Is it a problem? What do you think? Is there a need to fix? What say you, Ms. Schuman? Ms. Schuman. I say that it is a problem, and that it needs a fix. Allowing hospitals to charge a facility fee for telehealth appointment is a prime example of a payment distortion that is increasing healthcare costs for employers and patients. If these services are delivered via telehealth, but the facility is a phantom, but the fee is very real. We strongly support legislation that would protect group health plans from having to pay facility fees for telehealth services. It just does not make sense to pay a facility fee, a hospital facility fee when the facility involved is basically an internet connection, and voters see through this too. By an overwhelming margin of 82 percent to 9 percent, 8 to 1, voters believe that patients should not be charged a hospital facility fee. Mr. Bean. Ms. Schuman, it sounds like that if you were a member, and I presume that you would vote yes. Is that correct? Ms. Schuman. That is correct. Mr. Bean. Yes. Fantastic. You think it is worthwhile to do this bill? Ms. Schuman. Absolutely. Mr. Bean. Fantastic. All right. I am very close to launching this bill. Ms. Wade, NFIB is the forefront, it is the freedom loving businesses that want to get government out of the way, and just provide a service, make money, and be the backbone of small business. I did a roundtable in--I partnered over the break with the Clay County, if they are listening, thank you the city of Orange Park gave us their facilities. It was town hall. We partnered with the Clay County Chamber of Commerce. They invited just a handful, a variety of businesses, and I sat there and listened to obstacle after obstacle of challenge, inflation, taxes, hiring practices, regulation, and we talked a little bit about healthcare, and many of these small businesses are just--they are challenged by the immense costs of offering health plans. What say you, Ms. Wade, and NFIB? What do we need to do to make healthcare more affordable in America? That is a big question, and welcome to the world we live in. It is such a little tight window, but is there some 50,000-foot view of what we need to do to get healthcare more affordable in America? Ms. Wade. Sure. Not surprisingly, our studies find similar to what you heard in the roundtable, that 41 percent say it is a critical issue in operating their business, the cost of health insurance, and their ability to afford it themselves as the owner, but also in offering it to their employees, or potentially offering it to their employees if they do not offer it already. Transparency, better design choices, more plans available to small business owners will help in having stabilized and lower costs for them to offer benefit, association health plans, expanding those opportunities. Mr. Bean. It sounds like you are saying if I could summarize it, choice and competition, that is what the American consumer and small businesses want. How devastating, if we went to a one size fits all, single-payer system, how devastating would that be to Americans and small businesses? Ms. Wade. Small business owners would be less able to compete for talent in retaining current employees, and attracting applicants for those positions, if not given the choice to offer the benefit. Mr. Bean. You nailed it. Devastating is what you are saying. It would be devastating to have single-payer, that would eliminate single plans, health plans, and wreak havoc across America. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Scott from Virginia for 5 minutes. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wright, we have heard a lot about association health plans. It has always seemed to me that if you got a group of lower-cost healthier people, and make an association out of it, the association might save a little bit, but everybody left behind ends up paying more. Is there any evidence that eroding consumer protections promoting association health plans actually lowers health care prices in general, rather than shifts them to somebody else? Mr. Wright. I think a lot of the savings comes from the fact that they do not have to abide by certain consumer protections, and patient protections, which is a detriment obviously to the workers or employees, and also this issue of a risk shift, where if you are skimming off the healthiest populations, then you are shifting those costs onto the broader market for small businesses, and having an impact of increased premiums there. We would--I also just want to make sure that with regard to association health plans, that there is strong financial oversight because you do not want to have a situation of financial fraud or issues where because of lack of due diligence, you know, people are left high and dry without health care because the money went someplace else. Mr. Scott. You are talking about solvency of these plans? Mr. Wright. Yes. Mr. Scott. What happens when they go broke? Mr. Wright. Well, then that is a huge obstruction both to the health care for the workers, but also for the employer, issues of liability, issues of great concern. It is not good for anybody. Mr. Scott. What kind of--you talked about consumer protections before, you mentioned a protection if you have a pre-existing condition, what other kinds of consumer protections would you lose if you get into an association plan? Mr. Wright. Some of the consumer protections are just whether certain basic benefits are covered, whether preventative care, whether, you know, prescription drugs, equipment and services, et cetera. Mr. Scott. The American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act improved tax credits, Mr. Wright, and particularly for those earning over 400 percent of poverty, where there is a cliff, and you have got no benefits. Now you get benefits, you just pay a percentage of your income. At some point on the income scale, you will meet the sticker price. You would not be entitled to anything, but how have the premium tax credits helped both low-and middle-income individuals? Mr. Wright. They have been a lifesaver and a lifeline for millions of Americans. Over 5 million more Americans are covered, in part due to the enhanced tax credits that have been put in place in the last several years. People have gotten reduced costs at a time when people are screaming about affordability and have been screaming about health care affordability for decades. This is a direct form of assistance that says you do not have to pay more than a certain percentage of your income for coverage, and you are right, those folks just over 400 percent, for those under they will have the guarantee that they did not have to pay 8 and = percent of the income on coverage, but just those over, especially if they were older, would be paying 20- 30 percent of their income on coverage, having a huge impact on their ability to make ends meet for other needs. It is incredibly important that those tax credits get extended because they run out next year, and that needs to be done sooner, rather than later in order for them to take effect in 2026. Mr. Scott, Now, for small businesses where the owner may be just over the threshold, association plans start to look like a nice alternative. How does the elimination of the cliff affect the attractiveness of association health plans? Mr. Wright. In fact, the--if I had a chance to respond to the Representative here, I think the ACA Marketplace is an especially, with these enhanced tax credits, provide a real benefit for small business. A lot of the people in these Marketplaces are solo entrepreneurs, real eState agents, contractors, and people who are starting family businesses who are in the exchanges and marketplaces right now and getting this benefit. If these tax credits are not extended, that would be a premium spike of literally hundreds of dollars, and in many cases thousands of dollars to their bill. It would also have the impact of meaning that some of those 5 million people that got coverage, would lose coverage, and then have an impact on premiums overall in the overall marketplace. Mr. Scott. Now, if you are in an association plan, you are not getting a tax credit, right? Mr. Wright. No. Mr. Scott. The association plan would be competing with an ACA plan with a tax credit? Mr. Wright. That is right. Mr. Scott. That makes it virtually impossible for association plans to compete. Mr. Wright. I think that at this moment the ACA marketplace is a much better deal for people up and down the income spectrum. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Good. Thank you. I will now recognize the Ranking Member DeSaulnier, for 5 minutes. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last spring the New York Times published the results of an investigation to MultiPlan, a private equity-backed data analytics company that works with many employer-sponsored health plans, and their third-party administrators, or TPAs. The investigation found that when MultiPlan lowered reimbursements to providers, consumers would be on the hook for exorbitant balance bills that employers were liable for huge fees. In many cases, the fees paid to MultiPlan and the TPAs were more than reimbursements being paid to health care providers. To me, this is a clear example of the inefficiencies, and unethical behavior plaguing our health care system. Mr. Wright, can you comment on MultiPlan and its inefficiencies for consumers? Mr. Wright. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think we are deeply concerned about the potential price fixing, and anti- competitive behavior. I wish I could say I was shocked, but this is the kind of scheme that we have seen in the health care system with corporations trying to take a profit often to shift costs onto consumers. We are particularly concerned about the issue of a proprietary algorithm that is not public, that is making these decisions, and the issue of the shifting of costs onto consumers through balance billing. We do support the call for investigations by you, and others in the House and in the Senate, to look into this and deal with this appropriately. Mr. DeSaulnier. Ms. Schuman, much like PBA's, the inefficiencies of the system. Ms. Schuman. Okay. Well, thank you so much, and I think this just brings the light to need, the need to bring more light to healthcare system, and the need for transparency, to shine a light on these kind of payment distortions and practices that are driving higher costs for employers, and also for working families. Again, the important work that the Committee has already done to advance those transparency requirements in the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. The last hearing we had on ERISA we heard testimony about claim denials. Many of us have experienced at least one instance of a denied claim. We all know that claim denials can impose serious health and financial hardships. During our last hearing, the Democratic witness recounted the tragic death of Kyree, 27-year-old flight attendant who was denied prior authorization for a heart transplant, over criterion that never existed in the plan's documents. The denial would eventually be reversed, but the decision came almost a month after Kyree's death. Despite stories like Kyree's, we do not even collect adequate data to help us understand the extent of the problem. The Affordable Care Act required the Department of Labor to issue regulations to require group health plan reporting on claim denials, and in 2016, the Department proposed to do just that. Unfortunately, the Trump administration ignored the ACA requirement and pulled the proposal in 2017. Mr. Wright, at least anecdotally, I am hearing the problem is getting worse from providers that claims that they regularly put in to providers, are being denied, denied, denied, and either they, or their clients give up. Do you have any comments about claim denials, and the possible effect of companies like MultiPlan? Mr. Wright. Thank you for the question. Claim denials is a big issue for both patients and providers who are trying to provide care to their patients, and you do not want a plan or an employer to be judged during an execution, you want independent review. You want the ability to appeal if your claim--if your care was denied, that was medically necessary. Right now, the relief under ERISA is very limited, and so I think we need to look into this, and right now we basically even just need the transparency to even know why the claim denials are happening, because right now we do not even have that. We need to be able to know that the timeliness of these claims, how many claims are filed, what is the rate of denial, and for what reasons. Then I do think we need to have a greater look at what kind of relief can be provided under ERISA. Mr. DeSaulnier. Ms. Schuman, claim denials? Ms. Schuman. Yes. Well certainly I could not agree more about the need to have more transparency again for these claim denials. I will say that there is an important service that appropriate medical management, and prior authorization plays without a doubt. Again, I think the need for greater transparency to understand where those distortions are. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Dr. Fronstin, President Biden and VP Harris have tried to expand even further, government's role in healthcare, including as we saw in the video, a Medicare for All, and lowering the age to qualify for Medicare. As government control of healthcare expands, like when Democrats increase subsidies for Obamacare plans, what happens to employer-sponsored health insurance? Mr. Fronstin. Yes. We have talked to large employers about expanded subsidies, and for the most part, it does not affect what they do. They are concerned about recruitment and retention. They recognize that their employees value health benefits more than any other benefit, something I remind my retirement colleagues of all the time at EBRI. Small employers--we have not polled them on how subsidies might affect their behavior, but I would point out to the degree offer rates have eroded in a small group market, that was happening before the ACA passed, so I think its premiums are driving that more so, and the ones that continue to offer coverage are doing so, I think because of business reasons. They are concerned about recruitment and retention, and even with enhanced subsidies, they are still going to be concerned about recruitment and retention. Chairman Good. No question about it. A CBO report estimates 3 and a half million people would leave employment-based coverage if Democrats are successful in permanently expanding eligibility for enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Why do you think government wants to move more people--why do you think government wants to move more people from a quality private healthcare plan, to a more expensive one, fully paid for by the taxpayer? Why would the government want to do that? Mr. Fronstin. They are different markets, and they serve different purposes. The employment-based market is, you know, those are groups that are formed for reasons other than the provision of health insurance. They are considered a natural group, and the non-group market, it is different, right? It is people that cannot get coverage through their job, maybe they are in between jobs, subsidies are much higher in that market. I think they are temporary because of people moving in and out. I do not know that one--certainly one system has an advantage over the other, but there are purposes that they both serve. Chairman Good. Ms. Wade, more small businesses would like to offer health insurance to their employees, but many cannot afford it due to the cost of paying for the benefits, the reporting requirements, the bureaucratic burden of offering employer sponsored plans, but how can Congress make it easier for more small businesses to manage this bureaucracy that comes with operating a healthcare plan? Ms. Wade. First of all, businesses--16 percent are in the self-insured markets, so protecting ERISA, and allowing them to still have the flexibility and affordability of offering those sorts of plans to their employees is hugely important. Expanding the marketplace for the fully insured market and offering association health plans. Those sorts of tools that they can use to better access affordable plans that they can offer their employees. They are competing with larger businesses for talent that are better able to afford these benefits, and the labor market is still quite difficult for them, and a challenge in recruiting and retaining talent at their business. Because health insurance is the primary benefit that they are offering, or would like to offer, having that marketplace be affordable and flexible for them is important. Chairman Good. I am glad you mentioned it. I introduced, and this Committee passed, the Self-Insurance Protection Act, which prevents Federal regulators from redefining and regulating stop loss insurance, like a traditional health insurance. Many employers, as you know, choose to self-insure, and they purchase the stop loss insurance to protect themselves from the catastrophic claims. Why would some want to make it more difficult, some on the other side, for businesses to obtain stop loss insurance, unless it's just to prevent them from being able to provide private insurance? Ms. Wade. Without having that ability for the small business owners in the self-insured marketplace, it would be catastrophic for them in being able to offer the benefit to their employees and mitigating the catastrophic risk that they might incur with high costs associated with it. Protecting stop loss insurance, making it widely available to small business, is crucial in keeping that marketplace available to them. Chairman Good. Very good. Thank you. All right. We are going to go to Ranking Member DeSaulnier, for his closing remarks. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to all the witnesses. I appreciate you being here. First, a comment just on this idea that universal health care versus a complete free market. I think what the Congress has tried to do over the years is balance, is to create an avenue for the private sector and employers. As a former employer, who provided healthcare for my employees, and some of the struggles we had when employees actually needed to use that, and how confused they were about their copays. I can remember instances where employees were crying because they could not afford their copays, and never understood the documentation. This balance between the private sector and creating employer/employee good relationship, and NFIB, I was once a member when I was a small business owner, having that balance of a good responsible employer to good, valued employees, healthcare benefits are really important. Healthcare benefits that are easy for the employer, and the employee to understand, and require value, good quality of care. Too much of this hearing has been about costs, costs, cost. Cost is only important if you get value in exchange for the cost. This idea, Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, that it is one way or the other, just is not the American model. It is a balance, and I grant you there are some people who would like to switch that balance on both sides. Preemption is important when it is a national issue, but there are states issues. There was another interesting debate today, take the other side of states' rights, I guess in this instance, which I do not regularly do, but maybe from California, as a Member of Congress, I have become more of a states' right person than I was before, Mr. Wright, because I knew you when we both worked in Sacramento. This balance is important. I do not think it is a choice of either/or. Then last, on universal health care. We already have a universal health care system in this country, it is just really bad. If you call 911, the ambulance will show up. If you go to the emergency room, you will get care. It is called indigent care, and basic adult care. It is required under law. It is just that it does not pay. The idea that somehow this free market is the heaven on earth that we could get, just is not reality. If we had an efficient delivery system of health care system that had a high quality of care, both in the employer/employee market, and also Medicare and Medicaid, people would live longer lives in this country. We would have a lower GDP ratio for health care, and we would have a better system. Maybe not perfect, but certainly better than it is right now. ERISA was enacted with a goal of protecting workers and their families. Given the dramatic changes since 1974 when ERISA was enacted, it is clearly evident that ERISA must evolve to effectively address new challenges and opportunities that improve the efficiency of our health care system. House Democrats' primary goal is to support and build our middle class from the bottom up, and the middle out. This involves not only addressing the immediate needs of workers and their families, but also creating an environment where middle class prosperity can thrive, and small businesses are a part of that middle class. Ensuring that ERISA has strong consumer protections reduces waste, inefficiencies, and excessive costs, and enhances transparency in this critical effort. Congressional Democrats are committed to fighting for working families, and we have made significant strides through recent legislative achievements to do just that, including passing the Affordable Care Act, the American Plan Rescue Act, and fighting the attempts by our Republican colleagues to overturn the Affordable Care Act, multiple attempts, including protections for consumers for pre-existing conditions. The Inflation Reduction Act, these historic pieces of legislation, all of them, have increased coverage, protected consumers from nefarious practices, and lowered costs for millions of working families and seniors. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act capped out--of-pocket drug costs at $2,000.00 a year for Medicare. Capped insulin cost at $35.00 a month for seniors and secured significant price reductions through drug price negotiations. The negotiations alone will save an estimated 1 and one-half billion dollars for nearly 9 million seniors. We must remain vigilant against proposals like those in the Republican's 2025 that seek to roll back these critical reforms and eliminate the protections in the Affordable Care Act. Our work is far from finished. We must continue to build on these successes, and focus on creating a fair, more efficient system, that benefits all workers, families, and businesses. Thank you, and I yield back. Chairman Good. Thank you. I now recognize myself for a closing statement. It was interesting to hear the minority members reaction to the video we saw today, with the unedited words of Vice President Harris, without commentary, presented by none other than CNN and the Washington Post. I guess this is because she has been trying to express different positions over the past few weeks, than she has expressed over her entire career prior to that time. As noted last week by none other than Bernie Sanders, whose Medicare for All bill she cosponsored. Democrats seem to know that Americans do not support their actual positions, whether it is open borders, non-citizens voting, electric vehicle mandates, appliance prohibitions, anti-police policies, pro- criminal policies, higher taxes, more spending, and controlled by government, and yes, government mandated, government provided healthcare. This is a policy discussion, and the video revealed the Vice President's policy statements, relative to the topic at hand. The American healthcare system is far from perfect, but most Americans prefer their private health insurance offered by their employer. Naturally, Democrats do not want Americans to know that they want to eliminate that. On behalf of the 153 million Americans whose healthcare benefits rely on ERISA, I think we have learned a lot today. Government, especially the Biden Harris administration, continues to burden employer sponsored health insurance through over regulation. Meanwhile, they prop up the expensive Obamacare plans, and daydream about single payer Medicare for All. Government should actually though decrease intervention in healthcare markets, not increase it. Americans want flexible, innovative healthcare, not one size fits all. Employers have a strong incentive to keep healthcare costs low, to help their own bottom line, and they have an incentive to offer good benefits to keep their workers. Democrats never seem to understand that. For 50 years, ERISA has provided the guardrails to protect individuals, while allowing employers to develop robust benefit plans. We can amend ERISA while protecting it, because in doing so we defend private insurance and shield Americans from devolving into a single-payer system. We thank the witnesses today for your time and testimony, and without objection, there being no further business, this Subcommittee stands adjourned.
