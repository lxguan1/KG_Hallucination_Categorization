PERSISTENT CHALLENGES: OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS ---------- Wednesday, June 26, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:08 p.m., in room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. August Pfluger (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Pfluger, Bishop, D'Esposito, Crane, and Magaziner. Mr. Pfluger. The Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence will come to order. Without objection, the subcommittee may recess at any point. The purpose of this hearing is to conduct oversight of the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis--that will be referred to as I&A--and hear from under secretary for I&A, Mr. Kenneth Wainstein. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. We're holding this important hearing to examine and discuss the role of DHS's office of I&A that helps play a role in safeguarding our Nation. The United States faces a myriad of threats from state and non-state actors. We're seeing authoritarian regimes, such as China, Russia, and Iran, expand their reach across the globe and challenge the sovereignty of the United States and our allies. Our adversaries are not only working to achieve these objectives through conventional military means but are also masterfully accomplishing these goals through cyber space and by using asymmetric tactics that fall just below the threshold of traditional conflict, more commonly known as gray zone aggression. We've seen malign actors utilize state-owned companies and their technological products to spy on our Nation and gather sensitive data that advances their strategic goals. Further, the threats posed by violent extremist groups, like ISIS, al- Shabaab, al-Qaeda, and others, that continue to operate throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia present consistent challenges. Overall, the threats posed by state and non-state actors, paired with the Department's failure to secure our borders, have led our Nation down a precarious path that presents a clear and present danger. Our Nation is almost certainly not seeing this level of instability since World War II, and these threats will only continue to metastasize if we don't do something about it and stop the aggression from our adversaries. I highlight the troubling developments because they show why now, more than ever, our Nation needs an effective and efficient intelligence enterprise to keep the homeland safe, secure, and resilient, while not abusing its authorities or violating the Constitutional rights of Americans. The men and women that work within I&A are charged with disseminating intelligence to State, local, Tribal, and territorial enforcement agencies and other partners, and develop intelligence from those partners for DHS and the IC to ensure our communities stay safe. Over the years and across administrations, I&A has struggled at times to complete its mission to equip the homeland security enterprise with timely intelligence and information needed to keep the homeland safe. Systematic and documented failures, as detailed by various reports by the DHS inspector generals, have led to breakdowns in identifying specific threat streams or have undermined public trust. For instance, I&A's overt HUMINT intelligence collection program has raised serious questions and concerns related to the Department's overreach of its statutory mandate and to potential violations of the fundamental civil liberties of all Americans. In fact, part of the program was paused after a number of DHS officials raised concern about its legality. These issues have led to high turnover, no clear leadership or effective oversight, and significant training gaps for its employees. These incidents within DHS are unacceptable and erode trust in keeping our Nation safe at a time when our country faces an elevated threat. It did not help when DHS unilaterally decided to establish a now-disbanded homeland intelligence expert group, an action that continued--an action that continues to raise concerns about DHS's impartiality and objectivity in furthering its homeland security mission amidst ever-evolving threats. These concerns were further exacerbated when DHS then decided to rebrand the discredited experts group as an advisory board, claiming that the new board builds upon the expert's group and will represent diverse perspectives without regard for political affiliation. In an effort to address some of these shortcomings within I&A, Members of this committee have not only conducted oversight of I&A's operations but also passed various bipartisan legislative measures designed to improve training and transparency of I&A's activities. Today I've asked Under Secretary Wainstein to provide us with an update on the steps that the Department has taken to address the long-standing issues associated with I&A that cannot be fixed with surface-level patches. I'm encouraged to hear that I&A has been undergoing an internal review, and we thank Mr. Wainstein for doing that and in a reorganization as well. But it simply can't be a reshuffling of leadership roles or just to give the appearance of progress. We have talked several times throughout the last year about some of these issues. I've worked with the Ranking Member, Mr. Magaziner. This subcommittee has worked on truly identifying and having a conversation that highlights some of the past what I would call failures but also looks forward to what can be done to keep our Nation safe. As we approach the anniversary of 9/11--the 23rd anniversary of 9/11, I think it's important for all of us to keep in mind that, in the days leading up to 9/11, the word-- the phrase ``the system was blinking red'' was brought up. That was part of the 9/11 Commission. It was part of the findings, and it's part of what I want to frame this subcommittee hearing today, is that I'm fearful and concerned today that the system is blinking red in a number of ways. I think that, even if our intention is to keep this country safe, we have to look under the hood and get to an organization, and I appreciate you being here doing that so that if it is blinking red, which I think it is, that we can get the oversight done, provide DHS with the appropriate resources to keep the country safe so that we don't have another incident like 9/11 again. I appreciate you being here. I look forward to hearing your testimony.  Statement of Chairman August Pfluger June 26, 2024 We are holding this important hearing to examine and discuss the role DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) plays in helping to safeguard our Nation. The United States faces a myriad of threats from state and non- state actors across the globe. We are seeing authoritarian regimes, such as China, Russia, and Iran expand their reach across our globe and challenge the sovereignty of our allies and our national security interests. Our adversaries are not only working to achieve these objectives through conventional military means but are also masterfully accomplishing their goals through cyber space and by using asymmetric tactics that fall just below the threshold of traditional conflict, more commonly known as gray zone aggression. We have seen malign actors utilize state-owned companies and their technological products to spy on our Nation and gather sensitive data that advances their strategic goals. Further, the threats posed by violent extremist groups like ISIS, al-Shabab, al-Qaeda, and others that continue to operate throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and southeast Asia present consistent challenges. Overall, the threats posed by state and non-state actors, paired with the Department's failure to secure our borders, have led our Nation down a precarious path that presents a clear and present danger. Our Nation has almost certainly not seen this level of instability since World War II, and these threats will only continue to metastasize as time goes on with weak leadership that invites aggression from our adversaries. I highlight these troubling developments because they show why now, more than ever, our Nation needs an effective and efficient intelligence enterprise to keep the homeland safe, secure, and resilient, while not abusing its authorities or violating the Constitutional rights of Americans. The men and women that work within I&A are charged with disseminating intelligence to State, local, Tribal, and territorial law (SLTT) enforcement agencies and other partners and develop intelligence from those partners for DHS and the IC to ensure our communities stay safe. Over the years, and across administrations, I&A has struggled to complete its mission to equip the Homeland Security Enterprise with timely intelligence and information needed to keep the homeland safe. Systematic and documented failures, as detailed by various reports by the DHS inspector general, have led to breakdowns in identifying specific threat streams or have undermined public trust. For instance, I&A's Overt Human Intelligence Collection Program has raised serious questions and concerns related to the Department's overreach of its statutory mandate and to potential violations of the fundamental civil liberties of all Americans. In fact, part of the program was paused after a number of DHS officials raised concerns about its legality. These issues have led to high turnover, no clear leadership or effective oversight, and significant training gaps for its employees. These incidents within DHS are unacceptable and erode the public's trust in keeping our Nation safe at a time when our country faces an elevated threat environment. It did not help when DHS unilaterally decided to establish a now disbanded \1\ Homeland Intelligence Experts Group, an action that continues to raise concerns about DHS's impartiality and objectivity in furthering its homeland security mission amidst ever-evolving threats. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ On May 2, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security agreed that the Homeland Intelligence Experts Group would be ``wound down'' and the Department would ``not reconstitute the Experts Group inconsistent with the FACA  or the Homeland Security Act of 2002.'' See, Joint Notice and Stipulation of Dismissal, No. 1:23-cv- 3322-CRC (May 2, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These concerns were further exacerbated when DHS then decided to rebrand the discredited Experts Group as an ``Advisory Board,'' claiming that the new board ``builds upon'' the Experts Group and will represent ``diverse perspectives, without regard for political affiliation.''\2\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., DHS Announces Creation of the Homeland Intelligence Advisory Board, (May 17, 2024). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In an effort to address some of these shortcomings within I&A, Members of this committee have not only conducted robust oversight of I&A's operations, but also passed various bipartisan legislative measures designed to improve training and transparency of I&A's activities. Today, I have asked Under Secretary Wainstein to provide us with an update on the steps the Department has taken to address the long- standing issues associated with I&A that cannot be fixed by surface- level patches. While I am encouraged to hear that I&A has been undergoing an internal review and reorganization, this cannot be simply reshuffling leadership roles to give the appearance of progress. Additionally, I look forward to hearing about ways that Congress and DHS can work together to tackle the threats mentioned at the beginning of my statement. This year marks the 23rd anniversary of 9/11. As we approach this year's anniversary, I can't help but remember what George Tenet famously said to the 9/11 Commission. In describing the warning signs leading up in the days before 9/11, he stated that in his world ``the system was blinking red.'' I am fearful that we are once again ignoring the fact that the ``system is blinking red'' and we are failing to take the necessary steps to correct course to safeguard the homeland. I hope and pray that I am wrong in that assessment. However, hearings like today allow Congress the opportunity to conduct oversight and assess our Nation's effectiveness in mitigating the threats posed by a catastrophic attack. I look forward to the conversation and appreciate Under Secretary Wainstein for speaking with us today. Mr. Pfluger. I now recognize the gentleman from Rhode Island, the Ranking Member, Mr. Magaziner. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman Pfluger, for calling today's hearing, and also for the constructive conversations that we've been having around ways that we can support your efforts to reform and enhance the effectiveness of the office. Thank you, Under Secretary Wainstein, for joining us this afternoon. Today's conversation has to start with remembering why the Office of Intelligence and Analysis was created, the terror attacks that took place on September 11, 2001. I remember that day vividly, and I'm sure everyone else here does as well. The failures that allowed it to happen were, in large part, due to the lack of coordination and information sharing at the time between intelligence agencies and law enforcement. The terrorism threat that I&A was created to combat persists today, as does our mission of overseeing the integration of DHS with the intelligence--between the intelligence community and law enforcement. We are aware of some of the challenges that I&A has experienced, but I do want to also highlight the good work that people there are doing every day to keep America safe and, to a degree, the success of I&A can also be measured in the terror attacks that have not taken place over the last two decades. That being said, there are challenges that need to be addressed, and I am pleased that the under secretary has undertaken a 360-degree review of the organization to realign the structure and improve the performance of I&A. But the work continues to assess how I&A meets its intelligence mission and ensure that it complies with important privacy and First Amendment and oversight requirements. I&A plays a critical role in protecting the American people from violence by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to State, local, Tribal, territorial, and private- sector law enforcement. It is the only intelligence community member tasked with providing actionable intelligence to these partners. I&A's critical role in helping to secure the homeland is more necessary today than ever because the United States faces a wide variety of threats, both domestic and international, from states and non-state actors. For example, racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists, including those motivated by white supremacy, pose a significant threat to our country according to FBI data. They commit mass shootings and other violent acts to advance their racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and bigoted agendas. At the same time, Secretary Mayorkas recently warned that ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other foreign terrorist organizations are, once again, increasingly recruiting and plotting attacks against Americans at home and abroad. These are serious threats that require our intelligence community and our law enforcement agencies to work together to share information, to have access to timely, actionable intelligence to do their jobs on the ground. I look forward to hearing more about the results of the 360-degree review for I&A and the steps that are being taken to help I&A regain its status as a trusted intelligence partner and learning what Congress can do to ensure that I&A's critical mission is carried out to its fullest with respect to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. With that, I yield back. I thank you again for being here, and I thank the Chairman.  Statement of Ranking Member Seth Magaziner June 26, 2024 Today's conversation should start with remembering why the Office of Intelligence and Analysis was created--the terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001. I remember that day vividly, as I'm sure all of you do as well. And the intelligence failures that allowed it to happen were in large part due to a need for stronger coordination between the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies. The terrorism threat that I&A was created to combat persists today, as does our mission of overseeing the integration of DHS with the intelligence community and law enforcement. We are aware of some of I&A's challenges, but the success of I&A can be measured in the terrorist attacks that have not taken place over the last two decades. I am pleased that Under Secretary Ken Wainstein undertook a ``360 Review'' of the organization to realign the structure and improve the performance of I&A. However, we must continue to assess how I&A meets its intelligence mission, and ensure it complies with privacy and oversight requirements. I&A plays a critical role in protecting the American people from violence by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to State, local, Tribal, territorial, and private-sector law enforcement. It is the only intelligence community member tasked with providing actionable intelligence to SLTTP partners. I&A's critical role helping secure our communities is more necessary today than ever before. The United States faces a wide variety of threats, both domestically and internationally, and from state and non-state actors. Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists--particularly those motivated by white supremacy--pose the most significant threat to our country per the FBI's data. They commit mass shootings and other violent acts to advance their racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and bigoted agendas. At the same time, Secretary Mayorkas recently warned that ISIS, al- Qaeda, and other foreign terrorist organizations are increasingly recruiting and plotting attacks against Americans at home and abroad. These are serious threats that require our State, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement to have access to timely, actionable intelligence to do their jobs on the ground in our communities. I look forward to hearing from Under Secretary Wainstein about the results of his 360-Degree Review, and the steps it should take to regain its status as a trusted intelligence partner. I also look forward to learning about what Congress can do to ensure I&A's crucial mission is carried out to its fullest and with respect to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Mr. Pfluger. I thank the Ranking Member. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson June 26, 2024 Today's hearing title is accurate. Historically, there have been ``persistent challenges'' at I&A. The MAGA Trump administration tried to tear apart I&A for political gain, to the detriment of our national security and Americans' privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Under Secretary Wainstein has devoted his time in office to cleaning up the mess left by the Trump administration and so-called ``Acting Secretary'' Chad Wolf. So, thank you, Under Secretary Wainstein, for your dedication to I&A and for joining us today. Today's hearing is an opportunity for Members to gain insight into how Under Secretary Wainstein and the Biden administration have taken the first steps toward rebuilding I&A's reputation and effectiveness. Shortly after Under Secretary Wainstein took office, he initiated a 360-Degree Review of the entire Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Throughout the 360 Review process, Under Secretary Wainstein has kept Congress up-to-date on his findings. He has been a partner as we help rebuild and realign I&A to safeguard the office from politicization and prevent any future harm to our homeland security apparatus. Here are just some of the results from Under Secretary Wainstein's 360 Review: I&A's collection activities will be separated from its analysis teams, and a new deputy under secretary will oversee all intelligence collection. I&A's Open Source Intelligence collectors will be embedded within I&A's 4 analytic centers to work alongside and in closer collaboration with analysts and privacy experts. And I&A will implement a new process to measure and establish benchmarks for intelligence output and feedback from customers, then use ``surge'' efforts to cover near-term priorities. These reforms--and the others that will emerge from the 360 Review--go a long way toward rebuilding I&A's operations, effectiveness, and morale following the years I&A was trashed by Trump. These reforms--and this hearing--have been a long time coming. Republicans have been in charge of the House for 18 months, but unfortunately this is the first time this subcommittee has held a hearing focused on the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. I&A's mission is critical, particularly at a time when our country is facing lethal threats from white supremacists, racially motivated violent extremists, malign foreign governments like China and Russia, and growing threats from ISIS. Congress should be a partner to I&A and work to help the Under Secretary rebuild what the Trump administration broke. I look forward to hearing from Under Secretary Wainstein on how to further improve I&A based on the 360-Degree Review. I stand ready to continue working with Under Secretary Wainstein and committee Members on this critical effort. Mr. Pfluger. I'd like to welcome and thank the under secretary, Mr. Wainstein, for being here today. I ask that our witness please rise and raise your right hand.  Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. You may be seated. Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the affirmative. I'd now like to formally introduce Under Secretary Kenneth Wainstein, who serves as the Department of Homeland Security's under secretary for intelligence and analysis. He's responsible for providing the Secretary, DHS leadership, and all the components thereof and private-sector partners with the homeland security intelligence and information needed to keep the country safe, secure, and resilient. The office of I&A is a member of and the Department's liaison to the United States intelligence community. Mr. Wainstein has served as the chief intelligence officer for DHS and reports directly to the DHS Secretary and director of national intelligence. Prior to his confirmation, Mr. Wainstein spent over 20 years in law enforcement and national security positions in the Federal Government. Between 1989 and 2001, Mr. Wainstein served as a Federal prosecutor and held a variety of supervisory positions. In 2006, Mr. Wainstein was confirmed as the first assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice. In that position, Mr. Wainstein established and led the new national security division, which consolidated the Justice Department's law enforcement and intelligence operations on all national security matters. In 2008, he was named homeland security advisor by President George W. Bush. I know for a fact that you come into this job because you love this country and want to see the security of our country as the utmost priority. I appreciate you being here, and the Chair now recognizes Mr. Wainstein for your opening testimony. STATEMENT OF HONORABLE KENNETH L. WAINSTEIN, UNDER SECRETARY FOR INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS Mr. Wainstein. Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and distinguished Members of the committee, I thank you for the opportunity to appear today. I thank you also for holding the roundtable that you held a couple months back about I&A, and also thank you for your sustained interest in I&A and its mission. Thank you for also--also, for both of your opening remarks because they frame the issue and the challenge very well for the rest of the hearing. I'd like to frame today's remarks as an update to my last testimony to this committee back in December 2022, which is about 6 months or so after I started in this position. In that hearing, I previewed our plans for significant change at I&A, and in the last 18 months since then, we put those plans in place and into action. We've done that through what you referenced, our I&A 360 review, which has been a rigorous re-examination and reassessment and reprioritization of our operations that has proceeded in three stages, the third and final stage of which we just announced and shared with Congress in April of this year. I'd like to give you--I'd like to take my time today to give you an overview of this process because I think it's the best way to illustrate the depth of the change that is under way here at I&A and to address your very valid concern, that the change is real and deep. It isn't just reshuffling the deck chairs. So, in terms of the three stages, the first stage that we went through implemented last May was a reorganization that reprioritized four areas of operations within the--within I&A with the creation of new organizational structures to lead each area. We created an office of partnerships to enhance the critical liaison work we do with our State, local, territorial, Tribal, and private-sector partners. I'll refer to them as our SLTTP partners. We created an office of collection to enhance supervision of our collection activities, an issue that you referenced earlier. We created an intelligence enterprise program office to enhance our coordination of the intelligence elements of all the DHS components. Finally, and very importantly, we created a transparency and oversight program office to enhance our ability to protect privacy and civil liberties in our intelligence operations. So that was the first stage, the organizational stage. The second was the topical stage. It involved reprioritizing the intelligence topics that we pursue and then producing, for the first time in over a decade, a homeland intelligence priorities framework, which is a prioritized list of threat topics along the lines of the DNI's annual national intelligence priorities framework. That framework now serves as an overarching strategic document that guides all of our intelligence activities. The third stage of our review was the functional stage that involved examining the utility of the various functions within our organization against four operating principles. We developed these principles in consultation with our partners, including with you all on the Hill, and it's worth taking a time on--taking a minute on them as they show the direction that we're taking the organization. Those guiding principles are the following: First, that while we serve many different intelligence customers from the President of the United States on down, our primary external intelligence customers are our SLTTP partners. In other words, it is their intelligence needs that are our primary concern. Second, that we serve those partners' needs primarily by providing them not with tactical law enforcement type of intelligence but, instead, with strategic-level threat intelligence that helps to inform their decision making as officials and policy makers out in their jurisdictions. Third, that we focus our resources and operations on those areas where we at I&A have distinct operational advantages and defer to other IC agencies where we do not. Fourth, that we continually strive to build strong management into our organization and into our culture. So, based on those four principles, we developed and announced and are now implementing about 30 different functional initiatives across I&A. As one example, to advance our service to our primary SLTTP customers, per the first principle, we're restructuring our field operation around the country to make it more responsive to the needs of those customers. We're also starting a program that will embed State and local officers and private-sector representatives within the ranks of I&A. Next, to enhance our strategic focus, we're embedding our open-source collectors within our analytic centers to more directly tether their collection to each center's strategic analytic efforts. To leverage one of our distinct operational advantages, i.e., our intra-DHS relationship with CBP and ICE, we're embedding personnel within those components to access and generate intelligence reports about the fentanyl-related data in their systems. We're also, importantly, teaming our HUMINT collectors up with CBP personnel to conduct field interviews along the Southwest Border. Finally, to improve the management support for our work force, we've created a substantial slate of new training programs for current and future managers. So those are just a few examples of the significant change that is under way at I&A. As I wind up, let me take a moment to give well-deserved kudos to the work force at I&A. Change like this isn't easy, and our work force has really been stepping up and leading into it. As you know, openness to change is not something that's everywhere in Government, but it is here in I&A. That's one of the many reasons I'm proud to be part of the organization and to be counted among its dedicated professionals who do so much to protect our homeland security each and every day. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you, and I look forward to answering your questions.  Prepared Statement of Kenneth L. Wainstein June 26, 2024 Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the current activities of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS or Department). It is an honor to share with you the hard work of I&A's dedicated employees, who tirelessly serve and protect our Nation. For background, I have served as the under secretary for intelligence and analysis since June 2022. Prior to this role, I spent over 20 years in law enforcement and national security in the Federal Government, including as a Federal prosecutor in both the Southern District of New York and the District of Columbia, as the director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, as general counsel and then as chief of staff of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, as the first assistant attorney general for national security, and as homeland security advisor for President George W. Bush. I subsequently worked in private legal practice and served on the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense before being given the opportunity to return to public service as the leader of I&A. Today, I will provide an update to my last testimony before this committee from December 2022, with a focus on the organizational improvements, mission prioritization, and functional adjustments that are driving progress at I&A. First, I find it is helpful to begin with a brief overview of I&A, its founding, and its core missions because that context clarifies why the changes we are making today are so critical. Then, I will walk through the 3 stages of our 360 Review-- which is the top-to-bottom organizational assessment that we started shortly after I joined I&A. Now more than ever, I&A is in a state of positive change. We are adapting to address the current threat environment while ensuring we always act with full respect for the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of the American people. i. the mission I&A was established specifically to address the intelligence gaps exposed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11). As numerous experts and entities--like the 9/11 Commission--examined and diagnosed the gaps that allowed the attacks to happen, Congress undertook the task of building a Federal apparatus to address those gaps and develop a stronger domestic intelligence capacity. I&A was established as a critical part of that apparatus and was tasked with developing a national intelligence network and sharing information with our Federal and other homeland partners under authorities and limitations designed specifically for the sensitivities of conducting intelligence activities in the homeland. In service of that goal, we at I&A serve 3 core missions: First, to build and maintain an intelligence program within the United States that can detect and prevent threats to the homeland. Second, to serve as an information-sharing bridge between Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies and our State, local, Tribal, territorial, and private-sector partners (SLTTP). And third, to operate with an intensely-focused regard for privacy and civil liberties, which is a mission that is completely on par with the other 2. We emphasize these missions with the recognition that homeland security can be achieved only in conjunction with the protection of privacy and civil liberties, and that both objectives can and must be pursued at the same time. As someone who spent the better part of 15 years as a Federal prosecutor, this dual mission is not a foreign concept. Just as I had a sworn and equal duty as a prosecutor to both pursue conviction of the guilty and protect the rights of the accused, we at I&A have a sworn and equal duty to both prevent threats to homeland security and protect against incursions into our rights and freedoms. With that duty in mind, my I&A colleagues are building the foundational elements of transparency, civil liberties, and privacy into our intelligence tradecraft in the domestic operating environment. ii. 360 review and organizational improvements Upon my confirmation, Secretary Mayorkas asked me to conduct a ``360-degree review'' of I&A and its operations, with a focus on privacy and civil liberties safeguards. We immediately undertook that comprehensive operational review, building on the work of my predecessor John Cohen, who had taken important steps to strengthen oversight functions after compliance concerns arose in 2020. We brought in 4 senior advisers with extensive backgrounds in intelligence and intelligence oversight--Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Hill veteran Steven Cash, former DHS General Counsel Stevan Bunnell, former National Counterterrorism Center Director Russ Travers, and, later, former DHS Inspector General John Roth. They helped me in consulting with both outside experts and internal I&A personnel to provide input on the direction of I&A. This 360-review has involved a rigorous and probing process to examine I&A's structure and mission, with the goal of providing mission clarity and ensuring we focus our operations and resources on areas that add the most value to the homeland security enterprise. The 360-review encompassed 3 primary stages of prioritization, which I will explain in detail. They are: (1) organizational prioritization, (2) topical prioritization, and (3) functional prioritization. All 3 stages have yielded structural and operational improvements that have significantly increased our ability to execute I&A's core missions. Stage 1: Organizational Prioritization This first stage of our 360-review focused on a reorganization of I&A's top-level structure. Through this process, we signaled our prioritization of certain critical operations with the creation of new organizational structures to lead and support them. This included: (1) Creating the Transparency and Oversight Program Office (TOPO), (2) separating the management of our collection and analysis operations, and (3) establishing the Intelligence Enterprise Program Office (IEPO) and reinvigorating the Department's counter threat coordination through the Homeland Security Intelligence Council (HSIC) and the Counter Threats Advisory Board (CTAB). 1. Establishing the Transparency and Oversight Program Office To lead our mission to protect privacy and civil liberties, and to signal the centrality of this mission to all our activities, we created a new Transparency and Oversight Program Office led by a highly- respected veteran DHS attorney, Andy Fausett, who reports directly to me and the principal deputy under secretary for intelligence and analysis. This new office unites all the transparency and oversight functions that were previously dispersed throughout the organization-- the 8 members of the Privacy and Intelligence Oversight Branch, the personnel handling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, Congressional oversight, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) and inspector general inquiries, and the organizational ombuds--and elevates their role within I&A. We now have a strong voice for oversight and compliance in all our front office decision making and policy conversations, which has been absolutely critical over the past year as we have considered and implemented additional changes and reforms to the organization. a. Guidance Improvements Under TOPO: TOPO has been heavily engaged in drafting guidance for our collectors and analysts. That guidance has been particularly important for our intelligence efforts directed at domestic violent extremists (DVEs) and home-grown violent extremists (HVEs) inspired by foreign terrorist organizations who have engaged in violence in reaction to recent sociopolitical and geopolitical events. The volume and frequency of threats to Americans, especially those in the Jewish, Arab American, and Muslim communities in the United States, have increased, raising the prospect that violent extremists and lone offenders could target these communities. It is critical for our intelligence professionals to examine these threats, and it is our job to give them the guidance to conduct this mission. TOPO is focused on providing that clear guidance to our collectors and analysts on the handling of speech that may be Constitutionally protected. This guidance is critical, especially in relation to threats like domestic terrorism, where so much of the information about potential violence comes from speech that fall squarely within the core protections of our First Amendment. b. Oversight Improvements Under TOPO: Former DHS Inspector General John Roth recently joined TOPO as a senior advisor for compliance and oversight. John is helping I&A strengthen its compliance and oversight programs to better ensure robust adherence to legal and policy requirements and best practices. This work will, in turn, enhance the quality and speed of I&A's responses to external oversight entities like the GAO and the Department's and intelligence community's (IC) Office of Inspector General. c. Policy Improvements Under TOPO: Due to TOPO's strong performance to date, we have recently decided to move I&A's policy coordination and oversight function to that office. Better tailored and more routinely-updated policy is essential to the maturation and oversight of I&A's operations, and we believe TOPO is uniquely positioned to ensure that policy development is fair, transparent, thoughtful, and timely. The oversight from TOPO will ensure that all I&A intelligence policies, existing and future, fully protect privacy and civil liberties. 2. Establishing the Office of Collection and the Office of Analysis As part of the organizational reprioritization, I&A separated the management of collection and analytic functions, establishing a deputy under secretary for collection to work alongside the deputy under secretary for analysis. This increased the supervisory attention dedicated to both disciplines, which require distinct methods of management and supervision, particularly with respect to the protection of privacy and civil liberties. I&A veteran Jim Dunlap has taken the helm of analysis and, to lead collection, we brought in a highly respected 20-year veteran from the CIA who has brought an increased level of rigor to those operations. With this new management structure in place, we now have the focused management we need both to enhance the utility and quality of our analysis and to provide constant, hands- on supervision of our collection activities, which so directly implicate privacy and civil liberties concerns in the homeland. 3. Enhancing Coordination of the Intelligence Enterprise As we re-examined the organizational structure of I&A, the Secretary directed the DHS counterterrorism coordinator, Nick Rasmussen, and me to assess the effectiveness of the mechanisms for coordinating threat intelligence and response across the Department's components and headquarters elements. That assessment resulted in several reforms to improve coordination and integration of the Department's intelligence activities as well as the threat policy and response functions that are informed by those activities. a. Creating the Intelligence Enterprise Program Office: We undertook to build a mechanism to strengthen, better coordinate, and oversee the efforts of the DHS intelligence enterprise, which is composed of the intelligence programs housed within the DHS components. In statute, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis--by way of their dual role as the DHS chief intelligence officer (CINT)--has the authority to set policy for these offices and coordinate intelligence capabilities across DHS to enhance threat identification, mitigation, and response. In practice, I&A has not always had the resources, mandate, or organizational structure to fully execute this coordinating and strategic oversight role. We created the Intelligence Enterprise Program Office (IEPO) to provide strategic, administrative, and functional support to the CINT and integrate intelligence policymaking across DHS components. The office is led by Steve Cash and reports to the under secretary and the principal deputy under secretary. IEPO is already having a significant impact. For example, IEPO has developed and implemented a budget request for the intelligence enterprise to improve resource management across the Department, as well as rigorous, repeatable, process for enterprise-wide intelligence topic prioritizations. The latter process produces an annual document--the Intelligence Enterprise Intelligence Priorities Framework (IE-HIPF)--which will be modeled on the IC's National Intelligence Priorities Framework and uses the recently completed I&A priorities framework as a starting point. Our goal is to have the IE-HIPF in place to support fiscal year 2025 operations. b. Enterprise Privacy and Civil Liberties Intelligence Product Reviews: Working with TOPO, IEPO is sharing I&A's experience in the privacy and civil liberties space with the DHS Intelligence Enterprise. For over a decade, the DHS Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Privacy Office (PRIV), and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) have reviewed I&A's finished analytic products disseminated outside DHS, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and addressing concerns related to the protection of privacy and civil liberties. This review process reflects the Department's commitment to protecting the American people while upholding our Nation's fundamental values. To build on the success of this model, the Secretary directed the creation of similar review processes for the external release of analytic products authored by other components in the broader DHS Intelligence Enterprise. While the specific process for review varies among the Component Intelligence Programs, each process ensures legal, privacy, and civil rights and civil liberties oversight. c. Counter Threats Advisory Board: At the direction of the Secretary, IEPO has worked with the Counterterrorism Coordinator to revise our approach to the Counter Threats Advisory Board (CTAB). First established and chartered by the Secretary as the Counterterrorism Advisory Board in 2010, the CTAB was reconstituted and renamed following the enactment of legislation in 2020 which, among other things, directed the USIA to chair this advisory board comprised of the principals of all DHS components and headquarters entities. While the requirements of that legislation have since expired, the CTAB has endured with an expanded remit encompassing all threats within the Department's mission space, not just terrorism. To make the CTAB meetings more substantive and impactful, we have scaled back meetings to a quarterly schedule, while maintaining the ability to call snap meetings when warranted by a crisis or the emergence of a specific threat. As a result, the CTAB is now a more focused and directed forum for operational planning and decision making on key issues, and has recently served as a critical coordinating force for the Department's response to threats such as transnational organized crime (TOC) and fentanyl. d. Homeland Security Intelligence Council: IEPO has also helped to reenergize the Homeland Security Intelligence Council (HSIC), which is composed of representatives from the intelligence elements of each DHS component, ie. each Component Intelligence Program (CIP). Within the HSIC are 6 functional boards: (1) Analysis & Production Board; (2) Counterintelligence & Security Board, (3) Career Force Management Board; (4) Collection & Reporting Board, (5) Intelligence Systems Board, and (6) the Strategy, Planning & Resources Board, each of which is co-chaired by a representative from I&A and from a CIP. IEPO's leadership has dramatically improved the operationalization of the HSIC, evolving it from a forum where components provided primarily rote updates to one for Enterprise coordination and actionable policy decision making. Since October 2023, the HSIC has proposed plans to develop specific intelligence enterprise budget guidance; optimize and execute the Enterprise Homeland Security Intelligence Priorities Framework; standardize intelligence training; facilitate better access to originator-controlled information; and improve information sharing to combat counterintelligence threats to the Department, among other initiatives. e. Replacing the NTAS Bulletins: As a part of our reforms to the CTAB, we also reworked the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS), which was designed to communicate information about terrorist threats to the American public. NTAS reports were designed to describe DHS's assessment of the terrorist threat and the factors driving it, but in recent years, all the bulletins have stated that the terrorism level is ``heightened.'' To increase its utility and value as a warning tool, we will henceforth reserve the NTAS system for situations where DHS needs to alert the public about a specific or imminent terrorism threat or a change in the threat level. I&A will now provide a more general annual update on the threat environment--including the terrorism assessments that used to be conveyed through the NTAS--through the Homeland Threat Assessment (HTA). The HTA will serve as the homeland security counterpart to the director of national intelligence (DNI) Annual Threat Assessment, reflecting insights from across the Department, the IC, and other critical homeland security stakeholders to highlight the most direct, pressing threats to our homeland during the next year. Stage 2: Topical Prioritization--Homeland Security Intelligence Priorities Framework The organizational reforms I have just outlined have created a solid foundation to refine the intelligence priorities that underpin I&A's mission. The homeland security threat environment that we face today is arguably as complex and varied as it has ever been. With this diversity comes the additional challenge of triaging competing priorities and limited resources, to focus our efforts on those specific threats where I&A can uniquely contribute, whether that be through homeland-focused analysis, collection, or information sharing with SLTTP stakeholders. For the first time in a decade, I&A produced last fall a Homeland Security Intelligence Priorities Framework (IA-HIPF)--a prioritized list of national and departmental intelligence topics that will serve as an overarching strategic document for all our intelligence operations. This is the product of an in-depth assessment of the missions where I&A provides unique contributions to the national and homeland security communities, and involved multiple ``deep dive'' sessions with I&A managers; engagement with I&A's field personnel and SLTTP partners; and outreach to Congress. Guided by the priorities of the DNI, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and our homeland security partners, this engagement resulted in lists of threat topics within the homeland security mission space. We then then applied the following criteria to rank the topics: 1. Priority 1.--These are topics for which no other department or agency provides intelligence support, or topics where I&A makes unique contributions distinct from the work of other departments and agencies. The Secretary's priorities are also a significant factor in determining whether a topic is critical. 2. Priority 2.--These are topics receiving intelligence support from other departments or agencies, but not to the extent or in the manner needed by I&A's stakeholders. 3. Priority 3.--These are topics receiving intelligence support from other departments and agencies where I&A's support would have only marginal additional value. The IA-HIPF informs our Program of Analysis (POA) and Operating Directive (OD), the annual strategic documents that guide our analytic and collection efforts, respectively. Together, the IA-HIPF, the POA, and the OD focus our efforts on the most pressing threats and help our partners understand the threat areas where I&A is best positioned to provide unique contributions. Specifically, the IA-HIPF has helped to clearly articulate the scope of our intelligence missions and activities; to seek, justify, and allocate resources; to ensure that our efforts match customer needs inside and outside of DHS; and to manage our workforce, direct action, and measure our performance. The IA-HIPF will be updated at least annually to reflect changes in the threat environment and national and departmental priorities. As I previously mentioned, I&A is currently organizing a similar prioritization process for the DHS intelligence enterprise to better coordinate collection and analysis activities and align them with Departmental missions and objectives. Stage 3: Functional Prioritization The final step in our 360-review has been the prioritization of the functions we perform in the course of our intelligence work. This effort has included cataloguing all the duties we perform and examining their relevant importance to our mission against 4 operating principles that have guided our decision making throughout this process. Those principles are: 1. Focus on servicing the intelligence needs of our SLTTP partners.--Congress made clear that we are the Federal agency with primary responsibility to share intelligence with and among our SLTTP partners across the country. As such, our intelligence work should be primarily guided by the homeland security needs of those customers. 2. Focus on producing strategic-level intelligence.--Our greatest value to the national intelligence enterprise is the delivery of strategic--as opposed to tactical--intelligence that provides decisional advantage to our SLTTP partners and helps them prepare for and meet the current homeland security threats in their areas of responsibility. That is the intelligence gap that I&A was established to fill. In the domestic context, the tactical intelligence work is better left to our Federal, State, and local law enforcement partners whose investigative work focuses on individual threat actors. While it is inevitable that some of our intelligence work (especially on the collection side) will relate to tactical information about individual threat actors and their activities, we should focus on providing intelligence that illuminates the broader threat patterns and trends that our partners should be prepared to confront and doing so at the lowest classification level possible to maximize its accessibility and consumption by SLTTP partners. 3. Focus on leveraging unique capabilities.--In prioritizing our functions, we endeavor to focus on areas where I&A and DHS can contribute unique capabilities and distinct operational advantages. It is for this reason, for example, that we prioritized topics in the IA-HIPF, POA, and OD based on how well we could collect on and analyze that topic relative to other agencies. 4. Focus on building our internal management.--As a relatively young agency with a broad mission, it is critical that we continually focus on measures that enhance I&A's management capabilities, provide support to the workforce, and promote I&A's growth into a more mature and effective intelligence agency. We applied these 4 principles in every stage of our functional reprioritization process, which has resulted in approximately 30 functional and organization initiatives across I&A, detailed in the April 9 memorandum entitled ``Direction Regarding the Recommendations from the I&A 360 Review,'' which I&A shared with Congress. I will highlight some of the more significant initiatives here: 1. Field Realignment I&A recently announced a realignment of its field posture to bolster management and connectivity with headquarters, to improve intelligence support to our SLTTP partners, and to enhance information sharing and integration with other components of DHS. The realignment makes 4 key changes to I&A's Field Intelligence Directorate. Specifically, it will---- Create 4 divisions within the Field Intelligence Directorate to provide leadership and oversight of I&A's field presence; increase connectivity across the directorate, I&A leadership, and other DHS components; and relieve field staff of significant administrative, human resources, logistics, security, and information technology demands; Realign I&A's existing 12 field regions into 10 regions, consistent with the regional structure used by other DHS components, and tailor the internal management structure to provide consistent levels of supervision and oversight in each region; Clarify roles at the individual field officer level to improve mission focus, professional development, and accountability; and Add functional leaders and compliance staff to ensure field activities focus on the most pressing threats while adhering to IC and departmental policies and protecting individuals' privacy and civil liberties. Importantly, the realignment will collocate I&A field offices with those of other DHS components. Collocation of office space and secure work space across DHS components will increase collaboration and information sharing, and ultimately result in greater efficiency and cost savings in the long run. 2. Field-HQ Rotational Program To promote cohesion between the field and headquarters and better integrate field personnel into overall I&A operations and strategy, we will initiate a program for bringing field personnel into I&A headquarters for details of varying lengths starting later this year. We plan to expand the program and require field personnel to serve such a detail beginning in fiscal year 2025. Simultaneously, we will develop a TDY program for headquarters analysts and collectors to complete rotations to the field to increase their exposure to and understanding of field operations. 3. Overt Human Intelligence Collection: Focusing on the Border In our Overt Human Intelligence Collection (OHIC) Program, we have undertaken an in-depth review of its policies, rules, and procedures to ensure they provide the level of governance and oversight needed for such a sensitive area of operations, as well as an assessment of how the program can provide the most utility for the Department and our partners. We found that the program has been exceptionally valuable for our mission at the border. Since 2021, I&A has provided intelligence support for CBP security operations, conducting over 200 overt, voluntary interviews of special interest migrants that have led to: (1) a half-dozen referrals to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces for further investigation, (2) the production of over 400 intelligence information reports, and (3) the initiation of several successful law enforcement operations against human smuggling networks. To build on that success and leverage our relationship with DHS components with border enforcement responsibility, we will now largely focus our field interviews on individuals with information about border security-related threats (such as fentanyl supply chain networks, human trafficking and narcotics smuggling), and in particular on the interviews of detained migrants of homeland and national security interest that we conduct in coordination with CBP along the Southwest Border. Those interviews generate raw intelligence reporting that provides information about the illicit narcotics trade, human smuggling, TOC and other cross-border threats--reporting that is not conducted by any other intelligence agency outside DHS. While the field may still submit operational proposals for other field interviews, the majority of this program will be focused on border-related issues. 4. Open-Source Intelligence The I&A open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection program has also yielded valuable information in support of our national and departmental missions. For example, we have utilized OSINT capabilities to understand how human smugglers communicate with migrants on social media and to identify U.S. schools and businesses targeted by foreign governments for espionage or transnational repression activities. a. Embedding Collectors in Analytic Mission Centers: We have recently conducted a review of our OSINT program and identified several adjustments that we believe will increase the relevancy of collection to both analysts and SLTTP partners. First, we have decided to move our OSINT collection staff from their current office at the DHS St. Elizabeths campus to the Nebraska Avenue Complex (NAC) to work more closely with I&A's analysis and collection management personnel. And second, OSINT staff will functionally integrate within I&A's analytic mission centers to better align priorities and improve the utility of collection to finished intelligence production. Collection staff will continue reporting to the deputy under secretary for collection, but by eliminating physical and organizational silos, analysts and collectors will have more opportunities for collaboration and alignment. b. Focusing on Strategic Intelligence: Our goal is to recalibrate our open-source collection efforts to better support strategic intelligence analysis. In recent years, there has been movement toward more tactical-level open-source collection as we have increasingly tasked our collectors to report on unfolding threat situations. There have been numerous occasions where we have asked them to search, collect, and provide warnings about the possibility for violence developing around events of heightened tension, ranging from the January 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol to the reaction to the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, and the mass gatherings in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel. For a number of reasons, the OSI collectors are not well-postured to perform that tactical warning function. First, they operate with strictly constrained authorities, in that they can only collect publicly-available information and cannot misrepresent themselves to access certain chatrooms or types of communications. Second, OSI is a very small unit, and it lacks the manpower needed to conduct the kind of wide-ranging internet search that is often necessary to identify threats in a period of heightened tensions. Finally, OSI has now been further constrained in dealing with domestic terrorism threats as a result of language in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024 (NDAA) that limited our open-source cadre collecting on the domestic terrorist threat to a handful of collectors. On those occasions where OSI has been asked to do this tactical collection, it has done so in parallel with the FBI. The FBI is similarly called upon to provide warnings in times of heightened tensions, but unlike I&A, it has investigative collection authorities that permit more intrusive search techniques upon sufficient predication. In light of our limited authorities and the statutory limit on our manpower, we are simply not as well-positioned to effectively perform tactical open-source threat reporting. Instead, we will focus our open-source collectors on collection that supports our strategic intelligence priorities as they embed in the analytic centers. To preserve some tactical-alert capability in support of internal DHS needs and requests, we will retain a group of contract open-source collectors--under an OSI supervisor and subject to OSI policies--with the Intelligence Watch at the St. Elizabeths campus. While we will carry out our OSINT collection in the more limited fashion set out above, we maintain broader concerns about the Government's ability to conduct the open-source collection that provides warning about looming threats. We therefore urge Congress to re-examine the allocation of resources and authorities for this critical function. This re-examination may ultimately call for a substantial enhancement of the Government's OSINT effort, given its critical role in threat warning. 5. Analysis a. Strengthening Analytic Production: Our Analytic Advancement Division has already made significant strides in improving both the quality of our products and their utility to our consumers--and it shows in the feedback we receive on our products. To build on that progress, the deputy under secretary for analysis is implementing a new process to measure and establish benchmarks for our intelligence output and the feedback from our customers. We plan to leverage this data to reassess the allocation of our analysts within mission centers and ensure our posture is tailored to cover near-term Departmental priorities and needs. As one example, I&A has clearly displayed the quality of its work and the agility of its operations in its response to the horrific attacks on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Through the New Year, I&A produced daily situational reports about the conflict and its homeland implications for DHS leadership and our partners to ensure homeland security stakeholders had accurate and timely information to make decisions, and we continue to produce similar weekly situational reports. I&A has also published several products jointly with the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), including an initial Public Safety Notification on October 7, followed by a Liaison Information Report for private-sector customers, a Public Service Announcement, and multiple Joint Intelligence Bulletins, the most recent of which focused on threats to Jewish communities in the United States and abroad. Our subject-matter experts also participated with FBI and NCTC in national threat calls with State and local customers to communicate the state of the homeland threat environment from a variety of threat actors including foreign terrorist ideologies, violent extremists inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, domestic violent extremists, and cyber actors. I&A continues to partner with IC counterparts to anticipate potential threats stemming from the heightened tensions surrounding the conflict. b. SLTTP Fellows Program: To ensure our analysis is tailored to the needs of SLTTP stakeholders, we are reestablishing our SLTTP fellows program to create an analytic cell at I&A staffed by analysts detailed from our SLTTP partners. This cell will produce focused products to answer our partners' most pressing security questions, and work with other analysts at I&A to help them better understand our most critical audience. This effort will also help to ensure critical information at the Classified level is reviewed by SLLTP stakeholders and tailored at the un-Classified level for broader dissemination. c. Leveraging Investigative Case Files: Consistent with our reorientation toward strategic-level intelligence, we will focus on producing strategic intelligence products based on the investigative holdings of our law enforcement partner agencies. Although it has long been recognized that the information in criminal investigative files can be an important source of strategic intelligence about our homeland security, various historical obstacles have prevented that information from being fully leveraged for strategic intelligence purposes. To address that situation, we are now participating in 2 pilot programs that will have our analysts reviewing and generating intelligence products from the case files of our law enforcement agency partners. First, as part of the Department's counter-fentanyl campaign, our analysts and reports officers are working closely with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) to review fentanyl investigation files and generate products with actionable intelligence for our Federal and SLTT partners, while protecting sensitive investigative methods and information as well as individual privacy and civil liberties. In addition, we are developing a similar arrangement with the FBI, whereby our analysts will embed with FBI analysts, have access to FBI systems, and generate intelligence products regarding domestic terrorism-related patterns and trends under the strict controls necessary to protect such sensitive investigative information. With Congress prohibiting NCTC from producing analytic products about domestic terrorism threats that lack a foreign or international nexus, it is all the more important that we work with the FBI to make sure that the information in its domestic terrorism case files that could prevent or mitigate attacks is reviewed and turned into actionable strategic intelligence for our SLTTP partners. 6. Improving Management and Supervision a. Training and Development: I&A recognizes that any progress we achieve is due to the dedicated efforts of the hard-working individuals who make up our work force, and that our most important job as leaders is to ensure our people have the resources, support, and direction to execute their role to the best of their ability. To that end, I&A is continuing to implement new initiatives to improve the support and supervision of our employees. For example, we are developing a comprehensive New Managers Orientation Program to develop foundational supervisory competencies and management best practices. In tandem, we are also creating a Future Leaders Roadmap to develop existing managers, an Aspiring Managers Program to prepare I&A's rising talent for supervisory roles, and new mentorship programs to provide additional professional development at all levels of the work force. These programs expand upon our management team's strong work over the last 2 years. During that time, we established a New Hire Orientation Program and delivered the course to over 200 new employees; facilitated approximately 34,000 on-line trainings through our new Intelligence Learning Management System; and delivered over 150 additional courses to more than 3,500 students through I&A's Intelligence Training Academy. We also developed oversight training that covers I&A's authorities, the Intelligence Oversight Guidelines and whistleblower protections, and brought on 2 full-time Ombuds to help our workforce raise concerns with management. To hear from our work force directly, we also implemented an advanced analytic employee feedback survey about the management and work environment of I&A's centers and divisions. b. Telework Policy Changes: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I&A instituted a telework policy in 2021 that provided I&A staff with telework opportunities according to their work position and responsibilities. While this policy was an appropriate means of affording staff with locational flexibility, it exacted a cost in terms of workforce cohesion and the effectiveness of the supervision, training, and mentoring that is often best carried out in person. Pursuant to direction from the DHS Management Directorate, and after careful review of various considerations, in April we adopted a new telework policy for I&A that generally reduces the amount of time our work force may telework. This change is already increasing collaboration across our personnel and improving supervisory support for our work force. The new policy provides that designated senior telework officials, consisting of I&A senior staff who report to the under secretary and the principal deputy under secretary for intelligence and analysis, will determine telework eligibility based on mission requirements, required access to Classified information, collaboration and operational needs, position responsibilities, and other factors. Given their responsibility to support other staff, supervisors and those designated in leadership positions will generally be eligible for less telework than non-supervisory staff. This policy will also prohibit routine telework on the core days of Tuesdays and Thursdays each week, maximizing in-person collaboration across the entire I&A work force on those days. iii. conclusion Around this time last year, we were engaged in a debate with lawmakers surrounding our collection authorities, and we are grateful to Congress for hearing out our concerns and working constructively with us to reach the agreement that was incorporated into the fiscal year 2024 NDAA. Even before that law was passed, we immediately began issuing additional guidance for our work force to address the concerns raised by Congress. Following the enactment of the NDAA, we have developed a series of new policies to ensure compliance with its restrictions and codify the best practices for our intelligence activities. That is just one example of the many ways we have improved the rigor of our operations. Going forward, we want to continue engaging with Congress and developing solutions together. As I have said many times, I&A is in a state of positive change. Importantly, the work force has proven itself very open to that change, and that is one of the many reasons I am proud to be part of I&A and counted among its professionals who do so much to protect our homeland security each and every day. Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before you today, and I look forward to answering your questions. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Under Secretary Wainstein. The--I thank you for your testimony, again, for your service. The Members of our subcommittee may have some additional questions, and we will--we'll ask our--we'll basically go side-by-side and ask initial questions. If we have additional questions, then we'll submit those in writing to you. I now recognize myself for opening questions. I'll start with the Southern Border. As we've talked about a couple of times, the fact that we've had from fiscal year--from the beginning of fiscal year 2021 through present date over 360 individuals who have entered this country in some, way, shape, or form match the terror watch list, what I want to start by asking is, what is I&A doing and how is that being reorganized to better know those individuals and whether or not we're detaining them? I think the recent arrest of or detainment of 8 Tajik nationals who had ties to ISIS, as reported by DHS, highlights and frames this particular question. Can you walk us through what I&A is doing in this situation? Mr. Wainstein. Thank you, sir. As we discussed--and, by the way, thank you for the phone call the other day. That was a very fruitful discussion. But, as we discussed, that is a major focus of, obviously, DHS and I&A that being the border and who is coming across the border. We have at DHS a very strong screening and vetting capability. The whole intent of that is to identify people who might be a threat to the United States and prevent them from getting in here, either getting a visa, coming across the border, or if they're here and we learn about that derogatory information--which we're constantly trying to develop, whether they're here or not--that we pick them up, and we neutralize that threat. I&A plays a very important role in that effort. We, obviously, are generating intelligence on a regular basis looking for threats and threat actors. We also are centrally involved in the screening and vetting operation. We actually do a lot of the support for the National Vetting Center that is the--sort-of the intermediary that makes sure that the information from our national security elements relating to people who might be encountered on the border gets into the vetting process, and we provide a lot of the technical support, as well as the training, for that. We also do a number of other things that are very focused on the border, such as we're involved in providing nominations to the TOC, the Transnational Organized Crime, watch list. As you know, there is a watch list for TOC, as there was--as we've had for 20-some years for terrorism. We nominate, based on information we get from our State and local partners, individuals for that watch list based on our intelligence work. That's another area. Then, you know, as we said, in terms of proactive intelligence collection, we are focusing our interview efforts on the border against the threat of people coming across the border. Mr. Pfluger. How did the Department on this particular issue--because these folks, as reported, came in--8 Tajik nationals came in in January. So I think it leads everyone to believe that probably 362 is at the very low end of the number if there were 8 people who have been in the country for, call it, 5 to 6 months, and then we found them. How did the Department miss that? Then how did the Department catch that? What are we doing to make sure that that never happens again? Mr. Wainstein. Well, as I think you know, colleagues of ours from DHS are going to be giving you a Classified briefing, I believe, right after the recess, and most of this is very sensitive and Classified, so I'm very limited what I can say on the record. But I think it is clear that when those individuals came across the border and were encountered, there was no derogatory information that came to the attention of the people on the border at that time. The derogatory information came to light later on. I can say, without getting into the specifics of the work done after they got here, that I think you've heard from the FBI and others there was unprecedented cooperation between DHS and the FBI in working the situation. Beyond that, I think I would be--I'd have to defer to the--my colleagues who will give a Classified briefing on this. But it has been a--it's been a joint effort between us and our law enforcement friends at the FBI. Mr. Pfluger. When Director Wray sat here and testified in front of our committee last, he talked about the threat level being exceedingly high and used some specific words to describe that he doesn't believe that it's ever been higher. Do you think that we are in a period that you agree with that statement that he says, and then is there a black swan event, is there some sort of event that keeps you up at night that I&A is focused on trying to communicate, cooperate, and help between State, local, Tribal, Federal, all the different levels? Mr. Wainstein. Well, let me start with the latter part of your question. I&A is very much involved in the terrorism fight, and we are focused on the whole range of terrorism threats that we face. Then, to the first part of your question, is this a time of unique threat? You know, every time that you--when you look at it, you think it's, like, a unique level of threat. But we are at a very fraught time, especially after October 7, because October 7 sort-of energized so many threat vectors from so many different places and bad actors and is mobilizing potential terrorists from a variety of different perspectives. That, in addition to what was already a standing threat of terrorism, both traditional and foreign terrorism threats, but also domestic violent extremism that we've seen. So the overlay of the, sort-of, sustained raised threat from October 7 on top of what, as we said in our threat assessment last year, was already a heightened threat does make this a particularly precarious time in our Nation's history. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. My initial time has expired. I now recognize the Ranking Member for his round of questioning. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. I want to pick up, Secretary, on that last point you made about domestic violent extremism because I know both DHS and the FBI have flagged domestic violent extremism as one of the top threats that we face right now. We're talking about home- grown extremists here who are motivated by racial or ethnic prejudice, by extremism in their politics or anti-Government beliefs, by Islamophobia or antisemitism. But, of course, it can be challenging to find and to disrupt these plots because, unfortunately, we're often talking about American citizens who have First Amendment rights as well. So can you just expand a little bit on the I&A's role in fighting domestic terrorism, what can be done to strengthen DHS's ability to counter domestic extremism? I'll leave it open-ended like that. Mr. Wainstein. Thank you, sir. Domestic violent extremism, I think you've heard from Chris Wray and Secretary--Director Wray, Secretary Mayorkas and others, that, just in terms of the numbers, it is the--it is the most lethal and most dangerous threat that we're dealing with right now in terms of the threat from individuals and small groups who are ideologically motivated. However, October 7 exacerbated that threat. Now you see--I was alluding to this a little bit in the last answer. You see a little bit of the convergence of the foreign terrorist threat and, sort-of, ideological rhetoric being picked up by some of the domestic violent extremists here in the United States. That sort-of--that's kind-of fully energizing that threat. In terms of what we have to do at I&A to deal with that, you put your finger on what is particularly challenging because a lot of domestic violent extremism grows out of--by definition, grows out of ideology, and a lot of that ideology is politically-based and political thought, rhetoric, communication is the most centrally core protected Constitutional activity there is. So it's our job to make sure that, if we're focusing our collection or our intelligence and our analytical efforts on domestic violent extremism, we're not focusing on just maybe extremist discussion, extremist thought. You're allowed to be extremist in this country. That's what our country is all about. But we're only focusing on violence. One of the important things that I highlighted in my opening statement was I think one of the things I'm most, sort- of, gratified about that we've done since we got to I&A is the creation of our Transparency and Oversight Program office and the success that we've had with that office led by Andy Fausett, who is here with me today, in really starting to put a program of oversight--strong program of oversight into our operations very much because of the complexity of that challenge, of making sure that we don't do anything that chills the exercise of Constitutional rights. Mr. Magaziner. So, again, I'm--thank you for that, and that's very welcome news. On the topic, again, of domestic extremism, I&A failed to disseminate actionable intelligence prior to the January 6 attack on this Capitol when there were individuals, extremists who came to this building armed with weapons, with zip ties, intending to commit acts of violence, and there was open-source communication that suggested that this was not just political opinions or political extremism even, but that there were individuals who were contemplating violence. So can you tell us now that I&A's ability to find and disseminate information related to, you know, possible events like that has improved to the point that we can be more likely to prevent another January 6 from happening again? Mr. Wainstein. Thank you. That's--you know, that's an ever- present concern for us, that a January 6 could happen again or some other variation of it, right? I mean, you can look at a lot of events, protests, marches, whatever, a large part of them is Constitutionally protected, is fine. But then maybe some subset of the people who are there engage in terrorism or want to use that as a cover and a pretext for terrorism. It's very challenging. We have to make sure that we address the second but not the first part. That's the oversight challenge that we deal with. In terms of our capability to do that, we're very focused on making sure that we don't have another situation where we have communications that suggest violence and don't get that information out to our partners. I can tell you that, in the situations that I've been involved in the last 2 years where we've had an emergent situation, crisis situation, we have effectively gotten the intelligence out both by product and by calls at our State and local partners. I've been on a number of 3,000-person calls the day that something happens to say, ``This is what we're seeing.'' So we're making sure to get that information out. Let me just mention one thing, though. If you look--my statement for the record was kind-of long and dry and little hard to read, but one part of it, I think, is important, which is there is a function that the Government needs to do, which is reviewing the open-source environment, looking for the indicia of coming violence. That's where those indicia we're seeing back before January 6, it was there. This is open- source. We right now, I&A, are very limited in our ability to actually access a lot of that information because of the authorities we operate under and the resources we have. The point of this is not to say that we should have those authorities or resources, but Congress should think about that. Something the Government needs to be, sort-of, more--in a more muscular way and, obviously, under all the limitations we need to protect Constitutional rights, looking for that kind- of, you know, threat discussion in the open-source space because that's where the next alert for the next coming crisis is going to be. Mr. Magaziner. I think I&A can play a valuable role there, and I'll yield back. I'm over time. Mr. Bishop . I thank the gentleman for yielding back, and I recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Wainstein--is it Wainstein? Wainstein? Mr. Wainstein. It's Wainstein, sir. Mr. Bishop. I beg your pardon. Mr. Wainstein. No problem. Mr. Bishop. I was hearing you earlier, and I wonder if you could repeat something. You said that this--you identified a moment in time as giving rise to a recent substantial increase in risk of terrorism. You said October 7, the Hamas attack on Israel. Tell me again what you said about that. Why do you point to that as the trigger of this heightened risk? Mr. Wainstein. Well---- Mr. Bishop. For the United States, homeland. Mr. Wainstein. Yes, for the homeland. So what we had is we had, you know, the threat lay down that--in fact, we issued our annual homeland threat assessment 2 weeks or so before that. So you can look at that. We lay down the threat, and we determined that it was a heightened threat of terrorism at that point. Then, with October 7, you then have--you know, you've got Hamas attacking Israel; you've got Israel's response; and then different parties' reaction to both of those things. That is animated activity by everybody from Hezbollah to the Iranian Government, which, as you know--and this is public--has engaged in plotting here in the homeland, reacting to Israel, reacting to our support to Israel. We have the Houthis, who are now launching missiles at maritime targets. We have also--and I was alluding to this earlier, this interesting, sort-of, strange connection where you have--you do have some domestic violent extremists here who are not of the-- -- Mr. Bishop. So, talking about the homeland, I sort-of get why domestic violence extremists, if you see an uptick in things around the world. But, you know, as Bill Clinton once said, there's always going to be trouble in this old world. I'm not sure that the threat picture changed all that dramatically. It's not a surprise to me that Hamas wanted to do as much harm to Israel as possible. So it's--it's interesting to me you point to that, and you point to--you point to the issue of DBEs. But, if we talked about that story about the 8 Tajiks who came in who, as you said, you didn't want to talk about much here, they're not domestic violent extremists. They're here. You said there was-- see if you can--see what you've said about one statement. You said there was no--and the Secretary said there was no derogatory information about them when they crossed the border. I would think being on the terror watch list and being affiliated with an ISIS--with ISIS-K or suspected affiliation would be derogatory. Are you saying that information was not available to you when they come across? Mr. Wainstein. My understanding is that when they were encountered on the border and they were--the responsible officials checked the data systems, the data systems did not have the derogatory information in there indicating---- Mr. Bishop. So, see, that concerns me gravely. Then there's a news story by NBC News--the Chairman said before he walked out for a few minutes that he hopes we don't see another story like that, but there's an NBC News story, DHS identifies over 400 migrants brought to the U.S. by an ISIS-affiliated human smuggling network. Now, I understand maybe the Secretary has suggested some of what's in that article is not accurate. What can you say about that? Mr. Wainstein. I think what I can say--and I'm sure that my colleagues will be able to talk about this at greater length in the Classified briefing--but that the--of those people who were smuggled in from that network, which, according to the news reports, has an affiliation with ISIS, there is not information that suggests that those particular individuals are terrorist operatives. Mr. Bishop. Well, see, there's one thing you didn't say. You talked about October 7. You talked about domestic violent extremists. You did not say--and it's been curious to me as I've sat on this podium for a while, no one seems to want to say opening the doors on the border has exposed us tremendously. In November 2022, Christine Abizaid, director of the counterterrorism center, was here with Wray and the Secretary, and I asked her if her agency saw a significant threat of terrorism from the historic level of uncontrolled crossing at the Southern Border, particularly gotaways. She said, we don't, actually. Border security is really important. If we look at the nature of the threat and how it has evolved here in the United States homeland, it has been striking how the evolution to lone actors actually reflects how much more difficult it is for terrorists to enter into the United States. We look historically at the kind of attacks we have experienced here in the homeland. None of them have been connected to major illegal crossings or otherwise from the Southern Border--Southwest Border. I think that's clueless. I see stories about Quantico, people probing. I heard a vice admiral in FOX News saying they're seeing probing, you know, visits a couple times a week. Are you prepared to say that opening the border has subjected the United States with an extravagantly increased risk of significant terrorism? Mr. Wainstein. I'm prepared to say that we're hyperfocused on the threat coming across the border, and that's why I've detailed all the things that I&A is focusing on. I'm also prepared to say that CBP, as I understand it, issues publicly the number of last listed individuals that they encounter on the border. So we're not trying to sugarcoat or, you know, hide the fact that there's a threat there. In fact, I'm being instructed by my Secretary to focus like a laser beam on that threat. Mr. Bishop. Well, he's late coming to that conclusion, and I think--well, we're going to see--I just think it's inevitable we're going to see in coming years that that has been ignored to the exclusion of some other far less significant risks. My time has expired. I'll now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Crane, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Wainstein, for appearing today before the committee. How often do you meet with Secretary Mayorkas, sir? Mr. Wainstein. I meet with him pretty much every morning when we do the President's daily brief together. Mr. Crane. Your job is to give him intelligence, is that correct, regarding homeland security? Mr. Wainstein. To give him intelligence, but also to give all our partners intelligence and receive intelligence from them and make sure that it's integrated into our operations, yes. Mr. Crane. Recently, Director Wray of the FBI has been warning that the lights are blinking red as far as terrorism threats to the U.S. homeland. Would you agree with his assessment, Mr. Wainstein? Mr. Wainstein. Sir, I'd agree that we're in a very serious time, that we have to be very careful. Director Wray lived through the 9/11 era with me together, and so he knows about threats. Mr. Crane. Mr. Wainstein, do you believe that this blinking red terror threat that we now have in this country is a self- made, self-inflicted wound, or do you believe that, you know, our actions and our policies have had really nothing to do with that? Mr. Wainstein. Well, I don't know that I'd, sort-of, buy into either of those two propositions. I would say that, just like with 9/11--one of the interesting things about 9/11 is there are a lot of studies afterwards to, sort-of, ascribe blame, which were really healthy, and you see that it's always a combination of the bad actors--bad actions of our adversaries, but also our ability and willingness to try to head those off. Mr. Crane. Yes. Let's talk about that, sir. Let's talk about our ability and our willingness to head those off, because that's been the problem that many of us have tried to be the canary in the coal mine about and the American people see on a daily basis. They're not--the American people aren't stupid, right? Mr. Wainstein. No---- Mr. Crane. They're busy, but they're not stupid. They see what's going on at our Southern Border. As somebody who has spent a lot of time dealing with security threats, you've got to be pretty concerned with what's going on at the Southern Border. I think you know that that's a pretty big conduit that's leading into this blinking red light that now Director Wray is warning about. Would you agree with that, sir? Mr. Wainstein. Yes. We've--as we were saying earlier today, the border is an area that we're focusing on because we're so concerned with the threat down there; threat from a variety of different areas, not just terrorism. Fentanyl as well. Mr. Crane. Absolutely. Mr. Wainstein . As well---- Mr. Crane. Absolutely. Mr. Wainstein. Very serious. Mr. Crane. We've been talking about that, too. Mr. Wainstein. Uh-huh. Mr. Crane. Some of us are wondering, is--is Secretary Mayorkas, is President Joe Biden, are they not getting the intel, or are they just not willing to secure the border? Maybe you can help us answer that question, sir. Mr. Wainstein. I don't meet with President Biden, but I meet with Secretary Mayorkas every day, and I can tell you that he spends a lot of time making sure that I am doing everything I can and that we're doing everything we can to go after that threat. Mr. Crane. Oh, so he's--he's tasked you with making sure that you're doing everything you can? Mr. Wainstein. On the intel side, yes, sir. Mr. Crane. Well, then you're not getting it done, are you? Mr. Wainstein. I think we're doing---- Mr. Crane. Really? Mr. Wainstein . Contributing pretty well. Uh- huh. Mr. Crane. Really? Mr. Wainstein. Yep. Mr. Crane. You think you're getting it done? When you look at the numbers from individuals on the terror watch list for the last administration and this--and this administration, what are they, sir, if you know those off the top of your head? Mr. Wainstein. We are part of a team, and we are--we have a certain lane, and we're driving down that lane pretty aggressively right now. We've got a--still have a ways to go, as I discussed with the Chair and the Ranking Member, in terms of organizationally really maximizing our capabilities, we're putting them in place. Our people are stepping up, and we're focused intently on the threat. Mr. Crane. Well, sir, I say what I say knowing that you're ultimately not in--you're ultimately not in charge of the security of the homeland. That--unfortunately, that responsibility is above your pay grade and over your head, and you and I both know that. Your job is to provide intel. Is that correct? Mr. Wainstein. Uh-huh. Yes. Mr. Crane. But you don't get to make--you don't get to cancel Executive orders that we're keeping the American people safe, do you, sir? Mr. Wainstein. I don't have anything to do with the Executive orders. Mr. Crane. No, you don't, do you? If you were pushing--if you wanted to push and pass H.R. 2, it probably wouldn't matter, would it? Mr. Wainstein. Yes. But let me--let me say one thing. I am responsible for the national security. Every one of my team here and myself---- Mr. Crane. Yes. Mr. Wainstein . We wake up in the morning and we say we have a responsibility, and it's our job to---- Mr. Crane. I appreciate that. As somebody who served this country myself, I appreciate you taking ownership and-- accountability, you know, for wanting to secure our national security. But we both know that's not getting done, which is why Director Wray himself is now saying, hey, the lights are blinking red. We have more threats than even before we did at 9/11. It's not a coincidence, sir. It's not a coincidence at all. We've been foolish. We've been arrogant, and we've put policies in place that not only have cost the lives of Americans, but are putting countless more at risk today. I'm--I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed and upset I am as somebody who has been sent here to try and conduct oversight and fix this problem. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back. The subcommittee will proceed to a second round of questioning, and so I recognize myself for an additional 5 minutes, Mr. Wainstein. I want to, sort-of, continue the same theme. I appreciate your inclination to be accountable, Mr. Wainstein, and I'm not trying to suggest either that you're solely accountable. I guess the thing I wonder is how we've gotten here. I read you the quote that Director Abizaid gave in response to a question from me, and I was trying to get at the thing. I mean, it seemed to me--I'm a layperson, you're a security expert. But I think millions of Americans have watched that-- you know, from the beginning--from 2021, from the run-up from the election to 2021, immediately to an historic level of cross--border crossing, and we were told all along that the numbers of gotaways were significant, meaning that they're holding a substantial number of people coming into the United States who are never encountering anyone--any of--any Government official, and to a point, you just said, it's kind- of chilling. We've got people who are--I don't know how the terrorist watch list works or what exactly that looks like or how people get on it and so forth. But it's incomprehensible that such a thing exists and that even the vetting is so bad that those people don't get identified as they come across. Then I remember seeing the news article on that, and what it indicated was they were arrested, and then it listed the cities they were arrested in. It was every major city in America it sounded like. I don't--but then, you know, I sit up here as a layperson asking the questions that seem obvious to me. I don't-- candidly, sir, I don't know--I remember your coming out and making a public statement that the administration is engaged in reckless policy. I don't think you've done that. Frankly, Chris Wray has begun sounding increasingly alarmed in his rhetoric, but I read from you what the director of the counterterrorism center said. ``We don't really think that's a risk.'' Now it's--I mean, the evidence is cropping up. So far, thanks to God, we have not seen a spectacular act of terrorism. But you're still sitting down here and the priorities you're identifying are changes in--you know, October 7 attack on Israel, which sounds like a make weight to me. It is a tremendously horrific incident, but it's not a change in terms of the threat picture that has always existed in the Middle East. Then you talk about domestic violent extremists. Mr. Magaziner asked you about risks like January 6. I know that it is a stock piece in some politics in the United States that January 6 was as bad as 9/11. I don't honestly remember it that way. I may be--and maybe some American will disagree with me-- or many Americans, Mr. Magaziner might disagree. But what accounts for that? I mean, it sounds reckless to me. You did not--Ms. Abizaid has not, other Members have not come out and said, ``This is dangerous to the homeland. I'm accountable.'' I'm not going to sit in my position and see the risks you're bound to see, that you're not able to tell me about in detail. Why keep quiet about a risk like that, that we now see manifested in visits to Quantico, a Chechen conducting surveillance on an Army--a special forces colonel in Carthage, North Carolina, leading to a killing; an Eritrean in Gates County, North Carolina, leading to a stand-off with police and a shooting. It just goes on and on. It is--it's not domestic violent extremists. So what gives? Mr. Wainstein. Couple things, sir. Thank you for the question, and I understand where you're coming from. If I could just clarify one thing. I didn't finish, sort-of, the chain of reasoning I talked about--I started on about Gaza. You say that there's no change since October 7. I think if you were to talk to the Jewish community, they would say quite otherwise. They're suffering. They are under threat in a way they weren't before, and that is what I was talking about. The events overseas have energized threat actors of a variety of different types, foreign as well as domestic, and they're suffering from it. Mr. Bishop. Yes. I agree with that. Mr. Wainstein. So we've put bulletins out about that jointly with the FBI. We've been engaged fully with the Jewish community because this is a sea change, and it's not coming-- it's not going to end. Mr. Bishop. Yes. I never imagined I would see what I see-- in the Democratic Party, frankly, in our country. But go ahead. Mr. Wainstein. It's horrendous. But, in terms of the threat from foreign terrorism, you asked why I'm not saying anything more about it. I've spent every public moment talking about the terrorism threat, in particular the threat from foreign terrorism since--especially since October 7. If you look at the Tajik situation, that's--you'll get briefed on that. But, you know, it's not lost on us that the people who killed over 150 Russians in that theater were from the same part of the world, OK? So--and I can tell you that Director Abizaid is working with my team and me on a daily basis. I'm going to be with her tomorrow, and we're working on a daily basis on this very threat and with the Bureau. The amount of--and I mentioned this earlier. It really is unprecedented the level of cooperation between us and the Bureau on these threats, and I say that with a little bit of perspective because I was in Government in the national security space up until inauguration day 2009. I left with the Bush administration and then stepped out of Government and then stepped back in 2 years ago. The amount of--in real day-to-day operational coordination between DHS and FBI that I'm seeing now, we didn't have anything even close to that back then. So it is unprecedented; it's real; and we're taking it seriously. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, sir. My time has expired. I recognize Mr. Magaziner for 5 minutes. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate it. This started out as a good, productive bipartisan hearing that I hoped it would be. Of course, now we've gone off the rails. I just want to correct the record on a few things. The Anti-Defamation League, the ADL, has reported a skyrocketing rate of antisemitic violence in this country after October 7. We've also seen huge spikes in targeting of the Muslim community in the United States, and oftentimes it is foreign terrorist organizations who are on-line through propaganda and otherwise trying to incite people here in the United States and divide us against each other. The synagogue in my neighborhood received a bomb threat just in the week after October 7. That hadn't happened in years. It's not a coincidence. So we cannot minimize, we cannot diminish, we cannot sweep under the rug the very real threat of domestic extremism in this country, which is on the rise. By the way, even before October 7, more Americans over the last 5 years have been killed by domestic extremists than by foreign terrorist organizations on the homeland. That doesn't mean that the foreign terror threats aren't real. They always have been, and they are heightened again after October 7. But we cannot minimize, we cannot diminish the very real threat from domestic violent extremism here in the United States. It's not just related to October 7 either. How many, 50 people killed at Pulse nightclub in Orlando for no reason other than it was a gay bar. People killed in Buffalo because they are African American. People killed in El Paso because they were immigrants by domestic violent extremists. The threat is real. I thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your focus on it and for trying to keep Americans safe. I will also note, January 6 was a big deal. If you think it wasn't, talk to the family members of the Capitol Police officers who lost their lives in the days following that dark event. So let's not minimize, let's not diminish--and, by the way, all of these threats are real: foreign terrorist organizations, the challenges we're having at the border are all real, but we're not going to get anywhere by minimizing or sweeping under the rug or trying to make this a partisan thing. I'm sorry. The people chanting ``Jews will not replace us'' at Charlottesville, they weren't Democrats. Antisemitism knows no party in this country, and I can tell you that from personal experience. Nick Fuentes, the Neo-Nazi having lunch at Mar-a- Lago is not a Democrat. So neither party has a monopoly on antisemitism in this country, and let's not politicize that. Now, with the remaining time that I have left, Mr. Wainstein, I want to go back and give you a chance to actually have the time to respond a little bit and talk about particularly as it relates to the Southern Border, the work that your office is doing to make sure that we minimize and intercept as many threats as possible. So can you please expand on the work that you are doing and that people under you are doing. Mr. Wainstein. Thank you, sir. Appreciate your comments. I just--I think I addressed a number of them, but a couple things I would like to mention. One is fentanyl. The fentanyl threat is a huge crisis. We're losing 70,000-odd Americans a year, untold damage to American families and economy. It's unlike other drug threats which, you know, were labor- intensive, sometimes difficult to secrete and send across the border. Fentanyl is easy to produce. There seems to be an endless stream of precursors coming over from China. It's small and compact, can be easily secreted into a car or whatever and gotten across the border. It's really tough, and it's--now we have, sort-of, knockoff, follow-on types of synthetic opioids. So this is going to take an all-of-Government effort, and it's going to require the Executive branch but also Congress. We are focusing on it both in terms of we're generating increased amounts of reporting on fentanyl. We're working closely, in person and in great communication with our State and local partners who are focusing on that, especially the Southwest Border partners who have been very supportive of us along the border. We're--as I mentioned earlier, we are nominating people for the TOC watch list, the Transnational Organized Crime watch list, which is focusing on the border, often on cartel members. The cartels--and, you know, we don't need to--I don't need to educate you on what the cartels are doing, but they are having an outsize effect on our national security because they are now going beyond just narcotics trafficking into human smuggling and all sorts of other licit and illicit activities, and they are--you know, they're unbelievably wealthy based on the fentanyl. So we're generating these nominations for the TOC watch list so that we can better stop cartel members and affiliates from coming across the borders. Those are, sort-of, two areas that we're ramping up our activity in. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you for the seriousness with which you are taking on this very big challenge and all of the challenges facing our homeland as it relates to security threats. So I thank you for that work. I'll yield back. Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back. I recognize Mr. D'Esposito, the gentleman from New York, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir, for being here this afternoon. The Department of Homeland Security grants clearances to State, local, Tribal, territorial, law enforcement officers. Once in receipt of an approved clearance nomination for a SLTT law enforcement officer who supports the DHS mission, the DHS office of the chief security officer or a DHS component with its own personal security unit will either grant the clearance or deny the clearance based on the background investigation. The committee has learned that there exists a serious backlog of issuing security clearances to these State, local, and Tribal, territorial, law enforcement officers. In one Department alone, they currently have nearly 20 members of service who are still waiting on the process of the security clearances, and it's been more than a year without any follow- up by your office for most of them, and there's actually a handful of them that are waiting 2 years; obviously, resulting in a serious backlog in which law enforcement officials are unable to attain--obtain the essential information that they need in order to conduct investigations. It's having a negative effect on their ability to receive and use that intelligence that's critical to not only doing their job but keeping their communities and this country safe. So, really, a yes-or-no question. Do you have a responsibility in providing SLTT law enforcement officers access to intelligence product, including some at the Classified level, as well as granting or denying security clearances to these law enforcement officers based on their background investigation? Just yes or no? Mr. Wainstein. Yes, we're involved in the clearance process, yes. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. So are you aware that there exists a serious backlog stemming from your office being able to provide these clearances? Mr. Wainstein. Yes. I've been very focused on our role, as well as the security office's role. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. I mean, do you agree that the--that, if the SLTT law enforcement officers are unable to obtain this information, it's, obviously, going to result in a negative effect on their ability to receive and utilize or even obtain this information? Mr. Wainstein. Absolutely, sir. Look, you put your finger on a very important issue. I wrestled with this when I was chief of staff of the FBI back in 2003, back when we were trying to expand the number of State and locals who had clearances. You could only have them be fully engaged in something involving foreign terrorism in particular if a certain number of them have clearances. When I came in, we did have a backlog. We had a pretty significant backlog for resource and procedural reasons. At the end of last year, we put together a task force that zeroed in on the backlog and largely got rid of the backlog. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. So, from last year to today, what was the backlog, and where is the number at today? Mr. Wainstein. I don't have the exact number, but I can tell you this. We largely got rid of the backlog, but then, for instance, we got 100 applications from another State. Mr. D'Esposito. Just respecting--respecting both of our time. So we're saying--we're agreeing that there's a backlog. We see that there's an issue. You're saying that, when you came in, obviously, you put together a strategy in order to diminish that backlog. So, if we could give--just take a round number guess, where it was at and where it's at today? I mean, is there a significant change? Is there, you know, a few people that have been granted clearance? Are we making a difference that's actually giving law enforcement officers the intelligence that they need, or---- Mr. Wainstein. Yes. Mr. D'Esposito . Are we not making a difference? Mr. Wainstein. So, sir, I don't have the exact numbers, but I will get those to you promptly. But I will tell you that we largely got rid of the backlog. It's crept back up again. We now have more resources going into that so that we don't allow the backlog to get out of hand. Mr. D'Esposito. So do you agree that it is a priority to-- -- Mr. Wainstein. Absolutely. Mr. D'Esposito . Address the backlog and report--report regularly to Congress on the progress? I mean, it seems like a common-sense reform. Mr. Wainstein. Absolutely. My State and local partners are very energized by this issue. So I hear about it a lot. Mr. D'Esposito. So will you commit that your office will address the serious backlog so that our State, local, Tribal, territorial, law enforcement officers obtain the necessary information to ensure the public and, obviously, their safety? Mr. Wainstein. Absolutely. We'll ask Congress for the resources to make that permanent. Mr. D'Esposito. My time has just about expired, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize Mr. Crane from Arizona for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&A has consistently come under fire for its social media collection targeting Americans' political views. You claim that you have safeguards for First Amendment-protected speech, but by all accounts they come with a huge loophole. If an I&A officer says that collected protected speech somehow furthers one of your missions, he can collect that speech all day long. I&A has claimed a vague counter-terrorism need to target Americans talking about politics, COVID, environmentalist issues and so forth. Please explain your method for deciding which one to monitor to prevent terrorism, please. Mr. Wainstein. Thank you, sir. That is--that goes to the crux the issue that I was raising earlier, which is how difficult it is to do this work in this--in the homeland where the Constitution, obviously, applies, applies strongly, and it's sacred that we respect the Constitutional right to free speech and political engagement. The--so what we do in terms of collection, as well as in terms of analysis, is we can only do intelligence work as it relates to communications, political speech if that political speech does relate to one of our missions. In other words, if that political speech is coupled, for example, with talking about coordinating violence in a protest, violence, actual violence, the type of thing that you were referring to, Ranking Member Magaziner, pre-January 6, or in the context of any kind of protest. That's an example. Or efforts--discussing cyber efforts on-line to undermine the integrity of our critical infrastructure. We're seeing that by people domestically. We're also seeing it by foreign adversaries who are trying to get inside the systems of our critical infrastructure. So we have to have a mission, and we actually--in order to do that collection or analysis. Our Transparency and Oversight Program Office is doing something very important, which is we're putting in place a process to make sure that that collector or analyst identifies what that mission is before they take the step based on that mission. So we can go back and audit it and make sure that someone didn't willy-nilly collect something without a verifiable basis for doing it. That's one of the big things--big-ticket items that our TOPO, Transparency and Oversight Office, is pulling together right now. Mr. Crane. So, sir, you're saying that you're currently putting that process in place? Or do you already have that process written down and your agents are trained on that process? Mr. Wainstein. We have guidance in place. We have training that has been greatly improved over the last few years. Then, in terms of the accounting afterwards, the audit function, that is being built right now. We've gotten some assistance from folks like the inspector general and the GAO. We actually have the former Inspector General of DHS John Roth on our staff as a special Government employee helping us with these kind of systems. Mr. Crane. Are you prepared and willing to share that process, the training with the Homeland Security Committee? Mr. Wainstein. Absolutely. I'm very proud to show it to you. Mr. Crane. Great. Thank you, sir. One thing that I wanted to touch on with the remainder of my time is I represent half of the Tribes in Arizona. What are you guys doing to work with the localities, Tribal police to deal with some of the issues that they're experiencing largely because of our open border? Like the fentanyl deaths are skyrocketing on the reservation. Can you share with us what you guys are doing to coordinate and work with Tribal police? Mr. Wainstein. Thank you, sir. I know that they have particular challenges and particular threats, and we are working our engagement office that engages with the State and locals. Like I told you at the beginning, one of the things we've done is we've elevated that whole function within the organization. So they report directly to me because it's a huge priority. We're meeting with our counterparts, State, local, but also Tribal partners on a regular basis and particularly those who are affected down by the border, by all the activity down there. I was down at the border for a week, I guess, last year in Texas and seeing the issues there. Obviously, the same thing, issues there are playing out in the areas of the reservations over New Mexico and Arizona. So---- Mr. Crane. Is this something that your office is proactive in, reaching out to the Tribes? Or do you require them to come to you for intelligence? Mr. Wainstein. We reach out to all our partners. But if it's OK, sir, what I'll do is I can get you a written or verbal brief about specifically what we're doing with the Tribes. Mr. Crane. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Pfluger . The gentleman yields. Under Secretary, we'll start our third and final round. Again, appreciate you being here. If folks come in, then I'll allow them to talk but, otherwise, it will be this group here. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Last year Politico reported--and I alluded to this in my opening statement--that DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis has a virtually-unknown program gathering domestic intelligence called the Overt Human Intelligence Collection Program. The program has raised concerns even from within DHS from employees within DHS that the work that was being done could be illegal. According to the Politico report, one unnamed employee quoted in an April 2021 document stated that I&A's office of regional intelligence is, ``shady'' and, ``runs like a corrupt government.'' I just want to get your take on not just that quote but just in general that program. Are you aware that some DHS I&A employees share concern, wide-spread internal concerns about legally questionable tactics and political pressure? Mr. Wainstein. You know, thank you for that, sir. In fact, we--you might remember we sent you and your fellow Members a very lengthy letter that explained everything we were doing in that space. So, just as a quick backdrop, there--the way this sort-of became known is we put a pause on one aspect of our human interviewing program. That was where people, I&A people might go in and interview folks who are facing charges. The reason for that--and, remember, I'm a long-time Federal prosecutor. So I'm sort-of sensitive to this. The reason for that is, while it might be perfectly legal and Constitutional, it could be seen as sort-of invading the relationship between that person and their criminal attorney for their criminal case because they're facing charges. So we put a pause on that. That's what sort-of got in the news and became an issue. I'm fine with that because we--our rules allowed for something that we should have been more careful about. We came to find out when we did an audit that we actually had never interviewed anybody in that situation, you know, where we actually after they've been arraigned and received counsel and had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached. But our procedures allowed for it. So that necessitated us going back and redoing, relooking at all the different guidance for our human intelligence program. Part of what I've laid out in detail in this statement for the record is all the work we've done in that space to redo that program, new guidance, new training, limitations, and then some of the limitations that were imposed by Congress last year which, you know, we sort-of worked back and forth with Congress in a very respectful way to come up with the NDAA resolution that limited our ability to do that human intelligence collection. The last thing I'd say is what I said earlier which is we're taking those resources, taking that human intelligence focus and focusing on the border now. So most of that work is going to be, you know, special interest migrants who are detained on the border, working with the CBP colleagues, trying to get information about the threat related to the border. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Under Secretary, and I'm glad you brought up products. I think there are a number of questions via letters and other correspondence that we have to DHS and I&A and just want to make sure that the Department is tracking those but not only that, that in a timely manner that you'll commit to responding to those. Mr. Wainstein. I'll go--I'll look into whatever's pending sir. Thank you. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. What's your biggest concern right now? What's the priority for I&A to keep the country safe in the threat environment that we previously discussed today? Mr. Wainstein. Well, to talk like a bureaucrat for a second, one priority is for me is making sure that we can maximize the ability of I&A to address these threats. That's why we have this review going on. That's why I actually welcome this because the more scrutiny, the more guidance, and the more engagement from Congress, the better we're going to be able to improve and progress. Mr. Pfluger. What's I&A's competitive advantage in the IC? Mr. Wainstein. Our bread and butter--and to step back for a second, you both spoke about challenges that I&A has had. One thing that I think people need to recognize, if you go back and look at sort-of the founding documents, the legislation for I&A, it's not clear what the core mandate for I&A is. But, when you sort-of look at what gap it was intended to fill post-9/11--so you referred to the 9/11 commission report, which is a brilliant piece of writing, by the way. If you go back and look at that, you'll see that the, one of the concerns that was raised is the disconnect between the hundreds of thousands of State and local, territorial, Tribal, and private- sector partners who have, you know, security interests and knowledge and the Federal intelligence and law enforcement communities. Our job is to be that connection, to be that bridge, to share information about the threats facing the homeland with those SLTTP partners and making sure that we're getting the information from them that feeds into our intelligence system. So, for example, I mentioned that we do TOC nominations for TOC watch lists. A lot of that comes from our State and local partners who tell us, you know, at Fusion Centers, hey, Ken Wainstein, here's the information that shows Ken Wainstein's a cartel member. We then take that, vet it, and get into it the TOC watch list. That's the kind of information that we need bidirectionally from our State and local partners. That's why, as I said when we talk about the guiding principles, that our guiding principal is, the first one is our main focus is providing intelligence to the SLTTP partners. It's not necessarily getting the PDB. Right? It's good to inform our Federal decision makers. But the gap that we fill and the intelligence enterprise is connecting with those SLTTP partners. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. My time has expired. I recognize the Ranking Member. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you again, Secretary. I know you've taken steps to improve training and developing the work force at I&A. I'll just plug that I have a bill, H.R. 4429, the Department of Homeland Security Intelligence and Analysis Training Act, that would require standardizing entry-level basic intelligence training for all new I&A employees. But could you just take a moment to explain some of the reforms you're making in addressing training of the work force at I&A? Mr. Wainstein. We are--we have improved training, and this--this predates me. I mean, a lot of the progress I'm talking about here, by the way, started well before me. So I don't want to be taking personal credit for all of it and particularly in the training area. Some of the things were put in place after, for example, the Portland situation in 2020 and then the January 6 situation early 2021 was a recognition that the guidance wasn't sufficient in certain areas and that the training on that guidance wasn't sufficient. So we have ramped up the training, the frequency, and the substance and quality of the training. Our intelligence training academy is much better equipped now to handle these trainings internally, as well as with external partners. Then we're also--in terms of guidance, obviously, we have the Transparency and Oversight Program Office, which is making sure that the guidance is put out as we need it and dealing with current events and then it gets integrated with the training. So, for example, with the campus protests, we put guidance out because that's a very sensitive, delicate situation. We put guidance out to our people quickly, once that sort-of came up, written guidance, and then followed that up with in-person or actual training to make sure where the left and right boundaries are. So there's a lot happening, and I'm happy to give you a written or verbal briefing on that. Mr. Magaziner. Terrific. As I read through the sort-of the third phase report that you put out as part of the review, there was a lot in there, but the part that interested me the most related to collection activities was the intent to basically embed open-source intelligence collectors within the analytic centers and with sort-of your partner offices. I thought that made a lot of sense. You know, we talk about breaking down silos and kind-of the silo--over-siloing that allowed 9/11 to happen. Could you just talk a little bit more about how that's going, what the thinking behind it was, how it's going implementation-wise, and what you think the enhanced abilities of I&A will be as a result of that model? Mr. Wainstein. Yes, that's--thank you for asking that because that's sort-of a good example of some of the thought process that's going on here largely by the team behind me. So our open-source people for historical reasons were sort- of in one place separate from the rest of the work force, actually over at St. Elizabeths, whereas the rest of us are at the Nebraska Avenue Center. So they're by themselves, and they weren't physically and sufficiently operationally integrated with our analysts. Of course, the collectors are supposed to be serving the analysts and vice versa. Right? So collection is supposed to feed off of analysis and vice versa. So, you know, we made the decision we should move them over for those reasons, also just management reasons. It was going to be better to have them sort-of with everybody else. Then we wanted to--we decided, I think I alluded to this earlier, that we really need to have them focus on strategic collection, not just sort-of law enforcement collection about the threat of the moment. But the point we made earlier, our main purpose is helping that police chief or city mayor or Governor or Tribal official understand the threat that's going to come to his or her jurisdiction today and then down the road so that they can make resource and policy decisions. That is--we can only do that if we have our open-source collectors looking at it through the strategic lens, and that is only going to happen if they're working with analysts who are doing strategic products. So that was the thinking. Mr. Magaziner. Yes, I'll just say, you know, as a former bureaucrat, when I was State treasurer in Rhode Island, that's the kind of, you know, nuanced thinking that I think can actually, you know, create really good results. So I thank you and your team for that, among the other actions that you're taking to enhance the organization. With that, I'll yield back. Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wainstein, thank you again for this opportunity. The--you--you know, a lot--we--early on in your testimony when we were having a colloquy in the first round, I think, you talked about events, antisemitic protests and the like around the country. Have you guys--do you guys have any information or indication whether any of that is a product of foreign malign influence? That is to say, we're all aware we've had fairly controversial Foreign Influence Task Force at the FBI and the issue with the foreign malign influence allegedly spread through social--well, spread through social media and what the FBI's done to curtain that. We had the Murthy v. Missouri case that just came out from the Supreme Court today in which they said there's no standing for people who feel like their speech was suppressed to challenge that in the United States and then court. But what about these--the protests? So it was--and what I meant when I said earlier about post-October 7 things, I was just stunned to watch Palestinian flags, 300,000 people, you know, marching through the streets. I just didn't know that was the nature of the politics we had in the United States even at this point. Then, of course, we've seen all of the protests, some of them involving significant vandalisms, tent settlements, a lot of building vandalism at universities across the country. Is any--are--is there foreign malign influence in that? Mr. Wainstein. So you put your finger on a very critical issue. Obviously, if there were, that would be--if I was aware of anything, that'd be based on intelligence sources and methods. Mr. Bishop. So you couldn't talk about it. Mr. Wainstein. I couldn't speak about it in an unclassified context. But let me just say that that is an issue that we in the intelligence community focus on not just with this round of protests but with all protests because we're seeing that that is one of the entries in our adversary's menu. Right? Try to foment agitation within the United States, sow discord. We've seen that over and over, and one of the ways of doing that is to try to sow disorder on the streets. So---- Mr. Bishop. Are there programs, are there Government resources that are available to deal with that in any way? So, again, the Foreign Influence Task Force, that's a publicly-known thing. They're supposed to be--they say they are working to counter foreign malign influence on social media. Are there programs or--I guess if you really can't speak it to, even if you can't speak to the risk, can you talk about whether there are resources that are devoted to trying to address that in any way? Mr. Wainstein. Sure. Once again, I'm answering that as to any sort of foreign malign influence, sort-of put aside whether it relates to any particular protest. Absolutely Foreign Malign Influence Center is up and running and is focused on that. The FBI obviously, that is a counterintelligence threat. So a foreign nation-state or foreign terrorist organization is trying to foment discord with any groups here in the United States, that is by definition the counterterrorism--a counterintelligence threat and it's subject to something that the FBI can investigate. That's the kind of matter that they do investigate. Mr. Bishop. OK. For my remaining time, I want to revisit this same topic a couple of times that I've addressed--tried to address a couple of times. I've read from Director Abizaid's response, but I can-- November 2022. I had another crack at her in November 2023, and I kind-of went at the same issue again, whether the number-- just the sheer volume of cross-border crossings presents a significant risk of terrorism. She says at one point, ``I appreciate the question. We absolutely recognize the kind of vulnerabilities that are associated with border security across all our ports of entry, across Southwest Border, and otherwise. But I would maintain, and I talked to my analysts about this on a regular basis, that as we look at the global terrorism environment, as we look at foreign terrorist organizations' intentions to try and seed operatives into the United States, we don't have indications that are credible or corroborated that those terrorist organizations are trying to do that at this time.'' Do you--do you join in that opinion at this time? Mr. Wainstein. Well, let me answer that in a couple of ways. That was obviously an answer at that point in time. Mr. Bishop. Has it changed? Mr. Wainstein. November 2022. Mr. Bishop. This was 2023 actually. Mr. Wainstein. November 2023. So that was at a point in time. In terms of what terrorism threat there is, whether there are particular threat actors, you know, I would have been to defer to the FBI NCTC and my colleagues who will give you a brief in the Closed session. Mr. Bishop. So you can't really answer the question whether that still obtains. Mr. Wainstein. I cannot answer what the intelligence picture is in an open setting. One way---- Mr. Bishop. It just seems to me, and I will tell you as an American citizen observing, it seems like the Tajik story, it seems like the NBC story I related earlier, it seems like the vice admiral on FOX News saying we're receiving probing visits a couple of times a week at military installations in the United States, the--I did a hearing recently in a committee on the sheer--on the, you know, 1,100 percent increase in Chinese national migration. I just--but she--she was prepared to say that, and you can't say one way or the other today. Mr. Wainstein. No, keep in mind, I'm answering the question what the intelligence picture is and telling you that I just can't do it publicly. But I can say this. We see that as an area that we need to focus on, and we're spending a lot of time focusing on it. We're redirecting resources to focus on the border, and I've explained why and what we're doing. So, in terms of the seriousness with which we take that concern, we're taking it very seriously. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Wainstein. I yield back. Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Crane. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to read a headline that was posted about 30 minutes ago on FOX News and a little bit of the article and have you respond to it, sir. ``Biden DHS reveals 50 migrants still at large as ISIS-affiliated smuggling network brings hundreds to the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security has identified over 400 individuals brought to the U.S. from Eastern European and Central Asian countries by an ISIS-affiliated smuggling network in the past several months, a DHS senior official confirmed to FOX News on Wednesday. Officials have arrested over 150 so far that have either been removed, placed in removal proceedings, or are currently receiving additional screening. They would not confirm of how many match the terror watch list. Of the remaining 50 individuals at large, they acknowledge that a small number may match the terror watch list.'' Can you respond to that article, sir? Mr. Wainstein. So I'll give this--generally the same response I gave before which is, you know, subject to the Classified briefing that you'll receive on this, which I know has already been scheduled, which is that the--my understanding is that, while there was a smuggling network and there are a certain number of individuals who came through the smuggling network---- Mr. Crane. An ISIS-affiliated smuggling network. Mr. Wainstein. A smuggling network for which there's an ISIS affiliation, there has not been any evidence but for any of those individuals were terrorist operatives. Mr. Crane. Why is this still being allowed to happen, sir? Mr. Wainstein. Why is the smuggling network being allowed to happen? Mr. Crane. Yes, I mean, why are we consistently seeing stories like this? Mr. Wainstein. I can tell you that we are very focused on the smuggling networks, and our colleagues at HSI and FBI and others are really are zeroing in on these networks. A lot of what we've done at DHS is to work with the FBI to get a clear understanding of the networks out there. This is-- we spend a lot of time helping to sort-of, to clarify the picture of what the networks are so that we can---- Mr. Crane. Right. Mr. Wainstein . Anticipate whether any of those networks are involved in terrorism. Mr. Crane. I appreciate that you guys are doing that. But wouldn't you say, sir, that you can have all the intelligence in the world but if you don't have leaders who are willing to execute on that intelligence, it doesn't really matter, does it? Mr. Wainstein. Well, also what you do need also, and this is one thing I think is important, and you asked about what I need or we need. We could use more resources to go to the border, both DHS but also I&A. You know, the more people we have down here, interviewing folks along the border, the more likely we're going to find about bad actors coming across the border. Mr. Crane. You say that because you know that your head shed, your leadership, won't actually change any of the policies, right? Mr. Wainstein. I say that because that's a--that's a truism that right now we are operating with relatively scant resources. Mr. Crane. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this then. Would we need to--would we need to surge more people to the border, the same exact Southern Border that we've had now, if your administration was actually doing its job and protecting the American people? Mr. Wainstein. Well, look, I'm not going to get into sort- of platitudes one way or the other, other than to say that we're going to go where we see the intel need to be. From when I went through my confirmation hearing and your colleague from Texas asked me about the border and I said, based on what I know as a private citizen outside the Government still, that's an area where we need to focus our intelligence efforts, that hasn't changed since I got in. So we're going to continue to focus there. Mr. Crane. Yes, let me shift real quick to the advisory board. According to a May 17, 2024, Department press release, DHS decided to rebrand its Experts Group as the Homeland Intelligence Advisory Board. The 19 members of the disbanded Experts Group have simply been reconstituted as members of the board. This is troublesome given that it appears DHS is attempting to mislead Congress and the American public by simply renaming a controversial advisory committee. We have also learned that DHS has exempted this board from public notice reporting and open meeting provisions that are normally required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Why is this, sir? Mr. Wainstein. Well, let me just clarify one thing because, whenever I hear a question with the word ``mislead,'' I feel I've got to respond to that. There was no misleading done at all. In fact, if you look at the settlement agreement, the public settlement agreement that ended the litigation, that led to us disbanding the original group, we said that we have the right to constitute a new group under the FACA law. We said that in black and white. The other party in the litigation accepted it. The judge accepted it. Mr. Crane. That's great. Real quick, sir, is it true Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper are on this advisory group? Mr. Wainstein. They were on the original Experts Group and, as we announced, we will be---- Mr. Crane. Didn't--didn't both of those judges say that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation? Why would you want--my question, sir, is: Why would you want guys that are putting out very false information publicly to the American people, why would you want them on your advisory committee? Mr. Wainstein. I want people who can help us do what I'm talking about here which is transform an organization. We're trying to transform an intelligence organization. There's one person in the world---- Mr. Crane. Is telling the truth a part of helping with that? Mr. Wainstein. Could I answer, please? Mr. Crane. Yes, go ahead. Mr. Wainstein. There's one person in the world who's recently transformed an intelligence agency, the CIA, John Brennan. I don't care what his politics are. I care that he's honest with us, he brings his perspective, and donates his time to us to help us---- Mr. Crane. Transformed it good or bad? Mr. Wainstein. That's for others to understand---- Mr. Crane. Yes. Mr. Wainstein . To assess. Mr. Crane. Exactly. Mr. Wainstein. But I want to hear that experience. Jim Clapper, once again, I don't care what his politics are, but he was the director of national intelligence. He coordinated all the different---- Mr. Crane. I don't care what his politics are, as long as he doesn't weaponize them. Mr. Wainstein. Exactly. Mr. Crane. But clearly he has, and that's why I asked you: Didn't both of these guys say that the Hunter Biden laptop was disinformation? These are intelligence guys. Everybody knew that that laptop was legitimate. I yield back. Mr. Magaziner. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields back. The Ranking Member is recognized. Mr. Magaziner. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the letter that the gentleman from Arizona is referring to, which outlines why 4 dozen intelligence officials who signed it believed based on the available information at the time that the---- Mr. Pfluger. Can the Ranking Member state the title of the article? Mr. Magaziner. It's the letter that the gentleman from Arizona was referring to that---- Mr. Pfluger. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Magaziner . Was signed by multiple intelligence individuals. Mr. Pfluger. Without objection, so ordered.  Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails October 19, 2020 We are all individuals who devoted significant portions of our lives to national security. Some of us served in senior positions in policy departments and agencies, and some of us served in senior positions in the Intelligence Community. Some of us were political appointees, and some were career officials. Many of us worked for presidents of both political parties. We are all also individuals who see Russia as one of our nation's primary adversaries. All of us have an understanding of the wide range of Russian overt and covert activities that undermine U.S. national security, with some of us knowing Russian behavior inmately, as we worked to defend our nation against it for a career. A few of us worked against Russian information operations in the United States in the last several years. Perhaps most important, each of us believes deeply that American citizens should determine the outcome of elections, not foreign governments. All of us agree with the founding fathers' concern about the damage that foreign interference in our politics can do to our democracy. It is for all these reasons that we write to say that the arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden's son Hunter, much of it related to his time serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation. We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement--just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case. If we are right, this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this. There are a number of factors that make us suspicious of Russian involvement. Such an operation would be consistent with Russian objectives, as outlined publicly and recently by the Intelligence Community, to create political chaos in the United States and to deepen political divisions here but also to undermine the candidacy of former Vice President Biden and thereby help the candidacy of President Trump. For the Russians at this point, with Trump down in the polls, there is incentive for Moscow to pull out the stops to do anything possible to help Trump win and/or to weaken Biden should he win. A ``laptop op'' fits the bill, as the publication of the emails are clearly designed to discredit Biden. Such an operation would be consistent with some of the key methods Russia has used in its now multi-year operation to interfere in our democracy--the hacking (via cyber operations) and the dumping of accurate information or the distribution of inaccurate or misinformation. Russia did both of these during the 2016 presidential election--judgments shared by the US Intelligence Community, the investigation into Russian activities by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and the entirety (all Republicans and Democrats) on the current Senate Intelligence Committee. Such an operation is also consistent with several data points. The Russians, according to media reports and cybersecurity experts, targeted Burisma late last year for cyber collection and gained access to its emails. And Ukrainian politician and businessman Adriy Derkach, identified and sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for being a 10- year Russian agent interfering in the 2020 election, passed purported materials on Burisma and Hunter Biden to Giuliani. Our view that the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue is consistent with two other significant data points as well. According to the Washington Post, citing four sources, ``U.S. intelligence agencies warned the White House last year that Giuliani was the target of an influence operation by Russian intelligence.'' In addition, media reports say that the FBI has now opened an invesgation into Russian involvement in this case. According to USA Today, `` . . . Federal authories are investigating whether the material supplied to the New York Post by Rudy Giuliani . . . is part of a smoke bomb of disinformation pushed by Russia.'' We do not know whether these press reports are accurate, but they do suggest concern within Executive branch departments and agencies that mirrors ours. It is high time that Russia stops interfering in our democracy.

A P P E N D I X I ---------- Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for Kenneth L. Wainstein i&a's overt human intelligence collection program Question 1. Yes or no: Under Secretary Wainstein, are you aware that while DHS I&A used the OHIC program ``to gather information about threats to the U.S.'' the program also included directly questioning ``incarcerated people--circumventing their lawyers,'' which caused many DHS I&A employees to ``fear that they  breaking the law''? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2. Yes or no: Are you aware that these fears seemingly caused the temporary halting of ``the portion of the program involving interviews with prisoners who had received their Miranda rights''? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3. Yes or no: Are you aware that some field employees were ``worried so much about the legality of their activities that they wanted their employer to cover liability insurance''? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 4. Yes or no: will you assure the committee that DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis will not abuse its authorities and violate the Constitutional rights of Americans? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. homeland intelligence experts group and the homeland intelligence advisory board Question 1. There have been many questions surrounding the composition of the DHS Homeland Intelligence Experts Group. The group features many prominent figures who have been found to be overly political figures who have made false or misleading claims to promote their own agendas. These figures include James Clapper, John Brennan, Paul Kolbe, and Tashina Gauhar. On October 19, 2020, James Clapper, John Brennan, and Paul Kolbe signed a public statement attempting to discredit the New York Post's reporting on Hunter Biden laptop was a product of Russian disinformation. This story proved to be true, and it is perceived that these individuals used their positions of power to influence and censor a news outlet. Another member of the Homeland Experts Group, Tashina Gauhar, who previously served as an associate deputy attorney general for the Department of Justice, was extensively involved in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into baseless allegations that former President Trump's campaign colluded with Russia. Yes or no: Do you agree that it is reasonable to believe that these concerning actions by some of the members appointed to the group call into question the group's neutrality? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2. Yes or no: Are you aware that internal documents from the Experts Group show that it pursued ways for DHS to enhance efforts to collect intelligence on U.S. citizens, and reach ``local communities in a non-threatening way''?\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Miranda Divine, How Biden DHS `intel experts group' plotted to get `mothers and teachers' to report dissent, N.Y.

Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3a.

Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 6a. Yes or no: Isn't it true that on May 17, 2024, the Department announced the establishment of a Homeland Intelligence Advisory Board, which will advise your office on national and homeland security intelligence matters? Follow-up: How is it appropriate to shield an advisory board from the American public when your agency targets Americans and works largely with publicly-available information to do so? Answer.

Within any intelligence agency, ensuring the proper use of authorities and safeguarding the rights of citizens remain enduring priorities for oversight bodies. As you are aware, in September of last year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis has yet to fully enact measures designed to oversee compliance with policies aimed at upholding the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of U.S. individuals, encompassing citizens and lawful permanent residents.

Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. Follow-up: How does DHS I&A train its personnel to recognize and report potential misconduct, and what measures are in place to investigate and address such incidents? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. i&a's role to share information with sltt law enforcement agencies Question 1a. In March of this year, the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence convened a roundtable conversation titled ``Exploring the Role of DHS Intelligence and Analysis.'' The purpose was to involve pertinent stakeholders in discussions about I&A's position within the intelligence community, recent significant activities, its collaboration with Fusion Centers, and on-going restructuring efforts. This roundtable served as an informative platform, fostering broader conversations on the committee's commitment to your agency's success and strategies for enhancing operational effectiveness. I&A is the only IC element statutorily charged with delivering intelligence to our State, local, Tribal and territorial (SLTT) and private-sector partners and developing intelligence from those partners for the Department and the intelligence community. How does I&A prioritize and facilitate the sharing of intelligence among Federal, State, and local agencies? Follow-up: Regarding intelligence sharing, what specific mechanisms or platforms does DHS I&A utilize to ensure timely and effective communication with its partners across different levels of government? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. Follow-up: As under secretary for intelligence and analysis, how have you restructured your staff to create a collaborative and streamlined work environment within the DHS I&A? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1c. Follow-up: What feedback does your agency receive from these partners regarding the intelligence you are providing? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1d. Follow-up: What measures are in place to guarantee that the intelligence products and information you furnish are pertinent, precise, and up-to-date? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. i&a's outstanding on-going issues Question 1a. For years, I&A has engaged in abusive domestic intelligence practices targeting Americans' political views and regularly of little legitimate value. For instance, I&A has engaged in monitoring political views shared by millions of Americans by tracking ``reactions'' and ``reflections'' of people simply discussing politics on-line. In fact, Under Secretary Wainstein, you referred to I&A's recent failures as a ``rough patch''\5\ resulting in a thorough internal review to correct abuses. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ Ellen M. Gilmer, Homeland Intelligence Unit Marred by Missteps Gets Overhaul, Bloomberg Government (May 4, 2023), https:// about.bgov.com/news/homeland-intelligence-unit-marred-by-missteps-gets- overhaul-1/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes or no: Do you agree that I&A has faced challenges to responsibly accomplish its mandate across administrations? Follow-up: Yes or no: Isn't it true that you referred to I&A's recent challenges as a ``rough patch''? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1b. Follow-up: What did you mean by that statement? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1c. Follow-up: Yes or no: Do you agree that I&A has been engaged in abusive domestic intelligence practices targeted in Americans' political views? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1d. Follow-up: Yes or no: Will you commit to ensuring that I&A does not engage in practices that target Americans' political views? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 1e. Follow-up: Yes or no: Do you agree that DHS should establish an intelligence oversight office that is actually independent of I&A, and put policies in place to increase transparency and accountability? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. i&a's role to help address the surge of special interest aliens Question 1. A Special Interest Alien (SIA) is a non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Tens of thousands of people designated as SIAs have been detained at the U.S. Southern Border during the past 2 years, raising worries about the threat of SIAs illegally entering into the country. What has I&A's role been in addressing this surge, as well as the increase of Known or Suspected Terrorists illegally entering into the country? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2. Please describe in detail I&A's role in assisting DHS's efforts to screen and vet illegal aliens. Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 3. As the under secretary of I&A, what should Congress or the Department do to fix this challenge? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. social media collection on political views Question 1. If I&A's stance is that the agency does not target political views, what objective criteria do you use to distinguish political views from extremist views? By all accounts, it appears entirely subjective. Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2a. Is I&A's social media collection method and criteria written down in any policy? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2b. Follow-up: If so, would you be willing to share it with the committee and make it available to the public? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. i&a's shift from raw social media collection to situational reports Question 1. In your recent realignment, you announced that I&A would be shifting away from raw social media collection and emphasizing ``situational awareness reports'' and support to analysts. I&A targeted Americans talking about matters during the Dobbs decision. This was done in one of your ``SITREPs'' that you've committed to doing more of now. For those of us who care about free speech, this isn't much reassurance. How is this supposed pivot meaningful when it involves the same activities? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2. How many people does your office have performing an open-source collection function, even if they are not formally part of the open-source office--including Federal employees, contractors, collectors embedded with analysts, and the watch? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
