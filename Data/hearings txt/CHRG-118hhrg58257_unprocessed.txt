The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Mark E. Green (Chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Green, Higgins, Guest, Gimenez, Pfluger, Garbarino, Greene, Gonzales, LaLota, Ezell, D'Esposito, Luttrell, Brecheen, Crane, Thompson, Swalwell, Thanedar, Ivey, Garcia, Ramirez, Menendez, Suozzi, and Kennedy. Chairman Green. The Committee on Homeland Security will come to order. Without objection, the Chair may declare the committee in recess at any point. Before we begin today's hearing, I would like to take a moment to recognize the loss of our dear friend to all on this committee, Congressman Donald Payne, Jr. Congressman Payne was a fierce advocate for the people of New Jersey's 10th District. His legacy, along with his father's legacy, will serve as a reminder to us all of what it means to be a true public servant. I really appreciated the time that I got to work with Congressman Payne on the Colorectal Cancer Caucus. He was a fierce fighter against that disease. I now recognize for a moment the Ranking Member, Ranking Member Thompson, to honor the life and legacy of Representative Payne. Mr. Thompson. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. This morning, we remember the life of Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr., our colleague and friend. He was a union worker, a toll collector. He literally kept the buses of Essex County, New Jersey, running on time. He was an Essex County Freeholder, a Newark City Council member, a city council president. He was a Congressman, a statesman, a son, father, brother, and a husband. With a kind heart, a closet full of bow ties, and a wit as sharp as his suits, Congressman Payne brought people together. But he also fought for what he believed in. He gave a voice to the voiceless. He never wavered. He never backed down. While we mourn the loss of our colleague and friend, we know his legacy lives on. Congressman Payne's legacy lives on in the work he did in Congress, including right here in this committee, to make every child in every school in America safe. Because of Congressman Payne's advocacy, the Department of Homeland Security today reports to Congress on school security. Because of a law he authored, aptly named the Homeland Security for Children Act, the Department of Homeland Security must plan for children's unique needs during disasters. His legacy lives on in the hearts of his wife, Bea, and it lives on in the bright futures of his children, the triplets, Donald, Jack, and Yvonne. We pray for their peace and comfort at this difficult time. Congressman Payne served in Washington, DC, but his heart never left Newark's South Ward. Every moment he spent in the halls of Congress was in service to the people of Newark. Congressman Donald Payne, Jr., leaves a legacy to be proud of. May he rest in power and rest in peace. I yield back.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson May 15, 2024 remembering congressman donald payne, jr. (d-nj) This morning, we remember the life of Congressman Donald M.

Chairman Green. I ask that the Members of this committee join me in observing a moment of silence to honor Congressman Payne's memory.  Chairman Green. Thank you. The purpose of our hearing today is to receive testimony from State and local law enforcement officers on the hurdles that their law enforcement agencies face in keeping our communities safe. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Good morning. We're here today to honor and recognize law enforcement officers Nation-wide during National Police Week. While our Nation has always been grateful to our men and women in law enforcement, beginning in 1962 we officially began recognizing their bravery, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to public safety on the 15th of May. Supporting our men and women in law enforcement should not be reserved for one week out of the year. Our Nation should be grateful every day to this unique group of men and women who risk their lives for our freedom and who serve our communities with a distinct sense of duty and honor. There's a saying, that service is the rent we pay for living on Earth. Our men and women who protect us daily pay the ultimate service and, for far too many, the ultimate sacrifice. Last year, 136 law enforcement officers were tragically killed in the line of duty. This year, there's been 56 and countless others injured. Just a few weeks ago, April 16, Police Officer Michael Jensen of the Syracuse Police Department and Lieutenant Hoosock of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office in New York were both shot and killed while attempting to locate a subject who had led officers on a vehicle pursuit. Officer Jensen had served with the Syracuse Police Department 2\1/2\ years, and he is survived by his parents and sister. Lieutenant Hoosock served with the county sheriff's office for 16 years. He is survived by his wife and 3 children. I know for them and their colleagues this loss is incomprehensible. In early May, 4 law enforcement officers were killed in Charlotte, North Carolina, while attempting to serve a warrant to a convicted felon, and 4 more were injured. A former Durham- based Marshals Service task force officer stated that he cannot remember another time in his 35-year career when 8 officers were attacked in one incident. From violent attacks on law enforcement to significant increase in crime across the country, it is an understatement to say that Americans no longer feel safe in their communities. We must provide reassurance to law-abiding citizens by holding lawbreakers accountable and let the level of accountability serve as a deterrence to others. Tough prosecutions, proper sentencing are not only examples of holding criminals accountable for their actions, but they send a message that Federal, State, and local jurisdictions will do what is necessary to protect their citizens. Even more important, this action will communicate to our law enforcement officers our appreciation and our commitment to equipping them with the resources required to fulfill their duties. Increasing crime rates and obstacles to prosecuting criminals are challenging enough, but dealing with these difficulties without adequate manpower and funding adds to the burden that law enforcement agencies across the Nation are confronting. Law enforcement agencies are not only grappling with unprecedented challenges in recruiting new personnel but are also contending with attrition rates and budget reductions. These factors hinder law enforcement agencies' ability to fulfill their obligations to safeguard Americans and obstruct police departments Nation-wide from accessing the necessary resources to enhance their officer training. In so doing, these factors also increase the risk to the men and women in blue who risk all for us every day. By reducing law enforcement budgets, police departments will face the tough decision of either lowering standards or being unable to fulfill their hiring requirements. This committee plays a critical role in overseeing the Department of Homeland Security, which aims to assist State, local, and Tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies in ensuring the safety, security, and resilience of our communities. We continue to focus on ensuring that information is efficiently shared between the Federal Government and State and local law enforcement agencies to combat the wide variety of threats from criminals and terrorists. Different parts of our country have their own unique challenges when it comes to dealing with crime. It's important that we ensure that DHS is properly supporting both metropolitan and rural communities as they confront these challenges. Today, I hope we can examine the ways that DHS supports these law enforcement agencies and identify new ways to improve. We should all work to ensure that the resources provided by DHS are effective in assisting law enforcement as they work to carry out their important mission. Last, it's crucial that, as a Nation, we regain a sense of appreciation and respect for the men and women in law enforcement who serve our communities and who pay the ultimate sacrifice for our protections. We have a distinguished panel of witnesses to testify about the daily challenges, successes, and strategies their officers encounter in dealing with various issues within their departments and communities. Thank you again to our witnesses for being here this morning, and I look forward to this important discussion. Before I recognize the Ranking Member for his opening statement, I would like to welcome Mr. Kennedy from New York to Congress and to our committee. I look forward to working with you. I will say that your addition here takes us to 7 members from New York. I think you're now 21 percent of this committee. So, not sure what that means, but we're glad to have you. It actually, you know, reflects back to the start of this committee and really what started it all. So we're very glad to have you.  Statement of Chairman Mark E.

Thank you again to our witnesses for being with us this morning, and I look forward to this important discussion. Chairman Green. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Thompson, for his opening statement. Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our panel of witnesses for being here today and for their service to our country. In honor of National Police Week, I also want to recognize the incredible contributions of law enforcement and honor those brave officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our communities safe. Our Nation is forever in their debt. Today, the committee is meeting to examine how Congress can support State and local law enforcement. This is an important question. National Police Week is of great importance, but Congressional support for law enforcement is about more than attending a ceremony or wearing a blue ribbon on your lapel one week out of the year. It's about supporting law enforcement, not just with ceremonial words or symbolic gestures, but showing up when it counts and voting for the resources our police officers need every day. It's about saying ``no'' when a disgraced former President calls for defunding the FBI or certain Members threaten to cut off funding for DHS because they have political disagreements with the Biden administration. It's about keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of those who would seek to harm our communities, our kids, our houses of worship, our supermarkets, our gathering places, and the police sworn to protect all of us. It's about honoring the heroic law enforcement officers-- Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police, and others--who protected and defended this very Capitol and everyone in it on January 6, 2021. While extreme MAGA Republicans try to cut funding and undermine public trust in law enforcement, Democrats are committed to providing Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement with funding and support to keep our communities safe. Democrats have made historic investments in public safety, law enforcement, school security, gun violence prevention, and nonprofit security for churches, synagogues, and schools. As a result, violent crime has dropped across nearly every category during the Biden administration. We're proud of doing right by law enforcement, but recognize more remains to be done. I hope to hear from our witnesses today about supporting community policing efforts across the country and how Congress can help fund these critical efforts. I also hope to hear from our witnesses about how we can encourage police forces to recruit more diverse candidates, including people of color and women, because police forces work best when they reflect the communities they serve. Again, I thank the witnesses for joining us today and express my appreciation for all the men and women of law enforcement who serve communities across America with honor and integrity. Be assured that those words have been and will continue to be backed up by action. Before I close, Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to welcome, as you did, a new Member of our committee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Kennedy. While we have quite a few New Yorkers serving on this panel, as has already been said, Mr. Kennedy is the only one that represents a district in western New York. His district is located on the U.S.-Canada border and has multiple international crossings, including the Peace Bridge. I know he will be actively engaged on northern-border issues, and we welcome it. Mr. Kennedy also recently chaired the New York State Senate's Transportation Committee, which will be invaluable to his service on this committee's Transportation and Maritime Subcommittee. We welcome you, and we wish you well. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson May 15, 2024 I want to thank our panel of witnesses for being here today and for their service to our country.

Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee May 15, 2024 Chairman Green and Ranking Member Thompson, thank you for this hearing on ``Standing Strong on the Thin Blue Line: How Congress Can Support State and Local Law Enforcement''. I thank today's witnesses for their testimony: Hon. Gregory Mays, deputy commissioner, Department of Safety and Homeland Security, State of Tennessee; Hon. Michael L. Chapman, sheriff, Loudoun County, Virginia; Mr. Michael Bullock, president, Austin (TX) Police Association; and Mr. Rodney Bryant, president, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives *Democratic Witness*. As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, I have a body of legislative work that informs me on this topic. Annually Congress hosts National Police Week to recognize the important work of local, State, and Federal law enforcement in protecting communities and to honor those who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they served. This year, National Police Week runs from May 12 to May 18, 2024. This hearing is an opportunity to demonstrate our support for law enforcement and highlight their priorities and accomplishments around strengthening public safety, combatting gun violence, and funding community safety programs. This should be a time of unity and a rededication of our commitment to law enforcement officers--to make every effort to make their work safer and promote the importance of law enforcement as public servants. Unfortunately, Republicans talk about supporting law enforcement but have sought to defund law enforcement and undermine public trust in police. Law enforcement is on the front line of fighting crime in communities across the Nation. Crime rates after rising sharply during the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, violent crime in the United States has plummeted to a near-record low under President Joe Biden. In fact, the most recent FBI data show that crime in the United States has dropped across nearly every category under President Biden's leadership. The Biden administration and Congressional Democrats have prioritized investments in fighting and preventing crime, most notably through the American Rescue Plan's (Pub. L. 117-2) record $15 billion funding for public safety. Every Republican serving in Congress at the time voted against the American Rescue Plan. Despite Republican opposition to that landmark law and Republican calls to defund the police, Democratic investments in public safety have delivered results. Murders across the United States dropped by 13.2 percent between 2022 and 2023. In America's largest cities--those with populations greater than 1 million--violent crime dropped by 10.6 percent. The vast majority of homicides in this country are committed with firearms, as are the vast majority of suicide deaths. Although murders in the United States plummeted by around 13 percent in 2023--one of the largest national declines in history--gun violence continues to plague the United States. In 2020, the last year of the Trump administration, 19,613 Americans lost their lives due to the willful, malicious, or accidental discharge or a firearm. In 2023, that number dropped to 18,854, but gun deaths remain far too high. This is especially true in ``Red States'' that tend to have weak gun laws. red states, weak gun laws, and danger to law enforcement Weak gun laws endanger law enforcement officers. Between 2012 and 2021, 504 police officers in the United States were killed in the line of duty. Of those, 90 percent--or 456 officers--were killed by a firearm. A study by the Center for American Progress found that between 2017 and 2021, the rate of police officers fatally shot in States with the weakest gun laws was 152 percent higher than in States with stronger gun laws. Weak gun laws make everyone less safe. From 2000 to 2022, the average murder rate in States that reliably vote Republican in Presidential elections (''Red States'') was 24 percent higher than the average murder rate in States that reliably vote Democratic. In fact, so-called Red States' murder rates are ``significantly higher'' than reliably Democratic-voting States, ``even when  removed the county with the largest city in Trump-voting States (and kept them in for Biden-voting States).'' Weakening requirements to carry a concealed firearm increases gun violence and violent crime. Every State allows individuals to carry concealed weapons in public, but fewer than half of them require a permit. Specifically, by the start of 2023, 26 States allowed individuals to carry loaded, concealed handguns in public without first undergoing a background check, obtaining a license, or receiving any firearm training. It is important to note that gun-involved homicide rates are higher in States with more permissive concealed carry laws. Permitless carry laws, like those in Texas, pushed by Republican State legislatures put law enforcement officers at risk. When Indiana was considering a permitless carry bill in 2022, Patrick Flannelly, vice president of the Indiana Association of Chiefs of Police warned, ``What we have done now is we've taken away the one tool that police officers had out on the street to be able to act quickly and efficiently for not only their personal safety but for the safety of our communities''. Law enforcement across the country similarly have warned that permitless concealed carry laws put officers at risk. In fact, in 2021, almost 61 of 84 law enforcement officers who died from felonious assaults were killed by firearms. Reliably Republican- voting States that have permissive gun laws, specifically permitless carry laws, are putting law enforcement officers' lives on the line by sending them into communities that are increasingly flush with firearms. democrats back up their support for law enforcement with needed resources Although Republicans claim they support law enforcement, Democrats have implemented policies and reforms that will keep law enforcement and the communities they serve safer and more secure--often over Republican objections. In June 2021, the Biden administration unveiled its Comprehensive Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gun Crime and Ensure Public Safety. Overall, the strategy sought to: stem the flow of firearms used to commit violence, including by holding rogue firearms dealers accountable for violating Federal laws; support local law enforcement with Federal tools and resources to help address summer violent crime; invest in evidence-based community violence interventions; expand summer programming, employment opportunities, and other services and supports for teenagers and young adults; and help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities. On June 25, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The BSCA was passed in the wake of the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the State's deadliest school shooting, where 19 children and 2 teachers were killed. Key provisions of the BSCA include: Enhanced background checks: Requires the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct an enhanced review of purchasers under the age of 21 to determine whether juvenile records disqualify that individual from purchasing a firearm. NICS is given 10 days to complete the investigation, and it unsets after 10 years. State incentives for ``red flag'' laws: Provides $750 million over 5 years that will go to States for ``crisis intervention programs'' including red flag laws, mental health courts, drug courts, veterans' courts, and extreme risk protection orders. $250 million in funding for community-based violence prevention initiatives $300 million in school safety funding through the STOP School Violence Act to institute safety measures in and around schools, support school violence prevention efforts, and provide training to school personnel and students. Codification of the SchoolSafety.gov clearinghouse, which provides evidence-based resources to improve school safety. Prohibits use of funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to train or equip any person with dangerous weapons in schools. congress must act to address the law enforcement staffing crisis As the Ranking Member of our Crime Subcommittee, I am in support of H.R. 3325, the Recruit and Retain Act. This legislation will help law enforcement agencies in tangible ways by providing them with tools to help address the high rates of attrition that have plagued these agencies for years. Our Nation's law enforcement agencies are facing an unprecedented staffing crisis. Hiring efforts have been unable to keep pace with the high rates of attrition that we are seeing in police departments from coast to coast, and everywhere in between. According to a report last year by the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Community-Oriented Policing, factors such as community frustration with the policing profession, and concerns about officer safety and well-being, have contributed to this staffing crisis. It is unsurprising, then, that a 2023 survey of police departments showed that resignations have continued to increase every year since 2019, with responding agencies reporting nearly 50 percent more resignations in 2022 than in 2019. In my district in Houston, Texas, the problem goes back even further. We recently learned that staffing shortages resulted in over 264,000 cases--including 4,000 sexual assault cases--were never submitted for investigation, due to staffing shortages. We cannot allow this to continue. Our communities deserve more. Victims deserve more. The Recruit and Retain Act will attempt to remedy this problem by authorizing law enforcement agencies to use COPS grants to reduce the numerous fees that law enforcement applicants must pay. We will not get qualified men and women in uniform if they cannot afford to even apply to a police department. The Recruit and Retain Act also will encourage voluntary partnerships between agencies and local elementary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of higher learning, including historically black colleges and universities, for students interested in careers in law enforcement. Partnership activities will include dedicated programming for students; work-based learning opportunities; mentoring; community liaisons; career and jobs fairs; job shadowing; and internships. These activities will help law enforcement agencies recruit talented applicants who reflect and respect the communities they serve. This, in turn, will help earn back the trust of those communities-- making all of us safer. I would prefer for this bill to include the minimum qualification and training standards that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act would require. I also think we must do more to address the mental health challenges that officers inevitably face, due to the harrowing nature of their work. We cannot expect qualified officers to remain in such a dangerous profession if we do not give them the resources they need to address the toll that police work takes on them. We cannot wait any longer to address the law enforcement staffing crisis. We must act now to help police departments across the country recruit and retain the officers they need to keep our communities safe. I invite my colleagues across the aisle to join me in this effort to support local and State law enforcement. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Green. I'm pleased to have an important panel of witnesses before us today. I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise their right hand.  Chairman Green. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. I'd like to now formally introduce our witnesses. The Honorable Gregory Mays serves as the deputy commissioner of homeland security for the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Mays had a distinguished career with the United States Secret Service, serving in a variety of roles that spanned a 25-year career. He holds a bachelor's degree from Auburn University, where he received his commission as an officer in the United States Navy through the Navy ROTC program. Following Naval flight officer training, Mr. Mays was assigned to Patrol Squadron FIVE, where he was designated a patrol plane mission commander and completed multiple deployments, including numerous missions in support of Operation Desert Storm. Sheriff Mike Chapman was first elected chair for Loudoun County, Virginia, in 2011 and was reelected to his fourth term in 2023. He directs the largest full-service sheriff's office in the Commonwealth of Virginia and employs approximately 700 sworn deputies and 200 civilian personnel and serves a population of approximately 447,000 residents and an area of 519 square miles. Sheriff Chapman has been a leader in advancing proactive and successful law enforcement and community engagement programs. During his tenure, major crime decreased 37 percent, the greatest reduction of any jurisdiction in the Washington metropolitan area. He has also successfully led efforts in addressing the heroin and, most recently, fentanyl problems that have impacted Loudoun County. Mr. Michael Bullock currently serves as the president of the Austin Police Association. During his time as president, he has worked to address the recruiting and retention problems that have affected the Austin Police Department. President Bullock is a 6-year veteran of the Austin Police Department. Mr. Rodney Bryant serves as the president of the National Black Law Enforcement Executives. Prior to his work with the National Black Law Enforcement Executives, Mr. Bryant served 34 years in the Atlanta Police Department. During his career, he climbed the ranks, serving as a patrol officer, senior police, sergeant, lieutenant, assistant commander, and major. Highlights of his career include leading the command of the College Football Playoff Championship in 2018 and Super Bowl LIII in 2019. He retired in 2022 as the 25th chief of the department. I thank all of the witnesses for being here today. I now recognize Deputy Commissioner Mays for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF GREGORY MAYS, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF HOMELAND SECURITY, TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF SAFE- TY AND HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Mays. Thank you, Chairman Green and Ranking Member Thompson, for holding this hearing and for the invitation to testify with my fellow law enforcement leaders on some of the critical law enforcement and security issues facing the American homeland. The Tennessee Office of Homeland Security is a law enforcement agency with State-wide jurisdiction. Our primary mission is to investigate threats to life, threats to our schools, to protect our State's critical infrastructure and major events, and to work with our Federal, State, and local partners to prepare for and mitigate any threat to our State. Our department's overall mission is to serve, secure, and protect the people of Tennessee, and we set about every day to accomplish that mission. As we gather here today during National Police Week to honor the fallen police officers across our Nation, it's also a time for us to discuss--or, to focus on the challenges faced by local law enforcement and the threats to our homeland. My testimony will focus on three areas to highlight some successes and challenges. I thank you again for the opportunity to be here. I would like to start with security in our schools. On March 27, 2023, Nashville was rocked by a shooting at The Covenant School. Three children and 3 adults lost their lives, in addition to the shooter, who was killed by police while she was still shooting at arriving officers from a second-story window of the school. This shooting, so close to home, further steeled our resolve to do everything we can to prevent something similar from happening again. We approach school security in Tennessee by focusing on 3 main areas: Physical security--door locks, et cetera. Sometimes the simple solutions are the best. Second, we must have proper response and training so that our officers respond properly, just as the Metro Nashville Police Department did at the Covenant shooting. Third--perhaps the most complex--we must investigate every credible threat and evaluate the subject's capability and intent to act violently. Research such as the U.S. Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center study published in 2021 titled ``Averting Targeted School Violence'' looked at 67 different averted school attacks. Ninety-four percent of the school shooters told somebody they were going to do it. The other 6 percent in that study were behaving so oddly that someone else reported them. So we can take away from that that, in all cases, we, the collective community, need to have our ears turned and be listening and then respond when threats come to our schools. We encourage this type of reporting, and the Tennessee Office of Homeland Security operates a 24/7 threat desk. Since the start of this school year, we have received approximately 322 threats to Tennessee schools. That amounts to a little over one threat to a Tennessee school every day. In the interest of time here, I'd like to pivot now to the subject of grants. Tennessee has benefited greatly from our Federal Homeland Security Grant Program. Funding for these State and territorial preparedness grants has dropped 44 percent since fiscal year 2010, with a 10 percent cut alone in fiscal year 2024. We rely on these programs--State and local law enforcement do. These grant programs save lives. As an example, on July 31, 2023, a suspect attempted to gain entry to the Margolin Hebrew Academy in Memphis with the apparent intent to kill those inside this Jewish school. After unsuccessful attempts to gain entry through locked doors, the subject fired shots outside the school and fled. He was encountered by police a short distance away and was taken into custody after brandishing a weapon. The school credited the recent security upgrades as saving lives. They wrote a letter to my office, and I want to read just a couple of sentences from it. ``The implementation of the latest security grant''--and he's talking about the Nonprofit Security Grant from DHS--``The implementation of the latest security grant allowed us to reinforce our entrances with new doors and access control, ultimately preventing the shooter from gaining entry. Additionally, the cameras installed from the previous grant played a pivotal role in assisting law enforcement in locating and neutralizing the shooter swiftly.'' Again, these grant funds save lives. As Federal funding for these programs decline, the needs are increasing. In Tennessee, we do not rely just on Federal funding for the nonprofit grants; we have a State-funded program. As an illustration of how much of a need there is, last year we received $2.2 million in requests, far outstripping the $750,000 in State funds that I had to award. In the interest of time, sir, I'll conclude my testimony there. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Gregory Mays May 15, 2024 Thank you, Chairmen Green, and Ranking Member Thompson for holding this hearing and for the invitation to testify with my fellow law enforcement leaders on some of the critical law enforcement and security issues facing the American homeland. The Tennessee Office of Homeland Security is a law enforcement agency with State-wide jurisdiction. Our primary mission is to investigate threats to life, threats to our schools, protect our State's critical infrastructure and major events, and to work with our Federal, State, and local partners to prepare for and mitigate any threats to our State. Our Department's overall mission is to serve, secure, and protect the people of Tennessee. We set about every day to accomplish our mission in several ways: Homeland Security employs a cadre of Homeland Security special agents across the State--at least 1 in each of our 95 counties. These law enforcement officers focus on threats to our schools and critical infrastructure and regularly conduct behavioral-based threat assessments. Our Homeland Security special agents come from varied backgrounds and bring a depth and breadth of experience to their mission to serve and protect Tennesseans. Homeland Security partners with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to co-direct the Tennessee Fusion Center--a team effort of local, State, and Federal law enforcement, in cooperation with the citizens of the State of Tennessee, for the timely receipt, analysis, and dissemination of terrorism information and criminal activity relating to Tennessee. Homeland Security helps to facilitate the distribution of Federal grant funding every year from the DHS Homeland Security Grant Program. Since inception in 2003, DHS has seen over $280 million come to Tennessee and go toward projects designed to make Tennesseans more secure. I'll speak more about these grants in a moment. Tennessee Homeland Security maintains a cybersecurity expertise focused on Homeland Security issues at the State and local level by providing training and assisting in responses to cyber-related incidents. Tennessee Homeland Security maintains a close watch on our State's Critical Infrastructure. DHS has designated 16 different Critical Infrastructure sectors ranging from Energy to Financial to Agriculture to Transportation. All these sectors are vital to our State. We work with law enforcement and our stakeholders to determine vulnerabilities and mitigate the threat. And last, but certainly not least, Tennessee Homeland Security partners with local law enforcement, the Tennessee Department of Education, local school districts, the mental health community, juvenile court systems, and communities around the State to keep our children safe by helping to develop and conduct security assessments at our State's K-12 public schools and investigate threats before they materialize on the school's doorstep. As we gather here today during National Police Week to honor the fallen peace officers across our Nation, it is also a time for us to focus on the challenges faced by law enforcement and the threats to our homeland. My testimony will focus on 3 areas to highlight some successes and challenges. Thank you again for the opportunity to be here. I would like to start with security in our schools. On March 27, 2023, Nashville was rocked by a shooting at the Covenant School. Three children and 3 adults lost their lives in addition to the shooter who was killed by police while she was still shooting at arriving officers from a second story window of the school. This shooting so close to home further steeled our resolve to do everything we can to prevent something similar from happening again. We approach school security in Tennessee by focusing on 3 main areas of concern: First, physical security such as door locks, cameras, barriers, access control procedures--sometimes a simple solution works best. Second, proper response protocols must be in place and exercised. If a tragic event does happen, law enforcement must be trained to respond appropriately and stop the killing. School students and administrators must be trained and have a plan to shelter in place or evacuate as appropriate. All these plans must be exercised regularly--a new State law in Tennessee requires it. We saw in the Covenant shooting the rapid and professional response of officers from the Metro Nashville Police Department. There is no doubt the bravery and rapid response of the officers saved lives that horrible day. The third focus of concern is perhaps the most complex. We must investigate every credible threat and evaluate the subject's capability and intent to act violently. Research such as the U.S. Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center study published in 2021, titled ``Averting Targeted School Violence'' looked at 67 averted school attacks. The study found 94 percent of school shooters told someone they were going to do it. The other 6 percent in the study were behaving so oddly that bystanders reported them. So, in all these cases, we see that law enforcement officers, educators, mental health counselors, and concerned community members must be listening and ready to report and act on any threatening behavior or statements. The Office of Homeland Security partners with schools to encourage this type of reporting. Of course, some kids feel more comfortable communicating electronically. So, In Tennessee, we instituted the SafeTN App to allow students (or members of the community) to anonymously report threatening behavior. The app also provides resources for anyone contemplating suicide or self-harm. The Tennessee Office of Homeland Security operates a 24/7 threat desk where these incoming calls for help or action are acted upon immediately. As I mentioned earlier, the Governor of Tennessee proposed, and the TN General Assembly funded, a Homeland Security Special Agent in each of Tennessee's 95 counties to help coordinate the multi-agency approach to school security and to conduct these behavioral-based threat investigations. Tennessee's local law enforcement officers play a critical role in school safety by acting as School Resource Officers (SROs). Last year, the Governor proposed, and General Assembly provided, funding to place 1 SRO in each of Tennessee's K-12 public and charter schools. This grant funding is managed by the Office of Homeland Security and is available directly to law enforcement agencies to hire, train, and equip law enforcement officers to serve in the important SRO role. Of the $140 million allocated on July 1, 2023: Over $101 million has been awarded upfront for salary, benefits, training, and equipment. 154 law enforcement agencies applied and were funded. 1,356 schools are covered by this State grant. As of 3/31/24, 1,309 of 1,356 schools were staffed with an SRO (97 percent). Is this approach to school security working? Although we don't claim to have solved the issue of school security, we are seeing positive results. For example, in the fall of 2023, Homeland Security agents, working with local Sheriff's Deputies, began an investigation of a student who had come to school in full tactical gear and made a bomb threat. The investigation indicated that subject had a fascination with the military, weapons, and explosives and that he also fantasized about killing people. Further investigation revealed the subject owned several knives and smoke grenades. Information was discovered that revealed the subject was frequently a victim of bullying by other students. A search warrant of the subject's cell phone showed evidence of making threats of being a terrorist, a member of the Taliban, conducting a school shooting, and shooting police. The subject underwent a court-ordered mental evaluation where he was determined to have homicidal tendencies. The subject was admitted to a mental health facility for further evaluation and care. We work a significant number of cases just like this one. Since the beginning of this academic year--approximately August 1, 2023--the Office of Homeland Security has logged over 322 threats to schools in Tennessee--or more than one threat to a school every day. And this number reflects only those threats which are known to us--either reported through our reporting mechanisms or reported by schools directly to us, or reported by local, State, or Federal agencies to us. We do not know the actual total number of school threats in the State because the local schools and law enforcement agencies are not required to report them to us. The problem is big. Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our children. Law enforcement will continue to prioritize the security of our schools. I would now like to pivot to the subject of grants. Tennessee has benefited greatly from the Federal Homeland Security Grant Program since its inception in 2003. As you know, 3 individual grant programs make up the Federal Homeland Security Grant Program: State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI)--Nashville area only Operation Stone Garden (for border States). Federal funding for these State and territorial preparedness grant programs (SHSP, UASI, and Operation Stone Garden) has dropped 44 percent since fiscal year 2010--including a 10 percent cut alone for fiscal year 2024. These programs that States and territories rely on for homeland security funding have all seen declines. On top of the decline in aggregate dollar amounts, given inflation, the purchasing power of each dollar provided has dropped more than 20 percent since 2014. These grant programs are a very worthwhile endeavor and we have had much success responding to man-made and natural disasters because of them. For example, in the immediate aftermath of the Nashville Christmas Day bombing in 2020, which damaged a piece of critical infrastructure and shut down 9-1-1 communications centers in the region, equipment acquired through the HSGP such as command posts, alternate communications equipment, rescue equipment, and training for responders was deployed and aided in the Response and Recovery efforts. With much of the equipment acquired through this program at the local level, it has served multiple functions for man-made and natural disasters and has created enduring capabilities in all of Tennessee's 95 counties. Another very important Federal grant program is the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). This program provides support for target hardening and other physical security enhancements for nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of a terrorist attack. In Tennessee, requests for funding under this program have skyrocketed from 10 applicants in 2019 to 103 applicants last year--a ten-fold increase. This year's application process is currently open and expected to see increases in applicants from last year. These grant funds have saved lives. On July 31, 2023, a suspect attempted to gain entry into the Margolin Hebrew Academy in Memphis with the apparent intent to kill those inside this Jewish school. After unsuccessful attempts to gain entry through locked doors, the subject fired shots outside the school and fled. He was encountered by police a short distance away and was shot and taken into custody by police after brandishing a weapon. The school credited recent security upgrades with avoiding tragedy. Specially, the school wrote a letter to my office crediting the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). The letter read in part, ``I want to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to both of you for your invaluable support in securing and administering the NSGP for enhancing our security measures. The implementation of the latest security grant allowed us to reinforce our entrances with new doors and access control, ultimately preventing the shooter from gaining entry. Additionally, the cameras installed from a previous grant played a pivotal role in assisting law enforcement in locating and neutralizing the shooter swiftly.'' Again, these grant funds save lives. And as Federal funding of these programs declines, the needs are increasing. In Tennessee, the need to help protect our non-profits and houses of worship does not rely on Federal funding alone. The Tennessee General Assembly recently allocated money for a new State grant program for nonprofits and houses of worship. Like the Federal nonprofit grant, we have seen a sharp increase in requests for these limited funds. In the fiscal year 2023 State program, we received over $2.2 million in requests, far outstripping the $750,000 of State funds we had available to award. Finally, I'd like to speak briefly about an emerging threat to Tennessee and our Nation where we need help from the Federal Government. Part of my role as deputy commissioner for homeland security is to evaluate the potential for future threats and take mitigation measures now to protect Tennessee. When I peek over the horizon to anticipate what may be coming, one challenge I see is weaponized Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones. The proliferation of drones has become a problem from a security and law enforcement perspective. While the Federal Government has taken steps to regulate use of drones and to some degree license users, little is available for State and local law enforcement in the way of countering drones that may be used as a method of attack. It's no secret this drone threat is real. Drones can be used to smuggle payloads, transport contraband, and carry lethal payloads or other weaponized materials. We've seen weaponized drones recently in the war in Ukraine, and in attacks on Israel. In the United States, we've seen an increasing number of drones in sensitive locations. For example, last fall, in 2 higher-profile instances, a drone flew over an Ohio State football game, as well as a Baltimore Ravens playoff game. In Tennessee, we saw drones flying over public gatherings and causing safety concerns for law enforcement aircraft in the area. Since drones are classified as aircraft by the FAA, only certain Federal agencies, including DHS and DOJ, currently have the legal authorization to mitigate threats from UAS. While many States have taken steps to regulate where drones can be flown, States do not have the authorization to mitigate a drone in-flight--they can only monitor its flight path and penalize those who fly in prohibited areas. I believe the probability of a weaponized drone attack in the United States should be a top priority for all of us who hold positions of responsibility for the security of our Nation's homeland. I ask this committee to prioritize Counter-UAS (C-UAS) for funding and expanded cooperation with States in this area. I have mentioned several times today the importance of partnerships. Law Enforcement in Tennessee and around the country take pride in working together to support each other under very difficult conditions. These partnerships--which are crucial to success--were never more evident to me than on Christmas Day 2020 when a vehicle- borne explosive device was detonated in downtown Nashville, all but destroying a city street. Only a few hours after the explosion, I found myself standing in the rubble on 2nd Ave and observing Federal, State, and local law enforcement all working together to determine what happened and why. The partnerships, information sharing, and preparedness funding contributed to quickly identifying the perpetrator, confirming he was deceased, and later confirming that he acted alone. As the deputy commissioner of Tennessee's Office of Homeland Security, keeping the people and places in Tennessee safe and secure is on my mind every day. Our dedicated group of highly-experienced law enforcement and public safety personnel always stand ready to serve, secure, and protect the people of Tennessee. But a single law enforcement or public safety agency cannot do it alone. We need each other. We need the support of the U.S. Congress and the support of the American people. I thank you once again for the opportunity to be here today. Chairman Green. Thank you. I now recognize Sheriff Chapman. Thank you, sir. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL CHAPMAN, SHERIFF, LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA Sheriff Chapman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the committee. My name is Mike Chapman. I'm the elected sheriff of Loudoun County, Virginia. I appreciate being invited to testify at this important hearing during this, one of the most important weeks of the year for law enforcement. Loudoun County sits about 30 miles southwest of Washington, DC, and is home to about 450,000 residents. I am in my 46th year of law enforcement, having served as a police officer and detective in Maryland, 23 years at the Drug Enforcement Administration as a special agent from coast to coast and in 3 foreign assignments, and over 12 years as an elected sheriff of Virginia's largest full-service sheriff's office, employing close to 900. Prior to being elected sheriff, I served 3 years as a law enforcement subject-matter expert with Booz Allen. I bring first-hand knowledge of police work, Federal experience, the private-sector perspective, and the complexities associated with the elected office of sheriff. I'm here today on behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association and serve as its chair for homeland security and on its board of directors. I'd like to address today's hearing, ``Standing Strong with the Thin Blue Line: How Congress Can Support State and Local Law Enforcement.'' Historically and currently, law enforcement collaborates well together regardless if it is a sheriff's office or police department. When national law enforcement organizations collectively present their concerns and positions, whether in support or opposition, to legislation, Congress needs to listen. Congress's decisions can significantly impede law enforcement's service, performance, investigations, or even recruiting. Supplying grant money or funding is not the cure- all. Backing from Congress in all aspects is essential. This is National Police Week as America honors the day-to- day service and sacrifice of our law enforcement community. On this day, Peace Officers Memorial Day, we honor those who have given their lives in the line of duty. This year, we have already witnessed 58 line-of-duty deaths among law enforcement officers, with 23 of those by gunfire. Our job is dangerous, and we need to help serve and protect our communities and ourselves. We ask that you recognize how law enforcement has and continues to raise the bar. The progress that I have witnessed since I was hired to be a police officer back in 1978 when it comes to training, professionalism, innovation, and best practices is nothing short of amazing. It is important that you recognize the progress and publicly show support--your support for our profession. It is also important that you listen so that you can help us do our jobs better. Let's start with intelligence gathering and police response. Currently, there are 80 State or locally-run fusion centers in 50 States and U.S. territories. They receive Federal grant funding, which accounts for about one-third of the cost of operation. There is also Federal, State, and local coordination through 6 strategically-placed Regional Information Sharing Systems, RISS, centers across the United States. Considering that local law enforcement are the boots on the ground, it is critical that Federal information flows quickly in our direction, even if the information is incomplete. The responsibility for this communication and coordination primarily falls under the Department of Homeland Security Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, and is the only Federal entity that is statutorily required to coordinate homeland security threat information sharing with State and local law enforcement governments throughout fusion centers. Congress should ensure that I&A is equipped and empowered to carry out that mission effectively. In Loudoun County, I experienced a personal case study with DHS regarding poor communication, both laterally and with other Federal agencies and on-ward to State and local agencies. In February 2022, I was made aware of some 1,000 evacuees from Afghanistan that would be arriving in Loudoun County in 2 weeks as part of Operation Allies Welcome following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. This would be the first wave during a 6-month period, all to be located at the National Conference Center, a dorm-style living facility in a suburban residential area of our county next to a middle and a high school. I immediately reached out to the DHS's chief of staff for additional information and to question their lack of notification earlier to local law enforcement and our public safety partners. We needed to know how well the evacuees were vetted, if the local hospital had been contacted, if school personnel and community members living within walking distance in that community were notified, if any houses of worship had been contacted, if language capability services had been retained, and how security would be conducted. Unfortunately, none of these concerns had been addressed. DHS subsequently postponed the resettlement for 2 weeks, still not addressing these issues. I alerted the public and organized a community stakeholders meeting, including dozens of agencies, which led to specific assignments and a community forum that, for the most part, alleviated the apprehension to this of the community. Our local initiative made a huge difference. For the next 6 months, potential chaos was averted and there were no major public safety incidents. This extraordinary effort, however, would not have been necessary had DHS communicated an organized plan. We hope that this will improve in the future. Today, we face a new set of challenges on many of our college campuses and cities over matters regarding the Middle East. It is critical that we receive timely information from DHS to get ahead of the curve. We need your help. We need your backing. We need improved communication from DHS to our local officers and deputies. Thank you again for holding this hearing and for listening.

Thank you, Sheriff Chapman. I now recognize Mr. Bullock for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL BULLOCK, PRESIDENT, AUSTIN POLICE ASSOCIATION, AUSTIN, TEXAS Mr. Bullock. Chairman Green, Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. My name is Mike Bullock, and I'm the president of the Austin Police Association in Texas as well as a senior police officer with the Austin Police Department. I wish it were amidst better times that I sat here before you today, but the somber week of honoring our fellow law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty sets the tone for the state of our profession. In my view, the state of law enforcement is dire. We all recognize that criminal justice, as a whole, is a complex policy issue for which no singular solution exists. But if we continue to do nothing, the sense of lawlessness being perpetuated in urban city centers and across the country will only get worse. Austin is the 10th-largest city in the United States, with a million people living in the capital of Texas. Despite this, we don't even make the top 25 list when it comes to staffing. We are 700 officers short of where studies done by the city of Austin have shown we need to be. Our staffing issues can be linked to a few key events, though our struggles are shared by agencies all across the country. In 2017, the Austin City Council unanimously voted against a contract with the Austin Police Association, which governs the wages, benefits, and working conditions of the men and women of the Austin Police Department. As a result, beginning in 2018, we have had more officers leave our department each year than have joined. Compounding this problem, in 2020 was when our city leaders defunded our department by $150 million, cut 150 authorized positions, and canceled cadet classes, all for the sake of political posturing. Our staffing has been in a free fall that has led us to a vacancy rate of over 30 percent. Little surprise, then, that after these decisions and an exodus from the department began, a year later our number of homicides nearly doubled. The last 3 years have been the highest homicide numbers in Austin's history. Though we are not a border city, the impact of immigration policies is felt by us as well. Our city has asked for help from the Texas State Troopers, who came for a time and had a notable impact on crime by increasing patrol presence. But due to the on-going border crisis, they were called away to help secure the Texas border and no longer able to help us in Austin. As a result, in May 2023, teenagers shot and killed a man in southeast Austin when attempting to rob him. The reason they gave for this heinous crime was they knew State Troopers had left Austin and they decided to start committing crime again. Adding additional layers of complexity to this issue is a lackadaisical attitude toward holding criminals accountable by judges and prosecutors, while at the same time seeing those same prosecutors target officers, which in turn has encouraged criminals to be increasingly violent toward law enforcement. Over these same time periods, we have seen a myriad of critical incidents take place. Austin has dealt with a serial bomber planting improvised explosive devices all across our city, killing our residents. We've had numerous mass shootings, including one breaking out during one of our largest festivals that draws people from all across the country to visit our city. Most notably on our minds is an incident that took the life of one of our own. On November 11, 2023, in the early morning hours, our APD SWAT team was called to a residence in southeast Austin where an armed subject was barricaded inside the residence. He'd already stabbed one of his family members, with 2 more held hostage inside, and he had shot at officers when they had initially responded. Fearing for the lives of others inside the residence and knowing this vile suspect had already attempted to kill one of his own family members and willingly shot at our fellow law enforcement officers, our SWAT team went through the door to try and save lives. After going in, they were met by a hellacious barrage of gunfire from the suspect, who was well-armed and wearing body armor. While the suspect was ultimately killed, it came at a high price. Two of our officers were shot, one of which was Officer Jorge Pastore, who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Across this country, we now see a law enforcement officer shot in the line of duty every 21 hours. This year alone, we've had over 145 officers shot, which has been increasing year over year. Our job is to uphold the Constitution and enforce the laws passed by yourselves as well as your State and local counterparts. This is a charge that we take seriously and one we are willing to sacrifice our lives for. I sit here before you today, though, pleading for your help. We need help in addressing our staffing needs, support in enforcing our laws, providing better training resources, and transcending the political rhetoric to end the war on law enforcement and restore law and order in our country. The trends we see in Austin are not isolated, and if not reversed, I fear that lawlessness is all but inevitable. Again, thank y'all for your time and for taking up this important matter, Mr. Chairman.  Prepared Statement of Michael Bullock May 13, 2024 Chairman Green, Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. My name is Michael Bullock and I'm the president of the Austin Police Association in Texas as well as a senior police officer with the Austin Police Department. I wish it were amidst better times that I sit here before you today, but this somber week of honoring our fellow law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty sets the tone for the state of our profession. In my view, the state of law enforcement is dire. We all recognize that criminal justice as a whole, is a complex policy issue for which no singular solution exists. But if we continue to do nothing--the sense of lawlessness being perpetuated in urban city centers and across the country will only get worse. Austin is the 10th largest city in the United States with a million people living in the capitol of Texas. Despite this, we don't even make the top 25 list when it comes to staffing. We're 700 officers short of where studies done by the city of Austin have shown we need to be. Our staffing issues can be linked to a few key events, though our struggles are shared by agencies across the country. In 2017 the Austin City Council unanimously voted against a contract with the Austin Police Association which governs the wages, benefits, and working conditions of the men and women of the Austin Police Department. As a result, beginning in 2018 we have had more officers leave our department each year than have joined. Compounding this problem in 2020 was when our city leaders defunded our department by $150,000,000, cut 150 authorized positions, and canceled cadet classes all for the sake of political posturing. Our staffing has been in a freefall that's led us to a vacancy rate of over 30 percent. Little surprise then that after these decisions and an exodus from the department began, that a year later our number of homicides nearly doubled. The last 3 years have been the highest homicide numbers in Austin's history. Though we are not a border city, the impact of immigration policies is felt by us as well. Our city has asked for help from the Texas State Troopers who came for a time and had a notable impact on crime. But due to the on-going border crisis they were called away to help secure the Texas border and no longer able to help us in Austin. In May 2023, teenagers shot and killed a man in southeast Austin when attempting to rob him. The reason they gave for this heinous crime, was they knew State Troopers had left Austin and decided to start committing crime again. Adding additional layers of complexity to this issue is a lackadaisical attitude toward holding criminals accountable by judges and prosecutors, while at the same time seeing those same prosecutors target officers, which has in turn encouraged criminals to be increasingly violent toward law enforcement. Over these same time periods we've seen a myriad of critical incidents take place. We have dealt with a serial bomber planting improvised explosive devices across our city killing our residents, had numerous mass shootings including one breaking out during one of our largest festivals, and most notably on our minds is an incident that took the life of one of our own. On November 11, 2023 in the early morning hours, our APD SWAT team was called to a residence in southeast Austin where an armed subject was barricaded inside the residence, had already stabbed one of his family members with 2 more inside, and shot at officers. Fearing for the lives of others inside the residence and knowing this vile suspect had already attempted to kill one of his own family members and willingly shot at our fellow APD officers--our SWAT team went through the door to try and save lives. After going in they were met by a hellacious barrage of gunfire from the suspect who was well-armed and wearing body armor. While the suspect was ultimately taken out it came at a high price. Two of our officers were shot, one of which was Officer Jorge Pastore who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Across this country we now see a law enforcement officer shot in the line of duty every 21 hours. This year alone we've had over 145 officers shot which has been increasing year over year. Our job is to uphold the Constitution and enforce the laws passed by yourselves as well as your State and local counterparts. This is a charge we take seriously and one we are willing to sacrifice our lives for. I sit here before you today though pleading for your help. We need help in addressing our staffing needs, support in enforcing our laws, providing better training resources, and transcending the political rhetoric to end the war on law enforcement and restore law and order in our country. The trends we see in Austin are not isolated--and if not reversed, I fear that lawlessness is all but inevitable. Chairman Green. Thank you, Mr. Bryant, for your testimony-- or, I'm sorry, Mr. Bullock, for your testimony. I now recognize Mr. Bryant for his 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF RODNEY N. BRYANT, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES Mr. Bryant. Good morning, Chairman Congressman Mark Green, Ranking Member Congressman Bennie Thompson, and committee Members. I bring you greetings on behalf of the executive board, members, and constituents of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, NOBLE. My name is Rodney Bryant, and I am the national president. NOBLE serves as the conscience of law enforcement by being committed to justice by action. NOBLE has 58 chapters and represents over 4,500 members world-wide that consist of chief executive officers, command-level law enforcement officials, and Federal, State, local, and county law enforcement agencies and criminal justice practitioners. I have served more than 35 years in the law enforcement profession in various positions of increasing responsibilities, to include serving as a patrol officer and ascending all ranks to become the 25th chief of police of the city of Atlanta. It is an honor for NOBLE to provide written testimony on the topic of ``Standing Strong on the Thin Blue Line: How Congress Can Support Local Law Enforcement.'' I would be remiss if I did not recognize that this week is National Police Week, where we honor and remember those law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In 2023, approximately 136 officers died in the line of duty, representing a 40 percent reduction compared to 2022. However, one officer is one too many. NOBLE will continue to stand vigilant and in solidarity with law enforcement in an effort to reduce the statistics. We invite Congress to join us in this ``NOBLE'' pursuit. On April 29, our Nation experienced the deadliest attack against U.S. law enforcement officers since 2016. An AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a 40-caliber handgun were deployed in a Charlotte, North Carolina, shooting that resulted in 4 law enforcement officers being killed and wounding 4 others. I extend heartfelt prayers and condolences to the officers, families, agencies, and affected communities. NOBLE is very concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States and, specifically, the correlation between violence and the proliferation of assault weapons and high- capacity ammunition magazines. It is our organization's opinion that violence, particularly gun violence, is a public health issue. As with all public health issues, it demands a comprehensive, nonjudgmental, pragmatic, evidence-based approach to saving lives and reducing injuries. A positive step toward addressing the level of gun violence in our Nation was taken with the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. NOBLE supported this legislation. The bill combined gun safety legislation with mental health and school security resources. We at NOBLE recommend that, in addition to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, that Congress, the law enforcement profession, and communities across this Nation work to secure the passage of bipartisan legislation that, at minimum, will address the following: mandate universal background checks, ban assault weapons, ban high-capacity magazines, and mandate safe gun storage. It is NOBLE's belief, and many in our profession, that the continued relaxation of gun laws poses a real danger to the law enforcement officers and the community. It is my opinion that the law enforcement profession is in need of comprehensive Federal legislation, such as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. NOBLE did support the Biden administration's Executive Order on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety. There are key elements in the order that we feel are responsible and actionable, such as accountability, work force support, use of force, and resources support for mental health and behavioral health services. Our organization recommends to Congress a bipartisan effort to find common ground on a very basic Constitutional right within the Fourteenth Amendment: equal protection under the law. For many parts of our society, citizens have not felt equally protected by a key American institution--law enforcement. In many communities of color, the first names of unarmed citizens that were killed by officers, who took an oath to protect and serve, resonate today and for generations to come. Last, I appeal to our Congressional leaders on both parties to continue to support our Federal law enforcement agencies in the areas of funding, public support, and policies that ensure that they maintain their readiness. It is critical that Federal law enforcement resources are available to support State, local, county, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. There must be a unified Congressional understanding of the importance of ensuring homeland security for our Nation, which equates to strengthening all levels of public safety. On behalf of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, I thank you for supporting our profession and our ability to maintain public safety. Our members stand ready to meet the needs of our communities and Nation. Thank you again for this opportunity to provide testimony.  Prepared Statement of Rodney N. Bryant May 15, 2024 Chairman, Congressman Mark Green MD, Ranking Member, Congressman Bennie Thompson, and committee Members, I bring you greetings on behalf of the executive board, members, and constituents of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives--NOBLE. My name is Rodney Bryant, and I am the national president. NOBLE serves as the conscience of law enforcement by being committed to Justice by Action. NOBLE has 58 chapters and represents over 4,500 members worldwide that consist of chief executive officers and command- level law enforcement officials from Federal, State, county, municipal law enforcement agencies, and criminal justice practitioners. I have served more than 35 years in the law enforcement profession in various positions of increasing responsibility to include serving as patrol officer, senior police, sergeant, lieutenant, assistant commander, major, and as the 25th chief of the Atlanta Police Department. It is an honor for NOBLE to provide written testimony on the topic of ``Standing Strong on the Thin Blue Line: How Congress Can Support Local Law Enforcement.'' I would be remiss if I did not recognize that this week is National Police Week where we honor and remember those law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In 2023, approximately 136 officers died in the line of duty representing a 40 percent reduction compared to 2022. However, one officer lost is one too many.

On April 29, our Nation experienced the deadliest attack against U.S. law enforcement officers since 2016. An AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and a 40-caliber handgun were deployed in a Charlotte, NC shooting that resulted in 4 law enforcement officers being killed and wounding 4 others. I extend heartfelt prayers and condolences to the officers' families, agencies, and affected communities. NOBLE is very concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States, and specifically the correlation between violence and the proliferation of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. It is our organization's opinion that violence--particularly gun violence is a public health issue. And, as with all public health issues, it demands a comprehensive, nonjudgmental, pragmatic, evidence-based approach to saving lives and reducing injury. A positive step toward addressing the level of gun violence in our Nation was taken with the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. NOBLE supported this legislation. The bill combined gun safety legislation with mental health and school security resources. Bipartisan Safer Communities Act Highlights: Increases funding and improves mental health, school safety, crisis intervention, and anti-violence programs. Requires tougher background checks for younger gun buyers, those who are deemed a risk in certain cases, and closes the so-called ``boyfriend loophole,'' barring intimate partners who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against their significant other from having a gun even if they don't live together. We at NOBLE recommend that in addition to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, that Congress, the Law Enforcement Profession, and communities across this Nation work to secure the passage of bi-partisan legislation that will at minimum address the following: Mandate Universal Background Checks Ban Assault Weapons Ban High-Capacity Magazines Mandate Safe Gun Storage Relaxation of Gun Laws such as Permitless Carry which exist in 29 States. It is NOBLE's belief and many in our profession that the continued relaxation of gun laws poses a real danger to law enforcement officers and the community. Key Statistics 2023 Mass Shootings--Approximately 656 Mass Shootings Firearms Number No. 1 Killer of Children (ages 1-17) In 2023, Firearms-related officer deaths accounted for 35 percent of the 136 officers killed in the line of duty. Studies have shown that officers are significantly more likely to be fatally shot in States with weaker gun laws and higher levels of gun ownership. It is my opinion that the law enforcement profession is in need of comprehensive Federal legislation such as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. NOBLE did support the Biden administration's Executive Order on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety. There are key elements in the order that we feel are reasonable and actionable such as accountability, workforce support, use-of-force, and resource support for mental/behavioral health services. Our organization recommends to Congress a bi-partisan effort to find common ground on a very basic Constitutional right within the 14th Amendment--Equal Protection Under The Law. For many parts of our society, citizens have not felt equally protected by a key American institution, law enforcement. In many communities of color, the first names of unarmed citizens that were killed by officers, who took an oath to protect and serve, resonate today and for generations to come. Their names are Tamir, Eric, Breonna, George, to name a few. Last, I appeal to our Congressional leaders of both parties to continue to support our Federal law enforcement agencies in the areas of funding, public support, and policies that ensure that they maintain their readiness. It is critical that Federal law enforcement resources are available to support State, county, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. There must be a unified Congressional understanding of the importance of ensuring homeland security for our Nation which equates to strengthening all levels of public safety. On behalf of the law enforcement leaders and constituents of NOBLE, I thank you for supporting our profession and our ability to maintain public safety. Our members stand ready to meet the needs of our communities and Nation. Thank you again for this opportunity to provide testimony. Chairman Green. Thank you, Mr. Bryant. Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. First, I'd like to start with Mr. Mays. You mentioned, I think, 3, sort-of, avenues of approach, so to speak, to use a military term, through which you guys are working on school safety. You talk specifically about response and training. Can you describe some of the training that you're talking about and the net effect and where DHS and the Federal Government are assisting in that area? Mr. Mays. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the question. We learned--as a Nation, we learned after the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting what a bad response looked like. We know from these shootings that law enforcement needs to respond and go into the school immediately and stop the killing, right? We saw in Nashville at the Covenant School shooting, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department officers went in immediately. It was interesting for me to find out that most of those officers did not know each other and had never trained together, but yet their training in the police department, under Chief Drake's leadership, was so good that, if you watch the body camera video, it looks like they train together every day. So training works. The procedures that need to be in place are now pretty universal through a system called ALERRT. It's an active-shooter-response-type training. School resource officers are trained in this. Police officers are trained. Homeland Security agents in Tennessee are trained in this response. We believe that that's a key part of school security. But much more important, I think, or just as important as the response is not waiting until danger is at the doorstep. As I stated in my written testimony about the averted school attack study, we hear a lot of information about a planned school attack. We must go out and confront that threat and determine whether there is capability and intent before it ends up on the doorstep of the school. Chairman Green. I think FLETC recently came to the State and did a little bit of training. Was that helpful? Do you know about their trip to Tennessee and what they did? Mr. Mays. I do not, Mr. Chairman. I'm not familiar with that particular trip. Chairman Green. I think they may have worked with THP on that. Thank you. Mr. Bullock, you described the impact of budgets and budget cuts and the mass shortage of officers. What's the impact on the other officers on the force, you know, stress-wise, you know, marriages, things like that, for these huge shortages of personnel? Mr. Bullock. It takes a tremendous mental toll on officers. Just as an example, because of the severe shortages that we are experiencing, officers who are assigned as a detective that should be investigating major crimes, like homicides, robberies, things of that nature, are having to work patrol shifts. So they are being sent back to patrol---- Chairman Green. Wow. Mr. Bullock . And are diverted away from their assigned duties as an investigator in order to take 9-1-1 calls. So they're having to do that on a regular-rotation basis each quarter. So that does have a significant impact, as you mentioned, on mental health. It has an impact on family life. It adds another layer of unpredictability to an already unpredictable job. So we do see an increase in officers who may have issues at home, that may deal with, you know, alcohol use, a variety of others things that come as a result of increased stress. Chairman Green. What about the rhetoric, sort-of, that there's been? It's died down a little bit, but, you know, over the--maybe a year or two ago, this whole, you know, ``defund the police'' thing, how has that impacted morale of the force down at the--as we'd say in the Army, soldier level--but at the officer level? Mr. Bullock. Yes. For, as you put it, kind-of, for the boots on the ground, it has a pretty devastating impact, as well, because you feel like you are not valued for what you're being asked. You're asked to be willing to give of your life in the defense of others, and those who are responsible for providing resources to do the job you're being asked to do are seemingly pushing you to an unvaluable role. So, from that aspect, it does have an impact as well. I will say, even though we have seen to a degree some of those funds restored, we do see some shell games that get played with that nonetheless, where the funding may seemingly be restored but yet it's a responsibility that wasn't necessarily given back to the department. So we're given the funds back, but it's not actually going to areas where we need it to go in order to recruit, retain, and provide the resources for officers to do their job. Chairman Green. Thank you. I now yield, and I recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Thompson. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. One of the questions, comments, that ran through everyone's opening statement was the threat of violence that occurs in this country, and most of those threats have occurred with the use of firearms. Some of us advocate universal background checks for people who own guns. I'm a hunter. I try get in the woods every chance I get, and every now and then I get lucky and bring something home. But I don't have a problem with whatever the requirements are to own that gun. So, you know, I'm a law-abiding gun owner. So I'd like to ask each witness their position on universal background checks to be able to purchase a gun. Mr. Mays. Mr. Mays. Thank you, Ranking Member Thompson, for the question. Whether it's background checks or extreme risk protection orders, whatever may be necessary, we would like to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. I've spent my career, both in State law enforcement and as a Secret Service agent, encountering people who are suffering from mental illness, people who are homicidal, people who are delusional, and they have guns. We have very little tools available to take the weapon away. I'm not too worried about law-abiding citizens like yourself who go hunting. Mr. Thompson. Sure. Mr. Mays. It's people who are of limited capacity or have bad intentions. This is where the mental health piece and the law enforcement piece need to work better together. I've encountered people over my career who are admitting to me that they're mentally ill and they're depressed, and he's holding a pistol in his hand, and I have to call his dad to come up and try to talk the guy out of the pistol, to give it to his dad, because I have no way to take it away from him. Mr. Thompson. Yes---- Mr. Mays. These are the kind of challenges I have. Mr. Thompson . I understand. Let me just say that what we did for the Federal people in DHS, we passed a specific piece of legislation to help with the mental health of those people. Because we talked to the family members and other people who were distressed. Sheriff, can you address that? Sheriff Chapman. I have a large agreement with my colleague here. I think the biggest problem isn't so much--it's the people that are criminals that get the guns. They don't necessarily get them, purchase them properly and the way they should, with the background checks. We do have background checks, obviously, in the Commonwealth of Virginia. But I'd have to know the details, quite frankly, of exactly what you mean by ``universal background check.'' I think a lot of that is already done within the Commonwealth of Virginia. But my biggest concern is the fact that a lot of these weapons are stolen. They're stolen or used in crimes. So you can--you know, you can do whatever you want; the fact of the matter is, I think we've got to hold these people accountable that use guns in crimes and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law, rather than constantly trying to change laws that are really only going to impact the honest citizen buying a gun. So---- Mr. Thompson. Well, Sheriff, we won't debate it, but an honest citizen can get a gun. Sheriff Chapman. Right. Mr. Thompson. I'm just saying that if there's a dishonest citizen--and it may be 5 percent, 2 percent--that's one of those steps we can do to mitigate that. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. I'd like to hit on what Sheriff just said, which is, a large part of what we deal with is stolen firearms. I certainly understand the question about universal background checks. Coming from Texas, you know, we definitely like our guns as well. I think that efforts are probably best spent in holding people accountable that are breaking the law very actively, including people that are knowingly using stolen firearms. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. Likewise, many of my colleagues, I think that universal background checks will assist us in the issues that we're seeing. In many instances, with the level of proliferation of guns that we're seeing on our streets, any aspect that can allow us to minimize what we're seeing would be beneficial not just to the citizens but to the law enforcement officers as well. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much. One more question. On January 6, thousands of angry supporters, who were whipped into a frenzy by the former President, marched on the White House to the Capitol, where they broke a police barricade, smashed windows, and assaulted police officers in an attempt to obstruct the democratic process. Over 140 officers protecting the Capitol were injured that day. Five police officers died in the days and weeks following. Mr. Mays, do you agree that this violence against police officers was unjustified? Mr. Mays. Absolutely. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Sheriff. Sheriff Chapman. Any violence against police officers doing their job should not be--should--should not be allowed in any sense of the word. So I agree that anybody should be--that does that should be fully prosecuted. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. I take the same stance. Anyone that commits violence toward law enforcement should not be tolerated. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. I agree that any violence against police officers lawfully doing their job should not be tolerated. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chair. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Mississippi and the Vice Chair of the committee, Mr. Guest, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To our witnesses, thank you for being with us this morning. Chief Bryant, before we begin, I was wondering if you could give the committee an update, if you have any, on the 3 officers in Atlanta who were shot over the weekend. Mr. Bryant. Absolutely. Thank you so much for inquiring. All 3 are in recovery. I spoke to the chief immediately after that incident occurred. He has continued to update me as a courtesy to inform me that they are improving. Thank you so much for asking. Mr. Guest. If you will please send along to those officers and the members of that department that our thoughts and prayers are with them during their period of recovery, and they will particularly be remembered this week. As we look at the headlines--I pulled some very brief headlines in preparation for today's hearing. I just put in in the search engine ``officer-involved shooting.'' One came up: 3 a.m. this morning, ``New Mexico State Police and Roswell Police Department investigating an officer-involved shooting that left a Roswell police officer injured.'' A headline from May 12: ``Police identify a man shot dead by law enforcement after opening fire in Amazon warehouse.'' The article says, ``West Jefferson police have identified a man killed by police Sunday. The gunman was fatally shot by law enforcement after he shot a Columbus police officer.'' Also a headline from May 12: ``Euclid police officer dead after `ambush' shooting.'' The first paragraph said, ``A first- year Euclid police officer in his 20's was shot dead Saturday night in what authorities describe as an `ambush' after officers responded to a disturbance on East 211th Street.'' We referenced and just spoke of the 3 Atlanta police officers who were shot and injured this weekend as they responded to a call involving an armed gunman. I think it was mentioned in at least one, if not several, of the opening statements by the officers of the shooting that happened in late April in Charlotte, where we had 4 officers killed and 4 other officers who were wounded in that particular incident. So my question--and I'll start with you, Mr. Mays. Are law enforcement officers, are they safer today than they were 3 years ago? Mr. Mays. Thank you for the question. That's a tough one to answer. I have a sense that it's worse out there on the streets. That's--I don't wear a uniform every day, so I get that information from talking to my fellow officers---- Mr. Guest. I'm not asking you to explain why you feel ``yes'' or ``no,'' but just, you know--and, again, I'm not--I'm just asking for your opinion because you're deputy commissioner and you're involved every day. Do you feel that law enforcement officers are safer today than they were 3 years ago, yes or no? Mr. Mays. No. Mr. Guest. Sheriff. Sheriff Chapman. No, I don't. In fact, the FBI just reported yesterday that 79,000 law enforcement officers in 2023 were assaulted, and that's a 10-year high. So what that shows is an increase in assaults on law enforcement officers. So, to answer your question, whether they're safer, we certainly are better well-equipped and can save lives much better than we did in the past, but, for sure, they're not as safe as they were in the past. Mr. Guest. Yes. Very quickly, because I've got a couple other questions, Mr. Bullock, do you believe officers are safer than they were 3 years ago? Mr. Bullock. No, sir. Mr. Guest. Chief, do you believe they're safer than they were 3 years ago? Mr. Bryant. As we see the increase in violence against police officers today, I would have to say no, due to the increases. Mr. Guest. OK. And thank you for your answers. Two of the things I want to focus on, very quickly--and I probably will only have the time to focus on one. First is the open-border policies that we see. I know that was referenced particularly in your testimony, Mr. Bullock, about some of the challenges that you're seeing because of that. Though not referenced in other testimony, I believe that we can say that the open-border policies has put a strain on law enforcement. But the other thing I want to touch on very briefly is rogue prosecutors. I know particularly as it relates to you, Mr. Bullock, there has been some allegations, in the media, not by you, about the prosecutor there in Austin. But I want to read this headline and talk on this very briefly. This kind-of encapsulates both. This is a CNN article. It says, ``7 people indicted in connection with assault on NYPD officers outside migrant shelter, officials say.'' The article--which is dated, for the purpose of the record, it's February 8. The article says, ``Seven people have been indicted in connection with an assault last month on two New York  police officers near Times Square, and authorities  are working to identify three other were involved.'' ``The indictments come in a case that's drawn attention in part because of the  status of at least some of the defendants and because four of those named in the indictment were released last week without bail.'' Are rogue prosecutors--do they pose a risk to law enforcement in general? I'll let you answer just ``yes'' or ``no'' very quickly because I'm over time. With that, I will yield back. Mr. Mays. Yes. Sheriff Chapman. Yes. Chairman Green. The gentleman--the gentleman yields. Mr. Guest. Well, can they answer the question? Chairman Green. Yes, go ahead. Sure. Mr. Guest. So if each of you wouldn't mind answering the question, then I'll yield back. I apologize for being over time. Chairman Green. Yep. Go ahead, sir---- Mr. Mays. Yes, sir. Chairman Green . Briefly. Sheriff Chapman. Yes, I agree. Mr. Bullock. Absolutely. Mr. Bryant. Not just to police, but to the community as a whole, yes. Mr. Guest. Thank you very much. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Swalwell, the Ranking Member on our Cybersecurity Subcommittee. Mr. Swalwell. Police Week is always a bittersweet week in Washington, DC. We remember the fallen, those who have given their lives in the service of their community over the last year, but also it's a time for fellowship and brotherhood and sisterhood of the profession to come together in our Nation's capital. Just, first, want to honor the service of those who we lost last year. I want to thank each of you for your service and wanted to just go through a couple of different incidents that this committee has focused on, or this Congress has focused on, and just get your perspective. Do you agree, Mr. Mays, that the officers who defended the Capitol on January 6 are heroes? Mr. Mays. Yes, sir, I would agree. Mr. Swalwell. How about you, Sheriff Chapman? Sheriff Chapman. Anybody that puts their lives on the line to make sure that they're keeping people safe is a hero to me. So I would agree that anybody that was assaulted certainly by the rioters were heroes. Mr. Swalwell. How about you, Mr. Bullock? Mr. Bullock. I would stand by the same words; any officer that puts on this uniform lawfully their duties is a hero in my book. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. I am in concurrence that anybody puts on this uniform and honorably serves out their career is a hero. Absolutely. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Mays, if you assaulted or physically harmed an officer on January 6, does that make you a criminal? Mr. Mays. Anyone that assaulted an officer on January 6 and then is arrested and convicted is a criminal. Yes, sir. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Chapman. Sheriff Chapman. An assault on a law enforcement officer is a crime. So, yes, that would be a criminal. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. The same. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. I'm in agreement that you become a criminal. Mr. Swalwell. By the way, I support legislation on the Judiciary Committee that would make assaulting or committing a battery against a law enforcement officer a separate class of crimes. I hope we can---- Chairman Green. Will the gentleman yield for just a second? Mr. Swalwell. Yes. Chairman Green. They do that in Tennessee. Mr. Swalwell. Good. We should do it Federally. Thank you, Chairman. One last question as it relates to January 6. Do you believe that anyone who is convicted of harming an officer on January 6 is a hostage? If they're in prison for that? Mr. Mays. No, sir, I do not. Mr. Swalwell. Sheriff. Sheriff Chapman. I don't really understand the question. Mr. Swalwell. I don't either. Do you believe that calling a January 6 convict a hostage is appropriate? That if they're in prison that they're a hostage? Sheriff Chapman. I would say that anybody that assaulted a law enforcement officer that was charged with it and is going through their legal processes, the appropriate action is being taken. Mr. Swalwell. Great. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. Regardless of the event, if someone is charged with a crime, all those due process and is convicted, they are a convicted criminal, not a hostage. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. I do not consider someone who was arrested for assaulting a police officer a hostage. Mr. Swalwell. Great. I also just want to point out that there are some on this committee, not all, certainly not the Chairman, who have advocated for defunding the FBI. Do you think we should defund the FBI, Mr. Mays? Mr. Mays. No, sir. Mr. Swalwell. Sheriff. Sheriff Chapman. No, sir. I have a son that is an FBI, so no. I want to keep him employed. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. No, sir. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. No. No, sir. Mr. Swalwell. So I just want to have some real talk with you all and some of my colleagues. Because I'm the son of a cop. My brothers are cops. I was a prosecutor. Law enforcement for our family is not a career, it's a way of life. It's about putting the bad guys away and keeping the community safe. So to me when I hear some of my colleagues again, not all of them, but some of them on this committee thump their chest and say they back the blue. But then they're going to call January 6 convict a hostage. That's not backing the blue, that's backing the coup. When some of them say that they back the blue, but the second the blue raids the house of their preferred candidate for President, that's not backing the blue, that's backing a fool. So I'm all about supporting law enforcement and honoring them during Police Week. But we got to be consistent. Police don't give a rip about politics. They just want to serve the community. They want to be independent and free of politics. We should back them every time they do their job, expect the highest amount of accountability, but not just expect them to wear red team, blue team when it suits them. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Gimenez, the gentleman from Miami, Florida, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Gimenez. Thank you. Thank you very much. I know most of you probably know that I was a firefighter for the city of Miami. But probably most of you don't know that I was a special officer that actually served on the SWAT team of the city of Miami Police Department. So while I rode a red fire truck, I also every once in a while, especially during difficult times, I also rode with the police department. So I honor the 4 of you for your service in public safety and the police department. When I was the mayor of Miami Dade, I was also the Sheriff of Miami Dade. One of the things that I did was after the incident in Paris, France, I mandated that all my officers, patrol officers, et cetera, will be equipped with AR-15s and enhanced body armor. Is that something which is normal in the United States, and do you think that we should protect our police officers, you know, more? If we are asking them to take their lives and put it at risk, should we as a either community or a country also give them the protection that they need in order to carry out their tasks? So I'll ask the 4 of you, is this something normal, or is this something a little bit unusual? Mr. Mays. Thank you for the question, sir. Protecting law enforcement officers is essential, and that comes in the form of equipment, including the body armor, the rifles, all the weapons, the radios, less than lethal force methods, everything they need. It also includes the training, all of it together, they need to be properly equipped. Mr. Gimenez. But is that normal? Is that--are the officers in this country sufficiently protected across the Nation, or is that something which is jurisdiction by jurisdiction? Mr. Mays. I don't know that I can answer for the entire Nation. I can say in the State of Tennessee, it is generally jurisdiction by jurisdiction, and it depends on funding. Mr. Gimenez. Fair enough. Sheriff Chapman. I would agree it's jurisdiction by jurisdiction. I served in Miami with the Drug Enforcement Administration. So I know how dangerous it was, certainly, during the cocaine wars down there. I think we do need to be equipped well. We need to be able to define ourselves against very violent criminals out there. But that does come down to a jurisdictional issue and how those communities feel about how the police or law enforcement officers in those areas should be equipped. Mr. Gimenez. Yes, and I was on a SWAT team during the cocaine wars. So, next. Mr. Bullock. I would say that's probably not the normal. I'd say in Austin, every officer is not equipped with an AR, nor are they all certified to use one per se. As well as us getting enhanced body armor is not standardized. They'll carry it on them all time. It will always be on their person. Mr. Gimenez. Would you want that? Mr. Bullock. Absolutely. Mr. Gimenez. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. Thank you. As a representative of law enforcement, not just nationally, but in internationally, I can tell you that it goes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There is not an equal level of distribution, nor an equipment or training. So we have to improve upon that nationally. Mr. Gimenez. All right. My second question is that Director Wray has informed us that because of the openness of the border, that he expects or he has apprehensions about a possible terrorist attack here in the United States. Because, frankly, there is about 2 million people. We haven't the faintest idea where they came from, who they are, where they are, or why they're here. Do you all have the same kind of apprehensions that Director Wray has? Mr. Mays. Yes, sir, I do. Very concerned about people coming across the Southern Border, and we don't know where they are, and we don't know where they're going. Sheriff Chapman. That absolutely concerns me, yes. Mr. Bullock. I would also agree, we deal with on a regular basis, interacting with individuals who have no form of identification that we know who they are. Mr. Gimenez. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. Yes, we trust the information being provided to us by Director Wray, and so I'm in agreement with it. Mr. Gimenez. Do you feel that the Federal Government is giving you enough in the terms or in the area of intelligence to be able to protect your jurisdictions, to the best of your ability, in light of the fact that Director Wray leaves that there is a great threat to the homeland from terrorists unknown to us? Mr. Gimenez. Anyone? Go ahead. One at a time. Mr. Mays. Yes, sir. We are not getting all of the information that would be helpful. We--the Federal Government is apparently unable to tell us how many immigrants are coming to Tennessee, where they're going in the State, where they came from. We don't have that information. We--so if I don't even know how many are coming and where they're from, then how can I begin to understand what kind of threat they pose to my State. Sheriff Chapman. We have a good relationship with the Federal counterparts. Any information we get is more at a personal, personal contact. But I would say as always, that communication could be better. Mr. Bullock. We're probably a little bit more different in that we have issues with our local officials that tend to try to restrict our use of information that is trying to be passed on to us; very accessible to us. Mr. Bryant. Having a strong relationship with our Federal partners is essential to what we do. However, we do recognize that there is a level of continuous challenges around intelligence and information. Mr. Gimenez. Thank you again for your service, and I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Ivey, the gentleman from Maryland, for his 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for calling this hearing today. And I appreciate the panel of witnesses as well. Deputy Commissioner Mays, I was especially impressed with your testimony. I thought it was right up the alley of the types of things that we can do here on the committee and things that we should hear about. Your points about the school shootings I thought was very helpful. One thing I did have a question about, you mentioned, I think, it was 94 percent, there is an opportunity to preempt some of these shootings because we have information that somebody's planning on doing it, and, you know, 94 percent of the time. I wonder if you can elaborate a bit on things that you think we could do, especially here in Congress, to help address that. Mr. Mays. Thank you for that question. Those study numbers are compelling. In the intact, the National Threat Assessment Center study that I referenced in my written testimony is not the only one. There are multiple studies. Again and again, they tell us that most attacks on schools, targeted violence as it were, there is a pathway to violence. If we can get involved and get the shooter off that pathway to violence, we have a chance at stopping something from happening. Unfortunately, there's no real shortcut. It's a roll-up- your-sleeves and get out there and talk to the person and intervention. It's a multidisciplinary team approach. I think, certainly, the U.S. Congress could help by more funding for those type of programs. Just last year in Tennessee, the multidisciplinary threat assessment approach in each school prior to last year was--it was permissive, but not required. A new State law has made that a mandate. So part of the Governor's initiative to put a Homeland Security agent in each of Tennessee's 95 counties is specifically to help coordinate that multidisciplinary approach which is needed. I hope that answers your question. Mr. Ivey. Yes, it does. It does. I might follow up with you afterwards as well. I did want to--actually, I forgot to welcome our new Member, Representative Kennedy, from New York. I take the Chairman's point that we're close to having a quorum for New York delegation meetings here on the committee, but certainly welcome you. I do want to make a point, too, with you, Mr. Chairman, and my colleagues here. I had a chance to go out and visit the Secret Service facility, which is in my district where they do training. Some of the training they do--and I take the point from some of the testimony today about how important training can be--so I was quite surprised to see that our Secret Service doesn't have a facility for training on protecting the White House. So when they took me out to show me what they do, they took us to an open field, literally, and they said, imagine the tree line at the back is the White House, and the road that we're on would be Pennsylvania Avenue. They did the demo, you know, with people coming in. You know, the dog went out and intercepted them, and all of that. But it was like playing pickup football. You know, as a kid, you know, the pine tree is the touchdown line. That's what they're doing, actually, to prepare for attacks on the White House. So one of the things I'd like to ask at some point, we--not today, obviously. But I hope that's the kind of thing that we can take a look at and try and figure out ways to help them get some kind of environment where they can do some training. The best they can do right now is--Tyler Perry built a mock White House for a movie or something back--so they fly them down there and use this mock White House, which obviously isn't the same thing as the real thing and certainly wouldn't be the kind of place that you'd want to do training to protect the President of the United States and the family. But that's what they've got right now. So I would love to have a chance to--for us to take a look at that as a committee and see if there is a way to step up on that front. Then, finally, let me end with this, National Police Week-- and I thank the Chairman, again, for holding a hearing on the topic. I thank all of you for the service that you provide, the risks that you've taken, the sacrifices you and your families have made, and for police officers around the country and their families as well. I was a local prosecutor. I first got elected in 2002. Before I took office, 2 police officers were gunned down trying to serve a warrant for a mental health issue. It was in the guy's parents' house. They didn't know that he had a firearm. So there's the guns issue. There's mental health issue. I think those are the kinds of things we need to talk about more as we move through these. But thank you to you and law enforcement officers around the country for the sacrifices you make and the work that you do to protect the country and our communities. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. It sounds like rock drill, doesn't it? Strange. I now recognize Mr. Gonzales, the gentleman from Texas, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, gentlemen, for your service to our country. Thank you for the men and women that serve alongside you that this committee is-- committee is committed to making sure that you have all the tools you need to be successful and keeping Americans safe. In particular, I want to thank Mr. Bullock. You know, Justin Berry is a good friend of mine; an officer there in Austin. I hear a lot about kind-of behind the scenes what's happening. In many cases, I feel as if you're serving behind enemy lines. I want to take this opportunity to really tear into the Travis County District Attorney. I think that guy has done a terrible job. I think that individual has made that community unsafe. Those type of situations need to go away. We need to get back to everybody is on the same team, paddling in the same direction for the safety of all citizens, not this ideology or the other. My question is to you, sir, in recent years, rogue prosecutors have brought radical ideas on how to approach our criminal justice system. Where you see prosecutors refusing to prosecute offenders and allowing low-bond amounts for violent criminals. We've seen criminals posted bond that end up committing more violent crimes; in some cases, shooting police officers and endangering the community. This is a dangerous trend and tells communities that there are no real penalties for breaking the law. My question to you, Mr. Bullock, is what are some of the tools that States or Congress might be able to use to reel in some of these criminal-friendly prosecutors? Mr. Bullock. Well, thank you, sir. It undoubtedly is an issue we deal with. You know, it's the enforcement aspect is the biggest part where laws are passed, laws are in place, but yet we have individuals that decide on their own not to enforce those laws. I think that some opportunities are what Congress is already looking at. In particular when officers are targeted, that that becomes a Federal crime because then we tend to have these working relationships with U.S. Attorneys that do prosecute those crimes, along with a lot of other drug crimes that we have. For example, we just recently in Austin had almost 80 overdoses of fentanyl that resulted in the 9 people dying. Then we had between EMS and APD over, I believe it was over 300 doses of Narcan that was administered within a single weekend. Yet, we have a prosecutor who drops unilaterally any possession of a controlled substance under a gram. That can be a lethal dose of fentanyl. So any efforts that would strengthen prosecution that make sure that crimes are actually enforced and prosecution is fallen through would be extremely beneficial. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you. This is certainly getting a whole lot more attention here on Congress. Because I feel as if you are doing your part of the job. You are putting the uniform on. You are going to work. You are once again trying to protect your community. Then when you pass that ball off to the prosecuting standpoint, in some cases, you have people that are throwing the ball the other way, and it's not getting down the field. I recently introduced the Cops Act. One of the things that I thought was interesting on it, and I'd love to get your take, is the Cops Act includes any attack against a police officer to include explosive materials, such as fireworks and other dangerous weapons. We always talk guns. We always talk about a police officer getting shot in line of duty. What I am starting to see is this morph into something else. You know, these criminals, these rioters, they're using fireworks, they're using, you know, bottles of water that have been frozen. So once again, are you seeing an increase in other than kind-of firearms--this is for Mr. Bullock--other than firearms, are your officers under attack with these other areas? Mr. Bullock. Yes, other things that you mentioned such as fireworks are being used, high-powered lasers are an issue as well. We have even recently discovered of a dry chemical that can be thrown on officers that burns and it causes--it could be potentially lethal, depending upon how it's treated. So these are all things we are having to prepare for now that it is not just firearms that are a threat to law enforcement. Mr. Gonzales. I see this growing, and I also--we have to get ahead of this. It can't just be firearms when a police officer gets a firearm. My last question is for your, Sheriff. I lean on sheriffs heavily. I have nearly half of the overall Southern Border. One of the questions I want to ask is a little bit more blocking and tackling is license plate readers. In many cases, what I hear from my sheriffs is license plate readers are a game- changer. They include--you're able to find more information and get an aspect of it. So just in general, what is your thoughts on interacting license plate readers and the data along that into your county? Sheriff Chapman. License plate readers are critical information that helps us solve crimes up and down the coast, anywhere in the area. It gives us a heads-up on anything that might have been like a crime that already past occurred in like a neighborhood where we can go back in and track it, license plate reader, and see who might have been in the neighborhood. Then you can get yourself a suspect and possibly prosecution based on something as simple as that. So they're critical to what we do. We need to have them. We need to have access to that information. It really does help us quite a bit. Mr. Gonzales. Thank you, Sheriff. I yield back, Chairman. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Garcia for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of you for your service as well. I was mayor of Long Beach before I got to Congress for the last 8 years. So I worked with our police department, obviously, very closely. I'm really proud of the men and women that served in Long Beach and police departments across the country. I also want to thank them for working in those 8 years to focus on also issues that I believe made the Long Beach Police Department focus on issues around diversity, around equity, around community policing, and other initiatives that really make our police department inclusive of the community. Now, we know that law enforcement and keeping people safe shouldn't be a partisan issue. I hope people understand that when we talk about supporting police, we need to follow through on that support in Congress through real actions not just partisan messaging bills. Police officers actually need the tools to do their jobs. They need training. They need technology. Of course, we need to make sure that we can hire and recruit talented people into our police departments. That also includes and means Federal funding. Now Mr. Bryant, would it support State and local law enforcement to actually defund Federal support programs for community policing? Mr. Bryant. Absolutely not. Many of our agencies work together within a type of ecosystem that we are relying upon one another. So any defunding of our Federal agencies will have a significant impact on our local enforcement agencies as well as we typically have TFOs on part of those organizations. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, sir. I'm assuming you're familiar with the COPS Federal funding program as well. Mr. Bryant. That's correct. Mr. Garcia. Which, as we all know, if you ask any police department across the country, particularly those in urban large cities, they're critical for our police departments. You know, 80 percent of the Majority have signed onto a budget which actually eliminates and reduces funding for our COPS Federal program for police departments. I think it's really important that we keep that funding, that we support law enforcement across the country in places like Long Beach and across America. Now, Mr. Bryant, I also wanted to show you this graph, and I think it's very important. As mayor, we would track data. This is data that comes from police departments from across the country. As you can see here, there was a surge of homicides 30 percent to the highest level of the 90s here in 2020. And overall, we know that violent crimes and homicides have been decreasing over the last few decades, even though some like to scare folks and act like somehow we are in this massive crime wave that we have never seen. We know that is just actually not true. But in 2020, when we do see a small increase, who was President? In 2020? Mr. Bryant. In 2020, it was President Trump. Mr. Garcia. That's right. So if you look at the graph where the overall crime was decreasing, we see the one spike that we had, it was actually during Donald Trump's Presidency. Since then, crime is actually beginning to decrease. In fact, we are now reaching again lower levels because President Biden and other Presidents and other mayors and other Governors have also invested in community policing, in community safety, in park programs, and ensuring that we not just focus on the policing side, but that we're also investing in communities. So I just want to be very, very clear about where actual homicides in United States have actually gone. They're going down. In fact the only real increase we had was when Donald Trump was President. Just to know when he talks about what's happening across this country as it relates to crime, he is actually wrong. So I want to make that note. I wanted to say one final thing. As you probably know, we're going to go back to January 6. We talk about policing and supporting police officers. I think it is very important to support our Capitol Police that were here and protected the Capitol on January 6. I toured the D.C. jail with, in fact, one other Member of this committee in the Majority. We did that, unfortunately, those prisoners, those insurrectionists were treated like heroes. They were hugged. They were given handshakes by Members of the Majority and particularly one Member of this committee. Let's remember the facts. Seventeen of the 20 that were charged at that jail were charged with assaulting police, 6 of them had already pled guilty, yet they are being called in some cases heroes. They're being called hostages by folks in the Majority. In fact, this right here is a reminder these circles of folks that actually are in the D.C. jail that have been called heroes, that have assaulted police, that have done nothing but commit an insurrection and treason against this country. So when we talk about supporting law enforcement, sir, we talk about ensuring that we support our police officers. It is very important that we support the Capitol Police and not the 20 people that are being held, and they're being coddled, supported, and uplifted by some Members of the Congress, which I think is shameful, disgusting, there is no place, and, quite frankly, hypocritical as well. To conclude, I want to submit the profiles of the January 6 inmates of the D.C. jail, which is an article that just outlines and lists exactly who these quote, unquote hostages as called by some of the Majority actually are. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell, former Sheriff, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is honor to be here this week, especially serving in the House on National Police Week, acknowledging the hard work of local law enforcement and Federal partners that we work with. Yesterday, I was proud the House unanimously passed my resolution, which expressed its Congressional support for local law enforcement and condemns a call to defund the police. This is particularly important, and I believe it relates to the conversation today as the Biden administration refused to enforce laws at our border that would make law enforcement officer jobs easier. Sheriff Chapman, it is great to see another sheriff in the room today, and glad to see all of you here with him. I know you're glad to be here. Your testimony about DHS silence when you were seeking answers about the resettling of 1,000 refugees in your community is disturbing. As a former sheriff, I know how important information sharing is, and I would expect DHS to fully cooperate with local law enforcement. Clearly, that's not happening. I'm sure you brought your concerns regarding intel sharing to DHS, and tell us what the response was. Sheriff Chapman. The first response was, OK, we understand your concerns, we'll get back to you, and we'll work this out. Two weeks later, still nothing had been done. It was clear that the only way that we are going to solve this issue with the people coming in and getting the community notified, there was no transparency in this with regards to anything that was occurring with that would be for us to do it ourselves. So I called a stakeholders meeting myself. I thought I would have about 12 people that would show up. I ended up having close to 70 that showed up. We went around the room. Everybody from faith-based leaders to hospital members to fire rescue, to, you know, many three-letter agencies around the Beltway here. We were able to put together a plan and do it, and then have a subsequent community meeting so that the citizens would know what to expect what was coming in. So, in other words, everything that was handled that need to be done was done at the local level with very little assistance until we had that community panel where they all came in and then were able to--after we had already organized where we needed to go with that, that community panel could then relay what was going to happen and how we were going to handle it. Fortunately, because we did that at the local level, we didn't have any issues of concern. Mr. Ezell. Very good. Has anything improved since you had that community meeting with DHS? Sheriff Chapman. The process went well. We had very little contact with DHS. We have a lot of contact with our other Federal partners, but we do not have very much contact with members of DHS. Mr. Ezell. As long as I'm here, I will continue to work with the committee to find ways to instruct DHS to cooperate with local law enforcement officers. We all know the importance of information sharing. You also testified that even though Loudoun County is not a border county, you face merely the same issue as these border counties do. Can you elaborate and tell us how this open-border policy is affecting your county? Even if you have some knowledge about some other counties around your area? Sheriff Chapman. I would say the most critical part of that is the fentanyl that's coming in. I just saw recent stats. I think there was 115 million pills that were seized in 2023. There was up 71 million from the year before. Fentanyl deaths are impacting everybody throughout the country. We've seen-- when I testified before a subcommittee a few weeks ago, I talked about the 9 fentanyl overdoses that we had from one particular high school--members of one particular high school in one area within about a 3-week period. So we are seeing issues or concern. We are seeing the fentanyl used by younger people. It is really concerning me that it's now going down to the teenage level, where before that we saw it between 25 and 35 years old. Then it was 20 to 25. Now, it is 15 to 25, whatever. It really does concern me that the ages drop. Then I will say that's the biggest impact that we are seeing from the open-border policies and the constant influx of drugs that are permeating throughout the United States. Mr. Ezell. Can you walk us through some of the challenges that's going on with local law enforcement as a part of this border mess that we have? Has this hurt your department's ability to recruit? Sheriff Chapman. I think we've actually done pretty good recruiting because we answer directly to the citizens that we serve. I think there's a lot of people that like that; being I'm an elected official rather than an appointed official. So we're in a position where we answer directly to them in our intake and our direction from necessarily people that have other agendas that might want to impose that on us as law enforcement leaders. So our very recruits actually have gone pretty good. We have about a 6 percent attrition rate, most of which are retirements. Our recruitment is up. We hired, I think--went through a hundred people last year, close to that. So we are doing pretty good in the scope of things in comparison to surrounding areas. So I don't really have any personal complaints, but I do know that it's a problem that's impacting many of our law enforcement agencies in the area. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you all, again, for being here today. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mrs. Ramirez from Illinois. Oh, yes, that's right. Thank you for the reminder. We will. So ordered. Mr. Garcia. Thank you. You know, I just wanted to make sure we put in the profiles of the January 6 inmates into the record. Chairman Green. So ordered. You're welcome to introduce your guest if you would like.   Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman. My mother, who oftentimes many of you have heard of was here for about an hour and had to leave, but I'm really grateful that she was here. As you know, she brought me here. She was pregnant when she crossed that border. Her daughter today is a Member of Congress. So I wanted to make sure she was in committee. Chairman, I want to thank you and Ranking Member and the witnesses that are here today for being here. You know, I heard one of my colleagues say, look, the No. 1 job for officers is to put the bad people away, like not just the bad guys, because guys, girls--it could be anyone--and to protect our communities and make our communities safe. I agree with that. After I've heard so many of your testimonies, it's clear to me that we all agree that we must strategically invest in community safety. I believe community safety is bigger than policing, because it requires long-term preventative solutions with professionals that are trained in multiple disciplines. That working together, officers and other trained professionals, we're able to address the cause of violence. For years now, law enforcement has increasingly become the first responder in the primary way that we address systemic problems. For example, increased global instability resulting in unprecedented numbers of refugees needing urgent resettlement support, as Chair Chapman mentioned occurred in Loudoun County. To unaddress issues that undermine school safety, as Deputy Commissioner Mays noted is priority in Tennessee. We have overburdened our public servants with tasks and crisis that they're not equipped to confront, which makes them and our communities, right, less safe. I believe as we're talking about where we are in this precise moment, I think we can restore balance in public safety ecosystem by investing initiatives that allow professionals to respond to the crisis that they were trained to confront, not a mental health crisis. President Bryant, I appreciate you noting how public health and safety require a comprehensive, nonjudgmental, pragmatic evidence-based approach that includes violence prevention measures. So I wanted to ask you, how would increasing the role of community members, health care providers, and other trained professionals in public safety response affect police departments? Mr. Bryant. Thank you so much. Public safety is the responsibility of all citizens involved. So when we are--and I agree that law enforcement's primarily police are typically the first responders to almost every given incident, which overburdens the profession. But increasing and allowing the community to play a significant part is very beneficial to what we do, incorporating other professions in what we do, as stated in this space of mental health, I think will help us tremendously. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Mr. Bryant. You know, Chicago, I represent one of the greatest cities in the world, Chicago. It's been working to right-size the role of police. It's been redesignating some of the overwhelmingly amount of public health and service work delegated to the police department, back the community partners, and trained professionals. The Chicago Police Department reported that in 2019, its officers had to respond to over 40,000 calls with a mental health component of some case. It generated, obviously, deep frustration among officers who feel like they're required to respond to social and medical problems for which they're not trained, and that mental health systems should be managing those instead. So to address this, Chicago had started a treatment, not trauma pilot that had counselors responding to 9-1-1 mental health calls instead of having to call the police. One organization using this motto has reported that they have had-- they have not needed police presence for over 94 percent of those calls. That means that those officers that would have had to respond to those calls can actually address the issues of crimes of violence. Because the community intervention programs, my own district has seen a 50 percent reduction in shootings and homicides. So as I think about that, and I think about our officers, one of the things that I want us to think about is how do we make sure that you have the resources you need, the partners you need to do this work, and that you are able to put the bad guys and the bad women behind bars while focusing on and also protecting our communities. That's why to me as we talk about Police Week, I want to make sure that we continue incorporating community policing and partnerships so that we do what we all care about: Reduce crime and have communities that are safe. With that, Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Garbarino . The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Thank you all for being here today. I thank the Ranking Member and Chairman Green for holding this hearing. President Bullock, I want to start with you about recruit retention. In your testimony, you discussed how your department is 700 officers short of where staffing should be. One of the reasons you attribute this shortage was the city of Austin's defunding the police department by $150 million. As you mentioned in Austin's case, political posturing has led to the defunding of cameras in police departments across the United States, which has increased crime and erode public safety. Austin continues to be one of America's fastest-growing cities. As this growth continues, what do you foresee will be some of the impacts of rising crime on economic development, quality of life for city residents in Austin? Mr. Bullock. I think we're already seeing it quite honestly. I've had a number of discussions with business owners that are, you know, involved in recruiting new businesses to come to Austin, to come to Texas, and public safety is one of their biggest issues. People have opted not to come to Austin because of the issues that we have seen, in particular, with crime and as it relates to a lot of homeless issues and various other things. But, in particular, enforcement and public safety is the No. 1 factor that businesses take into account. We are now starting to see people choose not to come to Austin because of the environment that's been created. Mr. Garbarino. These are not just small businesses, these are pretty sizable companies as well, right? Mr. Bullock. Correct, yes, they're businesses of all size. They are still, like, new start-ups, but also significant companies as well. Mr. Garbarino. What has the impacts of the defunding department had on officer morale and recruitment and retention? Mr. Bullock. I mean, from the recruiting and retention part, I think is very, it's pretty quantifiable because we have seen every year since this started--in particular, back in 2018, we have lost more officers than we've been able to recruit. So it has a very definitive impact on those numbers. As far as morale goes, it takes a very heavy toll on officers to try to maintain the same level of service that our community expects and deserves, while at the same time doing it with ever-diminishing resources. So that's a lot for officers to try to carry as they're trying to go out and keep the city safe. Mr. Garbarino. Absolutely. Just to double down on that, I mean, you're saying you're losing officers, but also in your testimony you talked how Texas State troopers have been reassigned from Austin to the Southern Border, which also hurts. What impact has that had on public safety in Austin; the reassignment of the State troopers? Mr. Bullock. When they were assigned to be in Austin, they had a pretty--they had a notable impact, in particular, in areas where we had seen increased call volumes, we had seen increase in 9-1-1 calls and criminal activity. So being able to go and suppress that activity by an increased presence of State troopers was very beneficial. In particular, as we have dealt with in recent years, street takeovers. State troopers being able to assist in curbing that issue. When they left, we saw spikes. A study was actually done as well as it related, specifically, to traffic fatalities where there was a notable increase that as we dealt with an increased level of patrol activity and traffic enforcement, we saw, I think, it was around a 60 percent increase in traffic fatalities that occur as a result of a lack in enforcement we were able to do. Mr. Garbarino. So you actually just answered my next question. So the reassignment had a heavy impact on the ability of Austin police to protect the public because you don't have enough people responding. So the thin ranks really does have a negative impact on what you can do. Mr. Bullock. Yes, sir. Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate you being here. Deputy Commissioner Mays, I want to ask you a question about interagency coordination. Collaboration and sharing information amongst law enforcement agencies plays a crucial role in mitigating the threats. Since 9/11, there's been a growing trend of agencies working together to promote transparency in exchange of information. In what ways does the Tennessee Office of Homeland Security coordinate with State, local, and Federal law enforcement agencies to address security concerns, and how has your experience been working with them? Mr. Mays. Thank you for the question. We coordinate several different ways. I would say at the forefront is the Tennessee Fusion Center. One of the other witnesses mentioned there are 80 fusion centers around the Nation and in the territories. Tennessee has a fusion center, and we have State, local, and Federal partners that participate there. We've also embedded Tennessee Office of Homeland Security intelligence analysts in the intelligence units of police departments around the State. We found that that's a good way to be present and to learn. For example, we have someone in the Memphis real-time crime center. That gets us a good idea of what's going on in Memphis better than we can ascertain from sitting in Nashville. Then the other really important thing I would say is it has to do with just personal relationships and in investing in those relationships before something bad happens. On the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville in 2020, we were opening presents with my kids, and I got a phone call that a bomb went off in downtown Nashville and blew up most of Second Avenue. When I responded downtown, everyone was there, all the Federal partners, all the local and State law enforcement agencies in the area. I knew personally the leader of every one of those agencies that we had met before and discussed responses before. The only one I hadn't met was the agent in charge of the ATF because he had only been on the job 2 weeks, right. So those are the ways we cooperate, and we do it daily. Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate that. I am out of time. I now recognize the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez for--I'll give you 5 minutes. Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to begin by thanking our witnesses for being here this morning and for the work you and all of your colleagues do every single day to keep our community safe. This week--and in this committee, I want to focus on some of the bipartisan things that we've been able to achieve in this Congress. Some thanks to our Cyber Subcommittee led by Chairman Garbarino and Ranking Member Swalwell. Deputy Commissioner Mays, during your testimony, you touched on the importance of collaboration and responding to cyber-related incidents. How does Tennessee Homeland Security support capacity-building efforts to ensure that State and local agencies have the resources and expertise to effectively respond to cyber-related incidents? Mr. Mays. Thank you for that question. Many people already know we are in a cyber conflict right now with nation-state actors. There are cyber attacks, ransomware attacks every day. We partner with the Federal Government CISA. We're very appreciative of the Federal cybersecurity grant. Tennessee has set up a State cybersecurity council where we are making decisions--the Office of Homeland Security has a seat at that table where we are making decisions on where to put that money to get the best use. We are partnering with--one of the innovative things we are doing is partnering with our Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology or with trade schools so that we can--we sponsor cybersecurity training so these students coming up learn about cybersecurity training; they get a chance to work with us and maybe pursue a career in that. The cybersecurity issue is very complex, and it's going to take a full Nation-wide effort every day to be successful there. Mr. Menendez. You know I'd love to learn more about that program because we talk a lot about building the pipeline of cybersecurity professionals because we are going to need them at every level of government. So I appreciate the collaboration that you've done there. President Bryant, thank you for your testimony this morning. Given the prevalence of mental health crises and law enforcement interactions, how can agencies better collaborate with mental health professional and community-based organizations to provide appropriate care and support for individuals in crisis? Mr. Bryant. Absolutely. I think that what we have to do is really come to the table and have more in-depth conversation on how we can work more collaboratively together. One of the things--and clearly my colleague can attest to--that many of our county jails and prisons have now become a subset of a mental hospital. So we have to address that. Because that, too, has an impact on how we are responding to crime throughout our community. So having the ability to come together and come up with a more in-depth way to respond to the community will be beneficial. Mr. Menendez. It will also be helpful for you as well to continue your primary function by shifting some of those responsibilities away to community-based organizations or people who are trained professionals in the mental health space. Would you agree with that? Mr. Bryant. Absolutely. I think in many instances, law enforcement officers are just ill-equipped to address the mental issues that we are encountering on the street. When it becomes a bad situation, it becomes even worse for the community. Mr. Menendez. Well, if you see any best practices, please come back to us and let us know so we can work on them at a Federal level. I also want to touch on a different issue. But coming back to you President Bryant. You have a great deal of experience working with DHS to get Federal resources for securing major public events, like the 2018 college football playoff and the 2019 Super Bowl. In fact, you led the command for both events, I believe. Is that correct? Mr. Bryant. That is correct. Mr. Menendez. I want to talk a little bit about your experience with the 2018 college football playoff which received the second-highest special event assessment rating or SEAR from DHS. It was a SEAR 2 event, as you know. That SEAR 2 rating brought some Federal interagency support to Atlanta, which helped your law enforcement team ensure the safety of everyone at the championship game, including the President. The DHS SEAR program has never been authorized by Congress, but my colleagues, Ms. Titus of Nevada, and Mr. Hudson of North Carolina have a bipartisan bill that would authorize a SEAR program, streamline the rating process, and make the program more robust. It is obvious to me that SEAR is important to help State, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement keep these large public gatherings safe for everyone. In the time we have remaining, what, in your opinion, can Congress do to support law enforcement in these efforts? Mr. Bryant. So to improve upon this, I think, again, having the collaboration for all Federal partners, State, and local entities coming together to address any large-scale event is very beneficial to the community as we serve. I had the privilege of leading both events and having a strong relationship with our Federal partners was very beneficial to ensuring that both events went off very peacefully. Mr. Menendez. I appreciate that. Thank you all, again, so much. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. D'Esposito from New York for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here, and thank you for your service to law enforcement and to this country. Mr. Bullock, you mentioned that even though you are not a border city, the impact of the Biden border crisis has been felt in cities and counties throughout the country. I think that we could agree that we've witnessed every State become a border State, every city a border city. The mayor of the city of New York actually said that the migrant situation would, ``destroy New York City.'' So I want to ask you, what impact has the border crisis had specifically on your officers? Mr. Bullock. So the few specific examples that I have is one we did because of our staffing crisis, we were relying upon State troopers to come in and to help us in order to support our patrol efforts and in order to tamp down violent crime. As a result of what's going on at the border, they were diverted away from helping us in order to go and help secure the Southern Border. So that took away additional resources that we had as a department to try to help the citizens of Austin. We also deal with it on a fairly regular basis, whether it's as a victim or as a suspect; difficulties in identifying people. We have people who come and all we get handed is a passport card, matriculate card, a voting card that tells us nothing about where they're living currently in the United States. So our officers can encounter difficulties in investigations in trying to identify people, where they are. Like I said, that could be either as a victim or suspects. We do have people who come here legally that are engaged in both. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. Obviously, one of the biggest issues that we as law enforcement have, I think, throughout this country is recruitment and retention. So we clearly understand that the anti-police rhetoric and the inability for many elected officials in Government agencies across this country to support law enforcement and give them the resources that they need has created issues. But what, specifically, have you seen with your officers with regards to the migrant situation and its effect on morale and obviously something important? I know there's legislation on the floor this week with regard to mental health. But what have you seen happen to the morale of your men and women with regards to the issues that you've--that your Department is facing? Mr. Bullock. I think the No. 1 recruiting asset that we have are the officers that are currently with the department. When they don't feel valued, and when they don't feel like they are appreciated, it is very unlikely they're going to encourage anyone else to undergo the same mental stress. So that perpetuates the issue of us having difficulty keeping people in the profession, as well as recruiting people to come into the law enforcement profession. So I think holistically, that's probably one of the most significant impacts that it has is the increased stress levels and the toll that it takes on officers and their families, it dissuades anyone else from coming in. So that makes it very difficult for us to get out of this situation. Mr. D'Esposito. Yes, I would agree. You know, I spent a career in the NYPD, and I think that we're seeing now--that's the fire departments, the police departments, they're careers that are generational. When you see individuals whose grandfathers and fathers and great-grandfathers all served in the New York City Police Department, and they're telling their children not to join the ranks, I think we have a serious issue. You also mentioned in your testimony you talked about the fact that you don't have sufficient amount of officers, and that your department was previously defunded by $150 million, cut 150 positions, and canceled recruitment classes. Obviously, Austin's not alone in places across New York, luckily not in Nassau and Suffolk County. But there are members of the city council in New York City who would love nothing more than to defund the NYPD. So it really goes back to the question that I really have, in the last 45 seconds, is what can we do better as Democrats, as Republicans, as Americans, what can we do to help departments? I know the answer, but I think that people need to hear it. What can we do to help law enforcement agencies? From the big ones like the NYPD, and the LAPD, to the small ones in small towns, what can we do to help make sure that you have, not only the resources that you need, but that you have the officers that want to join your ranks? Mr. Bullock. Well, I mean, the resources is obviously the biggest thing. It's support. It's making sure that officers know that the work they do is valued; that the work that they do has meaning to it. And that another member mentioned it earlier that officers aren't too interested in politics. We want to go out, we want to do our job, and we want to be able to do that without being used as political pawns and other people's games. That's what we deal with with rogue prosecutors in a variety of other different ways. So the support is the biggest thing as well as, quite honestly, addressing similar things. We may not have an issue if funding were taken away, if responsibilities were taken with it. If some of the mental health issues were taken on by other agencies and not given to us, it may not be as big of an issue. Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you. My time's expired, but I appreciate all of you. I value you. I appreciate you. I hope you all stay safe. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Suozzi, the gentleman, from New York for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Suozzi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first start by welcoming my colleague, Senator Tim Kennedy, now Congressman Kennedy to Washington. He's a great public servant. He's done a fantastic job in New York State, and I know he'll do a fantastic job here in the U.S. Congress, and that he is going to make a lot of friends here because of the seriousness with which he takes his job. I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here today. We really appreciate the time that you've taken to help to educate us. I know you have listened to a lot of this stuff back and forth, and you wonder what makes sense. Because people are just trying to score political points on both sides of this. We've got to start working together more to try and solve the problems we face in our country. We've really got to all support law enforcement. I was the mayor of a small city, my hometown of Glen Cove, and I was the county executive of Nassau County where I oversaw the eleventh-largest police force in the United States of America, where we reduced the crime rate to the lowest of any community in the Nation over 500,000 people. I know an important job you do. I know the challenges you're facing right now because of all the attacks that have been made on law enforcement over the years. It's not fair. It's not right. There are people trying to do their jobs. One of the dumbest statements that's ever been created anywhere in our country that is misused so often is this defund the police idea. It's an awful, terrible idea. If anything, I think that most people in the U.S. Congress agreed upon is we need to figure out how to get more money to law enforcement. I think that there are extremists on both sides: Some people that want to defund the police; other people want to defund the FBI; people want to cut the COPS program. We need to get more money for law enforcement. I think most people on both sides of the aisle believe in that. Do we need to fund the police? Yes. Is mental health a problem? Mr. Bryant, I think, was just saying--I've read statistics over the years--75 percent of the people in jail have a drug, alcohol, or mental health problem. Seventy-five percent of the people in jail have a drug, alcohol, or mental health problem. Those are problems we need to address earlier in life before everything blows up into a crisis. We need to go after bad actors. Are there bad actors in the police department? Yes, there are. But the large, large overwhelming majority of law enforcement officials are good people trying to do the right thing to make the world a better place to live in. Our society would not exist without the good work of law enforcement. So in thanking you, I'm thanking everybody you respect in law enforcement. So what can we do at the Federal Government? One size is not going to fit all. You've got these little small communities, you've got these big communities, you've got border communities, non-border communities, you've got places with heavy drugs where they want to carry, like Mr. Gimenez was saying earlier, AR-15s and body armor, and he's got little small towns as well. One of the great things that happened when I was the mayor of Glen Cove was the COPS program that the President Clinton did. They wanted to put 100,000 more cops on the streets. We could get a grant to bring more cops into our local little police department. It was a fantastic program. I want to know would you support the idea of funding for grants to hire more officers or buy equipment or do whatever you think is right for your department? Would you like to see the Federal Government provide more money for law enforcement? I'll just ask you all quickly. Mr. Mays, would you like to receive more money from the Federal Government for law enforcement? Mr. Mays. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Mr. Suozzi. Mr. Chapman. Mr. Chapman. Of course. Mr. Suozzi. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. Absolutely. Mr. Suozzi. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. Yes. Mr. Suozzi. I think we all agree. Everybody agrees. We need more money from the Federal Government for law enforcement. Now, one of the things--I can't tell you about all the things, but one of the things we can do at the Federal level in addition to providing funding is to try and address laws that would fill holes that exist in some communities. Mr. Mays, I was very interested to listen to you earlier. It sounded like you support red flag laws; the idea of a police officer for a family member or somebody being able to go before a law enforcement official, like a judge, and say, listen, this person should really not have a gun. We need to take this gun away from that person. Go through due process, go through a procedure, but have professionals testify and take guns away from people that shouldn't really have guns. Do you believe in red flag laws? Mr. Mays. I don't use the term ``red flag laws'' because it's loaded language that gets people all upset. But extreme risk protection orders---- Mr. Suozzi. Yes. Mr. Mays . The ability to take a weapon with due process available---- Mr. Suozzi. With due process. Mr. Mays . To someone who is mentally ill or unstable or we believe has capability and intent. The Governor of Tennessee proposed something like that. It didn't go. But so I would answer yes, but with different words. Mr. Suozzi. The words you use are--say it again. Mr. Mays. Extreme risk protection orders. Mr. Suozzi. So I know you have extreme risk protection orders type of laws in Virginia already, Mr. Chapman. So I'm not going to ask you. But I want to ask Mr. Bullock. You don't have those in Texas. Do you think we should have that as a Nation-wide basis? Mr. Bullock. I believe there's value in providing additional layers of protection. In Texas, one of the situations that was mentioned if we do place someone on an emergency commitment due to mental health, we have the ability to seize the firearm, but it's temporary. It only lasts for maybe a week, depending upon, you know, a variety of different circumstances. But the ability to make sure that individuals we know are at risk, don't have access to weapons I think is valuable. Mr. Suozzi. It would be great if we had extreme risk protection laws Nation-wide I believe. I just wanted to try and get some support from the different witnesses here today. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Higgins, the Chairman of the Water Subcommittee, for 5 minutes. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank our panelists for being here today. I'm honored and humbled to be a brother of the Thin Blue Line. Long ago, as a younger man, I served in the United States Army as a military police officer and then, later in life, as a civilian police officer in my home State of Louisiana for many years. I maintain my post certification through the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office, so I'm a cop as I sit in front of you today. This is a week in Washington, DC, this bizarre realm of Washington, DC, where there's a great cacophony of support across the--across the political spectrums for law enforcement, that you'll hear--you'll hear, you know, political testimony and agenda-driven questions, like how to--how to trick panelists into supporting red-flag laws, where, in the limited time available, you know, you just don't have--you don't have the time or the venue here to go into it, as to why we oppose such things. The actual existence of--Mr. Suozzi has left the room, but in the State of Louisiana we have the authority--law enforcement takes guns out of houses all the time under a protective order or under investigation of an on-going criminal allegation, and that property receipt is turned over to the spouse or whatever. Sometimes at the request of the spouse you remove firearms from a residence. These laws and protections already exist. The problem is when you force them from the Federal Government into the sovereign States and municipalities. This is where you have major issues and infringement of Second Amendment rights. So, moving on, Mr. Bullock, you're from Austin, Texas, correct, sir? Mr. Bullock. Yes, sir. Mr. Higgins. I would like for you to speak, if you don't mind, regarding the impact of the border crisis. You're a couple hundred miles from the border there. We know, of course, that the invasion at the Southern Border, the disintegration of our sovereignty at the Southern Border has affected the entire country, but would you speak to the impact in your community that the border crisis has had, in your city, your police department? Mr. Bullock. It's had an impact, not just from a resource aspect of our population continues to grow through a variety of different circumstances, but we've relied upon the State to help us and the State's resources have had to be diverted to the Southern Border. We also have issues when it comes to identifying individuals, when it comes to following up when people report crimes or when people commit crimes---- Mr. Higgins. How about response to complaints, 9-1-1 calls, response times? Mr. Bullock. They continue to go up. We've struggled with that for several years now. Mr. Higgins. So your citizenry that's accustomed to having access to police assistance for things like domestic disturbances, break-ins, burglaries, et cetera, suspicious people on their property, things of that nature, are they having to wait because your officers and your deputies in your community are doing other stuff? Mr. Bullock. Either wait or not get a response at all. There are numerous instances where we quit responding---- Mr. Higgins. Unfortunately, this is happening across the country. Sheriff Chapman, would you--in my remaining 30 seconds, sir, would you touch on the impact of the cartel pipelines, human trafficking, and drug trafficking into your community? Sheriff Chapman. I would say that, as I mentioned before, the biggest problem with that we've seen there is the fentanyl problem which is impacting us, starting to impact our community at younger ages. I think that's the biggest--the biggest aspect that's represented by the open borders there, with an increase in that. So we are starting to see that. I think our crime rate's starting to tick up a little bit, but we're still doing pretty good in our particular area. But it does concern me, the open borders and the impact it's having across--across the country, certainly, it's more significant, but in our community we're still doing pretty well. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Sheriff. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Kennedy, the gentleman from New York, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you very much. First of all, Chairman Green and Ranking Member Thompson, thank you for holding this hearing today. Also, I'd like to recognize the service of Congressman Donald Payne, Jr., who passed away far too soon just a few weeks ago. He served on this committee so nobly and leaves behind an incredible legacy. For over a decade, he honorably served and fought for his constituents in Newark, New Jersey. Yesterday, May 14, was the second anniversary of the Tops supermarket shooting in Buffalo, New York, my home town--an attack that struck the heart of our city and, really, of our Nation. Racist, white supremacist gunmen came to Buffalo, armed with an AR-15-style rifle covered in disgusting racist messages, and attacked citizens that were simply going to the supermarket on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, taking 10 beautiful souls, while it was streamed on-line, in over a matter of minutes. One of the victims was Lieutenant Aaron Salter, Jr., a retired Buffalo police officer working at Tops as an armed security guard. When the shooter came in, Lieutenant Salter didn't hesitate and returned fire, hitting his target. But because of the enhanced body armor, the shooter was unharmed and murdered Lieutenant Salter. Lieutenant Aaron Salter, Jr.'s courageous actions bought precious seconds for store patrons and employees to escape, saving lives at the expense of his own. He serves as a true testament to the sacrifices that police officers make for their communities, and we're grateful for his historic actions. I also want to recognize all law enforcement, this being National Police Week. As the grandson of a Buffalo police officer myself, I recognize the sacrifices that families make on a daily basis as their loved ones go off and put themselves in harm's way. I want to talk about enhanced body armor. I have questions for our panelists. I thank the panelists for your testimony today and your life-long commitment to protecting our streets across this country. As I described the situation that played out in Buffalo just over 2 years ago, we know that Lieutenant Aaron Salter, Jr., died a hero and embodied everything that police officers across the Nation stand for. He used his training to help others. Because of that body armor, he was unable to stop the perpetrator in that moment. I would like to ask each of you in your respective capacities: Do you believe that enhanced body armor should be readily available for citizens who are not law enforcement? Mr. Mays. Thank you for the question, Congressman. It's something I haven't considered before. I would suppose there are opinions on both sides. Body armor also provides safety for people who are doing shooting sports. I would hesitate to say people can't have it. But I don't have a clear answer for you on that. Mr. Kennedy. This would be enhanced body armor, level 3 body armor, military-style grade. Mr. Mays. Again, I don't have an answer for you. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. Sheriff. Sheriff Chapman. That's an interesting question, and I don't know if I have an answer either. Although, if somebody's going to purchase that, it would certainly be nice for us to know and have that information available in the event that we have to encounter that person at a later time. Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. Mr. Bullock. I'm kind-of in the--we're all in a similar boat, I'm going to imagine, where it's not a question that's yet been posed. You know, we're here, obviously, to protect people's rights and their ability to, you know, purchase what is legal for them to do so, but, obviously, it's concerning when it impedes our ability to enforce the law. So I think there's a balance that has to be found in all of that. Mr. Bryant. I would agree that more conversation would need to be had as it relates to it. It is concerning when people can use that level of equipment in a criminal act. Mr. Kennedy. I yield my time. Thank you. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the Chairman of the Counterterrorism Subcommittee, Mr. Pfluger, the gentleman from Texas, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As well as the Law Enforcement Subcommittee. Especially in this week, I want to say thank you to all those who serve. Sheriff and all of you in your respective jobs as part of the law enforcement community, thank you. I think one of the reasons that we're having this hearing is to express our appreciation, to make sure that even in some communities where law enforcement may not feel as appreciated-- and, Mr. Bullock, I'll talk to you about that specifically in Austin, Texas--what we want to do today is to say thank you, across the Nation, to our law enforcement personnel, to the families that support them and allow them to put that uniform on every single day to protect and serve. I know that when I spoke to our sheriff's department and police department, those that are DPS troopers, just on Monday, that's exactly what I told them, was, thank you for the service that you all do. Mr. Bullock, I'll start with you. We have a tragedy of untold and immeasurable negative aspects that's unfolding at our Southern Border for the past 3\1/2\ years. This committee, in particular, has held multiple hearings on that. What I'd like to ask you is: In Austin, Texas, tell us about the impact of transnational criminal organizations, cartel activity, human trafficking, drug trafficking. How has that impacted Austin, Texas? Mr. Bullock. Well, I think--and the sheriff mentioned it earlier, as well--but the influx of new drugs is a major concern, as well as, when you talk about human trafficking and organized crime activity, they're very resource-intensive investigations. Unfortunately, those are resources we lack at the moment, which impedes our ability to fully investigate, and leads to a likelihood that we're not going to be able to investigate everything. So my concern overall is that, as you deal with more complex crime, as you deal with an influx of individuals who are engaged in, you know, criminal activity and--very serious, when you're talking about trafficking individuals--that we don't have the resources to appropriately interdict and to stop that kind of activity. Mr. Pfluger. There was a lack of political will, as well, inside Travis County, specifically inside Austin. Has that been reversed? Do you feel supported by local leaders as far as the prosecution goes of these crimes that you're referencing? Mr. Bullock. No. We have yet to see that reversed. Mr. Pfluger. That's really unfortunate. A lot of those officers have come to San Angelo and Midland-Odessa, where I live, because they do feel supported there. Sheriff, I noticed in your testimony you referenced your time as a DEA agent, so I'll ask you the same question. When it comes to fentanyl and other illicit drugs that are coming across the Southern Border, how has that impacted you, the job that you're in right now, the community that you serve? Then, you know, maybe give us an idea of what this looks like over the past couple of years, 20 years in your time in service, and how bad is it right now. Sheriff Chapman. Well, as I mentioned before, I was--I served all over the country, but I served in Miami back in the 1980's, and I thought I'd seen the worst of the drug problem back then as a special agent. It's far worse now, because, you know, we've had, for the last 3 years now, I believe, over 100,000 people that have died from overdoses. So the tragedy associated with it in a different way, it's not--it's not organizations competing for product share; it's just people dying because they're being fed this fentanyl. I can tell you that in Loudoun County we're very proactive. We've had several fentanyl forums. We're out there all the time. We're working with the schools. We're doing everything that we can. I mentioned earlier that we've had--we're seeing a decrease in the ages of people that are using fentanyl. Our overdoses are starting to go down to the teenage level, which we hadn't seen a couple years ago. It started with heroin and fentanyl, and now it's almost all pure fentanyl now. So it does really concern me here. Then I look at the problem nationally, and I always, when I give my presentations, I say, if you were to fill up the Washington Commanders stadium, every single one of those seats, probably you still wouldn't have the amount of people that died from overdoses last year. So it is critical that we address this issue. We've got to be proactive on it with the education, Narcan, and all these other things that we do, that we're very active on, but also to hold these people accountable and stop whatever we can at the border, because that's where---- Mr. Pfluger. Do you think there's accountability at the border right now? Sheriff Chapman. I think it's a--that it's a porous border, so, no, I don't think we're having the accountability we need down there. Mr. Pfluger. To our other 2 witnesses, I'm sorry we didn't have time to come to you again. Thank you for being here. I'll reiterate, thank you to all that serve, all those who serve, and their families, for sacrificing so much for the safety of our communities. It is my sincere hope that we will actually get back to accountability. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. Greene, for 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to thank you all for coming to our committee today, and thank you for the job that you do. Today, I'd like to begin by honoring a police officer in my district who died in the line of duty after being exposed to fentanyl during an arrest. Corporal Christopher Jackson Dye spent his life in service to our Nation and to the community of northwest Georgia. He committed 12 years of service to the Army, followed by many years of law enforcement in Walker County. In November 2020, Corporal Dye was conducting an arrest when he was exposed to fentanyl. The arrest tragically resulted in his passing away from a heart attack associated with the fentanyl exposure. This week, we honor him along with many other brave men and women who have died in the line of duty serving our communities. Their commitment to their jobs should always be remembered. Fentanyl is the No. 1 killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. It kills approximately 300 Americans a day, every day. In counties throughout the 14th District, from 2019 to 2022, fentanyl deaths increased by over 350 percent. This is something I know that you gentlemen deal with far too often. According to the Georgia Narcotics Association, approximately 7 out of 10 pills on the street are laced with fentanyl coming across the Southern Border. I'd like to ask each of you, is this something that you're having to deal with as well? Mr. Mays. Thank you. Yes. The short answer's, yes, the drug problem that you're speaking of is prevalent in Tennessee, along with the human trafficking element that is a part of that also. Sheriff Chapman. Absolutely. The porous border is basically the cause for all this fentanyl going through the United States. Mr. Bullock. In Austin, it's something we deal with on a daily basis, all throughout the day. Mr. Bryant. Fentanyl is an issue that law enforcement is dealing with throughout the country. Ms. Greene. Yes. Thank you for that. Also, you know, for many years in the past, we used to hear young men and women say that they wanted to be a police officer when they grew up, but unfortunately we're not hearing that as much anymore. Law enforcement agencies across the country experienced a wave of retirements and departures and are struggling to recruit the next generation of police officers in the years following the BLM and antifa riots, where we saw police attacked night after night, continuously, all summer. Over 93 police cars were burned, and over $2 billion in damages were wrought in communities all over America. The rate of retirements in some departments rose 45 percent with the previous year, according to research on nearly 200 law enforcement agencies. At the same time, hiring slowed by 5 percent. The wave had come as local lawmakers and Federal lawmakers pledged to enact reforms on police, such as ending the policies that give officers immunity for their actions while on duty. Studies show there has been a 44 percent increase in retirements and an 18 percent increase in resignations in police departments. In Atlanta, the department has been down 400 to 500 officers over the past 3 years. One officer who left Atlanta said, ``Basically, we're one bullet away from death and one mistake away from indictment. So why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?'' These are the saddest statements that I think we can hear coming from police officers, feeling that they're forced into retirement because no one is supporting them on the job. In their exit interviews, many of them cited the defund movement and lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving their departments and leaving law enforcement completely. But, now, with the Biden administration's open-border policies that's opened our border to tens of millions of people from over 160 countries all over the world and a steady flow of human and drug trafficking, police in America are now on the front lines, facing new and staggering dangers in every community all over America. I'd like to again ask each of you: Can you tell us, is it difficult to hire new recruits to be police officers? Mr. Mays. I would say, to give you a brief answer, that the difficulties you're describing are--similar issues are being faced in Tennessee for law enforcement agencies across the State. Sheriff Chapman. I can't speak for nationally, which I think you have spoken for, which is a problem. In Loudoun County, we're actually doing pretty well. A lot of that has to do with the fact that I'm an elected official of a full-service sheriff's office and I answer directly to the people. Even though I'm an elected official, I'm not--we run an apolitical shop, and we support the Constitution, and that's what we do. So I don't have--I don't have political agendas driving what we do in the law enforcement community. So it actually works out well for our community. Ms. Greene. I'm happy to hear that. Mr. Bullock. In Austin and I'd say in the major city centers across Texas, yes, we are dealing with those issues. As a matter of fact, we tend to lose officers from our department that will go to a smaller department because it has a more positive environment that they feel supported in, that they want to go there. Mr. Bryant. I spoke to Chief Schierbaum just recently as it relates to Atlanta Police Department, and they are seeing improvements as it relates to recruitment. Having discussions with other police chiefs throughout the country, what we are seeing is those numbers begin to stabilize and a unique effort to recruit and challenge differently in their spaces of recruitment. So we are all hopeful. Ms. Greene. Well, I certainly hope so. I think supporting our police officers is the most important thing that we can do, especially as elected officials. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Luttrell for 5 minutes. Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, as we honor the Thin Blue Line of police officers that serve this great country, I'm trying to figure out the best way to actually say thank you, you know, so the world can understand it. You know, in the military, as Mr. Crane and the Chairman, forward-deployed overseas in a theater of war in the past 20 years when we were fighting in multiple areas, you know, they throw on their body armor, they grab their rifle, they go out the wire, they do the things they do. They come home, they redeploy back to the United States, they take the armor off, they're able to relax, and they're able to spend time with their families, they're able to repatriate and cool down. I think what is lost sometimes is that the men and women that wear the shield wake up every morning, they kiss their loved ones goodbye, and they walk out that front door with their badge and their weapon system, and they deploy out their front door--every single day. Now, you hear the statistics in the military of the cognitive and the physical struggles of combat and what that does to the human body. Those are 6 months at a time. Over a period of 10 to 20 years, you do multiple deployments--5, 6, 10--and then you're expected to come back, and there's a healing process. There's no off-ramp for the law enforcement officers. Ten, 20, 30, 40 years, you deploy out your front door every single day to every single conflict in your area. You know what's the most astonishing thing that most people don't realize either? Every single person, 330 million people in the continental United States, have your phone number. My 7- year-old son has your phone number. If something goes wrong, he's going to call you, and you will respond. I think what has happened is, the narrative has changed in a way that law enforcement has in some way become the bad guys and girls. It breaks my heart to say that. I don't believe that, but it's just something that--it kind of resonates in the media and the social media and the platforms that you see and the ``defund the police.'' How did this happen? Everybody has a bad actor. Everybody has a bad day. People do stupid things. Do you blame the entire establishment for a bad day at the office? You know, that's--you see that debated in this committee here today and in Congress and in your local law enforcement agencies. But I think we need to take a step back in the American public and understand that there is a--the Thin Blue Line is something that's very real. It's those men and women that, no matter the circumstances, no matter what you see every day, no matter what you hear, no matter what you feel in your heart--do you know how amazing it would be if you could take your eyes out of your head and put it in the American public's eyes, and your ears and your heart, and you say, now you see what I see, now you hear what I hear, now you feel what I feel, and I'm coming for you to help you regardless, and you may hate me every second of the way, but I'll be there for you. It's just tragic, in a way, that--law enforcement should be the most revered asset in our Nation, because you're there to save our lives. You're there to do the things that most people don't want to do. You go running in that direction. That's the best way I can say thank you. I hope it resonates with you. I don't have any questions for you. As it gets--it will always get worse before it gets better. The only thing that I ask is you don't leave, you don't walk away from us, as hard as it gets. The funding goes up and down, and people do the things that they do, but every time you go home and you see your loved ones and your kids and you say, ``Man, this is the worse day of my entire life,'' get up the next morning and go, ``I'm gonna do it again.'' Because if you don't, that--I don't even know where to go with that. But God bless each and every one of you, and thank you. I yield back, sir. Mr. Brecheen . The gentleman yields. I--this is a fun transition--I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. We want to thank all of you again for being here. Sincere gratitude for what you do, what you believe in, the rule of law, the services that are provided to this country, what you represent. We honor your courage. We honor those who have lost their lives doing what I can't imagine. You know, it's one thing to leave your family for extended periods of time; it's another thing to leave your family not knowing, when you walk out that door, whether or not that day's circumstances would allow you to reenter that family dynamic. This week, of course, we're recognizing law enforcement and police during Police Week, and we acknowledge these challenges. Our Nation is facing a crisis because of a culture of lawlessness that's been advanced because of a belief system that's taken hold. It's a rebellious-type atmosphere that highest leaders of our country are bolstering, because we're not in solidarity standing up for respect of authority, respect of the rule of law. We see this, you know, with the ``defund the police'' movement that's, you know, just wreaking havoc. It's--as I've listened this morning, you all talking about your recruitment, lack of ability to encourage for the--just the loss of morale, knowing that people from the highest positions of authority have your back. Specifically, what I hear in Oklahoma is our flood of drugs that have come into this country with this, you know-- heightened because of what's happening at the Southern Border. In Oklahoma, sadly, we had an initiative petition that, under the guise of recreational marijuana, brought marijuana. In Oklahoma--I'm not proud of this stat. I don't think--as a majority, you will find there's prideness of Oklahomans. But we export more marijuana than any other State because of this ballot initiative that came in. It's the tie, then, for the cartels seizing upon that and sending drugs into our State. So let me do this. For Sheriff Chapman and President Bullock, how has this problem of drugs flowing in affected you and what you're seeing? Sheriff Chapman. We had to address the community directly with regards to the overdoses that we saw at the school. We had 9 overdoses in a period of about 3 weeks of students that were affiliated--or the students at the school, 4 of which happened in the school, 3 of which required Narcan, 2 of which required CPR, so it was quite serious. What we find is that there's a reluctance to try to get that information out. We did our own press release, and it caused a little bit of a stir. But what that did was, it really prompted Governor Youngkin to immediately put an executive order in requiring a 24-hour notification of, to parents of that school in the event that somebody overdosed. That was then later put forward as legislation, and it didn't really pass the way it should've passed, with the 24- hour notification, which was actually taken out, which was the whole purpose of the bill. But it does impact us in the sense that, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing younger people doing this. We want to protect our children. We want to make sure we've got a safe community. That's my biggest concern, is with the fentanyl, the proliferation of it, the availability of it, and the impact that it's having on our youth. Mr. Brecheen. Mr. Bullock, can I transition and just-- because I actually have a question, I think, that I can--help me move the narrative, given limited time. You talked about the morale issue. I think earlier today you talked about, since 2018, you've had a loss of more officers than you've had the ability to recruit them. So, No. 1, would you speak to how the ``defund the police'' movement has impacted the morale? Then talk about the dollar loss that you've also seen that's contributed. Mr. Bullock. Well, I'd say it's all tied together, because the defunding movement as well as the taking away of money from our department overall means that we have less of a---- Mr. Brecheen. When you say taking--I apologize for interrupting. When you're talking about the loss of funding---- Mr. Bullock. Uh-huh. Mr. Brecheen . Specifically, you're addressing your State having--the State of Texas having to shift resources to secure our Southern Border, billions of dollars--Federal responsibility--and that is having an impact because the State is no longer able to help you financially like they were prior. Mr. Bullock. That's correct. Mr. Brecheen. Please continue on. Mr. Bullock. Yes, that's a correct characterization. But, I mean, when you're talking about the defunding movement overall, a lot of it ties into everything else that you're talking about, in that we have people that do not support officers when they are trying to enforce the law, and so the arrests that they make are tossed out by prosecutors, and so people wind up re-offending. There's no accountability for criminal activity, and so there's a perpetuation of crime that's going on that is leading to no type of intervention. That ties in directly with fentanyl overdoses; it ties in with officers being exposed to deadly substances. That all has a dramatic effect on how officers feel they're able to do their job, almost to the comment of, ``Well, what's the point?'' Mr. Brecheen. Yes. Well, thank you so very much. You'd think, sitting in the chair, you could yield yourself more time, but I won't do that to my colleague who's next. So thank you for answering those questions. With that, I will yield the gentleman from Arizona, Eli Crane, his 5 minutes. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for coming today. Thank you for your service. I also want to say thank to you the men and women that you're here representing today. I want to take a minute to honor the courage and resilience of my constituent Sergeant Preston Brogdon. The sergeant, a former Marine veteran and a member of a police force in Yavapai County, was shot in the line of duty a little over 2 years ago. He is a true hero. In the face of danger, Sergeant Brogdon selflessly placed himself in harm's way to protect his community. His unwavering commitment to duty was evident on that fateful day in 2022 when he was shot, narrowly escaping a potentially fatal wound. The following months were filled with surgeries and extensive physical therapy. He inspired many on his road to recovery. But his road has not been easy, and he continues to navigate what comes next for him and his family. He was recently fired by the Yavapai-Apache Nation Police Department. Despite facing this adversity, he remains steadfast in his recovery, demonstrating remarkable strength and determination. I bring him up today because I don't want his story to be forgotten. Folks like Preston, who sacrificed for our safety, need to know that we stand with them, especially when things get messy. I'm in awe of Sergeant Brogdon's bravery and resilience, and it should serve as a shining example to us all. His legacy of courage and boldness will forever be remembered with honor and gratitude. We've talked a little bit about this on this panel, gentlemen, about red-flag laws and even whether or not the citizens of this country should be allowed to have body armor. So I've got a question for you. You know, I apologize, but do you guys believe that the Constitutional rights of Americans should be dismissed when it increases the operational efficiency and safety protections for law enforcement? Mr. Mays, I'm going to start with you. Mr. Mays. No, I do not. Mr. Crane. Thank you. Mr. Chapman. Sheriff Chapman. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? Mr. Crane. Yes, sir. Do you believe that the Constitutional rights of Americans should be dismissed when it increases the operational efficiency and safety protections of law enforcement? Sheriff Chapman. No. I'm sworn to uphold the Constitution. Mr. Crane. That's right. Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock. I would echo the same thing. We take an oath, as well, to uphold the Constitution. Mr. Crane. Mr. Bryant. Mr. Bryant. I agree, we have a responsibility to the Constitution. Mr. Crane. The reason I bring that up is because I constantly hear arguments, usually coming from the other side-- and though often I think they're well-intended, it's this constant push-pull that we deal with up here, whether we're talking about firearms, whether we're talking about body armor, which I heard about today, or whether we're talking about FISA and whether or not that whole system should be reformed. So I want to challenge you gentlemen, as I thanked you earlier for your service, to make sure that we're not--as subject-matter experts and people that are often leaned on for their advice when it comes to protecting American citizens, that we hold those Constitutional rights paramount, even though at times it makes it harder for you to do your job. I want to yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Brecheen. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Ranking Member Thompson for closing remarks. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank our witnesses for your expert testimony. I think what you do every day reflects very clearly in what you shared with us. I can say that, for the Democrats on this committee, we've never, ever voted against law enforcement. The nonprofit program for churches and houses of worship legislation, we promoted. We started off with just synagogues, but then we made it available to mosques and just other houses of worship in general, because we have a fundamental belief that in America everyone ought to be safe. Whether I'm a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian, in our mind, you should be safe. The other thing is, the training that was talked about today is absolutely essential. In addition to being a hunter, I'm a volunteer fireman. I used to show up on scenes in mutual aid, and the equipment that we had didn't match the equipment of the department we were backing up. Sheriff, I know you can appreciate this. We used to have frequencies that certain departments would have that the others didn't have. So we've come a long way, especially after 9/11. We've said that first responders have to have the ability to communicate, so if it's the police, fire, or whomever, they should be talking to each other. The public expects and assumes that that's what's happening anyway. Well, in 20-plus years, we've made that happen, because we said to law enforcement, if you want Federal monies, you're going to have to solve the interoperability problem. So that's helped. On 9/11, the police in New York had difficulty communicating with the fire department, so we lost a lot of people. We've invested a lot. The COPS program--wonderful program. We've used it in my district, and it continues to work. The fusion centers you talked about--it is clear, those fusion centers we created here in Congress and working with State and locals, now they're an integral part of how we protect and serve the general public. If you want a real fight, you talk about doing away with them. The last thing: I can't stress training enough. Training is absolutely essential. We need to share facilities in the training. I encourage you to do that. To Mr. Bryant's comments, we have to do a better job of recruiting everyone into law enforcement; it can't just be a particular group. Law enforcement, they're all protecting Americans and upholding the Constitution. The Constitution, I've been told, is color-blind. It's the application of the law that creates the problem. If we do it in that respect, I think we all will be better because of it. So we thank you all for your testimony. My comments about January 6 were two-fold. I was in the Capitol on January 6 and could not get out for almost 4 hours because of what was happening. The only way most of us survived was because of the law enforcement presence in the Capitol protecting those of us who were just trying to certify an election. But I also had the responsibility of chairing the January 6th Select Committee. I tried to present a picture of exactly what happened. I didn't take sides. But, also, in law enforcement, you just--just the facts. We tried to present the facts. That's what we did. Ultimately we presented the report. I take issue that people who break the law--I don't care who they are, they're not hostages. They're crooks. They're felons. If they are so adjudicated, then they go to jail, plain and simple. So, apart from that, again, let me thank the witnesses for your expert presentation. If we have any questions, we'll submit them for your response. Thank you much. Mr. Brecheen. The gentleman yields. Now for the Chairman's closing remarks. Let me just say again thank you, on behalf of the committee, for your time. Thank you again for what you represent. I think most of us see--I heard it even recently, you know, in the last few moments--the rule of law, respect for authority. I heard an interesting statistic this last weekend. I read it, actually. America First Policy Institute has a quote--a commentary about the likelihood--and just falling under the thought pattern of respect of authority. Even on the microcosm of family dynamics, fatherlessness in homes produces 20 times more likely an incarceration, somebody that's going to do something that would lead to incarceration, some crime. Seventy percent of those that are addicted to drugs come from a fatherless home. So we have a cultural shift that has to happen in this country, from the lowest level, of us teaching within our family dynamics about respect of authority, understanding an authority doing what authorities should, No. 1, to love those people within that family, showing them responsibility, and then, in return, the children then respond with the respect of authority. So we've got a cultural dynamic that has to change in America. I am convinced that those of us that have the platform--support for law enforcement begins in the family first. I think you all deal with that day after day. For those who are having to deal with the aftereffects of a culture that's missing the mark on this, thank you for what you do. Thank you for your brothers and sisters in arms that have paid the ultimate sacrifice. With that, the Members of this committee have some additional questions for the witnesses. We would ask the witnesses to respond to these in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will be open for 10 days. Without objection, this committee stands adjourned.
