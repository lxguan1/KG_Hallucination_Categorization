The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:17 a.m., in room 1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Bryan Steil  presiding. Present: Representatives Steil, Loudermilk, Griffith, Bice, Carey, Lee, Morelle, Sewell, Kilmer, and Torres. Staff present: March Bell, General Counsel; Kelvin Bencosme, Staff Assistant; Kristen Monterroso, Director of Operations and Legislative Clerk; Michael Platt, Staff Director; Elliot Smith, Director of Oversight; Jessica Smith, GAO Detailee; Jordan Wilson, Director of Member Services; Khalil Abboud, Minority Deputy Staff Director; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director; Kwame Newton, Minority Oversight Counsel; Heather Painter, Minority Legislative Director; Matt Schlesinger, Minority Senior Counsel; and Sean Wright, Minority Chief Counsel. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REP- RESENTATIVE FROM WISCONSIN Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the chair may declare a recess at any time. Also, without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days so Members may submit any materials they wish to be included therein. Thank you, Ranking Member Morelle, Members of the Committee, and our witness, for participating in today's panel. As part of the Committee on House Administration's oversight over the legislative branch, today we are focusing on the U.S. Copyright Office operations. We will explore how the U.S. Copyright Office is modernizing, assisting customers, and engaging with stakeholders. As a legislative-branch entity, this Committee has oversight over the U.S. Copyright Office. Since becoming part of the Library of Congress in 1870, the Copyright Office has grown to become a critical linchpin in the U.S. economy. The copyright industry impacts roughly 16 million American jobs. Who requires a copyright? A variety of industries engage with the Copyright Office on a daily basis. I will just name a few. You engage with singers, with songwriters, authors, filmmakers, the media, software engineers, and more. Where does the Committee on House Administration come into copyright issues, one may ask. The Committee has oversight over the Office's operations. Each year, the Copyright Office works with thousands of individuals and examines their copyright claims. These records are supplemented with thousands of documents, representing hundreds of thousands of titles of work. In recent years, we have seen an uptick in the volume of work submitted to your office. Today, we will explore how the Office operations have been challenged and how they have worked to improve customer experience and make it simpler, easier, and more efficient for everyday copyright holders to register their works. By registering copyrights in a timely manner, individual creativity and individual businesses can thrive. As the Copyright Office knows, many high-volume artists, like photographers for example, are having difficulty registering their work due to an expensive and time-consuming registration process. Let us use wedding photographers as an example. They may take hundreds, possibly thousands, of wedding photos at an average wedding. The current online system prevents photographers from uploading in large batches, making it difficult for them sometimes to reach critical client deadlines. Assuming timely registration of copyright is of the utmost importance--ensuring timely registration of copyright is of the utmost importance, particularly to ensure these works are protected. As technology is rapidly evolving, widespread copyright infringement for many content owners is becoming the status quo, unfortunately. Copyright infringement corrodes value and diminishes their ability to make ends meet. We want to learn more about the process and some of the burden content creators are experiencing today. In recent years, the Office has undertaken significant modernization efforts. This includes IT modernization and AI policy plans. The Committee on House Administration has been working with each of our support agencies, including the Copyright Office, to develop AI governance plans. In 2016, the Copyright Office established the Copyright Modernization Office to ensure the Office is achieving its mission and strategic goals on behalf of copyright owners. In their 2023 annual report, the Office made steady progress in creating a web-based, cloud-hosted, user-friendly platform. While the new system has improved efficiency, there is still more to be done to make sure the new system is meeting the needs of users. Over the last year, the Committee has met with a variety of individuals and stakeholders who engage with the Copyright Office and have heard their concerns. I look forward to a robust discussion today to ensure we are promoting innovation while protecting content owners' work. Before I yield to the Ranking Member for 5 minutes, I will note that we are expecting votes to be called at the bottom of the hour. There is potentially a new 20-minute rule on the first vote, and so, at risk of that, we will probably gavel out a little early. Then we will come back and pick back up where we leave off, whether or not that is opening statements or into Members' questions. With that, I will now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes for the purpose of offering opening remarks.

JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership, for calling this on this really, really important topic. It has been great to work with you and your team on these important issues. I want to thank Register Perlmutter for being here today and for your efforts to ensure the Copyright Office keeps pace with what is breakneck change in the speed of changing technology. It is great to have you here to talk about this and the critical role that the Copyright Office plays in promoting creativity, innovation, and economic growth in our Nation. The Founders recognized the importance, enshrining the right in the Constitution as promoting the progress of science and useful arts. I think sometimes people are surprised when you mention that copyright is actually listed in the United States Constitution, but here we are and conducting this oversight of the Office to discuss the progress that has been made, the challenges that the Office and we all still face to improve the services that you provide to copyright owners and to the American public. Our responsibility is to ensure you have the necessary resources and congressional support to carry on the mission effectively in this ever-changing digital age. I do want to recognize the substantial progress the Office has made in recent years, thanks to your leadership and that of your team. Thank you to you for your hard work and the hard work of your staff. The development of the Enterprise Copyright System, the ECS; the launch of the Copyright Claims Board; and the establishment of the Copyright Public Modernization Committee are just a few of the highlights that I think demonstrate the Office's commitment to a future-facing intellectual property system. As we move forward, it seems to me it is crucial we build on these successes and continue to enhance the accessibility, efficiency, and resilience of the copyright system. The ongoing development of the ECS is particularly promising. When fully implemented, the system will provide a unified, user-friendly platform for registration, recordation, public recordkeeping, and licensure. As the chair has described and I understand, the dedicated copyright modernization funding is set to expire in the coming years, however, and additional fiscal support will be needed to avoid losing momentum on the progress you have made, so that is something we will all keep very much in mind. I do want to highlight the Office's ongoing work on artificial intelligence. Again, the chair touched on it. It has broad implications for copyright. I do not think anyone needs to be reminded of that. With the rapid advancement of generative AI, it is critical that the Office provides timely guidance and leadership not only on the scope of copyright protections in AI-generated works but also on the use of copyrighted materials in AI training on the so-called back end, when you are starting to train models. I worked on these issues back when I was a member of the New York State Assembly. We did not call it AI, but we talked about computer-generated images and computer-generated work and the use of someone's voice, their likeness, without consent, a problem that becomes even more pernicious with the explosion of AI technology--the ease, the ability to generate AI content. AI-generated deepfakes can be created using this technology in ways that it could not have been even a decade ago. The use of that technology will have a major implication for the worlds of copyright as well; I do not need to tell you. Is AI-generated content copyrightable? Who holds the copyright? Does the AI training process infringe on the rights of copyright holders when the data relied upon inevitably includes copyrighted work? In fact, just 2 days ago, three of the largest record labels in the world sued two AI startups, arguing the use of their AI technology to generate content infringes upon the rights of the artists whose material was used for training sets for those models. These are difficult, complex questions. I am looking forward eagerly to your multi-part report on how these issues affect the copyright domain. I understand that report is coming out later this year, and I am sure you will probably want to touch on that. Finally, I want to just touch on the importance of the right to repair, something that I have been involved in, again, since my time as a State legislator, and the role of copyright law, section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits the circumvention of technological protection measures that control access to copyrighted works even for non- infringing purposes like repair. Recognizing the unintended consequences of the prohibition, your office has encouraged the Librarian to exempt consumer devices from this restriction in the past. I am grateful to you for that. Obviously, an issue that will continue. Today, the Office considers whether or not to preserve these protections for consumer choice but to expand them to the commercial and industrial equipment that has just as great, in fact, if not even greater, impact on our everyday lives. I will continue on the questioning. I do not want to go far beyond my time, and I appreciate the indulgence of the chair. Again, look forward to hearing your testimony. Mr. Chair, thanks again for holding this important hearing. With that, I will yield back.

Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Appreciate your work in this nonpartisan way on the oversight of the Copyright Office, you and your whole team. Without objection, all other Members' opening statements, as well as letters for the record submitted from outside parties, will be made part of the hearing record if they are submitted to the Committee clerk by 5 p.m. Today, we have one witness. We welcome Register Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. Appointed in October 2020, Register Perlmutter advises Congress and executive branch agencies on copyright policy and directs the administration on important provisions of the U.S. Copyright Act, leading a workforce of roughly 500 employees. We appreciate you being with us today and look forward to your testimony. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of Committee rule 6, the witness will please stand and raise your right hand.  Chairman Steil. Let the record show the witness answered in the affirmative. Now, we appreciate you being here today and look forward to your testimony. I will remind you that we have read your written statement and it will appear in full in the Committee record. I will now recognize you for 5 minutes for the purpose of offering an opening statement. STATEMENT OF SHIRA PERLMUTTER, REGISTER OF COPY- RIGHTS AND DIRECTOR, U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Ms. Perlmutter. Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to report on the accomplishments of the U.S. Copyright Office in updating our information technology systems and serving the public. IT modernization continues to be a top priority for the Office as well as one of our main strategic goals. Development work began to build the new Enterprise Copyright System, or ECS, in 2020, after we received its initial funding from Congress. Since I joined the Office in October of that year, we have made significant progress, thanks to the close and productive collaboration we have established with the Library's Office of the Chief Information Officer, or OCIO. As we work together, the Copyright Office determines the evolving business priorities for ECS, and OCIO manages the software development and implementation. Two major components of ECS are already being successfully used by the public. We are now mapping out next steps and timing, with a focus on registration. The first ECS component to be developed was recordation, given the need to take an antiquated paper-based process into the 21st century. We now have an efficient online recordation system, which is used for more than 80 percent of submissions. Average processing times have fallen from months to weeks. We have also made available to the public a pilot of our new Copyright Public Records System, or CPRS. This will replace the existing Public Catalog with a more user-friendly system as the authoritative source for registration and recordation information. We are currently accelerating the pace of work on registration, which is the largest and most complex and most visible component of ECS. The Office has had an electronic registration system, known as eCO, for more than 15 years now. This system continues to function effectively, with processing times at an all-time low. It does have some limitations, and the new ECS version will be a major improvement. Over the past year, the Copyright Office and OCIO have, together, completed a great deal of work in developing the registration system. We have tripled the number of IT teams working on it, and we are further reallocating resources to enable rapid progress. Consistent with testimony I have given to Congress before, we expect to initiate a limited pilot of the standard application, as well as the eDeposit upload functionality, by the end of this calendar year. This will allow us to gather user feedback to guide further development. Let me mention two other areas of collaboration with OCIO. First, as part of our commitment to preservation and access, we are digitizing our historical records and making them available online. This summer, we have completed fully half of our over 26,000 record books. Second, we have launched a customer contact center, resulting in improved user experience and better analysis. The Office has, at the same time, taken on increasing responsibilities in the areas of law and policy. These include oversight of new statutory structures, multiple rulemakings, and studies on important policy issues, like the one currently on the topic of artificial intelligence. Another of the Office's priorities is outreach and communication. We are committed to maximum transparency, and we consult regularly with the public in both formal and informal ways. During my tenure, we have ramped up outreach, including to raise awareness about new opportunities for stakeholders, with the establishment of the Small Claims Tribunal and implementation of the Music Modernization Act. We also obtain public input through the notice-and-comment process as well as holding or joining meetings as requested by stakeholders. On IT modernization in particular, the Office has hosted numerous public events. We conduct training webinars for systems in production, gather feedback via email, and ask users to complete online surveys. Responses have been very positive, with strong interest in additional features. We have also established a more sustained formal mechanism for receiving input. In 2021, the Librarian appointed a Copyright Public Modernization Committee, or CPMC, to discuss the technology-related aspects of the Office's services. In its initial 3-year term, the CPMC held six public online meetings as well as several informal briefings, and the Librarian has reauthorized it for an additional term. Once the new Members are selected, we plan to hold a meeting before the end of the year. I will close by thanking the Committee for its support of the work of the Copyright Office and the Library to enable continued development of copyright IT systems. I am pleased to answer any questions.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF SHIRA PERLMUTTER  Chairman Steil. Thank you, Register Perlmutter. Appreciate you being here today. I will begin our questions, and then we will continue with the Ranking Member and alternate sides. Again, votes have been called. I will monitor where that process is; then we will take a brief recess. Register Perlmutter, I would like to begin my conversation with you about the AI initiative that you mentioned in your testimony. It is critical the Office addresses the copyright challenges that result from AI-generated content head-on. It is impacting every corner of the creative community in the United States. As we saw just last month, Scarlett Johansson was in the news after an AI company used a sound-alike voice despite her not giving permission for her voice to be used in that manner. Now, we have heard concerns from songwriters, from artists, photographers that are struggling with similar issues, and the stakeholders are eagerly awaiting guidance from your office. It is correct that the AI initiative has been in the works for now over a full calendar year, correct? Ms. Perlmutter. The issue has been around for about a year and a half. We launched our study--our AI initiative studying the issues in March and followed up with a notice requesting public comment at the end of August. Chairman Steil. In March of last year, right? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. Chairman Steil. A little over a year ago. You got comments in August, and you got about 10,000 comments. Is that about accurate? Ms. Perlmutter. We did. We have read every single one of them. Chairman Steil. You have bucketed them into key categories: literary works, visual works, et cetera. I want to dive in, kind of, then, on where you are at in this process, because a lot of people are waiting on this. Do you have an expected date for your review? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. We are issuing the report in sections, frankly, because there are so many issues it would take too long to try to do one entire volume covering everything at once. The first section will deal with the issue of digital replicas, the issue that Mr. Morelle has raised in his opening statement. That section is close to being finalized, and we expect to issue it in the coming weeks. The second section of the report will talk about the issue of copyrightability of the output created using generative AI. That study we expect to issue by the end of this summer. Then we will turn to the infringement-related questions, including whether the ingestion of copyrighted works for purposes of training the AI constitutes fair use, in what circumstances it might constitute fair use, and also considerations related to licensing and the allocation of potential liability. That--those last sections of the report we expect to be out in the fall. Chairman Steil. Obviously, this is a big topic area, a lot of comments. Is there something in particular that is driving the delay for these reports to come forward, or is it just the volume of work? Can you help scale that--or scope that for me? Ms. Perlmutter. This is really the timeframe we expected to always follow. We--it takes some time, as you can imagine, to review 10,000 comments, so we spent the period between September and December doing that. Since that time, we have been preparing outlines and drafting. The only thing that has been delayed a bit is, the initial section of the report on digital replicas we had predicted to be able to publish by the end of the spring, and, as I said, it will now be out within the next few weeks. Chairman Steil. Thank you. One of the concerns I have heard, in particular, is whether or not we are going to see a patchwork of State laws. As we look at Tennessee--Tennessee, not waiting for the Federal Copyright Office, has taken it upon themselves to pass the ELVIS Act--the Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and Image Security Act--a first-of-its-kind legislation prohibiting using AI to mimic an artist's voice without permission. It goes into effect July 1, just next week. I know you are monitoring this Act. Do you have a concern that there would be a series of State laws that will arrive and come on line prior to your report's coming out? Does that give you concern or does not cause you concern? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, there is a concern in general about having a patchwork of inconsistent State laws. That is already the case with State rights-of-publicity laws, which cover a lot of this type of conduct and they differ in many respects, one from the other. That is one of the things that commenters raised with us as one of the strong arguments they have made for a Federal right. We know, however, that Congress is not just waiting for us to issue the report, because one bill has already been introduced; another discussion draft has been circulated. There is legislative activity continuing even while we are preparing the report, and we are trying to stay abreast of all of that activity. Chairman Steil. As we think about the operations of the Copyright Office, obviously, a need for human capital, in particular, understanding AI in a way that probably was not prevalent, obviously, a decade ago. Do you feel you have the human capital and the knowledge of employees inside the Copyright Office to be able to navigate through the new questions that are arising as it relates to AI? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes, I do. The Copyright Office has always had to grapple with, how do we apply new, emerging technologies to copyright principles and laws? We have always had to make sure that we educated ourselves sufficiently to be able to be thoughtful and appropriate in what our recommendations were, and this is no different. We actually spent months at the beginning of last year, after we launched the initiative--so throughout the spring and summer--educating ourselves, including having multiple meetings with technology companies as well as doing our own research and reading. I think we have a good grasp of how the technology works; certainly adequate to analyze the copyright-related issues. Chairman Steil. Thank you very much. Thank you for being with us today. I will now recognize the Ranking Member for the purpose of asking questions. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for that exchange, which was really helpful. I did want--I had some questions, as well, on the question of AI. Without asking you to sort of preview what the recommendations are--because that, as you said, is going to come out in a series of reports--can you at least give me a sense of, sort of, the analysis you did and the process that you used to take new technology and things that would not have been even possible a decade ago and sort of just give me your thought process on how you place that against, you know, the standards that we have used in the past? How do you--what has been your charge to staff as you sort of work through this and, sort of, the principles that you have used? Ms. Perlmutter. We have basically been proceeding on two tracks at the same time. Because one of the Office's functions is to do policy analyses and assist Congress in analyzing copyright issues, and the other piece of our role is to administer the Copyright Act, which includes, of course, registering claims to copyright. We have, throughout the last few years, been looking at claims in works that incorporate in some way AI-generated material. That has been an ongoing process of having to draw lines and decide when there is sufficient human authorship in a particular work to support a claim to copyright. Because, in our view--and we have been upheld by the courts on this--human authorship is required for copyright protection. Mr. Morelle. You have sort of, I think--is it fair to say that, from your perspective, the notion of generative AI, where you cannot trace an author, a human author--that is not copyrightable? You have sort of--you have kind of already arrived at that conclusion, no? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we have certainly arrived at the conclusion that if it is purely generated by AI and there is no human involvement, there cannot be copyright protection. The District Court for the D.C.--for the District of Columbia has upheld that decision. It is now on appeal to the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Morelle. Because it is interesting, AI does not--I mean, there has to be some human involvement, right? I mean, you have to train the models, you have to write the algorithms. It does not produce it out of thin air. So--but it is interesting, where you--and this may be, you know, one of those deeply philosophical questions, ultimately, to arrive at it--where does human engagement stop and where is the tool doing the creative--or the creation of the work? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. Exactly. What we have been doing is trying to apply existing principles of how you distinguish idea from expression and how you determine whether there is sufficient expression to uphold a copyright. What we are looking at in each case--of course, you are right, there will be some human involvement. Humans have to program the machines. The question is, did a human determine the expressive elements of the output sufficiently so that we can recognize human authorship in it? Mr. Morelle. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter. We are drawing those lines every day in the applications we receive. We issued guidance to applicants last year that explained what they should do when they are trying to register such a work, essentially to disclaim those elements that were produced purely by AI and identify what the human authorship is of the work. Mr. Morelle. Yes. It is fascinating, and we are looking forward to this continued conversation. I want to jump, if I can, quickly, with the last minute and a half that I have, around the question of right to repair and exemptions that I mentioned in my opening comments. Can you just share what factors the Office is weighing as it evaluates the proposed expansion of the repair exemptions to cover a broader range of devices beyond consumer products? There is agricultural equipment; there is a whole host of folks that are deeply interested in this. I am just sort of curious if you could give me an update on your thinking. Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. As you recognize, we have already issued--or, the Librarian of Congress has issued one exemption for repair for consumer products, and the question is whether to expand it. Mr. Morelle. Right. Ms. Perlmutter. We are in the middle of the rulemaking now, so I cannot articulate exactly what we are going to say in October. I will say, we are looking at whether there has been sufficient evidence produced to meet the standards under the 1201 rulemaking process. We have suggested in the past that Congress look at a permanent exemption covering right to repair that could possibly be broader than the evidence we see in any particular proposal under 1201. Mr. Morelle. Yes. An issue I have long been involved with. You know, from my perspective, understanding there are rights here that have to be measured and balanced, but for a consumer, in terms of price, you know--and it is not just affordability. It is, if you are a farmer and you have to have a point where your whole year is relying on being able to harvest and your harvester goes down and you cannot get access to repair, it is really having a deleterious effect on their work and on their business. I appreciate your efforts in this and look forward to continuing to engage on these issues. With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Recognizing where we are at in the vote schedule and the theory that we are going to have a first vote that is 20 minutes long, we are going to recess now. I encourage Members to come back quickly. We will pick up where we left off with questions. This Committee stands in recess, subject to the call of the chair.  Chairman Steil. I reconvene the Committee and call it to order. We will continue with our order of questions. I now recognize Mr. Loudermilk for 5 minutes. Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Perlmul--Ms. Perl--Perlmutter. That is hard to say, since I served with a Perlmutter for many years. I do not know if there is any relation there. Thank you for being here. You mentioned in your testimony that the modernization of the Copyright Office's information technology continues to be a top priority as well as a strategic goal. Can you elaborate on the Office's partnership with the Library of Congress and the Office of Chief Information Officer in this effort? Ms. Perlmutter. I would be happy to. Before I arrived at the Library, the Library had centralized IT work within the Library for all of the service units, including the Copyright Office. The way the relationship works is that the Copyright Office experts develop the business goals and priorities and needs, and then work very closely with OCIO to help them understand what we need and when and how, and then they essentially enable us to do it by developing the technology. We work extremely closely together, so I would say, at all levels, in both offices, we are in contact every day. I meet regularly with the Chief Information Officer, Judith Conklin, and our teams meet regularly and work together, both formally and informally, constantly. Mr. Loudermilk. OK. Do you feel like you are getting the support you need from the Library and the CIO in order to advance these technology programs? Ms. Perlmutter. Absolutely. We are working as a team, and we have a completely shared vision of where this is going and how to work out the timing and make it happen. Mr. Loudermilk. Great. Can you speak to the IT modernization efforts that will harden the Office's systems against security concerns and cybersecurity weaknesses, especially in the context of electronic deposits of published works submitted to the USCO? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. I am far from a cybersecurity expert, but I know that the Library has in place excellent and state- of-the-art security processes and that, in particular, any electronic deposits that we get are protected in transit and when we receive them. I am sure we can get you a better answer for the record with more detail on exactly what is done for security purposes---- Mr. Loudermilk. Right. Ms. Perlmutter . from a technical perspective. I am assured that it is a very robust system that complies with all of the relevant Federal standards and, in fact, is as protective as the way that we protect sensitive congressional information as well. Mr. Loudermilk. OK. Yes, the cybersecurity is an issue; it is a growing issue. It will always be an issue. Unfortunately, it seems like the Federal Government is often the weak link in the chain. That is something that concerns a lot of people, especially if you are going to be housing protected works or personal identifiable information. That is of high concern. Can you tell me about the elements of the new IT system that will directly benefit an individual copyright holder who is trying to register a new work? Ms. Perlmutter. There will be a number of ways in which it will be beneficial to copyright holders. Of course, it is still in development, and we will be able to show a limited pilot by the end of the year of the standard application. People will have a chance to see it and give us feedback, and that will-- that feedback will, in turn, go into further development. One of the things that I have been most excited about with the new ECS registration system is that it will be much easier for the average person to use without having any expertise. Mr. Loudermilk. OK. Ms. Perlmutter. There will be a lot of help given in terms of understanding terms, knowing what categories to use, knowing what forms to use. I think that will be a tremendous benefit. There will also be ways in which it will be much easier to upload deposits. It will be faster, it will be easier to upload large deposits or multiple works at a time. I think people will find that to be a great benefit. Mr. Loudermilk. Do you plan on doing some sort of controlled testing with real-time users, and will you be asking for feedback in that? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes, that is---- Mr. Loudermilk. OK. Ms. Perlmutter . exactly what we have in mind. The idea is to have this limited pilot by the end of the calendar year. We are already getting information about people who are interested in participating. What we want to do is to prioritize those who have been using the existing online registration system so that they can helpfully compare what is in use now with what we plan to do going forward and give us the feedback that we can use to further shape and direct development. Mr. Loudermilk. The last question, real quickly: Do you have plans to keep it within budget and within the timeframe? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. We are currently operating within the budget that Congress has given us so far. We have a budget for fiscal 1925 where we did get what we had asked for for modernization. We have enough right now to proceed as planned with the limited pilot by the end of the year. We will be making a request in the 1926 budget for additional funding to ensure that we can continue in this pace of development. Chairman Steil. The gentleman's time has expired. Ms. Sewell is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Sewell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Register, for sharing your testimony today. For more than 150 years, the United States Copyright Office has been at the forefront of protecting creators and preserving our Nation's stories by maintaining intellectual property for musicians, artists, literary authors, and other forms of creative content. Copyright is the engine of free expression, and it plays a central role in our access to information. Being able to create new materials and share that information with the public is a fundamental right recognized by Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Copyright helps protect the value of the creator's work so that the creator can control how that information is shared. Extremists are making efforts across the Nation to decide what information is worthy of consumption by removing books that tell the full story about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom. Preserving all of our history is important, because it reflects the cultural diversity, ingenuity, and challenges that the fabric of our Nation was founded on. Each year, I look forward to attending the Congressional Dialogue Dinners at the Library of Congress, because it gives me a chance to access the information that expands our world view but also to see all of the amazing archives we have, the history that we have in archives. This is why I was particularly excited when I read about the Copyright Office's efforts to digitize information in your testimony, because it makes it more accessible to people. The Copyright Office is undertaking a major effort to digitize and make available online its vast collection of historical records, dating back to 1870, I understand. Beyond digitization, what steps is the Office taking to enhance searchability and usability of these historic records for researchers and the public? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, thank you for that question. I am very excited about this project. We, in addition to making those historical public records available online--and we have done about half of them so far--we are working on--the next step will be to develop a way to extract metadata from the records. Ms. Sewell. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter. Right now, the great improvement is that people do not have to come physically to the Copyright Office to look at those records; they can see them online in digital form. The next step is to enable them to do the research---- Ms. Sewell. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter . without having to go through, laboriously looking at each page. We are working right now with LC Labs to test an experiment with some AI programs to see how we can engage in exactly that project of extraction of metadata. Ms. Sewell. Gotcha. Ms. Perlmutter. I think there is a lot of exciting potential there, and we are---- Ms. Sewell. It is very critical that we figure out how to make it really searchable and usable, so I am glad to know that you have undertaken that. With over 12,000 record books available currently today, what is the timeline for completing the digitization of the remaining books? Ms. Perlmutter. I expect we will be able to do it in the next few years. We have to figure out exactly how we allocate all of our various resources and fundings between the other parts of---- Ms. Sewell. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter . ECS development and this digitization project. It is something we plan to do in the next few years--to complete in the next few years. Ms. Sewell. How is the Office leveraging the partnerships and collaborations, both within the Library of Congress and within--and with exterial--external--excuse me--organizations, to advance its historical record preservation efforts? How are you working with public-private partnerships to do that? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes, that is a good question. We are looking at the possibility of additional public-private partnerships. Ms. Sewell. Uh-huh. Ms. Perlmutter. Right now, we are doing this work on our own---- Ms. Sewell. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter . and making it available online, as I have said, through the Library's websites. I think the idea of public-private partnerships to do further work is a good one, and it is one that---- Ms. Sewell. We should explore, actually. Ms. Perlmutter . I have suggested exploring further, yes. Ms. Sewell. Exactly. Well, thank you for all that you are doing, and look forward to the digitization of all the wonderful books and historical records that we have. Thank you. Ms. Perlmutter. Thank you. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back. Mr. Griffith is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Griffith. I need some help understanding all this. I understand the historical records, but when Ms. Sewell starts talking about books, some of those books are currently under copyright, and if you digitize them and you do not have a license, what is the legal--underlying legal authority for that? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we are not digitizing books under copyright. We are digitizing our records---- Mr. Griffith. Just your records.  Ms. Perlmutter . records. Mr. Griffith. If you are doing submissions or if you are putting your work in, that is not going to be digitized. Ms. Perlmutter. We do not take material that is not digitized and digitize it. Mr. Griffith. You are not making copies digitally of material that could be copyrighted--or is copyrighted. Ms. Perlmutter. People can submit digital copies of their work---- Mr. Griffith. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter . as deposits, but we do not take the analog copies and digitize them. Mr. Griffith. OK. That is not a part of your plan that is coming out? Ms. Perlmutter. No. Mr. Griffith. OK. All right. That is good to know. What documents do you have that you are going to be digitizing for the historical records? Ms. Perlmutter. We have, they are called historical record books, which are records of copyright registrations and recordations over the years. The historical public record books go back to the 19th century, up until 1978, when the current Copyright Act went into force. We have those. We also have card catalogs. We have a number of different forms of historical records. We have some microfilm records that we are also---- Mr. Griffith. All right. Ms. Perlmutter . in the process of digitizing. Mr. Griffith. So--and I apologize that I am confused, but if I submit a book--and I have not written any yet--but if I submit a book to you for registration under the Copyright Act and you are digitizing those--let us say I give you an analog copy and I want it copyrighted. You are saying you are not digitizing those, but then you are saying anything that has been filed for registration. Tell me--explain it to me. Ms. Perlmutter. We are digitizing our records, which are, like, applications for registration or lists of---- Mr. Griffith. Would not that include a copy of the underlying book, or---- Ms. Perlmutter. No. Mr. Griffith. That does not? Ms. Perlmutter. That is the deposit copy, and that we are not digitizing. Mr. Griffith. All right. I am just trying to make sure I get it straight. Ms. Perlmutter. It can be confusing. Mr. Griffith. It can be confusing, yes, ma'am, and I appreciate that. The purpose is just so that the historical records can be more easily accessed. I am fine with the historical records---- Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. Really, for two purposes. One is for people who want to use copyrighted work so they can find out what is there and who owns it and get in touch with them. The other is for researchers. Mr. Griffith. All right. I appreciate that. What else is exciting going on over there that you have not had a chance to tell us about yet? Ms. Perlmutter. Oh, wow. There is so much going on. It has been quite something. One thing that we are very proud of: We have set up a new Copyright Small Claims Court 2 years ago, pursuant to the CASE Act---- Mr. Griffith. Yes. Ms. Perlmutter . that Congress passed in 2018. Mr. Griffith. I think you mentioned that earlier, yes. Ms. Perlmutter. It is functioning incredibly well and getting close to 1,000 claims having been filed. It is operating very smoothly and very effectively. Mr. Griffith. Again, just so that I am clear, you are not taking any documents that are filed as a part of the registration process and digitizing the document--the book or the work for copyright purposes, just the registration forms? Ms. Perlmutter. Just the--just the forms, the information that people have given us in connection with registration, but not the works themselves. Mr. Griffith. All right. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Kilmer is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Chairman. Thanks for being with us. I want to talk about the local news industry. There has been a significant decline in the number of local newspapers and outlets across the country. I think that is concerning, in part because it keeps our constituents informed and engaged, and I think it plays a very important role in maintaining a strong democracy. The rise of some of the large-language-model AI tools presents both some new challenges for local news outlets and some new tools that could help them develop more sustainable business models. We all know how important local news is for our communities, so it is important that, as Congress engages on this topic, ensuring that regulation of AI tools at the very least does not further contribute to the decline of local journalism is, in my view, very important. I guess I have a number of questions for you in that regard, foremost being: Are you getting any feedback from these local news organizations and outlets during the listening sessions that you have done, in the public inquiry that is happening on AI, and on these copyright issues more broadly? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. I would start by saying, we actually did a report, now probably close to 2 years ago, about press publishers' rights in general, where we recognized the challenge for local news outlets and exactly the trend that you mentioned, and we expressed concern about that as well. We have gotten input from--certainly from the news media and news media organizations. I would have to go back and check to see if any individual local news outlets filed separately. Definitely, that area was well-represented in the comments we received. Mr. Kilmer. Is there an intentional effort to engage with news organizations during the decision-making process regarding copyright registration for AI-generated content? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we certainly have an open door, and we certainly talk to the News Media Association, among others, on a regular basis about their interests and concerns. I do not know if that answers your question. Mr. Kilmer. Yes, I guess I am more interested in whether there has been any sort of assertive--I believe you when you say your door is open. I wonder if there is just any direct effort to outreach to this industry because it is so potentially impacted by this. Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we have certainly reached out to them on specific issues, you know, where we have had, for example, a notice of inquiry or a notice of potential rulemaking--proposed rulemaking. We are, right now, in the process of finalizing a rule to allow group registration of news websites in a way that has not been possible before. Actually, I am quite proud of the fact that we are getting that rule completed in record time, because we issued our notice of proposed rulemaking in January, and that rule--we are expecting to publish the final version in July, so just under 7 months, which is the fastest we have ever been able to put through a change like that and a new group registration option. Mr. Kilmer. Let me ask a more, I guess, specific area. When, you know, you are looking at potential copyright infringements of content that is produced by local media organizations, local news organizations, by these large language models, has your office done outreach, you know, as you sort of think through what those infringements might be and, you know, how to engage on that? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we are certainly aware of the issue and what the infringements might be. I believe that those interests were represented, for example, at some of the roundtables and meetings that we held last spring and summer, in addition to submitting comments to us in the notice---- Mr. Kilmer. OK. Ms. Perlmutter . of inquiry. Mr. Kilmer. Finally, what do you need from us? You know, as you look at specifically this intersection between your work and local journalism, is there anything Congress can do to better help you address that? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, that is a good question. I think, in our report on press publishers' rights that I mentioned, we did talk about the fact that a lot of the issues that were raised seem to relate to areas of antitrust law and bargaining power questions that were beyond the scope of expertise of the Copyright Office but could make more of a difference than anything that the copyright system could provide. Mr. Kilmer. OK. Thanks, Mr. Chair. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Mrs. Bice is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to circle back around, Ms. Perlmutter, on the conversation that Representative Griffith brought up about the copyright piece. Your office recently had an open rulemaking to authorize not just the use or disposition of electronic deposits by the Library of Congress but the reproduction, public display, or performance and distribution of new copies of electronic deposits. I want to read to you--this is from the notice: U.S. Copyright Office notice of proposed rulemaking concerning a regulatory expansion that would grant the Copyright Office authority to make or transfer electronic copies of published works of authorship submitted by the rights holders for registration purposes to the Library of Congress for purposes of its digital library operations without licenses or TPM or DRM protections and grant the Library authority to make yet further copies and provide access to the protected works, including over the internet, without licenses or protections. First of all, are not those electronic deposits not exclusively the rights of the copyright holders under the Copyright Act? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. I am not sure what the quote was from that you read. Mrs. Bice. That is actually from the rulemaking--the proposed rule that your office is actually putting forward. Ms. Perlmutter. That does not sound like the language of the rule, but I will take a look at it. But---- Mrs. Bice. Yes. U.S. Copyright Office's notice of proposed rulemaking. Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. The question before from Mr. Griffith was about whether we take works that are not in digital form and digitize them, and that, the answer is, no, we are not doing that. The---- Mrs. Bice. It looks like you are proposing the rule to do that very thing. Ms. Perlmutter. No. What the rulemaking is about is, when people deposit a work in digital form, when and in what circumstances it can be offered to the Library to select from for its collections. As of now, there are some works that already the Library can take electronic deposits, digital deposits, for purposes of its collections, but it is a limited category. I think it is just newspapers and serials. What the proposed rule would do would say that the Library can select from digital deposits of other types of works beyond just those limited categories. It would be under the same very strict limitations, which is that the electronic copies are only available on the premises of the Library, on dedicated terminals, by two people at a time who are authorized users, and do not allow any further copying or distribution or downloading of the copies. Mrs. Bice. OK. Thank you for clarifying that. You are saying that if an author submits a physical book, you are not digitizing it and then putting it in the Library of Congress's, sort of, database to be able to share. Is that---- Ms. Perlmutter. No. Mrs. Bice . correct? OK. Thank you for clarifying. I want to pivot to a little bit of a different topic. This year, there have been many statements that have been made by the Office that have caused concern regarding the efforts to modernize the Office's registry system. During a meeting in February, the Office announced a notice that would be published the following month in the Federal Register to reauthorize the Copyright Public Modernization Committee and requested applications from interested parties. The notice was actually not published until March, and then it was only published after Committee Members sent a letter requesting an update. It is my understanding that many of the Committee Members would like to meet more frequently. Can you talk about why the Office does not convene this critical Committee more frequently than it does currently? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, the Committee was set up through a regulation which entailed--which specified that it would meet publicly twice a year. Frankly, I thought at some point we should talk more often, and so we started having informal briefings in between the public meetings. The Committee was set up for a 3-year term, and it came to an end at the end of last year. We had a final meeting where we had a conversation with the Members about what their experience had been and what they would like to see going forward, talked about increasing the pace of meetings. I think at least continuing to have informal briefings in between the public meetings is a good idea. Someone had said at the last meeting--had predicted that we would publish the notice to reauthorize in mid-March. Just due to the press of business, it ended up happening at the beginning of May, so it was about a 6-week delay. None of that changed what the timing would have been to get the new Committee up and running. The deadline for applying to be on the Committee expired last week, and so we are looking at the applications. We will hold the first meeting of the new Committee this fall. Mrs. Bice. Do you believe that you should be given additional authorities or directives to meet more frequently? Ms. Perlmutter. I do not think it is necessary. I think we can change the frequency of the meetings. My understanding is that what the Members had been asking for was consistent with what we had in mind, which was a certain number of public meetings and then other briefings in between on specific issues that the Members are interested in. Mrs. Bice. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back. Mrs. Torres is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Perlmutter, for being here with us today. Some of the Members have already covered many of my questions, but I do want to ask and cover this other very important subject. As we are developing AI tools, we must not forget that AI serves as a supplement to human capabilities. In prioritizing our core values while harvesting AI, ensuring that we hold on to the human touch that informs our work is truly critical. That is why I recently introduced the International Artificial Intelligence Research Partnership Act of 2024, which would expand partnerships between U.S. cities and cities around the world in AI research and implementation projects that will--or, could spur innovation and uphold our shared global democratic values. My question to you, Register, is, can you provide a brief overview of key themes and issues that have emerged from the Copyright Office's listening session on AI and copyright to date, including any discussions on how the Office is partnering with international counterparts? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, let me start with that last part of the question. We are in regular communication with international counterparts. I mean, it is just absolutely clear that AI technologies are being developed all around the world, by people from different countries, that they draw on and train on content from around the world. We always have to be aware of the global context. I have been in frequent conversation with counterparts and policymakers from countries around the world that are also examining these issues. My belief is that the more we all share our ideas and our experiences, the more likely it is that we will get at least compatible approaches emerging around the world, which will avoid impeding cross-border communication and trade. Mrs. Torres. The European Union has been pretty aggressive. Spain, specifically, is trying to master the Spanish version of AI. You know, I want to make sure that the U.S. does not miss on an opportunity to ensure that we are working together side- by-side to develop, you know, one policy that represents--that is representative of all of our democratic values. How does your office plan to update your, you know, guidance and regulations to keep pace with future innovations? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we are working on that right now. Mrs. Torres. OK. Ms. Perlmutter. We issued guidance in March of last year on how to register works that contain AI-generated material, and we have been able to draw on the responses to that guidance. We have gotten, of course, a lot of questions about it, hypotheticals, people raising issues that maybe had not occurred to us. Meanwhile, we keep getting new applications to register every day. We see in the real world how this is playing out and what the issues are. We are going to be drawing on all of that to update our compendium of Copyright Office practices. We do that always through a public notice and rulemaking process, giving people an opportunity to give us input. Mrs. Torres. Thank you. On the issue that was covered by my colleagues regarding newspaper outlets, I just want to let you know I am very concerned about, you know, any policy that would make it harder for our newspapers, especially our small newspaper groups, to be able to publish and correct articles as they--as the news continues to change and evolve. Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. Thank you. Mrs. Torres. Please keep our office informed of any of those issues. With that, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back. Mr. Carey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Carey. You know, I want to thank the Chairman; I also want to thank the Ranking Member. I think that anybody who is watching online or who is watching on C-SPAN, I just want you to see how a Committee works in a bipartisan way. I think the level of questions that we have been asked--or, are asking you are very bipartisan, because we want to get to the issues that matter. I just wish that my colleagues on other Committees did the same thing. I want to thank you again. I also want to thank the witness for being here today to really discuss this important work with the Copyright Office. You know, the Copyright Office dates back to, what, the 1800's--you know, I am a student of history; that seems like a long time ago to me--and serves a wide variety of interests. In fact, the Office issued over 440,000 new registrations alone in just Fiscal Year 2023. Am I correct with that number? I think I am. If I am not, you can correct me later. Today, I want to focus on the modernization efforts of the Copyright Office. With that being said, the Office is now almost a decade into--I want to jump on what Mrs. Torres said, but--the Office is now almost a decade into the development of the Enterprise Copyright System, or the ECS, which is meant to integrate and improve all of the Office's technology modules. Can you provide an update on the progress made in the modernization aspects of ECS and relate directly to the copyright registration system? It is all yours. The floor is yours. Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. I will say, it has been almost a decade since we started talking about modernization. The actual development work started in 2020, so now about 4 years ago. We have made a lot of progress. I spoke in my opening statement about progress in recordation and also the development of the Copyright Public Record System, but you are asking specifically about registration. On that, I would say, it has been an area where we have just recently--well, over the last year, put a lot of our resources in particular on expediting work on the registration component of ECS. Working very closely with the Library's OCIO, we are making it now a top priority and moving around some of our resources so that we can speed up progress. That will include the launch of a limited pilot by the end of this calendar year. Mr. Carey. OK. That was going to kind of go into my next question, which was: Can we expect that the registration modernization updates will take effect all at once--you are kind of saying we are going to do kind of a pilot program--or were they going to be done in increments? Am I safe to assume that we are going to do it in increments, not just all at once? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, it will be all at once in the sense that, once the entire system is finished and we retire the existing eCO system, that will happen at once; we will have an entire system. My understanding of how the IT development process works is that we will be testing out in limited pilot with the public different pieces at a time so that we can get input, and then that will feed into the further development. Mr. Carey. To kind of jump on that, do you feel that the Office has the resources it needs to complete its modernization in a timely manner? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. We have--at the moment, we have the funding and the staff to proceed with that timing that I have been mentioning so that we would get the limited pilot up at the end of this year. Our goal is to be able to retire the eCO system at the end of calendar 2026. We have now the funding that can take us--we got the funding in the 2025 budget to do the current plan with the limited pilot. Then, moving forward, we will be making a proposal in 2026 for additional funding to be able to continue and finalize the work. Mr. Carey. Well, I thank you for your testimony, and I thank you for being here today. Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Lee is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much for being here with us today. I would like to go into a further discussion about the Music Modernization Act, which was signed into law back in 2018. It established a new entity to administer certain music licenses and distribute the associated royalties. Streaming services transfer those royalties and data to the collective and meet certain criteria in order to obtain a so-called mechanical license. The collective, in turn, finds the proper copyright owner and distributes royalties back. I am interested in talking about that mechanical licensing collective. That is something that the Copyright Office oversees. Is that right? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes. Ms. Lee. Who are the primary stakeholders that are involved in that process? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, the music publishers, the songwriters, and the digital services. Ms. Lee. Coming up on the 5-year re-designation of this collective, what would you say--are we facing a key moment here? What work and preparation is being done for looking at that 5-year re-designation? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, we have issued a notice seeking public comment on the re-designation, and we are currently in the process of reviewing all of the comments we have received. The various time periods, I believe, are not yet final, so we are still receiving input as well as analyzing it. Ms. Lee. Do you have any ideas or suggestions about how that process might be improved? Ms. Perlmutter. We--we will have some suggestions once we issue our report. Ms. Lee. The timeline, then, would be: Right now you are getting input from stakeholders, and then after that is complete you will be issuing a report, and that report is where you will set forth any recommendations from your office? Ms. Perlmutter. Yes, that is correct. Ms. Lee. All right. Ms. Perlmutter. I just should say, I mean, we have issued various recommendations for the MLC's operations periodically meanwhile. It is not as if this is the first time we have engaged in any oversight. This is the big reauthorization period. Ms. Lee. Are any of the recommendations that you have issued so far ones that you would characterize as particularly significant or things that you think are going to feature prominently in the reauthorization? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, a number of our recommendations have been about process. My understanding is that the MLC has been generally following those recommendations. We are also finalizing a rule right now that has to do with termination rights and how that affects who is the appropriate recipient of royalties and at what point in time by the MLC. That is likely to have a major impact, and that might figure into the final report as well. Ms. Lee. Now, switching gears a little bit, I would like to go back to this subject of artificial intelligence, particularly as it relates to deepfakes, misinformation. These are things that, I know, as Members of Congress, we all continue to hear great concerns about from at home as well as here in D.C. I am interested in your office's--I believe you either have issued or will be issuing a report on digital replicas. I am interested in your perspective on whether copyright law is potentially the right vehicle to address these challenges. Ms. Perlmutter. You are correct; we are going to be issuing a report very shortly, in the coming weeks, on the digital replica issue. There are ways in which copyright law can relate to some of these challenges, but it does not directly protect someone's identity against its replication. What we have right now in the United States is a whole array of different laws that could potentially apply in different circumstances. There is--and a lot of them are State laws, right? Publicity and privacy, unfair competition, and then also the Lanham Act at the Federal level. In our report, we are going to be looking at: In what ways do all of these laws, including aspects of copyright law, apply to what is happening out there in the world with these new technologies? What are the shortcomings or gaps? Should there be a Federal law that can possibly fill in those shortcomings and gaps? Ms. Lee. Can you tell us some of the ways in which you think copyright law may have a role or may provide an avenue for relief? Ms. Perlmutter. Well, to the extent that the person whose identity is being replicated is also an owner of copyright in a work from which the replication is made, they may have copyright claims. There also could be possible claims arising from the ingestion of copyrighted works that feature the voice or image of that individual for purposes of training machine learning. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back. We have concluded our questions for the panel. I will yield to the Ranking Member if he has just a couple closing comments before we close. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you, the staff on both sides, Members on both sides. I think the conversation was really an important one and very insightful. Thank you, Ms. Perlmutter, for--not only for being here today and being very thorough in your responses but for your leadership. I am sure the Chairman and I will continue to engage with you and your team about all the exciting--and it really is exciting--things that are happening and all the challenges that we all collectively face. Again, thanks for your service, and thanks for being here today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Steil. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here, Register Perlmutter. I know you have a team of about 500 people that work tirelessly day-in and day-out. To those that are here and those that are listening or watching, thank you for all the work that is being done. As noted kind of through our discussion today, there is a lot of work at the Copyright Office. Technology is evolving quickly, in particular as it relates to AI. I look forward to the ongoing dialog about the work the Copyright Office is doing, in particular, as we modernize and address some of the challenges that we face. We appreciate you being here today. I will also note, without objection, each Member will have 5 legislative days to insert additional material into the record or to revise and extend their remarks.
