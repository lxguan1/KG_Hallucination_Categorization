OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD OF
ARKANSAS, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT
Mr. Crawford. Good morning, and I want to welcome our
witnesses today. Thank you all for being here. We are here to
better understand the Biden administration's implementation of
Buy America, including those provisions that were in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA.
As most of us here know, I forcefully supported U.S.
manufacturing and our domestic steel industry for many years,
and I am proud to serve as the Republican cochair of the
Congressional Steel Caucus. I am particularly pleased to have a
great steel company, Nucor, which has significant investments
in my home State of Arkansas, here with us today.
Buy America policy supports and strengthens our domestic
manufacturing economy, which is crucial for both our national
prosperity and security. Enforcing Buy America requirements
ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent here in the United
States, and not enriching our foreign adversaries, such as the
Chinese Communist Party.
For example, in 2019, I led congressional efforts to pass
the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, or TIVSA,
which was included as part of the National Defense
Authorization Act of 2020. This law prohibits the use of
Federal funds to purchase rolling stock--buses and railcars--
from Chinese-owned or Chinese-domiciled manufacturers.
Unfortunately, codification of the TIVSA and its
prohibition on purchasing transit equipment from China did not
send a clear enough message to the Federal Transit
Administration. The FTA determined that transit agencies which
had formed contracts with restricted manufacturers, including
the state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock MA Corporation,
prior to December 2019, would be granted a lifetime exemption
from the procurement prohibitions enacted by law.
We are presently working to fix that loophole.
Earlier this Congress, the committee marked up and passed
my bipartisan bill, H.R. 3317, the Rolling Stock Protection
Act, to firmly and finally put an end to the practice of
sending American taxpayer dollars to Chinese-based
manufacturers of railcars and buses. The recent committee
passage of the Rolling Stock Protection Act is just one example
of the longstanding, bipartisan work of this committee to
ensure that Buy America policies are effective.
Buy America is not new to the transportation sector. The
first provisions date back to the Buy American Act of 1933,
which was the first Federal law to require domestic sourcing
preferences for items purchased with Federal funds.
The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, or STAA,
expanded Buy America provisions and stipulated that funds
authorized for Federal-aid highway projects, including transit,
rail, and road transportation, cannot be obligated unless the
steel, cement, and manufactured products used are produced in
the United States. STAA also directed the Federal Highway
Administration, FHWA, to develop its Buy America waiver
procedures to provide procurement requirement relief for grant
recipients under specific circumstances.
One such waiver, affirmed in a 1983 FHWA final rule,
exempted all manufactured products, other than steel and
cement, from Buy America provisions. However, this
``manufactured products'' waiver, which has been in place for
40 years, is now under review by the Biden administration, as
required by IIJA.
During the public comment period on the waiver's review,
the administration received more than 7,500 comments from
stakeholders, and I hope that our witnesses today will share
their thoughts on this important and pending process.
While I may not adamantly support everything IIJA did, one
thing it made very clear was that Buy America was critical. For
example, IIJA expanded Buy America provisions to federally
funded projects that had previously been exempt, including
transmission facilities, electric facility structures,
broadband infrastructure, and real property and buildings.
IIJA also included the Build America, Buy America Act,
which expanded domestic production preference for construction
materials in addition to iron, steel, and manufactured products
and extended those requirements to all infrastructure projects
that receive Federal funding, not just those authorized in the
bill.
Further, IIJA created the Made in America Office, as part
of the Office of Management and Budget, to provide and enforce
compliance guidance and evaluate waiver requests for project
applicants seeking exemptions under specific circumstances.
That said, since the enactment of IIJA, this committee has
continued to receive testimony raising concerns about the
implementation of Buy America. For example, despite direct
legislative language, the Biden administration took 15 months
to publish final guidance on Buy America implementation and
compliance.
To add to the confusion, during that same timeframe, the
U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, was advancing its
own waiver and exemption process guidance for grantees and
funding applicants, which included the issuance of a waiver for
all Buy America requirements for construction materials for
awards obligated over a 180-day period.
The contradictory guidance put forward by the Biden
administration on Buy America waivers continues to cause
project delays and regrettably leads to cost increases for the
businesses that build our roads and bridges as well as operate
the equipment in our transportation network.
States and industry need clear guidelines, including an
understanding of what is and is not required when applying for
a waiver, so that we can continue constructing a modern and
efficient transportation system reliant on American
manufacturing.
Our witnesses will offer their perspectives on the
continued implementation of Buy America and the opportunities
to continue growing and supporting domestic manufacturing.
Again, I thank them for appearing before us today.

Mr. Crawford. I now recognize Ranking Member Holmes Norton
for 5 minutes for an opening statement.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND
TRANSIT
Ms. Norton. I would like to thank subcommittee chair Rick
Crawford for holding this hearing on the implementation of Buy
America provisions.
Buy America is a foundational policy for our highway and
transit programs and for U.S. workers. These policies date back
to the late 1970s and have ensured that as States, localities,
and transit agencies build projects, they are also supporting
U.S. jobs and domestic supply chains.
Buy America ensures that taxpayers see double the benefit
in transportation projects: First, they see the safety or
mobility benefits of the project; second, the projects are
built with American products, creating good-paying jobs for
workers.
While the Federal highway and transit programs have
benefited from Buy America policies for over 45 years, that is
not true for every Federal infrastructure program. The passage
of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act changed that. The
law included the Build America, Buy America Act, a cornerstone
of the Biden administration's industrial policy. The law
extended domestic content requirements to all federally funded
infrastructure programs.
While highway and transit programs already included most of
these requirements, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
expanded Buy America to also cover construction materials.
This is a new policy for the Federal highway and transit
programs. Congress and the Biden administration must provide
State departments of transportation and transit agencies with
the resources they need to understand and comply with the new
requirements.
Another recent change is the Biden administration's policy
increasing Buy America standards for electric vehicle chargers.
These new standards will help us bring an emerging
manufacturing sector to the United States, while also helping
to reduce pollution in our communities. I was pleased that
President Biden vetoed the effort to overturn the increased
standards for electric vehicle chargers, and that these new,
stronger Buy America standards will stay on the books.
I also look forward to hearing from our witnesses about the
Buy America waiver process. While Buy America waivers should be
used judiciously, there are instances in which infrastructure
projects may require materials or products not made in the
United States. In those instances, the waiver process should be
fair and transparent to stakeholders.
Finally, I would be remiss not to mention this committee's
role in banning Federal transit funds from being used to
purchase transit rolling stock from Chinese state-owned
enterprises. That is a particularly critical policy here in the
National Capital region, home to much of the country's
intelligence and national security apparatus. I appreciate the
bipartisan work of my colleagues to confront that challenge.
I thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look
forward to working with you to improve and strengthen our
Nation's Buy America policies.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Delegate in
Congress from the District of Columbia, and Ranking Member,

I would like to thank Subcommittee Chair Rick Crawford for holding

Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Crawford. I thank the ranking member. I now recognize
the ranking member of the full committee for 1 minute--
actually, 5 minutes--for any comments he may----
Mr. Larsen of Washington . Yes, let me race
through this, then.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair and Ranking
Member, for holding this hearing.
Today's hearing focuses on the implementation of the Buy
America policy. And I want to thank all the witnesses for being
here today and for all your efforts to create jobs and
strengthen the U.S. manufacturing sector.
The subcommittee has jurisdiction over several agencies
that have decades of experience implementing Buy America
policies. The Federal Highway Administration and Federal
Transit Administration both were directed by Congress in the
1970s and 1980s to enforce domestic content requirements on
projects that use Federal funds. Since their enactment, these
requirements have been updated to respond to various issues
facing the U.S. economy.
Broadly speaking, current Buy America policies ensure that
federally funded transit, rail, and road transportation
projects cannot be built unless the iron, steel, manufactured
products, and certain construction materials used in those
projects are produced in the U.S. The intent of these policies
is to maximize the economic value of Federal infrastructure
investments in the U.S. and ensure taxpayer dollars benefit our
workers and companies.
Under the leadership of this administration, Democrats are
taking a proactive and strategic approach to create jobs and
strengthen the U.S. industrial base.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivered historic
investments to upgrade the Nation's infrastructure and expanded
domestic procurement policies through the Build America, Buy
America Act provisions in the BIL.
The law expanded Buy America coverage to all federally
funded infrastructure projects, including those that had
previously been exempt.
By requiring the use of products and materials made in the
U.S., the Build America, Buy America provisions have helped
stimulate private-sector investment in domestic manufacturing,
bolster critical supply chains, and support the creation of
good jobs so that America's workers and industries can compete
and lead globally.
Since the Biden administration took office, the economy has
added nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, and real manufacturing
construction spending in the U.S. has doubled since the
enactment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
This surge comes from a trio of policy achievements enacted
in the last Congress: the BIL, the Inflation Reduction Act, and
the CHIPS and Science Act.
These laws expanded Buy America provisions and provided
dedicated funding and incentives to encourage private
investment in our economy. This public spending has not crowded
out private spending. Real private spending on transportation
construction has grown by nearly 14 percent since the President
signed the BIL.
Following the enactment, this administration has faced
several competing priorities, including getting this historic
funding out quickly and efficiently--an issue this full
committee has analyzed and will continue to analyze--while
applying new and expanded domestic content requirements to
infrastructure projects. The administration has made clear that
it has a commitment to Buy America and enforcing these
requirements as soon as practically possible.
Additionally, the Biden administration is committed to
using waivers from Buy America in a limited and strategic
manner. In the past, broad and permanent waivers have diluted
the potential benefits of Buy America policies. And a lack of
targeted waivers, even when warranted, delayed critical
infrastructure projects.
Waivers, when issued appropriately, are a tool to signal
where gaps exist in the domestic supply chain or allow time for
compliance with stronger Buy America standards. Temporary and
targeted waivers send clear market signals, allowing for a
phase-in of domestic procurement preferences, which create an
incentive for firms to invest in the U.S. and create good jobs
in our communities.
For example, EV chargers were previously largely exempt
from Buy America under a 1983 general waiver for manufactured
products. Although not required to do so by law, the
administration extended Buy America coverage to EV chargers
under a phased-in implementation plan to give private-sector
companies in the U.S. time to adjust their supply chains. This
policy, which will be fully in effect in July, is already
spurring hundreds of millions of dollars of factory investments
and jobs for domestic EV charger production.
Failed attempts to repeal the standard would have resulted
in EV chargers again being exempt from Buy America, resulting
in taxpayer dollars going to overseas companies. So, I am
pleased the President vetoed this bad idea and instead honored
his commitment to our workers and manufacturers.
And yet I do continue to welcome the opportunity to
celebrate our infrastructure benefits that each of our
districts and constituents are reaping because of the BIL. The
committee continues delivering bipartisan solutions for all
Americans, and Buy America continues to enjoy broad bipartisan
support, and I look forward to today's discussion.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Washington, and Ranking Member, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Norton, for holding

Today's hearing focuses on the implementation of Buy America policy
and its impact on our economy.

Mr. Larsen of Washington. With that, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Just under a minute.
Mr. Crawford. I would now like to welcome our witnesses and
thank them for being here today.
Mr. Carlos Braceras, the executive director of the Utah
Department of Transportation, on behalf of the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
Mr. Ty Edmondson, CEO of the T.A. Loving Company, on behalf
of the Associated General Contractors of America.
Mr. Dan Needham, executive vice president at the Nucor
Corporation.
Mr. Brian Enders, vice president of the Walbec Group, on
behalf of the National Asphalt Pavement Association.
And Ms. Megan Salrin, legislative representative for the
United Steelworkers.
Briefly, I would like to take a minute to explain our
lighting system to our witnesses. It seems pretty self-
explanatory. There are three lights in front of you. Green
means go. But unlike a stoplight, yellow does not mean proceed
with caution, as you might expect.

Mr. Crawford. It means kick it into high gear, because you
are fixing to run out of time. And red will indicate that your
time has concluded, and we would ask you to conclude your
remarks. You might hear a little tap of the gavel, just to
remind you, in case you exceed that 5-minute mark. So, when it
turns red, just be advised.
And I ask unanimous consent the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided any
answers to any questions that may have been submitted to them
in writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 additional days for comments and any information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes.
Before our first witness, Mr. Braceras, gives testimony, I
would like to recognize Representative Owens to give a short
introduction.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chair. As I introduce my good
friend, Mr. Carlos Braceras, I would like to take a few minutes
to--I think it is very relevant to take a minute to brag on the
State we both serve.
Utah is a relatively small State, but we definitely push
above our weight in so many ways: the fastest growing State in
the union since 2020; one of the fastest growing States in
recovering from the economy, from COVID; most collaborative
between State, Federal, and local; and extremely innovative
because of our entrepreneurial culture. We are the State that
balances our budget every single year; we have state-of-the-art
airports, international, regional; we are building an inland
port that expands the length of our State, which will make Utah
the distribution hub of the West; and we were recently selected
as the site for the 2034 Winter Olympics.
Just this morning, I read that of the 400 cities ranked by
Milken Institute, Salt Lake City, Provo-Orem, and St. George
ranked in the top four of the best performing cities in the
Nation. At the heart of this smart growth is a vision of the
Utah's Department of Transportation, UDOT. At the head of UDOT
is Mr. Carlos Braceras.
Carlos joined the Utah Department of Transportation in 1986
and was appointed executive director in 2013. In this capacity,
he is responsible for UDOT's 1,600 employees and the design,
construction, and maintenance of Utah's 6,000 miles of roads
and highways. Under Carlos' leadership, UDOT continues to rise
to the challenge of our State's beautiful yet unique geography
and our explosive population growth. He has used innovation and
creativity to complete major highway expansions in record time.
In addition to his responsibility to UDOT, Carlos also
chairs the AASHTO Agency Administration Managing Committee, and
is the past president.
UDOT continues to represent what I call the ``Utah way,''
which is to lead.
And Carlos, I look forward to the members of the Highways
and Transit Subcommittee hearing your remarks and insight on
innovative work you have been doing back home. Welcome.
Mr. Crawford. With that, Mr. Braceras, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF CARLOS M. BRACERAS, P.E., EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UTAH
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN
ASSOCIATION OF STATE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS
(AASHTO)
Mr. Braceras. Chair Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for holding today's
hearing on Build America, Buy America. I am Carlos Braceras,
and I serve as the executive director of the Utah Department of
Transportation. I am also on the AASHTO board, including
serving as AASHTO's president in 2018 to 2019.
I want to thank this subcommittee for your leadership on
surface transportation issues that ultimately led to the
enactment of the IIJA. State DOTs have recognized since day one
of IIJA that the delivery of this historic investment is
paramount.
American money should be spent on American stuff to benefit
Americans. But at the end of the day, the true benefit is
realized through projects that we deliver to save lives and
make lives better. AASHTO and the State DOTs strongly support
the goal to increase American manufacturing capacity by
creating new domestic jobs and encouraging economic growth.
However, we also recognize this transformation cannot occur
overnight or with a flip of a switch.
When I am trying to do something really big, I usually find
it more effective to break it down into pieces. I think we will
be able to meet our shared goals of building the American
manufacturing base if we can remember Pareto's law: Focus on
what constitutes 80 percent of the value of projects being used
in transportation. No, this does not mean that we forget about
the other 20 percent, but recognize we are jumping on a very
fast-moving train.
Our transportation projects are moving forward quickly. For
more than 40 years, Buy America statutes have required domestic
manufacturing processes for iron, steel, and certain
manufactured products permanently incorporated into the Federal
highway and transit projects. IIJA significantly expanded
coverage to five categories of construction materials. With the
2024 transportation construction season on the horizon, State
DOTs are experiencing delays due to supply chain issues,
material availability, and, yes, continued worker shortages.
Now, while construction projects are accustomed to dealing
with complex realities, we are seeing further delays as part of
the industry effort to comply with BABA. While AASHTO
understands the difficult nature of implementing new BABA
requirements across the entire Federal Government, it is
important to recognize the disruption that occurs as a result
of changes to previously issued guidance. Programming projects
is like a symphony, so, some major changes to one single
project can have a cascading effect on timing and resource
allocations to very many projects.
Also, State DOTs expend significant effort to change
specifications, quality assurance, and other documentation, and
to train DOT employees, consultants, and contractors on how to
comply with guidance. Consistency and guidance will make our
teams more effective and efficient.
I want to highlight the importance of a timely and
transparent waiver process. Currently, many States would like
to see improvements in several areas: the time it takes for a
waiver to be processed, the level of effort and time required
to develop a waiver, and clearer guidance on what the required
documentation is.
I want to note that, for manufactured products, we have
been operating under the FHWA public interest waiver of general
applicability since 1983. FHWA is currently considering
termination of this waiver, which would represent an extreme
challenge for State DOTs and for manufacturers. We agree with
the 2013 FHWA determination that rescinding the waiver would
not have a significant impact on American manufacturing,
because manufactured products comprise a small percentage of
the cost for the highway construction program, which also means
it is a small share of the market for manufacturers.
In other words, the benefits are likely to be limited, and
the cost to schedules and budgets significant. If there is one
thing I hope you will take away from my testimony, it is the
importance of keeping the 1983 FHWA waiver of general
applicability in place.
To close, we firmly believe that a deliberative,
practitioner-informed process between Government and industry
should continue to guide implementation of Build America, Buy
America. This will ensure timely, cost-effective investments
and successful delivery of critical transportation
infrastructure projects funded through IIJA.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony at this
hearing, and I look forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement of Carlos M. Braceras, P.E., Executive Director,
Utah Department of Transportation, on behalf of the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
Introduction
Chair Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear today at this
important hearing on implementation of the Build America, Buy America
(BABA) requirements included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (IIJA).
My name is Carlos Braceras, and I serve as Executive Director of
the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) and on the Board of
Directors of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), including as AASHTO President in
2018 through 2019. Today, it is my honor to testify on behalf of
AASHTO, which represents the state departments of transportation (state
DOTs) of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
I first joined UDOT with degrees in engineering and geology in
1986. Prior to my appointment as the Executive Director in May 2013, I
served as the Deputy Director for twelve years with previous experience
as a Region Director, Major Project Manager, Chief Geotechnical
Engineer and Chief Value Engineer. In addition to serving as a past
AASHTO President, I am also Chair of the AASHTO Agency Administration
Managing Committee and Chair of the Technical Working Group of the
AASHTO Center for Environmental Excellence. I am also the past Chair
for the AASHTO Committee on Design.
I would like to extend AASHTO and UDOT's utmost gratitude to you
and your colleagues on the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit (the Subcommittee) for your
dedicated and tireless leadership on surface transportation policy that
ultimately led to the enactment of the IIJA. Stable and long-term
policy and funding provided through a robust multi-year federal surface
transportation bill remains crucial to the work of every single state
DOT to meet its goal of improving safety, mobility, and access for
everyone, which is articulated in AASHTO's 2021-2026 Strategic Plan.
Our country depends on a well-functioning transportation system for the
quality of life for all of our citizens and to remain economically
competitive.
At UDOT, our mission is to enhance quality of life through
transportation, and I would like to share several examples of how the
IIJA is supporting that mission. I will start with the Bridge Formula
Program, which has been one of the most valuable elements of IIJA for
Utah. We have identified 90 bridges for improvements, which we
prioritized with a goal to address as many locally-owned bridges as
possible; of the 90 bridges prioritized, 76 are locally owned. Without
the Bridge Formula Program, many of these bridges wouldn't be improved
for quite some time; however, after implementation of the five-year
program, all bridges that were in poor condition at the time of
prioritization will be addressed. This translates to increased safety
and accessibility in locations where needs are high and resources are
short.
Another formula fund program is supporting resilience in Utah. We
are using funds from the Promoting Resilient Operations for
Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT)
Formula Program to deliver projects that will mitigate wildfire and
flooding risks, which are common in Utah. We also hope to implement
another if we are able to obtain additional competitive grant funding
through the PROTECT program.
Next, through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI)
Formula Program, we will be able to expand availability of electric
vehicle charging infrastructure, especially to rural areas of our state
where very few options exist for communities and visitors. We have
awarded contracts for all Phase One sites in Utah, and we are now
working with private sector partners who will build and maintain the
sites.
Beyond formula funding programs, IIJA funding enables us to
continue forward with delivering the largest transportation program in
Utah's history. The IIJA's highway formula program was a crucial aspect
of the last surface reauthorization, and coupled with an extremely
robust state program in Utah, we are making a difference for all
citizens in our state. And even though we have more than two and a half
years before the IIJA funding expires, now is an ideal time to start
thinking about the next reauthorization.
With those many benefits in mind, I again thank the Subcommittee
for the opportunity to share input from the states. Today's hearing is
an example of Congress' important oversight responsibility on IIJA
implementation. By holding this hearing, the Subcommittee demonstrates
its understanding of the impact of BABA on translating resources
provided in the IIJA into programs, projects, and ultimately, tangible
benefits for the public. As the owners and operators of transportation
infrastructure in every corner of the country, state DOTs and AASHTO
greatly appreciate the opportunity to offer our perspective on this
vital issue.
State DOT's Support for Overall Intent of Build America, Buy America
From the very beginning of our developing nation, we have valued
investment in our transportation system--starting with rivers, harbors,
and post roads. We recognize that a well-functioning and safe
transportation system is the foundation of a strong economy and
provides quality of life benefits such as access to employment,
education, recreational, and health services opportunities. It is this
interconnected multimodal national transportation system that has
enabled the United States to become the most vibrant and powerful
nation in history.
Thanks to Congress, we have been able to continue honoring our
nation's commitment to transportation investment through the IIJA.
State DOTs have recognized since Day 1 of the IIJA in November 2022
that delivery on this historic investment is paramount. AASHTO and the
state DOTs have been partnering closely with the federal executive
branch including the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)
in providing coordination, collaboration, and direct assistance to
ensure that the benefits promised by the law are fully realized.
As you know, a key policy priority included in the IIJA pertains to
new BABA requirements. AASHTO and the state DOTs remain unwavering in
our strong support of the goal to increase America's manufacturing
capacity by creating new domestic jobs and encouraging economic growth;
however, we also recognize this transformation can't occur overnight or
with the flip of a switch. As such, we firmly believe that a
deliberative and practitioner-informed process between government and
industry should continue to guide implementation of BABA. This will
ensure timely, cost-effective investments and successful delivery of
critical transportation infrastructure projects funded through the
IIJA.
Improving Execution of Build America, Buy America To Remove Obstacles
to Project Delivery
For more than 40 years, Buy America statutes have required a
domestic manufacturing process for iron, steel and certain manufactured
products permanently incorporated into federal-aid highway and transit
projects. The IIJA expanded Buy America coverage to five categories of
construction materials: non-ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based
products, glass, lumber, and drywall.
With the 2024 transportation construction season on the horizon,
there remains significant concern regarding the readiness of industry
for the transition to recent and anticipated increases in BABA
requirements. State transportation agencies are continuing to
experience material and product delivery delays due to supply chain
issues, material shortages, and worker shortages. Materials including
aluminum, which is used in numerous products including light poles,
mast arms, and sign panels; glass beads, which are used in retro-
reflective pavement markings; fiber optic cable; epoxy; and plastic
pipe/conduit have been in short supply around the country over the past
two years--contributing to ongoing delivery delays for these critical
items. While construction projects are accustomed to complex realities
of utility relocation, we are seeing further delays as part of states'
efforts to comply with BABA.
Specific examples of state DOTs experiencing delays are as follows:
Utilities present particular challenges for many states.
Delaware has experienced significant delays in design on several
projects as some utility companies have been unwilling to sign project
agreements with BABA requirements. In addition, there are several
projects that the state DOT and utility companies have jointly decided
to change from advance utility work to concurrent project utility work
to address utility company BABA concerns. Their preference would have
been for advance work. There is now a possibility that changing the
process from advance utility work to concurrent work will delay the
overall project once construction begins.
Georgia is experiencing delays primarily due to utilities
failing to sign agreements because of BABA provisions. This is because
utility companies would have to source materials outside of their
regular operations and specifically for projects that have federal
funding. This has contributed to project delays at award and during
construction. Numerous questions persist on interpretation of BABA
requirements and inconsistent application across jurisdictions and
agencies.
Project challenges related to BABA extend beyond
utilities. California was unable to locate a domestic source for a key
element of an emergency project. They procured a non-domestic source
item for temporary use, while a domestic sourced item could be
procured. As a result, they incurred the additional cost of the
temporary nondomestic item, experienced an approximately four-month
project delay in accepting the contract, and expended additional
capital and support costs during the extended delay.
On a safety-related project, one of California's standard sole-
source products was found to be non-domestically manufactured and
subject to the polymer-based construction material requirements of Buy
America. This issue was identified prior to advertisement, and they
were able to specify a more expensive product that had been used in
more critical safety zones, produced by the same manufacturer at one of
their domestic facilities. As these safety-related items undergo pre-
qualification testing for safety performance, finding domestic
substitutes can create delays. Changing Buy America requirements
requires an implementation period of 18 months to allow for alternative
domestic materials and products to be identified, tested, and specified
without producing significant project delays and associated costs.
Maine has experienced challenges with procuring BABA-
compliant glass beads and marine decking, leading to project delivery
difficulties. With the removal of the manufactured product waiver,
Maine will need to request relief on products such as composites (e.g.,
Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic) from Canada, traffic signal equipment
from Mexico, and geosynthetics from Asia. In addition, Maine relies on
Canadian precast producers to meet the need for precast prestressed
girders, precast culverts, and other transportation related precast
products. The limited number of BABA-compliant precasters in the
northeastern United States and the impracticality of trucking heavy
precast elements long distances will increase costs and limit overall
production.
Nebraska has had difficulty securing silane sealers, as
they are not currently produced in the United States. Silane sealers
are vital in sealing and pausing the deteriorating effects on concrete
caused by Alikli-Silica Reactions. In addition, Nebraska has very
reactive aggregates used across the state on roadway concrete projects;
the state has not been able to program older in-place concrete roadways
that were constructed with inadequate amounts of supplementary
cementitious materials like Class F fly ash, as no other viable Buy
America product performs similarly.
North Dakota cannot procure submersible pumps for lift
stations that are Buy America compliant. Submersible pumps for lift
stations play a vital role in managing groundwater and stormwater in
road construction projects.
With that said, AASHTO appreciates the actions taken to date by the
Biden Administration since enactment of the IIJA to help with
transitioning to the new BABA statutory provisions. We specifically
recognize the following actions:
January 2023: Waiver of the construction materials
requirement for certain ``grandfathered'' projects in advanced stages
of procurement.
August 2023: Finalized and enacted a ``de minimis''
waiver from all Buy America requirements for the lesser of $1,000,000
or 5 percent of certain covered components and materials on a project,
or for entire projects that include less than $500,000 in federal
funding.
October 2023: The White House Made in America Office
(MIAO) updated ``high-level coordinating guidance'' for implementation
of Buy America and similar programs that took effect on Oct. 23, 2023.
This MIAO guidance included:
+ Reaffirmation that Buy America does not cover tools, equipment
or supplies not ``incorporated'' into the project.
+ Adding three new standalone categories of covered construction
materials to those specified by Congress--fiber optic cable (including
drop cable), optical fiber, and engineered wood.
+ Confirmation of Congress' intent that covered construction
materials do not include ``cement and cementitious materials,
aggregates such as stone, sand, or gravel, or aggregate binding agents
or additives.'' However, MIAO contends these materials can be covered
if included in manufactured products, such as precast concrete.
Importance of Consistency in Federal Guidance
Congress intended the IIJA to spur expansion of America's
manufacturing capacity, promote the creation of jobs across the
country, and encourage economic growth. To ensure timely and successful
delivery of critical infrastructure projects enabled under IIJA, the
White House MIAO, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and USDOT
should deploy a deliberative, practitioner- and industry-informed
process for BABA implementation.
While AASHTO understands the complex nature of implementing the new
BABA requirements across the entire federal government, it is important
to recognize the disruption that occurs when OMB and USDOT frequently
update and alter previously issued guidance. Every state DOT expends
significant effort to change specification language, quality assurance
language, and other documentation and to train state DOT employees on
how to comply with any guidance.
Consistency not only helps state DOTs but also our transportation
industry partners. Therefore, it is important that any issued guidance
not be a moving target. As state DOTs prepare, plan, and design
projects for 2024 bid lettings, it is important to ensure that the
transportation industry is prepared for and fully understands the new
BABA requirements. Uncertainty related to BABA guidance due to frequent
revisions to the process on how to comply with the law can impact the
ability to adequately source and procure products, can increase costs,
and lead to possible project delays.
In Utah, our teams are grappling with the distinction between
general manufactured parts in contrast with project-incorporated
manufactured parts. This uncertainty creates several difficulties.
First, UDOT staff and our contractors are spending significant
additional time researching and trying to make their own determinations
about compliance. In cases where our teams are uncertain and need
further guidance, they are unable to accurately estimate budgets and
schedules without either clarification or waivers, or both. This causes
delays for the projects in question, and it also has cascading effects
on other projects. Programming projects is like a symphony, so major
changes to one project can affect timing and resource allocation for
other projects.
Additional uncertainty arises even when we are sure of BABA
compliance with certain materials. Costs and availability of such
products tend to be less stable, which can cause problematic variables
and delays when developing and delivering a transportation program.
Need for a Transparent and Workable Waiver Process
It is important that the BABA waiver process at the White House and
USDOT be timely and transparent, including clear indication of when the
federal agency received the waiver request. States report that the
waiver process and expectations of approval are not clear. States that
have not submitted waiver requests report that the lack of a clear
process remains a barrier in seeking approval in the first place.
Specifically, there are three main factors contributing to this
barrier:
The time that it takes for the waiver to be processed
exceeds the time limit on project deadlines;
The level of effort and time required to submit a waiver
may not be worth putting forth when the outcome and timing of the
outcome are so uncertain, and;
The required documentation and supporting evidence to be
submitted is unclear.
Of the states who have used the waiver process and responded to
AASHTO's inquiry, all of them would like to see improvements. The most
critical area in which improvement is needed is clarity on the specific
rules of when a waiver is required. A more transparent process for
submitting a waiver request--including specific listings of required
documentation--would provide greater support for states. Additionally,
a set timeline for when to expect a decision on the waiver can help
states plan more effectively.
The challenges imposed by the waiver request process are also
burdening states with additional workforce requirements necessary to
carry out the documentation requirements necessary to comply with BABA.
States have been facing challenges to maintain full-time staff just to
process routine documentation associated with construction projects.
Unfortunately, time-consuming administrative tasks related to BABA
waiver requests add further strain to state DOT staff and reduce their
capacity to support non-federally funded transportation projects and
infrastructure that would otherwise complement and leverage investments
driven by the IIJA.
Review and Potential Rescission of Manufactured Products Waiver
The IIJA requires federal agencies to review existing general
applicability waivers of Buy America requirements. Using traditional
waiver authority, FHWA issued a public interest waiver of general
applicability of FHWA's Buy America requirement for manufactured
products (Manufactured Products General Waiver) in 1983. Through this
waiver, FHWA does not currently apply Buy America requirements to
manufactured products except for predominantly steel and iron
manufactured products, predominantly steel and iron components of
manufactured products, and covered construction materials. Termination
of this waiver would represent a major challenge and an additional
administrative burden for state DOTs and manufacturers.
Given the wide range of products used in transportation and the
global sourcing that has been established over the past several
decades, this type of new requirement could lead to project cost
increases and delays. Moreover, we believe the challenges from removing
the current general applicability waiver for manufactured products will
greatly outweigh any benefits to the domestic manufacturing capacity in
this country.
In 2013, FHWA maintained its original finding from 1983 that the
waiver of Buy America for manufactured products does not have any
significant impact on American manufacturing since manufactured
products comprise a small percent of the highway construction program.
AASHTO believes the original justification for granting the general
applicability waiver for manufactured products still applies.
State DOTs use a broad range of manufactured products on their
projects supported by the Federal-aid Highway Program. Many of these
products--or significant components of the products--are not readily
available domestically. This includes products such as traffic signals,
cameras, luminaires, controllers, cabinets, changeable message signs,
and traffic management system components. Without the continuation of
the current general applicability waiver of Buy America requirements
for manufactured products, the ability of state DOTs to deliver the
Federal-aid Highway Program will likely be impacted by project delays
that could affect the safety of the traveling public and the operation
of our road and highway system, which is a critical link in the
delivery of our already strained supply chains.
State DOTs also foresee significant challenges with tracking and
documenting compliance with any new manufactured product requirements.
As with the new requirements for construction materials, States have
resource constraints that would make the administration of additional
Buy America requirements even more difficult. This includes additional
owner and contractor staff time needed to collect and evaluate
documentation verifying the percentage of domestic content of numerous
and widely varied manufactured products. In addition, from the
manufacturing side, consistency in the implementation of requirements
across such a broad cross-section of products will be challenging,
creating additional burdens on the private sector manufacturers and
suppliers of these products.
If FHWA decides to rescind or narrow the applicability of the
current Buy America waiver for manufactured products, state DOTs and
industry will need sufficient notice and time to allow for an orderly
transition. Market conditions and supply chains for manufactured
products used in Federal-aid construction projects have developed over
several decades, and these processes would take multiple years to adapt
to a new way of doing business.
AASHTO recommends USDOT and FHWA conduct market research and focus
application of BABA on a limited number of manufactured product
categories that will have the most significant impact on American
manufacturing and expand this focus incrementally if tangible and
positive impacts are realized. It would be unrealistic to immediately
require American-made products in categories where a domestic industry
is not currently in place or envisioned to develop in the near future.
Furthermore, USDOT and FHWA should continue seeking ways to prevent
project disruptions caused by difficulties in certifying commercially
available off-the-shelf (COTS) components.
In Utah some of our contractors report that they are unwilling to
bid on certain projects because of the impractical amount of time
required to obtain and document manufactured products. In such cases,
they report that the cost to track compliance and quantities is simply
not worth their time, especially when the materials in question
represent a small portion of the overall project cost. The unintended
consequence is a decrease in competition and, in some cases, extreme
difficulty being able to deliver certain projects because contractors
cannot justify the business case.
Streamlining Certification with AASHTO Industry Document Repository
Absent the recommended improvements to BABA implementation
requirements as noted above, individual states are relying on their own
certification processes, with many states looking to self-certification
by their contractors and suppliers. To assist with certification,
AASHTO is looking to enable collaboration between state agencies,
contractors, designers and suppliers on developing a centralized
listing of domestically made construction materials complying with the
new Buy America requirements.
AASHTO's Product Evaluation and Audit Solutions (APEAS) technical
service program released a new tool in May 2023 known as the Industry
Document Repository (IDR). The IDR provides manufacturers and
distributors with an interface to upload and manage documentation and
associate each upload with an existing product previously evaluated by
APEAS. Additionally, industry users can assign and manage tags to
associate these uploads with specific states and agencies, while
providing categorization for BABA purposes. Documents uploaded by
industry are made available to state DOTs, which can greatly streamline
the certification effort.
Conclusion
Thank you for allowing me to share AASHTO's and its state DOT
membership perspectives--including those of Utah--on BABA
implementation. As I noted, states strongly support the policy intent
of BABA to strengthen domestic industry in delivering needed
transportation programs and projects. At the same time, states continue
to have significant concerns regarding the readiness of industry for
this transition and the near-term negative impact on the delivery of
needed transportation projects in communities around the country.
We believe that additional preparatory work--including robust
market research into the availability of American-made goods in the
broad cross-section of materials covered by the new BABA requirements--
needs to be undertaken at the federal level to ensure a less disruptive
transition to domestic products while providing the necessary time for
adjustments in the sourcing of listed construction materials.
Ultimately, critical infrastructure projects intended to improve
safety, mobility, and access for everyone should not be disrupted while
transportation agencies and their partners continue to make best-faith
efforts to integrate the new BABA requirements into their program and
project delivery processes.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony at this hearing
and I look forward to your questions.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Braceras. I will now recognize
Mr. Edmondson for 5 minutes.
TESTIMONY OF TY EDMONDSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND
PRESIDENT, T.A. LOVING COMPANY, ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED
GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA (AGC)
Mr. Edmondson. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton,
and members of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, thank
you for inviting me to testify on this vitally important topic.
My name is Ty Edmondson, and I am the CEO and president of T.A.
Loving Company and a board member of the Associated General
Contractors of America, where I serve as chair of the Utility
Infrastructure Division.
T.A. Loving Company was founded in Goldsboro, North
Carolina, in 1925. Today, the company employs more than 400
construction professionals who work on transportation, water,
education, healthcare, and other essential facilities and civil
infrastructure projects.
In my testimony today, I will discuss the implementation of
the Build America, Buy America Act as it relates to the
construction industry.
Before I continue, I want to be clear. I am not here today
to debate the merits of Buy America. I, along with AGC, support
the efforts to expand domestic manufacturing capabilities.
In addition, I would like to mention that the challenges I
will be discussing today mostly do not pertain to iron and
steel materials, as similar requirements for such products date
back decades. The IIJA expanded coverage to construction
materials and tasked the OMB with providing guidance to the
industry stakeholders and to be the ultimate decisionmaker for
waivers.
So, what does all this mean for construction companies
bidding on a road project?
After the State DOT opens a project for bidding,
construction companies work to put together a proposal. We
reach out to the suppliers to get estimates for the various
materials. Since we are ultimately responsible, we ask for what
they refer to as a ``Buy America certification letter'' that
guarantees to the contractor that these materials are
compliant.
Since the passage of IIJA, we have asked suppliers for
certification letters and instead get asterisks on their quotes
saying they cannot certify compliance. This is particularly
prevalent with manufactured products such as permanent traffic
management and safety equipment. Put simply, there is
uncertainty.
In construction, that means increased costs because
contractors have to account for that in their bids to mitigate
risk. How can an individual contractor be expected to adhere to
rules and regulations when it's a moving target? Such
situations are especially challenging for smaller companies
like a DBE, who lack the resources of a larger company.
Currently, my company is having difficulty sourcing the
following materials and products, among others: geotextiles,
LED lighting, electrical components, signal cabinets,
generators, pumps, motors, UV disinfection equipment, and PFAS
treatment systems and media.
Historically, the waiver process has not been transparent
or efficient. For example, a waiver request for the Illinois
DOT for nondomestic pumps took more than 2 years to be posted
for public comment and allow a manufacturer to respond that
they have the compliant product. Unfortunately, cases such as
these are not isolated instances and result in unintended
consequences such as project delays, material substitutions,
project redesigns, or contractors opting not to bid on a
project.
With OMB's latest memorandum, a Federal agency must also
consult with the OMB on the waiver scope prior to public
comment and after the comment period ends to have the OMB make
the final decision. This is akin to requiring a local school
district to contact the Department of Education twice to
approve a child's absence note to verify that the child can
return to school.
The requirement also adds unnecessary political pressure.
Because of these concerns, AGC and other stakeholders filed
a formal request for rulemaking today. We are urging the White
House to drop its current approach to the waiver process and
focus on implementing the requirements at a higher level and
empower Federal agencies with broad discretion to fill in the
details for projects they understand best.
I thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify
today, and I look forward to answering any questions you may
have.

Prepared Statement of Ty Edmondson, Chief Executive Officer and
President, T.A. Loving Company, on behalf of the Associated General
Contractors of America (AGC)
I. Introduction
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and members of the
Subcommittee on Highway and Transit, thank you for inviting me to
testify on this vitally important topic. My name is Ty Edmondson, and I
am the CEO & President of T.A. Loving Company and a board member of the
Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) where I serve as Chair
of the Utility Infrastructure Division.
AGC is the leading association in the construction industry,
representing more than 27,000 firms, including America's leading
general contractors and specialty-contracting firms, many of which are
small businesses. Many of the nation's service providers and suppliers
are also associated with AGC through a nationwide network of chapters.
AGC contractors are both union and open shop and are engaged in the
construction of the nation's highways, bridges, transit systems,
airports, waterworks facilities, waste treatment facilities, commercial
buildings, shopping centers, factories, warehouses, levees, locks,
dams, water conservation projects, defense facilities, multi-family
housing projects, and more. In 2020, 91% of firms within the
construction industry had 20 or fewer employees.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
T.A. Loving Company was founded in Goldsboro, North Carolina in
1925. For nearly 100 years, our firm has played an essential part in
the growth of our home state and the country by building thousands of
construction projects across the southeast and as far away as
California. T.A. Loving Company is responsible for historic
undertakings including the construction of Fort Bragg, now Fort
Liberty, a watershed project for our company at the outset of World War
II, and the construction of the Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama--a
national historic landmark.
Our work has taken T.A. Loving Company's workforce to numerous
states, and over the course of 99 years--our company has provided
gainful employment and career opportunities to more than 35,000
Americans. Those people and projects have provided the Southeast with
access to clean water resources, improved transportation, educational
opportunities, life-saving healthcare, and other essential facilities
and civil infrastructure.
Today, T.A. Loving Company employs more than 400 construction
professionals and continues to build across North Carolina, Virginia,
and South Carolina.
In my testimony today, I will discuss the implementation of the
Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA) as it relates to the
construction industry, including the challenges that it poses in
efforts to rebuild our nation's transportation infrastructure.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) represents the
most significant infusion of investment in our infrastructure since the
enactment of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950's. Under the
IIJA, Congress broadened Buy America requirements for transportation
projects. I want to be clear; I am not here today to debate the merits
of Buy America. I, along with AGC, wholeheartedly support efforts to
expand domestic manufacturing capabilities. However, implementation has
been confusing and unclear, creating uncertainty that has led to
unintended consequences for construction companies, facility owners,
and overall, our nation's infrastructure.
My testimony today will shed light on both the obstacles presented
by BABAA implementation within our industry and pragmatic actions that
could mitigate the challenges for construction companies so that we can
rebuild our nation's infrastructure without unnecessary delays and
burdens.
And before I begin, I'd like to mention that the challenges and
actions that I will be discussing today mostly do not pertain to iron
and steel materials. Our members have not reported issues with domestic
sourcing of iron and steel, as similar sourcing requirements for them
date back to the 1930s and have had a much greater amount of time to
adjust their processes to meet requirements.
II. Expansion of Buy America Policies
Buy America policies have been present in federal aid
transportation projects since they were included in an amendment to the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. The primary aim of this
legislation was to foster and safeguard specific domestic manufacturing
industries by mandating that iron, steel, and manufactured products
utilized in federally assisted highway and rail projects be produced
within the United States.
Over subsequent years, Buy America requirements expanded to include
additional infrastructure sectors, such as water-related projects and
aviation. However, the largest expansion of such domestic sourcing
requirements was included in the IIJA with the BABAA.
BABAA expanded coverage to all other infrastructure projects funded
by federal dollars such as electric utilities and broadband. Moreover,
BABAA broadened the scope of covered materials to include all other
metals in addition to iron and steel, along with plastic and polymers,
lumber, drywall, and glass.
As part of the IIJA, the White House's Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) was tasked with providing guidance to industry
stakeholders on the specifics of the requirements. Preliminary guidance
was issued on April 18, 2022, and the law was slated to take effect
less than a month later, on May 14, 2022.\2\ The short notice prompted
numerous federal agencies to request sweeping general applicability
waivers from BABAA as they were necessary to assess the changes, update
policies, train staff, and allow partners to do the same while
adjusting supply chains to meet the new requirements. As a reminder,
this was during a time when, at least from the construction industry's
standpoint, the supply chain crisis and inflation were at its worst.

Agencies https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite many of these sweeping waivers being in effect for over six
months, it seemed that the law would not come into effect for most
infrastructure projects until the beginning of 2023. However, on
February 9, 2023, just as federal agencies were finalizing their
policies and their partners were finishing administrative requirements,
such as material lists and certificates of compliance, OMB released a
Notice for Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), exploring options to expand Buy
America requirements beyond what the IIJA entailed.\3\ The timing of
the NPRM also led to federal agencies and their partners, such as state
DOTs, pausing from updating their policies, as there was now the sudden
possibility that the work put into the preliminary guidance might be
rendered obsolete, with expanded requirements for more materials and
more stringent criteria for already covered materials.

\3\ Guidance for Grants and Agreements https://
www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/09/2023-02617/guidance-for-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the final guidance being released on October 25, 2023, many
stakeholders have yet to adjust their policies, contracts, and supply
chains to ever changing and ever-expanding requirements.\4\ While
initially the category of ``construction materials'' required that the
last and second to last manufacturing steps be taken in America to be
BABAA compliant, the final guidance expanded those requirements by
adding additional manufacturing steps that have to take place in the
U.S. For example, aluminum would need to have from initial smelting and
melting through to final shaping, coating, and assembly occur
domestically to be compliant. In addition to expanding manufacturing
requirements, more items were added that were not included in the IIJA
and BABAA, including engineered wood and optical fiber. With a two-
month timeline for the expansive requirements to go into effect, the
industry is once again scrambling to try to meet requirements that were
released without due considerations for domestic manufacturing
capabilities to meet these requirements and stakeholder's abilities to
adjust their procedures and supply chains.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agencies https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/M-24-02-
Buy-America-Implementation-Guidance-Update.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To illustrate the rushed implementation of these requirements, you
can visit many of the state DOT's websites to see that nearly six
months after final manufacturing requirements have gone into effect,
many have yet to update their policies, forms, material lists and/or
contract language. This is not an attack on state DOTs, but just
highlights that such sweeping and expansive requirements necessitate a
much greater phase-in period than has been afforded.
So, what does all of this mean for construction companies bidding
on a road project, for example? After the state DOT lets a project,
construction companies like mine work to put together a bid for the
project. We reach out to suppliers to get estimates for the various
materials and as part of the estimation process. And we ask for what
they refer to as a ``Buy America Certification Letter'' that guarantees
to the contractor that these materials are Buy America compliant. We
then keep these certification letters on hand in case of a Buy America
audit.
Since the passage of the IIJA, what we have seen is a lot of bids
from suppliers come with an asterisk, denoting that the supplier cannot
certify that these materials are Buy America compliant. We now have
added risk to this project because our suppliers are unable to make
this certification. Some companies will now choose not to move forward
with a bid, while others will add in extra cost to account for this
unknown risk.
In an effort to tackle these issues, AGC chapters throughout the
nation have been engaging with their state DOTs on the implementation
process. To highlight the work in my home state, Carolinas AGC has been
working with the North Carolina DOT through a joint committee to
identify possible problems and provide solutions associated with
meeting BABAA requirements. I believe that NCDOT has been making
positive steps in implementing the new requirements, but it is
important to keep in mind that each state DOT is responsible for their
own implementation and as such, vary greatly between each other.
III. Regulatory Burdens Create Uncertainty and Further Increase Costs
Confusion surrounding new Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA)
requirements
While AGC supports efforts to bolster American manufacturing
capabilities, it is imperative that such efforts are executed with
clarity and without unduly burdening those tasked with procuring
materials for the construction of our nation's infrastructure.
Unfortunately, OMB's implementation process, as previously
highlighted, has been characterized by hasty implementation processes
and requirements that insufficiently account for existing manufacturing
capabilities, material delivery timelines, and the administrative
adjustments necessary to adhere to the new mandates. Put simply, there
is uncertainty. In construction, uncertainty means increased costs
because contractors have to account for that in their bids to mitigate
this risk.
The recent Request for Information (RFI), jointly issued by various
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT),
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD), exemplifies how the Administration has
imposed requirements on local agencies and contractors without a
comprehensive understanding of the availability of various manufactured
products essential to infrastructure construction.\5\ Despite the
incorporation of BABAA requirements into contracts since May 14, 2022,
federal agencies are still in the information-gathering phase, as
evidenced by activities such as this RFI occurring as recently as
December 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Request for Information Regarding Products and Categories of
Products Used in Water Infrastructure Programs https://www.epa.gov/
system/files/documents/2023-11/epa-hq-ow-2023-0396-0001.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can individual contractor firms be expected to adhere to rules
and regulations when the enforcing agencies lack an understanding of
the availability of materials required for compliance in the first
place? While some firms have dedicated or partially dedicated personnel
to handle Buy America requirements, T.A. Loving Company does not have
such staffers to support these requirements. Our project teams are the
ones faced with additional responsibilities to meet Buy America
regulations. This is especially challenging if you were a smaller
construction company trying to bid on a project, as it adds additional
responsibilities to workers already wearing many different hats.
The process for contractors becomes even more complicated if they
do work with more than one state or local government. For example,
because there is no federal listing of what specific products fall
under the categories of ``construction materials'' and ``manufactured
products'' as outlined in BABAA, a firm working with two state DOTs
could face different interpretations for the same construction
material. AGC members have noted that a specific product could be
classified as ``construction material'' by one state DOT while another
will classify it as a ``manufactured product.'' Under BABAA and OMB
requirements, these two classifications require vastly different
manufacturing requirements, forcing a contractor to be able to source
the same product that goes into a job site, but with different ways of
manufacturing that product.
Material Availability is Still an Issue
Since 2020, supply chain disruptions have posed significant
challenges for the construction industry. We have experienced increased
material delivery times and shortages that have delayed projects. While
the American public was well-aware of lumber shortages and the
subsequent surge in prices, our industry experienced similar scenarios
with many other materials that were much less publicized. In many
instances contractors encountered difficulties in locating the
necessary materials required to initiate or conclude projects.
Just in 2022 and 2023, AGC data reflect that:
93% of contractors experienced issues with acquiring
materials \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ AGC's 2022 Buy America Materials Survey https://www.agc.org/
news/construction-material-shortages-risk-undermining-infrastructure-
projects-most-contractors-struggle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
65% of contractors experienced project delays due to
longer material delivery times or shortages.\7\

workers-construction-careers-and-how
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
35% of contractors experienced delays due to the
government (lack of approvals, inspectors, etc.).
While the worst of the supply chain constraints and inflation seem
to be behind us, challenges still exist with long delivery times and
certain material shortages. The public comments by stakeholders,
including AGC, for the aforementioned Request for Information by the
EPA and DOT demonstrate that many materials still require over a year
for delivery after an order has been placed. Although the project
delivery process may enable contractors to procure these materials in
time for projects breaking ground, it can still result in substantial
delays in cases where additional materials are needed for an ongoing
project.
These shortages and prolonged delivery times are for materials that
are not Buy America compliant. With IIJA funding hitting the ground and
BABAA requirements coming into effect, compliant materials, if
available at all, will experience disproportionate demand that has the
potential to exasperate existing supply chain problems.
Currently, my company is having difficulty sourcing the following
materials and products:
Geotextiles (engineering fabric)
LED lighting
Electrical Components including switchgear, transformers,
controls and switches
Signal cabinets
Generators
Pumps
Motors
Aeration equipment
Ultraviolet disinfection equipment
Valve actuators
PFAS treatment systems and media
Brass products
Water meters and associated communication devices
While it would be ideal for the industry to have a manufacturing
base that can produce all necessary products for the construction of
our highways and transit, the reality is that certain essential
products lack domestic manufacturers. Even if manufacturing plants were
to be established in response to the demand for such products, our
industry requires a more phased approach that would allow these plants
to actually be built and scaled to meet production demands. Otherwise,
stringent BABAA requirements could impede infrastructure construction.
Whenever AGC has raised concerns about the challenges posed by the
current BABAA implementation process, the Administration has
consistently referred to the waiver process outlined in BABAA and its
15-day timeline for approval or rejection. However, OMB's
implementation of the waiver process and historical precedent with
waivers paints a different picture.
De-Politicize Buy America Waiver Requests
Past Experience Sets a Bad Precedent
The burdensome Buy America waiver process often leads to unintended
consequences. As an example of flaws within the system, on August 28,
2023, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) posted for comment a
waiver request from the Illinois Department of Transportation (ILDOT)
for non-domestic pumps.\8\ The waiver was initially submitted by the
Illinois DOT to FHWA on May 21, 2021. How are U.S. DOT and the White
House supposed to determine if there are domestic manufacturers or not
if the public is not made aware of the waiver request for nearly two
and a half years? In this instance, a supplier responded to the posted
waiver request and confirmed that they could indeed meet the
requirements and supply those pumps. While this appears to be a ``good
news'' story, it is frustrating that two years were wasted in the
process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Notice of Buy America Waiver Request--ILDOT https://
www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/contracts/waivers.cfm?id=175
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among the waiver process' unintended consequences is its
politicization, which unfortunately appears to be embedded within the
system. For example, on June 24, 2020, a waiver request was made to
FHWA for the installation and maintenance of a suicide deterrent system
on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, CA, where an average of 30
people die from suicide each year.\9\ Despite the fact that this
critical construction request was made in June 2020, the waiver was not
posted for 15 months and a determination on this life-saving waiver
request was not made until nearly two years after the initial request,
on February 7, 2022. This delay shows that the politicization of
waivers is a bipartisan problem occurring across multiple
administrations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Notice of Buy America Waiver Request--Golden Gate Bridge
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/contracts/waivers.cfm?id=157
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To illustrate how slow the process can be, there are waiver
requests dating back to 2016 that have not yet been given any
determination and are still pending on FHWA's website. For a list of
additional examples that demonstrate the slow nature of the waiver
process so far, please see Figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix. It is
important to note that the examples I have shared with you are waiver
requests under Buy America requirements prior to the expansion of
requirements under BABAA. With the new BABAA rules, the waiver process
could get a lot worse since the number of materials that it applies to
is expanded.
The lack of confidence in the Buy America waiver system has led to
some unintended consequences. First, as was already mentioned, it
causes project delays when a seemingly insignificant component cannot
be sourced domestically. Second, project owners and designers may opt
to substitute original materials with domestically available
alternatives. This might not always be a feasible option and it raises
the risk of someone using substandard materials that miss the project's
initial goals and requirements. Third, they can change the scope of the
project to not require that material. And fourth, contractors either
ultimately choose to not bid on a project or build increased costs into
the bid to ensure they can account for this uncertainty.
OMB Added More Steps to the Waiver Process
A memorandum released by OMB on October 25, 2023, mandates that
federal agencies notify and consult with the Made in America Office
before posting proposed waivers for public comment.\10\ This additional
requirement is poised to further extend the timeline between a project
stakeholder's waiver request and the public's opportunity to comment on
its necessity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ M-24-02 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and
Agencies, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/M-24-
02-Buy-America-Implementation-Guidance-Update.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To clarify, prior to BABAA, a funding recipient (usually the local
government agency in charge of the project) had to request a waiver
from the federal agency providing the funding and then have that
federal agency make a determination on the waiver's merits and
necessity after posting the waiver request for public comment. With
BABAA and OMB's latest memorandum, a local government agency now has to
navigate the following waiver process:
I. The local agency has to request a waiver and send it to the
federal agency.
II. The federal agency must consult with the OMB on the waiver's
scope prior to publishing for public comments.
III. Once the consultation is finished and modifications are made
to the request by the White House, the federal agency can finally post
the request for public comments.
IV. After the comment period ends, the federal agency has to go
back to the OMB's Made in America Office to have them make a final
decision on whether the waiver is granted or not.
V. Once the decision by the OMB has been made, the federal agency
will inform the local agency of the decision.
While agencies should publish Buy America waiver requests for
public comment as soon as they receive them, OMB says otherwise. The
BABAA waiver system implemented by OMB is akin to requiring a local
school district to contact the Department of Education twice to approve
a child's absence note to verify that the child can return to school.
In this comparison, the Department of Education thinks the school
district is incapable of properly verifying attendance. The president
appoints the head of the Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, and Federal Transit Administration. The idea that the
highest office in the land cannot trust its own appointed and capable
managers and agencies to make decisions is alarming and exhibits the
degree to which construction projects are being micromanaged at the
highest level of government.
Involving the White House with Buy America Waivers Makes it More
Political
The requirement for the White House to have the ultimate decision
on any waiver request introduces the potential for the politicization
of the waiver process. The requirement for the Made in America Office
to be the final decision maker for waiver approvals and denials is not
included in the IIJA. This requirement comes from Executive Order 14005
``Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's
Workers,'' which directs OMB to be involved in every single waiver
request sent to federal agencies.\11\ The added requirement for federal
agencies to communicate and consult with the White House on Buy America
waiver requests unnecessarily adds political pressure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Executive Order on Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of
America by All of America's Workers https://www.whitehouse.gov/
briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-
ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-
workers/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important that all Buy America waivers get equal treatment
whether it is for an electric vehicle charger, a transit system, or a
roadway project. Likewise, the waiver process must be depoliticized. If
a waiver is granted, it does not mean that the Trump Administration or
Biden Administration does not care about domestic manufacturing or
American jobs; it means that they also care about American construction
jobs and want to rebuild America's infrastructure as promised under the
IIJA.
Again, AGC is supportive of efforts to expand domestic
manufacturing efforts and its members help build those manufacturing
projects. However, we are concerned that reality of the timeline
necessary to attract and build a stronger domestic manufacturing sector
will come at the expense of construction jobs because of project delays
caused by an opaque, politicized, and lengthy waiver process.
Industry Stakeholders Take Action
To further demonstrate the concerns that industry stakeholders have
with the implementation of BABAA, today, February 15, 2024, AGC joined
a coalition of trade associations that includes the American Public
Transportation Association, the American Road & Transportation Builders
Association, and the National Association of Home Builders in filing a
formal request for rulemaking urging the White House to drop its
current approach to the waiver process and focus on implementing the
requirements at a generalized level and empower federal agencies with
broad discretion to fill in the details.
While the groups underscore that they fully support BABAA's core
purpose of strengthening domestic manufacturing, they note that OMB's
focus on managing virtually every aspect of the Build America, Buy
America Act requirements is not practical and causes confusion and
delay with federal agencies that fund construction projects. In
particular, the groups home in on the uncertainty surrounding the OMB's
implementation of the waiver process and historical precedent with such
waivers. While OMB sets itself a 15-day approval or denial process for
waivers, too often the politics of these waivers creates bureaucratic
inertia.
The groups' filing urges the need for timely waivers, given the
record number of projects utilizing federal funding, short-term
deficiencies in domestic manufacturing capabilities, increased
materials costs and unpredictable lead times for key components. The
trade groups put forth recommendations to ensure an effective and
``depoliticized'' waiver process by allowing all such requests to be
treated equally and transparently.
The formal petition requests a new rulemaking under the
Administrative Procedures Act and a request under the Paperwork
Reduction Act to review the way the administration collects Build
America, Buy America Act waivers.
IV. FHWA's Manufactured Products Waiver
When the initial Buy America requirements were being implemented
for transportation projects in the 1980s, FHWA approved a general
applicability waiver for manufactured products, the Manufactured
Products Waiver. FHWA approved the waiver after it found that granting
the Manufactured Products Waiver would have an insignificant economic
impact on all materials covered under waiver since ``foreign
competition in natural materials was not significant due to their high
transportation cost and the lack of availability of petroleum-based
products from domestic sources in sufficient and reasonable
quantities.'' The most recent completed review of FHWA's Manufactured
Products Waiver, in 2013, found that the initial reasoning still
applied and that it was necessary to continue the use of the waiver to
avoid significant project delays and cost increases for products that
made up a minor portion of the total material cost of FHWA-assisted
projects.
Ever since its inception in 1983, the Manufactured Products Waiver
has been reviewed and upheld by both Republican and Democratic
administrations, stating that the initial reasons for its existence
hold true. It is currently undergoing review once again, in accordance
with the requirements of the BABAA, which mandates a review of every
prior general applicability waiver at least every five years. This
long-standing waiver now faces the possibility of being removed,
modified, or replaced.
While the outcome of the Manufactured Products Waiver review
remains uncertain, highway contractors have expressed serious concerns
about potential impacts if the handling mirrors other aspects of BABAA
implementation. To illustrate the construction industry's concerns, in
May of 2023, 65% of AGC and American Road and Transportation Builders
Association members stated that removal of the waiver would have a
major effect on the time and cost of their projects.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, FHWA has previously stated that ``it is very
difficult to identify the various materials and then trace their
origin'' regarding manufactured product components.\13\ As BABAA's
requirements insert cost of component tracking requirements to
manufactured products in addition to tracing the various materials in a
specific product, it will become even more burdensome and difficult to
determine whether a specific product meets all requirements.

archives.federalregister.gov/issue_slice/1983/11/25/53097-
53104.pdf#page=3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To further exemplify the need for a continued waiver, certain
products and components are completely unavailable domestically and
lack the conditions to be able to meet the manufacturing demands in the
near future. The Department of Energy stated in its LED Manufacturing
Supply Chain Report that ``irtually no LED lamp manufacturing is
taking place in the United States today.'' \14\ The lack of any
available domestic raw materials, such as gallium, and the lack of
currently available manufacturing make it all but impossible to be
complaint with BABAA. As a result, American-made LED lighting on roads
does not exist and will not exist for the foreseeable future.

https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/ssl-2020-led-mfg-
supply-chain-mar21jul21.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any rushed changes to the Manufactured Products Waiver which could
restrict the source of LED lighting components could dramatically alter
the safety of American roads and delay completion of projects. AGC
urged FHWA to research material manufacturing capacity for all
permanent products used in FHWA's projects before deciding to alter the
current Manufactured Products Waiver to avoid any unintended
consequences, particularly as it relates to safety.
V. Buy America Changes Require a Phase-In Period
Adjustments to Supply Chains Take Time
When BABAA was coming into effect, nearly all federal agencies that
provide financial aid for construction projects passed sweeping and
time limited general applicability waivers. This was not because
agencies don't support domestic manufacturing, but rather aimed at
allowing all involved stakeholders, including manufacturers, local
government agencies, and contractors, to adapt supply chains, train
their workforce for new requirements, and adjust administrative
procedures. As the requirements of the law have evolved to become ever
more complex and demanding since April 2022, the need for an additional
phase in period has become even more apparent.
Numerous local AGC chapters are actively collaborating with their
state DOTs across the nation to update their BABAA requirements.
Unfortunately, implementing changes just 60 days after a final rule is
impractical and irresponsible.
Furthermore, AGC members have noted that certain local agencies
still have not taken action to update their BABAA requirements or are
entirely unaware of the new requirements. In such instances,
contractors find themselves in an increased risk environment where they
are still ultimately liable for compliance with BABAA, yet the agencies
they work with are not fully prepared to provide details, documents, or
answers on how to properly comply.
While I would consider the previously mentioned partnership between
Carolinas AGC and NCDOT a success so far, it is crucial that the
permitting, design, and engineering communities work together to
mitigate potential issues. From what we have experienced, my state's
permitting agencies are overwhelmed with the amount of work. A waiver
that makes sense is critical to ensuring that funding is put the work
and projects break ground.
All Buy America Waivers Should be Treated Equally
In September 2022, FHWA released a proposed waiver for BABAA
seeking public input on the necessity of a BABAA waiver for EV Charging
Stations. The proposed waiver cited information on the relevant
manufacturers, their stated production capacity, estimated demand for
compliant charging stations, and asked for public feedback on their
findings. In addition, the proposed waiver offered a timeline for a
phase in period, where the BABAA requirements would increase gradually
year over year until the manufacturers had adequate time to be able to
meet the requirements fully.
AGC contends that such outreach and research should be performed to
a similar degree of rigor for other manufactured products and
construction materials subject to BABAA. That is indeed why it is
simultaneously refreshing and troubling to see the EPA, DOT, HUD and
others releasing a joint RFI on the availability of water
infrastructure just this past December, when BABAA requirements are
well into the implementation process and are beginning to appear on
contracts.
As specifically outlined in the IIJA, the Secretary of the U.S. DOT
is to work with the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership to
provide annual reports on the status of domestic sourcing requirements
to various relevant House and Senate committees, including the
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. As part of the annual
report's requirements, the Secretary is to provide updates on the
challenges and gaps in the domestic supply base identified in carrying
out the implementation of BABAA. As far as we are aware, these reports
have not yet been provided to this and various other committees. Such
reports would aid contractors in identifying potential challenges
during the bid process, allowing for awareness of supply
availabilities, reduction of uncertainties, and minimizing the workload
for each contractor to provide optimal value for the American taxpayer.
VI. Conclusion
As previously noted, AGC supports efforts to boost domestic
manufacturing. Unfortunately, the process by which the new BABAA
requirements are being implemented leaves contractors with increased
risks and liabilities while OMB continues to implement ever expanding
and stringent requirements without providing transparency and data to
back up their implementation timelines.
I request that the committee members work to ensure that the goals
of these Buy America requirements are successful by working towards a
quick and transparent waiver process and providing flexible
requirements that allow federal and local agencies to rebuild their
infrastructure. I thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify
today and appreciate its continued efforts to help improve our nation's
infrastructure. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

TESTIMONY OF DAN NEEDHAM, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF
COMMERCIAL, NUCOR CORPORATION
Mr. Needham. Chairman Crawford and members of the
subcommittee, on behalf of Nucor Corporation and our 32,000
teammates, thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I am
Dan Needham, executive vice president of commercial. I have
been with Nucor since 2000 and in my current position since
2021.
Buy America and other domestic preference laws are vital to
the American steel industry. We thank the committee for
ensuring that they remain robust and effective.
Nucor is the largest and most diversified steel producer in
the United States and the largest recycler of any material
anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. We are one of the safest
steel companies in the world, with a 2023 injury and illness
rate that was less than 30 percent of the industry average.
Nucor is also a leader in sustainable steelmaking,
producing steel using up to 100 percent recycled content. Our
greenhouse gas intensity is 60 percent lower than the global
average, and we aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050.
Nucor continues to expand and improve our operations to
ensure we can meet the needs of American infrastructure. Since
2020, we have invested more than $12 billion to ensure that we
can produce the steel needed for any project anywhere. Recent
investments include a state-of-the-art, cut-to-length plate
mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky, which produces plate for
military, transportation, and energy applications, including
offshore wind monopile foundations. We are the only steel
producer in North America capable of producing the steel for
these offshore wind monopile foundations. We are also expanding
capacity in traditional product lines, including at a new rebar
micro mill in Lexington, North Carolina.
Strong Buy America provisions are critical to these
investments. Nucor firmly believes that investing in
infrastructure ensures American safety and competitiveness, and
supports a resurgence of American manufacturing that we have
seen in recent years. When implemented effectively, Buy America
requirements encourage investment and innovation, create stable
and high-wage American jobs, and help keep high-emission and
unfairly traded foreign steel out of U.S. infrastructure.
We have been encouraged by recent efforts to expand and
strengthen domestic iron and steel requirements, whether
through the Build America, Buy America Act or the IRA.
BABA's provisions require uniform application of Buy
America requirements, with a ``melted and poured'' standard for
iron and steel that agencies like the Federal Highway
Administration and the Federal Transit Administration have
implemented for more than 40 years. These Buy America programs
are readily available models for other agencies to follow as
they implement BABA.
As energy and infrastructure investments under the
infrastructure law and IRA drive as much as 8 million tons of
additional steel demand, robust and consistent Buy America
provisions are as critical as ever. Nucor strongly supports
recent improvements, but is carefully watching certain aspects
of implementation.
First, as detailed in my written statement for the record,
de minimis content or minor component waivers could result in
significant volumes of high-value steel products being
unreasonably exempted. In August of last year, for example, DOT
increased most of its de minimis content thresholds, which
weakens existing Buy America programs and is inconsistent with
BABA's goal of maximizing the use of American-made goods in our
Nation's infrastructure.
Other agencies have proposed or implemented new waivers
that would exempt so-called minor components from Buy America
requirements. These waivers could exempt sophisticated steel
products like fasteners, which are a critical product line for
Nucor. We appreciate DOT's decision not to move forward with
the minor components waiver, and hope other agencies follow
suit.
The most effective Buy America requirements are simple and
straightforward. FHWA's Buy America program is probably the
gold standard. It requires all iron and steel to be produced in
the United States, period. There are no loopholes and no
ambiguity. As the Federal Highway Administration reviews its
nationwide waiver for manufactured products, it should maintain
its longstanding policy that all steel be produced in the
United States, including the steel contained in manufactured
products. FTA and other agencies should implement the same
standard.
We thank the subcommittee and welcome the opportunity to
work with you on effective Buy America implementation.

Prepared Statement of Dan Needham, Executive Vice President of
Commercial, Nucor Corporation
Chairman Crawford and members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of
Nucor Corporation (``Nucor''), and our 32,000 teammates across the
country, thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the
importance of our country's Buy America laws. I am Dan Needham,
Executive Vice President of Commercial at Nucor Corporation. I have
been with Nucor since 2000 and have overseen commercial operations
across product lines in my current position since 2021. Buy America and
other domestic preference provisions are vital to the American steel
industry, and we appreciate the Committee's efforts to ensure that they
remain robust and effective.
Nucor is the largest and most diversified steel producer in the
United States and the largest recycler of any product anywhere in the
Western Hemisphere. Nucor produces one out of every four tons of
American-made steel using up to 100% recycled content, and with 60%
lower greenhouse gas intensity than the global steelmaking average.
Nucor's goal is to achieve net-zero science-based greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050, including Scopes 1, 2, and 3. Nucor is not only one
of the cleanest and most efficient steelmakers in the world, but also
one of the safest, with a 2023 steelmaking injury and illness rate that
was less than 30% of the industry average.
Nucor is continuing to expand and improve our operations to ensure
that we can meet the needs of our country's rapidly expanding
infrastructure. Since 2020, we have invested more than $12 billion that
will ensure that we can produce the steel needed for any project
anywhere, from roads and bridges to offshore wind facilities. Last
year, we began operations at a $1.7 billion, state-of-the-art cut-to-
length plate mill in Brandenburg, KY that produces plate for our
military in addition to transportation and construction applications.
Nucor Steel Brandenburg is the first mill in the United States and one
of only a few globally that can produce heavy gauge plate used in
offshore wind monopile foundations. We are also expanding capacity in
traditional product lines, including at a new $350 million rebar micro
mill in Lexington, NC that we anticipate will be operational by the end
of this year.
Robust and well enforced Buy America provisions are critical to
these investments. To justify and sustain them, Nucor needs to know
that the demand created by U.S. infrastructure spending will not go to
foreign producers who often sell at dumped and subsidized prices. Nucor
firmly believes that investing in infrastructure is crucial to American
safety and competitiveness and to supporting the resurgence of American
manufacturing that we have seen in recent years. When implemented
effectively, Buy America requirements attached to infrastructure
spending encourage investment and innovation in the domestic steel
industry, create stable and high-wage American jobs, and help lower our
carbon footprint by keeping emissions-intensive foreign steel out of
U.S. infrastructure. Nucor continues to invest in part because of the
greater demand for American-made steel that strong Buy America
provisions create.
Nucor has therefore been encouraged by recent efforts in Congress
to expand and strengthen domestic iron and steel requirements in recent
infrastructure investments, whether through the Build America, Buy
America Act (``BABA'') in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(``IIJA''), or through the domestic content bonus credit for renewable
energy projects in the Inflation Reduction Act (``IRA''). It is worth
noting at the outset that these provisions simply call on federal
agencies to implement certain Buy America requirements that other
agencies, like the Department of Transportation (``DOT''), have
implemented effectively for decades. For example, the Federal Highway
Administration (``FHWA'') and Federal Transit Administration (``FTA'')
have successfully implemented a robust ``melted and poured'' standard
for more than 40 years, which requires that all manufacturing processes
for iron and steel products occur in the United States. DOT's existing
Buy America programs should serve as the model for other agencies as
they implement BABA's requirements.
BABA's provisions should help to ensure consistency of
implementation across the Federal Government, enhance transparency and
communication among agencies and stakeholders, and extend robust Buy
America requirements to federal agencies that have not previously
applied such rules. As energy and infrastructure investments under the
IIJA and IRA drive as much as eight million tons of additional steel
demand annually, ensuring consistent Buy America implementation across
the Federal Government is as critical as ever. While Nucor strongly
supports BABA's improvements, implementation has at times been
inconsistent or even potentially contrary to the broader objective of
ensuring that U.S. government investments benefit American workers and
companies.
As a preliminary matter, Nucor remains concerned about delays in
BABA implementation by certain agencies. BABA's Buy America provisions
were to be implemented no later than May 14, 2022. While some agencies,
including DOT, have generally moved forward with implementation, others
have issued extended ``adjustment'' or ``phased implementation''
waivers that have delayed application of BABA's requirements
significantly. The Department of Housing and Urban Development
(``HUD''), for example, issued a phased implementation waiver in
February 2023 that delays full BABA implementation through fiscal year
2025 for certain programs. The Treasury Department has also issued a
waiver delaying implementation for certain types of funding through
February 2028. There is no justification for delays of this magnitude.
Numerous federal agencies, including DOT and the Environmental
Protection Agency (``EPA''), have decades of experience administering
similar Buy America programs and provide readily available frameworks
for effective implementation.
Nucor has also been concerned by a proliferation of proposed
waivers related to de minimis content or minor components that could
result in significant volumes of high-value steel products being
unreasonably exempted from Buy America requirements. In August of last
year, for example, DOT issued a waiver that significantly increases the
de minimis threshold to the lesser of 5% of total project costs or
$1,000,000 for most of its Buy America programs. This weakens Buy
America programs and is inconsistent with BABA's clear terms and
objectives to maximize the use of American-made goods in our nation's
infrastructure.
The same is true of proposed waivers for so-called ``minor
components'' of iron and steel products. Guidance from the Office of
Management and Budget (``OMB'') suggested that such waivers could apply
to as much as 5% of the content of iron and steel products. Some
agencies have either proposed or implemented new waivers consistent
with OMB's guidance in a manner that could significantly weaken
existing standards. These waivers threaten to sweep far too broadly and
cover sophisticated iron and steel products like fasteners, which are a
critical product line for Nucor and other domestic steelmakers. Nucor
appreciates DOT's decision not to move forward with a minor components
waiver and urges other agencies to follow suit. Constant refrains over
the years that supposedly ``minor components'' are impossible to track
are untrue. Every steel product is fully traceable with readily
available documentation from melting and pouring through final end
product.
In Nucor's experience, the most effective Buy America requirements
are the ones that are simple and straightforward and that have limited
exceptions. In critical ways, FHWA's Buy America program is the gold
standard in this respect. It requires all iron and steel to be produced
in the United States, including components and subcomponents of
manufactured products. Unlike FTA's exemptions for steel components and
subcomponents of manufactured products, there are no loopholes and no
ambiguity. As FHWA reviews its nation-wide waiver for manufactured
products, it should leave untouched its longstanding policy requiring
that all steel be produced in the United States, including the steel
contained in manufactured products.
We are aware that critics of robust Buy America programs often
assert that cost and availability concerns make compliance burdensome
and compromise efficient completion of infrastructure projects. These
claims are unsubstantiated and simply untrue. According to the American
Iron and Steel Institute's most recent data, the American steel
industry is operating at 76.3% capacity utilization thus far in 2024.
That means that millions of tons of steel are readily available from
domestic producers. Most of the steel required by federally funded
infrastructure projects, moreover, consists of common construction
grades that Nucor and others produce every day. Any short-term supply
chain issues that may have existed during the COVID-19 pandemic are now
a thing of the past. To the extent that certain specialty products may
only be available from import sources, these situations are rare and
can be dealt with by narrowly tailored, project-specific waivers.
Nucor also has concerns regarding implementation of the IRA's
domestic content bonus tax credit rules for iron and steel products. As
with BABA, IRA applies a clear melted and poured requirement for iron
and steel products to count towards domestic content thresholds. We are
concerned that implementing agencies have unreasonably exempted clearly
iron and steel products like offshore wind monopile foundations and
steel torque tubes for solar trackers. Removing products like these
from the scope of the iron and steel requirement eliminates one of the
IRA's primary incentives for sourcing American-made steel and is at
odds with the law's goal of encouraging investment and creating jobs in
American manufacturing industries. It also undermines the IRA's
climate-related objectives. American steel is among the cleanest in the
world thanks to the investments and innovations of companies like
Nucor, and this clean steel should build America's green economy.
Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. Nucor
welcomes the opportunity to work with the Subcommittee to ensure that
Buy America provisions are administered as effectively and efficiently
as possible. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Needham.
Mr. Enders, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
TESTIMONY OF BRIAN ENDERS, VICE PRESIDENT, WALBEC GROUP, ON
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASPHALT PAVEMENT ASSOCIATION (NAPA)
Mr. Enders. Ranking Member Larsen, Highways and Transit
Subcommittee Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and
members of the committee, thank you for inviting me today to
discuss lessons learned from the Buy America provisions via the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. My name is Brian
Enders, vice president of the Walbec Group, a construction
company employing over 2,000 hard-working men and women
throughout the upper Midwest.
Walbec is a vertically integrated organization of six
companies that produce high-quality construction materials
along with design, engineering, and construction services.
I was raised in Laona, a small town in northern Wisconsin.
I started my career as an intern at Walbec, and over the last
20 years, grew into my current role. I serve on boards of the
Wisconsin Asphalt Pavement Association and National Asphalt
Pavement Association. I am also the chair of the National
Center for Asphalt Technology at Auburn University, which
continually improves our product through science. I am proud to
join you on behalf of the National Asphalt Pavement
Association.
It is vital to understand the many contributions of asphalt
to our surface transportation network. Almost 95 percent of
roads in the U.S. are surfaced with asphalt, including 65
percent of the interstate system. Almost 80 percent of airport
runways are surfaced with asphalt. If you wonder what asphalt
pavement really is, essentially it consists of two primary
materials: aggregate, which is the stone, sand, and gravel that
form the base; and asphalt binder, a specific refined oil
product that serves as the glue bonding the aggregates
together. Asphalt pavement contains about 95 percent aggregate
and 5 percent binder. It can be designed for specific project
requirements like traffic volumes and climate conditions, while
remaining cost-effective to build, easy to maintain, and
resilient to last for decades.
A source of pride for my industry is that asphalt pavement
is the most recycled product in America. Old pavements can
continuously be reused in new pavements.
Additionally, the asphalt pavement requires 20 percent less
energy to produce and construct than other pavement materials,
meaning fewer greenhouse gas emissions. In most parts of the
country, asphalt pavement is produced with locally sourced
materials, yet certain parts of the country need to import raw
materials like asphalt binder and aggregate, because those
materials are not available locally. There are a couple
underlying reasons for this.
Nationwide, the U.S. lacks the refining capacity to fulfill
the asphalt binder demand, and there are certain areas of the
country lacking quality aggregate reserves. Without access to
these necessary raw materials, road construction would be
delayed or altogether cost prohibitive. That is why in certain
regions of the country, mix producers import a small amount of
raw materials, and it's why Buy America carries such an
importance to our industry.
IIJA provided much-needed transportation funding for our
communities. Wisconsin was able to invest in over 1,300 State
and local highway projects, leading to job creation and
economic growth. In addition to IIJA's historic highway funding
levels, which NAPA supported, the package contains significant
policy changes like Build America, Buy America.
For more than 40 years, Buy America required a domestic
manufacturing process for certain products used on Federal-aid
highway projects. The road building industry operated without
these sourcing requirements because the components in asphalt
pavements are not considered manufactured products, based on a
waiver granted in 1983 by the Federal Highway Administration.
During IIJA negotiations, some wanted to extend Buy America
provisions to include various construction materials which
would have made our work more difficult and more costly.
Fortunately, we worked with Senator Baldwin and our
coalition partners to continue the 1983 exemption status for
certain materials like asphalt binder and aggregates,
protecting the construction materials supply chain. We
appreciate the work of many on this committee who reaffirmed
the legislative exemption in IIJA. Thanks to your support, as
well as collaboration between NAPA and its peer construction
material associations, the Office of Management and Budget
issued extensive clarification reaffirming congressional intent
to ensure Federal, State, and local agencies do not place a new
domestic sourcing requirement on materials like aggregate and
asphalt binder.
The backbone of America's economy is its vast roadway
system. Our roads connect people and goods, and asphalt is key
to facilitating that connectivity.
Thank you for your continued support of transportation
funding and for having me here today. I have included
additional insights in my submitted written testimony. I
welcome your questions.

Prepared Statement of Brian Enders, Vice President, Walbec Group, on
behalf of the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA)
Introduction
Full Committee Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Highways
Subcommittee Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Holmes Norton, and
members of the committee, thank you for inviting me today to discuss
lessons learned from the Buy America provisions via the implementation
of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) package. For the
asphalt pavement industry and my company, the Buy America exemption for
aggregates and cementitious materials, including asphalt binder,
enshrined in the IIJA legislation, is an absolute necessity to continue
the essential business of constructing roadways, serving state
departments of transportation and the traveling public.
My name is Brian Enders, Vice President of the Walbec Group, a
Waukesha, Wisconsin-based construction company employing over 2,000
hard-working men and women throughout the Upper Midwest. Walbec is a
vertically integrated organization of six companies--Payne and Dolan,
Northeast Asphalt, Zenith Tech, Parisi, Premier Concrete, and
Construction Resources Management. Together, we produce high-quality
construction materials and deliver unparalleled professional design,
engineering, and construction services. While we are often associated
with state, municipal, and federal projects, many of our customers are
commercial businesses. We build various infrastructure, including
highways, roads, bridges, parking lots, bike trails, athletic tracks,
and so on. Walbec is committed to helping people, including our team
members, customers, and the public, reach their destinations. Our team
comprises a great group of people across our companies who are ethical,
positive, and family-focused.
I have worked for the Walbec Group my entire career, beginning as
an intern in 2004 working on a paving crew with Northeast Asphalt and
eventually joined the team as a project manager in 2007. I later became
the area manager for Northeast Asphalt South in 2017 before becoming
Vice President of Northeast Asphalt in 2019. I was born and raised in
Laona, Wisconsin, and majored in civil engineering with an emphasis in
construction management at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I
currently serve on the board of directors of the Wisconsin Asphalt
Pavement Association and the National Asphalt Pavement Association
(NAPA). In addition, I am the Chair of the National Center for Asphalt
Technology (NCAT) located on the campus of Auburn University in
Alabama; NCAT is the industry's premier academic and research
institution aimed at advancing the industry's ability to provide
asphalt pavements that are safe, sustainable, durable, and economical
for road owners.
I am proud to join you on behalf of NAPA, the only national trade
association representing the interests of asphalt producers and the
asphalt pavement industry in the United States. NAPA represents over
1,100 member companies across the country and has advocated for our
industry's critical legislative and regulatory priorities for nearly 70
years.
The Walbec Group is a multi-faceted construction materials
producer, as we own and operate aggregate, ready-mix concrete, and
asphalt facilities, but our company owes its success to its long and
storied past producing and providing asphalt mixtures throughout the
Midwest, and we have been a member of NAPA since its founding in 1955.
The Walbec Group operates over 40 asphalt plants, producing millions of
tons of asphalt each year, with projects across the major thoroughfares
and highways throughout the Midwest, including I-43 and I-39. We also
operate three multi-modal storage terminals on the Great Lakes,
providing asphalt binder to the region.
Asphalt Background
When discussing highway funding and infrastructure policy--a key
objective of this committee--it is vital to understand how asphalt is
used for our surface transportation network. NAPA and the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) report that asphalt accounts for almost
95% of the roadway market, which includes local and county roads,
subdivisions and commercial/industrial parks, state and regional
thoroughfares and highways, as well as federal and national interstate
and intrastate networks \1\. Further, our product makes up almost 80%
of the airfield pavement market, which includes private and regional
airstrips, military bases and airfields, along with larger, highly
utilized national and commercial airports \2\.

Asphalt pavement is 100% recyclable. In fact, at a rate of 99%, it
is the most recycled product in America. The industry reuses and
recycles 100 million tons of asphalt pavement a year, incorporating
reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) into new pavements and saving
taxpayers over $2 billion annually.\3\ Asphalt mix requires 20% less
energy to produce and construct than other pavement materials.\4\
Despite the scope of asphalt pavement utilization across the country,
our industry's cradle-to-gate emissions associated with asphalt mix
production represent only 0.3% of total U.S. GHG emissions \5\ and we
are committed to industry-wide efforts to reduce that figure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that I have established the scale of our product's varied and
essential uses, I will illustrate its components and the relevance to
Buy America policies. It is important to understand asphalt production
and the materials we rely upon from the perspective of asphalt
producers. You do not need a civil engineering degree to quickly
understand asphalt production; it is straightforward, as asphalt
pavement primarily consists of two materials:
1. Aggregate--the stone, sand, and rock raw material product that
is the base of our finished product, and
2. Asphalt binder--the specific refined oil product that serves as
the `glue' that keeps the aggregate materials bonded and connected.
Roughly speaking, asphalt is made up of about 95% aggregate and 5%
binder, and depending on the mix or maintenance strategies, may contain
emulsifiers, additives, and other post-consumer waste products. Asphalt
mix types can serve different purposes based on the customer's
objectives, including traffic volumes, climate conditions, budget,
performance expectations, and so much more.
Asphalt Production
In most parts of the United States, asphalt pavements can be
produced reliably with local or regional access to aggregate materials,
additives, and asphalt binder. However, certain parts of the country--
particularly the West Coast, Pacific Northwest, Upper Midwest, and
Northeast--depend upon importing raw materials that cannot be sourced
locally. I will share insights on raw material imports and the need for
supporting the current construction material exemption, but this
underlying point is important: 100% of all asphalt mixtures used in the
United States are produced right here in the United States in every
Congressional district across the country. Local production is designed
to meet local needs and support local communities--producing and
constructing asphalt pavements are inherently local operations.
While I am best suited to discuss how our company's asphalt binder
is sourced and the impact on our regional market, I would be remiss if
I did not mention how this same issue exists for aggregates, primarily
along coastal cities on the East and West Coast, as well as the
Southeast and Gulf of Mexico. These regions are too built up and cannot
access local aggregate deposits, cannot be properly permitted, and/or
lack the geological makeup necessary for suitable aggregate production.
These constraints can be exacerbated by a difficult permitting process,
taking years, if not over a decade, for aggregate facilities to be
operational. Similar to asphalt binder, aggregate sourcing may be
dependent upon what is available based on regional geological makeup.
The majority of asphalt binder used in our nation's roadways is
refined domestically, however a small portion is imported. According to
figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, and the Asphalt Institute, in 2022 18.4% of the
total liquid asphalt supply used for U.S. production was imported--with
88% of those imports coming from Canada.
If Buy America requirements were in effect for asphalt binder, the
United States would need to increase refining capacity, especially in
the Northeast, or refiners would need to increase production and/or
expand material transport, counterproductive to climate goals. Further,
costs to build and maintain U.S. highways--especially in certain
regions--would be delayed and costs would skyrocket. For example, if
Canadian-sourced asphalt binder and additives were arbitrarily delayed,
it would have major disruptions to the binder market in the United
States, including material shortages and higher prices. Given the lack
of refining capacity in regions like the Pacific Northwest, Upper
Midwest, and Northeast, Canadian imports are the most economical,
efficient, and practical means to obtain the appropriate asphalt binder
content for our mixes.
Within the Walbec Group's profile, we operate three multi-modal
terminals that serve as an entry point for this necessary component of
our asphalt products. These locations across the Great Lakes serve our
entire spectrum of asphalt plants. Given the sheer scale and scope of
projects we maintain and execute in the region, our work would not be
possible without this raw material input.
As mentioned, RAP is the most recycled product in the country and
continues to grow in use across our nation's roadway network, with RAP
comprising 94 million tons of new pavement mixtures in 2021 \3\.
Through enhanced engineering innovations, asphalt is 100% recyclable,
and the industry has worked hard to engineer RAP mixtures that provide
an environmental benefit, without sacrificing quality or performance.
Using RAP involves milling an existing road, processing and
incorporating it into a new mixture, then laying that new mixture down
as a new road surface. It represents circularity at its finest without
any degradation, while reducing the virgin materials required to renew
a road's surface.
Nationally, RAP is utilized at an average rate of 21.1% with
positive impact on cost, materials, and emissions. To illustrate its
importance to our sustainable road network, increasing RAP just 1%
would avoid the equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
approximately 30,000 passenger vehicles.\5\ RAP is a key component of
the industry's goal to produce and construct net zero carbon emissions
asphalt pavements by 2050. Ensuring the necessary raw materials to re-
engineer and reuse RAP to meet performance and environmental demands is
critical to achieving this vision.
Buy America Background
NAPA understands and supports the merits of Buy America and why we
need to support our domestic labor force, manufacturing, and raw
material resources where available. But the asphalt pavement industry
cannot execute a broad application of unincumbered Buy America
provisions without unintended consequences on our product's design,
quality, and cost to American taxpayers.
NAPA was a vocal supporter of IIJA. When it was signed into law in
2021, IIJA provided long-term, sustainable transportation revenue that
has allowed us to make our communities safer, more efficient, and
better connected. As a result, Wisconsin was able to invest in over
1,300 state and local highway and bridge projects to significantly
improve our state's system, and this investment led to job creation and
economic growth.
The multi-year highway reauthorization package contained in IIJA
included various policies beyond the surface transportation formula
funding and authorities granted to the FHWA, including the Build
America, Buy America Act, regarding revised mandates to Buy America
sourcing guidelines. I am here to share with you how we acquire our
essential raw materials and how asphalt mix producers are impacted by
Buy America.
For more than 40 years, Buy America required a domestic
manufacturing process for certain products permanently incorporated
into federal-aid highway and transit projects. The road building
industry has operated without these sourcing requirements because the
components in asphalt pavements are not considered manufactured
products based on a waiver granted in 1983 by FHWA \6\. Yet, as IIJA
moved through Congress and enveloped other bills like the US Innovation
and Competition Act of 2021,\7\ Buy America was revisited under the
updated Build America, Buy America standards via Section 4101.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IIJA's original text revised Buy America standards to be applicable
to all materials and products within the General Services
Administration's procurement, including raw materials like aggregates
and asphalt binder that were previously exempted. Working with Senator
Baldwin and industry coalition partners representing aggregates,
cement, and ready-mix concrete, NAPA conveyed the importance of
continuing the 1983 exemption status for certain construction materials
including asphalt binder and aggregates.
Further, Congress understood that, without an exemption, a
cumbersome and inefficient individual waiver process would be utilized.
Thanks to the historic highway funding that IIJA provided, state
departments of transportation (DOTs) are administering a record number
of contracts. With this scaling up in project delivery and development,
the individual waiver process would have hindered states' ability to
deliver projects on time and on budget, due to the unnecessary
regulatory burden. With even a medium size state like Wisconsin
investing into 1,300 projects thanks to IIJA, it is easy to comprehend
the added administrative burden an individual waiver process would have
put on state DOTs, FHWA, and the entire asphalt contracting community.
Thus, when IIJA passed inclusive of the Buy America exemptions for
certain construction materials like asphalt binder and aggregates,
Congress recognized the uniqueness of our raw material sourcing was
based purely on local market limitations and efficiencies. These
actions provided certainty to the construction material supply chain,
road owners, and road builders.
Closing
We appreciate the work of many members across this subcommittee who
reached out to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the White
House last summer to reaffirm the legislative exemption in IIJA \8\.
Thanks to your support and coalition comments submitted by NAPA and its
peer construction material trade associations \9\, OMB issued extensive
clarification that reaffirmed IIJA's congressional intent to ensure
federal, state, and local agencies do not place a new domestic sourcing
requirement on materials such as aggregate and asphalt binder. These
materials are essential to building and maintaining our modern way of
life in every neighborhood coast to coast.

The backbone of America's economy is its vast roadway system. Our
roads connect people and goods from one end of the country to the other
and asphalt is key to facilitating that connectivity. Asphalt offers a
high-performing, strong, smooth, durable roadway surface for the
traveling public. Long-lasting, durable asphalt pavements are the
result of collaborative partnerships between researchers,
manufacturers, paving contractors, and agencies. These experts work
together to engineer and develop optimal pavement and mix designs,
equipment, and processes to improve asphalt durability and performance.
In addition, they engage in research and collaboration to develop best
practices and techniques to enhance asphalt's performance. As American
business moves, so do the demands on our nation's roads. I want to
thank the committee for the continued support of transportation
investment funding absent unrealistic mandates, thereby allowing us to
continue building roads that are safe, sustainable, durable, and cost-
effective for the traveling public around the country.
On behalf of my company and industry, thank you for hearing my
perspectives on Buy America and working with us to continually ensure
that no legislation or regulation unnecessarily impedes our ability to
efficiently build roads, using the best materials possible, that help
Americans and American businesses in every community thrive.

TESTIMONY OF MEGAN SALRIN, LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE, UNITED
STEELWORKERS (USW)
Ms. Salrin. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify today on behalf of the United Steelworkers, the largest
industrial union in the United States.
Our members truly supply America, manufacturing the inputs
for our Nation's infrastructure from the pigment in yellow road
paint to the steel that is used in bridges. That is why, in
August of 2021, we led a multistate tour visiting USW-
represented factories to spotlight workers ready and eager to
deliver new and improved infrastructure. We heard over and over
again that historic investments in our Nation's infrastructure
should include strong Buy America policies that support
American manufacturing workers, not corporations that outsource
production to countries with weak or nonexistent labor and
environmental standards.
Congress ultimately came together to pass the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Included in this bill
was the bipartisan Build America, Buy America Act, which builds
on the successful impact, but limited and inconsistent
application, of pre-existing Buy America laws. BABA expands Buy
America coverage to infrastructure programs across all
departments and agencies. Previously, Buy America was limited
to only a handful of programs, mostly within DOT.
BABA also broadens Buy America to cover manufactured
products and common construction materials, categories that
were either waived or not covered by existing laws.
To showcase the profound impacts the infrastructure
investments coupled with Buy America have on American workers,
let me tell you about my union siblings, members of Local USW
7-838 making fire hydrants at Mueller in Decatur, Illinois.
After the passage of the IIJA, and thanks to Buy America
coverage for fire hydrants from a pre-existing law, orders at
their plant soared, and the company approached us about mid-
contract raises, which is unprecedented. But the benefits don't
stop there. The increased orders triggered upstream employment
opportunities, including at a copper mine in Utah, a brass
manufacturing plant in Ohio, and a brass and bronze foundry in
Illinois, all of which are USW-represented facilities. And that
is just one example for one product of the ripple effects that
these investments with Buy America can have on our workers and
their surrounding communities.
However, we understand that the implementation is not an
easy task. Reversing decades of neglect in our Nation's
manufacturing base will not happen overnight, but we cannot and
must not return to failed policies that have annually sent
billions of tax dollars offshore. My written testimony details
past significant outsourcing events, including loopholes that
enabled the use of Chinese steel for the San Francisco-to-
Oakland Bay Bridge, and a blanket waiver for broadband spending
that helped give rise to Huawei and ZTE.
BABA means giving our companies and our workers the first
shot at supplying the products and materials that go into our
critical infrastructure. We commend the Biden administration
and DOT for making strides in implementing new Buy America
policies. DOT does deserve credit for proactively applying Buy
America to electric vehicle chargers and for working to reverse
the 40-year-old waiver of manufactured products.
Additionally, OMB's final guidance is now complete, which
allows DOT to accelerate implementation for the benefit of all
stakeholders.
But there is more work to do. Billions of dollars are still
being spent on infrastructure projects that source foreign
inputs, and here's why.
First, DOT delayed BABA's implementation beyond the May
2022 statutory deadline, and major elements of the law are
still not in effect.
Second, DOT has issued general waivers that limit Buy
America application. Instead, DOT should use product-specific
waivers that are time limited and transparent so that
manufacturers can gain insights on supply chain gaps, thus
informing capital investments, program awardees can proceed on
necessary infrastructure projects without delays, and
policymakers can understand where we are dependent on China or
other foreign sources.
Finally, DOT must avoid creating new loopholes. This means
adhering to BABA's savings provision so that it results in more
Buy America, not less.
USW stands ready to work with Congress and all stakeholders
who are committed to the shared goal of American-made
infrastructure, but we soundly reject political gamesmanship
that toys with Buy America policies. And so too will voters,
who, across the political spectrum, overwhelmingly support Buy
America laws.
On behalf of USW members making the products that are the
backbone of American infrastructure, thank you.

Prepared Statement of Megan Salrin, Legislative Representative, United
Steelworkers (USW)
Introduction
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify at today's
hearing. My name is Megan Salrin, and I am honored to serve as a
Legislative Representative for the United Steel, Paper and Forestry,
Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers
International Union, commonly known as the United Steelworkers or USW.
As the largest industrial union in the United States, our members
truly ``Supply America'' from making the pigment that goes into yellow
paint for roads to the steel used in bridge construction, and hundreds
of products in between. During a multi-state campaign in August 2021,
our union visited factories that supply our infrastructure needs,
spotlighting workers who are eager to deliver new and improved
infrastructure, a more powerful economy, and stronger national
security. However, over the past several decades, infrastructure
investments have failed to keep up with a deteriorating system--one
which has not been meaningfully modernized for today's needs.
Meanwhile, the decimation of our nation's industrial sector through bad
tax, trade, and procurement policies has resulted in fragile supply
chains and a dangerous reliance on unreliable or potentially hostile
foreign manufacturers.
We were pleased that Congress came together to enact the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which is making historic
infrastructure investments that lead to the creation and retention of
good, family-supporting jobs throughout the United States. As one of
many ways to fortify our neglected domestic supply chains and support
American workers, our union advocated for strengthening and expanding
domestic content preference policies, often referred to as ``Buy
America'' policies, as a critical step to protecting our economic and
national security. We were proud that Congress acted in a bipartisan
manner to include the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) in the
IIJA, and today's hearing allows us to recognize the implementation
progress and identify what needs to be done to ensure that the benefits
of the law are fully realized.
Buy America Supports Our Shared Policy Goals
The purchasing power of the U.S. federal government and the federal
financial assistance that it delivers for infrastructure and other
purposes has the potential to grow domestic job creation and U.S.
manufacturing capabilities. When funded by taxpayer dollars, Buy
America policy acts as a commonsense preference for U.S. produced goods
and materials that are used to construct the nation's public works
infrastructure. The premise is simple: Buy America policies give
domestic producers and workers the first shot at supplying the products
and materials needed for infrastructure projects funded by taxpayer
dollars.
The federal government has maintained various domestic content
preferences for many years. For the purposes of this hearing, Buy
America laws, applied to federally assisted infrastructure projects,
should not be confused with Buy American laws, which are applied to
direct government purchases and acquisitions. There are notable
differences in coverage, origin standards, and reciprocal market access
commitments with trading partners. There are also many states that have
their own Buy America policies--which our union has supported.
Buy America policies are an important tool to ensure that taxpayer
dollars support domestic manufacturing jobs and responsible
manufacturing practices, not corporations that outsource production to
countries with weak labor and environmental standards that too often
are ignored. In fact, the existence of strong Buy America policies act
to prevent shifts in production to countries that rely on practices
that are significantly less energy efficient and far more polluting
than here in the United States.
To illustrate how Buy America is good for our shared environmental
goals, I point your attention to National Academy of Sciences' research
showing that a large fraction of Chinese emissions are due to the
manufacture of goods for foreign consumption. According to their
research, ``Los Angeles experiences at least one extra day a year of
smog that exceeds federal ozone limits because of nitrogen oxides and
carbon monoxide emitted by Chinese factories making goods for
export''.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The New York Times, ``China Exports Pollution to U.S., Study
Finds'', January 20, 2014.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, it is simply unacceptable for U.S. tax dollars to be used
to source materials from foreign factories whose workers are subjected
to substandard working conditions. To illustrate this concern, the New
York Times reported on iron foundry workers in India who produced
manhole covers that were shipped eight thousand miles to Manhattan.
According to the reporting, ``impervious to the heat from the metal,
the workers . . . relied on strength and bare hands rather than
machinery. Safety precautions were barely in evidence; just a few pairs
of eye goggles were seen in use''.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The New York Times, ``New York Manhole Covers, Forged Barefoot
in India'', November 26, 2007.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strong Buy America policies also stand to support workers of color
who have been disproportionately affected by the decline of U.S.
manufacturing, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute
(EPI).\3\ The authors noted that ``factory jobs still provide a
significant wage premium compared to other sectors,'' and expanded use
of Buy America policies in conjunction with other policies, ``would
create millions of good jobs for workers who have been hardest hit by
globalization''. Additionally, according to Political Economy Research
Institute (PERI) at UMass Amherst, when domestic content in
infrastructure is maximized, U.S. manufacturing job gains increase by
as much as 33 percent.\4\

globalization have decimated manufacturing employment with often

the Economy'', January 16, 2009.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buy America policies have always garnered strong bipartisan
support--both in Congress and among U.S. voters. In fact, January 2023
polling conducted by Morning Consult identified that 83 percent of
voters agree that ``taxpayer dollars should go toward infrastructure
projects that utilize American-made products like iron, steel, and
other construction materials versus products that are imported from
foreign countries,'' Democrats (82 percent), Independents (80 percent),
and Republicans (87 percent) all agree.\5\

Overwhelming Support for Strengthening American Manufacturing'', June

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, we note that Buy America policies applied to federally
assisted infrastructure spending are wholly consistent with U.S.
international obligations. Federal assistance infrastructure programs
have largely been reserved by the United States (and other nations)
from government procurement market access obligations in international
trade agreements.
The Need for BABA
Prior to the IIJA, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of
Agriculture (USDA) were among the few government entities with Buy
America laws, but even these policies have been applied only to a
limited scope of items--including iron and steel and, in limited cases,
certain manufactured products. Additionally, DOT's Buy America
policies--already limited in statute--have been eroded by decades of
excessive waivers and narrowed further by agency decisions.
One must look no further than a 1983 Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) Buy America waiver of all manufactured goods on the grounds that
it was not in the ``public interest'' for a clear statutory requirement
to be enforced. It is inarguably in the public interest that FHWA
adheres to Buy America requirements imposed by Congress. Yet, this
massive Buy America loophole has remained in place for decades across
both Republican and Democrat administrations. As a consequence,
billions of federal assistance dollars have been spent to purchase
foreign-produced inputs for transportation projects, representing a
missed opportunity to maximize the return on these investments with
stronger supply chains and more jobs.
To remedy these concerns, Congress acted on a bipartisan basis to
include BABA in the IIJA--a law that stands to build upon existing Buy
America laws to address various gaps and shortcomings. Specifically,
BABA ensures that any federally assisted infrastructure projects across
all federal agencies and departments adhere to Buy America. The law
also broadens the types of products and materials covered by Buy
America to include iron and steel, manufactured products, and commonly
used construction materials (e.g. copper, aluminum, glass, lumber,
drywall, and fiber optic cable used to construct broadband).
Our union was fully supportive of BABA and commends Congress for
recognizing that reinvesting tax dollars here at home creates American
jobs, invests in goods produced under strong environmental and
workplace safety standards, and protects our economic and national
security by making our nation less dependent on imported products and
materials from unreliable sources.
Buy America Works
As we examine Buy America policy at today's hearing, we must be
clear that implementation of the new BABA law is ongoing, and much of
our public infrastructure spending continues to be completed absent
major elements of the domestic content preference policy. However, we
know that when the law is fully implemented and fully enforced, these
modernized Buy America policies will deliver more for every federal
dollar spent on infrastructure. Already, we have seen signs that the
policy is working.
Electric Vehicle (EV) Chargers
Thanks to the Biden administration's proactive steps to apply Buy
America to electric vehicle (EV) chargers, there are hundreds of
millions of dollars in U.S. factory investments underway to produce
BABA-compliant products that will power a diverse transportation
network. According to the White House, just three years ago, there was
almost no U.S.-based production of fast chargers; now there are at
least 26 firms manufacturing these products within the United States.
Since President Biden took office, at least 40 U.S. based facilities
that produce EV chargers have been announced or opened.\6\ As of
September 2023, these facilities now have the capacity to produce more
than a million charging stations each year--including 60,000 fast
chargers.\7\

Broadband
Companies in the broadband sector are also investing heavily in
U.S. production to ensure that the optical fiber and fiber optic cable
that will connect millions of Americans to one another are produced by
American workers. At the White House signing ceremony for IIJA in
November 2021, USW Local 1025 President Donneta Williams from Corning's
Wilmington, North Carolina plant, kicked off the ceremony, all the
while wearing her USW ``We Supply America'' sticker. Her remarks touted
the innumerable contributions of USW members. Later, in March 2023,
CommScope and Corning announced combined investments of $550 million
that will create hundreds of new jobs in America to build the fiber
optic cables that will help close the digital divide.\8\

Transit
In the transit sector, Buy America improvements in the 2015 Fixing
America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act increased content
requirements for rolling stock gradually to 70 percent. This catalyzed
significant investment in transit parts made in the USA.\9\ In 2017,
Amsted Rail launched a dedicated transit section to meet the demand for
domestically sourced components essential for transit rolling stock.
This strategic move not only bolstered Amsted Rail's position in the
market, but also provided vital support to hundreds of USW members
employed at Amsted facilities across the country. By prioritizing
domestic procurement and manufacturing, Amsted Rail's transit section
not only ensures compliance with Buy America regulations, but also
reinforces the commitment to quality, reliability, and job creation
within the American transit industry.\10\ This investment underscores
the transformative impact of policies that prioritize domestic
production, benefiting both the economy and workers across the nation.

Meanwhile, Alstom leadership recently credited the new Buy America
policy with strengthening Alstom's Hornell, New York operation, now the
largest passenger rail manufacturing plant in the United States. The
investments made there have had positive ripple effects for local
suppliers making passenger seating and other inputs.\11\

Water Infrastructure
With respect to water infrastructure projects, EJ Americas
testified before the T&I Committee in 2021, telling members that ``Buy
America policies work and EJ's investments in its U.S. manufacturing
capacity is demonstrable proof''. EJ also warned that weak Buy America
policies ``miss the multiplier effect of taxpayer financed spending,
resulting in lost opportunity and forsaken economic return.'' \12\

USW members also have stories to showcase the positive impact IIJA
has had on their jobs and communities. The experiences of USW Members
at Mueller, a fire hydrant manufacturer with locations in Illinois and
Alabama, vividly illustrates the profound impact that infrastructure
investments, coupled with Buy America, has on American workers
throughout the infrastructure supply chain.
Following IIJA's passage, production at the fire hydrant plants
soared, which prompted management to approach the union with an
unprecedented proposal--reopening the contract to negotiate additional
pay increases to attract and retain workers to meet the surging demand.
The influx of orders provided financial stability for the company and
workers, translating into additional income for families and
invigorating local economies. IIJA's emphasis on strong origin
standards for domestic products ensured that the benefits extended
beyond the walls of the fire hydrant plants. The increased production
of hydrants is creating employment opportunities throughout the supply
chain, including at brass manufacturing plants that are hiring more USW
members to keep up with demand.\13\

Eliminating Loopholes
As we examine Buy America policies at today's hearing, we are
reminded that it would be foolish to return to decades of flawed
policies rewarding companies that have sent U.S. jobs offshore where
they operate free of U.S. safety and environmental standards. We must
work together to fully implement and enforce our Buy America policies
in a manner that provides powerful incentives for companies to invest
in U.S. operations.
Our members also know from painful experience that when Buy America
policies are either nonexistent or eroded by bad implementation, major
U.S. infrastructure projects are free to ignore American workers who
are ready to get the job done.
For example, in 2013, California state officials used clever
accounting gimmicks to avoid federal funding and bypass federal Buy
America laws for the construction and completion of the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge. They thought that using Chinese steel would net
them $400 million in savings to the overall project. Rather, the
project was plagued with quality issues and cost overruns, all while
thousands of jobs were created in China instead of here in the United
States. The project was eventually finished--a decade behind schedule
and nearly $4 billion over budget.\14\

In New York, state officials decided to source 15,000 tons of
steel, including the fabrication work, from China for the bridge deck
replacement at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. In shocking fashion, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) awarded the contract to a
Chinese state-owned company that had never done such work. MTA used a
very specific fabrication design, called orthotropic decking, and used
it as an excuse to bypass U.S. companies and workers ready to rebuild
the bridge.\15\

Also in New York, Chinese and other foreign-origin steel is used in
the multi-billion-dollar LaGuardia Airport renovation.\16\ The project
did not adhere to a federal Buy America law, which was notable given
that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had received tens of
millions of dollars in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants for
improvements at LaGuardia in prior years.\17\ The project was supported
by $1 billion in Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), which can
unfortunately be used to complete major projects without consideration
of Buy America provisions.\18\

Similarly, clever accounting allowed Washington D.C.'s transit
agency (WMATA) to avoid federal Buy America laws for the purchase of
hundreds of 8000-series railcars. At the time, WMATA claimed that it
would only be using non-federal (MD/VA/DC) funds for the purchase of
these railcars, and not the hundreds of millions of federal assistance
dollars it receives annually, including significant pandemic relief
infusions.\19\

America policy for broadband networking infrastructure was issued,
which helped fuel the rise of Chinese telecom companies such as Huawei
and ZTE.\20\ Policymakers have since been forced to enact restrictions
for U.S. procurement and grants due to the national security risks that

Current Implementation of BABA
While the Biden administration and DOT have made progress in
implementing BABA requirements, much remains to be done to ensure that
maximum benefits of the policy are achieved. Reversing the negative
impacts of decades of neglect in our nation's manufacturing base does
not happen overnight. With sustained commitment and strategic
investment, we can rebuild domestic industries, foster innovation, and
secure long-term economic prosperity for all Americans.
Areas of Progress for BABA Implementation
The Biden administration and DOT have made notable strides in
implementing Buy America policies, reflecting a commitment to
bolstering domestic industries and supporting workers. These include,
but are not limited to, the following examples:
Final Guidance Allows DOT to Accelerate Implementation
After a frustrating 17-month delay beyond the statutory deadline,
in August 2023, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Final
Guidance, allowing federal agencies to implement BABA. OMB's Final
Guidance established construction material origin standards and other
critical policies necessary to implement and enforce the new law. With
OMB's Final Guidance in place, departments and agencies are now able to
fully include BABA preference requirements in the terms and conditions
of federal financial assistance awards for public infrastructure.
FHWA Is Applying Buy America to Electric Vehicle Chargers
Despite the existence of its now four-decade-old general waiver of
its Buy America law for ``manufactured products'' issued in 1983, FHWA
deviated from its longstanding policy to apply the Title 23 Buy America
law to EV chargers purchased with newly authorized National Electric
Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program Assistance. Recognizing the
short-term market constraints faced by the emerging domestic EV charger
manufacturing sector, FHWA implemented a phased-in approach for Buy
America compliance, affording private sector companies a commercially
reasonable time period to adapt their supply chains and domestic
manufacturing operations. Notably, DOT's EV charger waiver results in
the same final domestic origin imposed by the BABA law for
``manufactured products''. Importantly, from USW's vantage, this policy
shift has already catalyzed significant investments in factories and
created job opportunities in domestic EV charger production.
FHWA Is Working to Discontinue the 1983 Manufactured
Products Waiver
In the 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA), Congress
enacted the Title 23 Buy America law that remains applicable to the
Federal-Aid Highway Program today. But since 1983, DOT has only applied
the Title 23 Buy America law and its regulations to steel, but not to
``manufactured products'' despite the law's express coverage of this
category of products.
After soliciting public input in 2023, FHWA has commenced a
rulemaking process, expected to move forward in Spring 2024, aimed at
phasing out the 1983 general waiver of manufactured products, and
replacing it with updated guidelines to clarify the covered products.
This longstanding blanket waiver has hindered opportunities for
expanding domestic supply chains and discouraged investments in U.S.
production for suppliers seeking to participate in Buy America-covered
markets. By the FHWA's own estimates, the Title 23 Buy America
requirement has only been applied to less than 5 percent of the average
highway project since 1983 due to the ``manufactured products'' waiver.
Given the critical importance of revitalizing lost industrial
capabilities, and the now apparent and unquestionable need to fortify
existing ones, we acknowledge DOT's efforts to start undoing the harm
of the 1983 waiver.
Areas for Improvement in BABA Implementation
As we examine Buy America policy at today's hearing, we must be
clear that implementation of the new BABA law is ongoing and much of
our public infrastructure spending continues to be completed absent
major elements of the domestic content preference policy. Since BABA
was enacted in November 2021, DOT has issued multiple waivers and
policy interpretations delaying implementation. Our union and other
stakeholders have filed comments raising concerns regarding these
actions. In some instances, such as their small grants and de minimis
waivers, DOT has been responsive and adequately addressed the concerns
of multiple commenters. However, billions of dollars are still being
spent on infrastructure projects that are sourcing foreign inputs. It
is imperative for DOT to expedite implementation by taking the crucial
steps outlined below.
Implementation Delays
More than two years have elapsed since the enactment of IIJA, yet
DOT has not fully implemented BABA. As the statutory implementation
deadline of May 14, 2022, approached, DOT issued a series of general
waivers that delayed the process. Consequently, billions of federal
assistance dollars--including IIJA funded projects--have been expended
across numerous infrastructure projects without key provisions of the
BABA law being enforced. DOT must prioritize the expeditious
implementation of BABA in order to make up for numerous missed
opportunities due to neglected statutory deadlines.
Devoting Resources to Stakeholder Education
Although both FHWA \22\ and FTA \23\ offer online guidance for
stakeholders, it is important to prioritize education for all
infrastructure stakeholders regarding the timing and implementation of
BABA policies. While criticisms alleging confusion from some critics
are exaggerated, DOT still bears the responsibility of collaborating
with stakeholders to establish clear expectations for the construction
sector and provide the strong market signals necessary to stimulate
investments in manufacturing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPA provides a useful model for effective stakeholder engagement
through initiatives such as trade shows, seminars, and outreach
programs; adopting similar strategies would enhance understanding and
compliance with BABA requirements across the infrastructure landscape.
Fewer General Waivers, More Product-Specific Waivers.
Since the enactment of BABA, DOT OAs have frequently resorted to
the issuance of general waivers, which significantly restrict or
entirely eliminate the application of Buy America provisions across
various product categories, entire programs, and even agencies. These
broad waivers ignore domestic workers who already produce Buy America-
compliant goods and materials within the United States.
General waivers undermine the market signals crucial for
stimulating investments in U.S. factories created by Buy America
policies. Instead of utilizing general waivers, BABA directs
departments and agencies to rely on product-specific, time-limited
waivers. A targeted approach to waivers, accompanied by full
transparency for the public, offers clear market signals essential for
investors and manufacturers to confidently make substantial capital
investments in domestic production capacity.
Increase Waiver Transparency
DOT must actively support and use the centralized MadeinAmerica.gov
website, which is aimed at informing the public about pending and
current Buy America waivers. Transparent Buy America waivers will
bolster domestic manufacturing by enabling existing suppliers to
promptly access potential opportunities to manufacture materials and
products needed for infrastructure projects. Additionally, this waiver
database will furnish valuable insights into the frequency, value, and
nature of purchases that are not sourced from domestic producers, which
empowers domestic manufacturers to make informed investment decisions
aimed at bridging gaps in our production capabilities.
Expanded Use of MEP Supplier Scouting
With experience collaborating with small- and medium-sized
manufacturers, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) is well-
equipped to identify domestic manufacturers prepared to supply the
materials and manufactured products essential for infrastructure
investment. Through BABA, Congress has explicitly mandated that DOT
agencies, including FHWA and FTA, are to collaborate with MEP. While
recognizing existing suppliers is an essential initial step, DOT should
also actively engage with MEP to pinpoint manufacturers interested in
expanding their operations to contribute to the domestic infrastructure
supply chain.
Respecting the BABA ``Savings Provision''
Congress included a ``savings provision'' in BABA to prevent the
weakening of existing Buy America policies during the implementation
process, reflecting its intention for DOT to apply more Buy America,
not less. For example, DOT issued a proposed waiver for de minimis and
small grants, which would have violated the savings provision if not
revised. By increasing the pre-existing de minimis threshold, DOT would
have weakened Buy America application for iron and steel products.
Additionally, DOT proposed a $500,000 small grants waiver when the pre-
existing small grants waiver was $150,000. In the final publication,
DOT ultimately adhered to the BABA ``savings provision''. DOT must be
vigilant in the application of the ``savings provision'' in order to
implement BABA as Congress intended.
Avoiding Shifting Origin Standards for Manufactured
Products
DOT must steer clear of implementing policies that weaken Buy
America by permitting multiple end products to be amalgamated as part
of a ``kit'' or ``system''. Since BABA mandates domestic final assembly
of manufactured products and requires over 55 percent of their
components to be domestically produced (70 percent for FTA rolling
stock), adopting this ``origin shift'' approach effectively eliminates
Buy America coverage for upstream components and materials. Congress
should oversee the classification of ``kits'' as manufactured products
and urge FTA to close its ``systems as end products'' loophole.
Monitoring for New Loopholes
Congress should diligently monitor the implementation of BABA to
prevent the creation of new loopholes. This oversight must include
scrutinizing the use of public interest and general applicability
waivers that diminish or eliminate Buy America coverage.
Apply BABA Prior to Any Other Procurement Preference, Like
Buy Clean
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, FHWA is instructed to use
certain funds to procure low carbon materials--i.e. concrete/asphalt,
steel, and other materials whose manufacturing process produces lower-
than-average carbon emissions. As FHWA implements these provisions, it
must ensure that BABA applies first, then Buy Clean can be applied
second. At its core, Buy Clean policies are competitiveness policies
birthed from the problem of Chinese steel in the California Bay Bridge,
and aimed at ensuring that U.S. workers are making the materials used
in our infrastructure projects. As FHWA implements these provisions,
they must utilize global industry averages for emissions and bifurcate
emissions standards for steel, just as the General Services
Administration (GSA) did in their Buy Clean pilot, to ensure that no
U.S.-based process for production is advantaged over another U.S.-based
process for production.
Conclusion
The Biden administration and DOT have shown a strong commitment to
bolstering the application of Buy America through proactive measures
aimed at fortifying domestic manufacturing and supply chains. However,
there is room for improvement as DOT continues BABA implementation.
Congress, too, can play a pivotal role in supporting the
administration's efforts by fostering bipartisan cooperation and
focusing on the shared goal of enhancing American manufacturing and
infrastructure--not by politicizing implementing policies.
On behalf of USW members making the products that supply our
nation's infrastructure projects, we appreciate the opportunity to
share our views on the current implementation of Buy America. We look
forward to working with Congress, DOT, and its stakeholders to advance
the ability of U.S. companies, and their workers, to provide American-
made products and materials for our public works infrastructure. Thank
you.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Ms. Salrin.
I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record statements
from the American Traffic Safety Services Association, the
Associated Builders and Contractors, the American Road and
Transportation Builders Association, and a submission from the
Portland Cement Association and the National Ready Mixed
Concrete Association.
Without objection, so ordered.
[Mr. Crawford's submissions for the record, including the
aforementioned items, are on pages 81-95.]
Mr. Crawford. Thank you all for your testimony. We will now
turn to questions from the panel. I recognize myself for
questions. I will start with Mr. Needham.
Arkansas' First Congressional District is proud to be a hub
for steel manufacturing, as you well know. Mississippi County
is the home of many major steel facilities, including three
Nucor facilities. We appreciate your company's commitment to
the families and local community there in our little corner of
the country.
Could you elaborate on how Buy America requirements
embedded in Federal policy have allowed domestic manufacturing
and industrial production to flourish?
Mr. Needham. I didn't catch the last part. Could you ask
that once again?
Mr. Crawford. Yes. Could you elaborate on how Buy America
requirements embedded in Federal policy have allowed domestic
manufacturing and industrial production to flourish?
Mr. Needham. Yes, in two ways.
One thing, Buy America, what it does do is it gives
companies like Nucor the confidence to invest in the future,
knowing that U.S. tax dollars, taxpayers' dollars, are going to
support and also support in buying American-made products. As I
mentioned in my opening statement, that has allowed Nucor since
2020 to invest $12 billion in our capabilities and expanding
our capacity to meet customer demands.
The other thing I would say about Buy America is it
absolutely creates and maintains high-paying and excellent jobs
here in the United States, and I will give a couple of
examples.
One thing that, I will highlight about Nucor is one of the
things that is excellent about our company is our culture. And
our culture is absolutely created by our 32,000 teammates
around North America, predominantly here in the United States.
And those 32,000 teammates create the results that we have in
our company. And one way that we share in that is we all share
in the fruits of our capabilities and our results.
One thing I would like to highlight is, our teammates
participate in a profit-sharing program. In that profit-sharing
program, I am glad to say, last year, Nucor paid out nearly $1
billion to all of our teammates because of what they created.
And so, Buy America programs help support jobs, create the
volume that we need to provide great-paying jobs in our local
communities.
Mr. Crawford. In many cases, this focus on retaining
American tax dollar investments in American companies and
workers actually lowers the bottom line of project costs, and I
am wondering if you could speak to that, as well. What are some
of the long-term benefits you are realizing?
Mr. Needham. So, long-term benefits also--I spoke to the
volume that it creates, and so, we make the investments, and
those investments we are confident because we have programs
like this that will support purchase of American-made products
in the future.
The other thing that our team does is our team makes more
money based on each ton, safe ton and quality ton, that they
put out the door. So, programs like these support our teammates
directly in providing that volume and those great jobs that we
need.
It also provides the infrastructure that we need to support
here in the United States, and that's absolutely a critical
part of what we are seeing today through the IIJA, the IRA, and
the CHIPS Act.
Mr. Crawford. Excellent. Thank you sir.
Mr. Braceras, I spent years pushing and passing legislation
that would prevent United States infrastructure dollars from
making their way to companies based in China and with links to
the Chinese Communist Party. Do State DOTs benefit when Federal
infrastructure funds are provided to companies in China, or
would the citizens of Utah and throughout the rest of the
country stand to gain more when the U.S. Government ensures
taxpayer dollars are delivered to companies in Utah and
elsewhere in American businesses?
Mr. Braceras. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Absolutely, the State of Utah, the citizens of Utah, and
the citizens of this country will benefit if we can grow the
manufacturing base. I think this is one of the areas where we
all agree on the goal, and that goal is to spend American money
on American stuff to benefit Americans.
And so, Mr. Chairman, I may not have heard the last part of
your question appropriately. So, if I could----
Mr. Crawford . Just talking about the value
that the investment in American companies delivers to
communities.
Mr. Braceras. Yes, absolutely.
When we can help grow American businesses and American
companies in the State of Utah, those companies, those people
are part of our community. They are invested in our community
and all those intrinsic values that make a community a great
place to live. And when they understand that they are part of
that community, they are not only a business, they are a
community member, a community partner, and they are invested in
the State of Utah for the long term.
And so, it's absolutely to the benefit economically, but
also from those things that are so intrinsic and the things
that we value most in our lives. They become friends, and they
help support our communities. And so, I think, fundamentally,
this is absolutely the right thing to do over the long run, is
to try to get to a place where we can grow and nurture those
businesses in the United States and Utah.
My goal is to deliver projects as effectively as possible
and to get the benefits from those projects. And I would like
to think that the free market system, if I can provide a level
playing field, I can get that competition to get the best value
for the taxpayers.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you.
Mr. Braceras. And I believe in that.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
Ranking Member Norton.
Ms. Norton. I thank the chair. This question is for Ms.
Salrin and Mr. Needham.
The Federal Highway Administration has longstanding Buy
America requirements that apply to iron and steel. These
protections are critical, as steel is the most widely used
metal in the construction industry. So, Ms. Salrin and Mr.
Needham, can each of you discuss the importance of Buy America
in preserving good-paying jobs and a robust U.S. manufacturing
base?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, thank you for the question.
I think, with robust implementation of Buy America
policies, not only can we preserve existing jobs, but we can
create more jobs. Buy America essentially gives U.S. producers
and workers a first shot at supplying the goods that go into
our critical infrastructure. And so, I think that we can
rebuild our middle class and ensure job security for millions
of workers if we ensure robust implementation of Buy America.
Mr. Needham. Yes, I would agree that when we think of our
manufacturing positions, they are high-paying jobs, they are
excellent jobs. And it is wonderful to be a part of the
resurgence of American manufacturing here in the United States.
And so, Buy America certainly supports that, those efforts. It
brings critical projects that we need for our country, and ones
where we can certainly provide those at a great service here in
the United States with American-made products.
And our teammates are absolutely right in the forefront of
that. They benefit from that, from a standpoint of wage. As I
mentioned, our teammates, a significant portion of their pay is
based on volume and good volume that they put out the door, so,
these projects certainly support that. And they also
participate in how we share in the results of our company. So,
Buy America certainly supports those.
Ms. Norton. This is another question for Ms. Salrin and Mr.
Needham.
There are additional benefits to manufacturing critical
construction materials in the United States. Products made in
America support jobs that provide access to healthcare. Thanks
to our environmental laws, U.S. manufacturing tends to release
fewer carbon emissions in the production process when compared
with other countries. So, Ms. Salrin and Mr. Needham, can you
discuss some of the other advantages, including worker benefits
and environmental protection, that come with supporting
manufacturing in America?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, of course. I will do the worker benefits
first.
So, by supporting American manufacturing and enforcing Buy
America policies, you give us the demand for U.S. producers to
increase production capacity. And when we go to the bargaining
table, that gives us more opportunity to advocate for
healthcare benefits, for retirement benefits, instead of
fighting for job security. And so, it gives us more leeway when
we go to the bargaining table to advocate for those extra
benefits for our members, instead of focusing on job security.
In terms of the environmental protections, strong Buy
America policies act to prevent shifts in offshore--shifts in
productions to countries that have lower environmental
standards and are high, more polluting than the United States.
And so, we are just exporting our pollution at that point.
Thank you.
Mr. Needham. And I would add that, from a climate
standpoint, one of the things that is probably not well known
to many, though, is for over 50 years now, Nucor has led the
way in how we produce steel. And there are a couple of ways to
produce steel, but we produce it by the circular method. And
when I say that, we recycle scrap into new steel products. And
so, our method of making steel versus what I would compare it
to, the blast furnace method of extracting iron ore from the
Earth, which is predominantly what's used around the rest of
the world, our method is 66 percent lower in greenhouse gas
emissions.
And so, Buy America provisions here, it certainly promotes
American steel products. And I will tell you, the American
steel industry today is one of the cleanest in the world, and
that is a fantastic thing that we have, is the strength here,
right here in the United States.
Ms. Norton. My time is expired.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman yields.
Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Edmondson, I know you are aware of the IIJA, some new
requirements for an expanded number of items that would be part
of the Buy America, and I just wondered if you have any insight
into how these added items might impact a person putting
together a bid, in that they have got to now find--it could be,
in a sense, a trinket which sometimes was overlooked before,
but can't be now. Have you any experience in that?
Mr. Edmondson. Yes, thank you.
Yes, when we put together a bid, we go out and we have got
to pull together pricing on all the components that go into a
job. And in anticipation of the Build America, Buy America
requirements, we have started asking our manufacturers to
provide a certification that says they can meet that
requirement. And more and more times than not, we are seeing
our manufacturers come back and say they may take exception.
And for us, as contractors, that's a problem because when
we have a risk like that--that's what it equates to us--we have
to make a decision, and it's either: proceed with the bid or
deal with our price structure. And uncertainty in our world is
not a good thing. So, the more and more that we can make this
process be a certainty for us, the better off we are going to
be.
We agree that--we are in the business of building America,
so, we want this to go in place. But it will take some time on
certain products. And like you said, there are minor products
that you don't necessarily think about when you are putting
together a bid on an interstate project, for instance, that may
cause us real problems on the other end when we can't procure
that product and meet the requirement.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Have you found any suppliers that
just can't do it, or are having difficulty in doing it?
Mr. Edmondson. We do have suppliers that just can't meet
the requirement. And we tend to see it on--a lot of times, it's
with manufactured products, where it may be a signal cabinet or
a generator, things that pull together multiple components to
make that product. That gets extremely difficult for these
manufacturers at times.
And quite frankly, the market is so good for a lot of these
manufacturers, they are going to go to where they are
comfortable, too. So, they may not pursue a certain type of
job. If you are a generator manufacturer, they may go into a
market that's not requiring that. So, that's causing us some
problems.
But again, it's going to take some time, but it's going to
end up being a good end result.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, is there a risk involved that
you would--sort of a fudge factor of some kind that you might
have the wrong product, or an uncertified product, or something
like that?
Mr. Edmondson. Typically, the way it works is everything
gets pushed down to the contractor. So, any requirement--we are
ultimately going to be responsible to meet all the
requirements, whatever is being imposed. So, that's our risk,
and it's something we have to deal with on a daily basis.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Also, is there sort of an added
cost of complying in that there is extra administrative stuff
that needs to be done? Have you found that to be true?
Mr. Edmondson. That is a real possibility. Our company, we
don't have a dedicated person that is a procurement individual
that guarantees we are going to meet these requirements. It's
something our project teams have to do on a regular basis.
Probably one of my biggest concerns is we know how to deal
with a lot of that, that process. Where you end up with trouble
that--or what I think is you are going to negatively impact
small businesses, disadvantaged businesses in some of these
requirements, because ultimately, we take a price from a
subcontractor, we are asking them to guarantee that product
meets all requirements. So, it's putting a burden on them that
they may or may not be able to deal with.
Mr. Webster of Florida. The time has run out. I thank you
for your answers.
I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Garcia.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking
Member, and all the witnesses for your expertise today.
Buying America requirements are essential for supporting
good-paying, union jobs that manufacture and produce materials
right here in the U.S. IIJA-funded infrastructure projects are
beginning to break ground, and we should be using products made
by U.S. companies with U.S. workers that benefit our economy.
The American Transportation Research Institute recently
announced that the second and third most congested bottlenecks
in the country are in or near my district. One of these is a
segment on Interstate 290. This highway was constructed in the
1950s, is heavily traveled, and is severely deteriorated. It's
in need of reconstruction, and there are plans to add a high-
occupancy toll lane to improve congestion. A concurrent CTA
project is also being considered in the same corridor to
rehabilitate the Blue Line Forest Park branch rail station and
terminal infrastructure.
Mr. Braceras, this project is estimated to bring in 22,000
construction-related jobs, will improve safety and mobility,
and decrease pollution from idling vehicles. How can we
encourage the State DOTs to abide by Buy America requirements?
And what additional resources do the agencies that you
represent need to improve compliance and prevent delays?
Mr. Braceras. Thank you, Congressman.
First of all, all State DOTs support and adhere to the
Build America, Buy America provisions, and they are committed
to them. I think that's really an important component we need
to all understand.
The percentage of items that we talk about sometimes is
very small in terms of the total project piece, in terms of
cost and elements. And so, I think it's better understanding of
the supply chains to do some market research to understand the
elements that are the more difficult ones to find compliance
with. As Mr. Edmondson said, when a contractor is getting
quotes on a job, it's a pretty tight timeframe for them to make
this commitment, and they have to price the risk on that.
And so, I think, as a Nation, if we could better understand
the market and where the stuff is--what are the things that are
a challenge to us to have compliance with Build America, Buy
America, and then what are the barriers with having that
onshored, having that process onshored. I think that would help
us--lend to us getting there in a much smoother way because we
want to be there, we can get there.
I know we are going to get there as a country, it's just
how we get there, and I don't want us to stumble over the small
items that are more difficult. There are processes we can think
about on how, as a country, we can figure out what are those
things we should focus on, and then how can we help those
elements, companies, the private sector say, ``You know what? I
think there is a business here for me to do this in America and
to support those jobs.''
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you for that.
Ms. Salrin, Buy America requirements are beneficial for
many reasons, including the fact that they support domestic
manufacturing jobs with responsible practices. Many countries
that we outsource production to have weaker labor and
environmental standards. The EPA has determined that they will
not apply Buy America to the Clean School Bus Program.
Given that Congress has clearly identified that
administering Buy America is in the public interest, how do
departments and agencies determine that it is in the public
interest to waive its application?
Ms. Salrin. Thank you for that question. I will note that
USW last year organized Blue Bird manufacturing workers in
Georgia, and so, we have a really high stake in ensuring that
EPA does apply domestic procurement standards for clean
schoolbuses.
But I think, to answer your question, in terms of public
interest, USW opposes--strongly opposes--public interest
waivers and general applicability waivers because they do not
send market signals, and they allow for a large variety of
foreign products to come in. And we highly suggest--and in my
testimony I lay out--that we should focus on product-specific
waivers that will allow manufacturers to see gaps in the supply
chain, invest in that, as well as allow departments of
transportation to go ahead with projects without any delay, and
then also give Members of Congress an idea of where we lack in
domestic capacity.
Thank you.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Bost.
Mr. Bost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Needham, my office has heard from many industry
stakeholders that are expressing concerns about how the Build
America, Buy America Act has been implemented. And I have been
told that the guidance is unclear and takes a long time for the
administration to publish rules.
Mr. Chair, I request unanimous consent to enter into the
record a letter from nine industry groups to the administration
raising serious concerns about how the law is being
implemented.
Mr. Crawford. Without objection, so ordered.

Letter of March 20, 2023, to President Biden from Nine Iron and Steel
Industry Groups, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Mike Bost
March 20, 2023.
The President,
The White House,
Washington, DC 20500.
Dear Mr. President:
On behalf of the undersigned organizations, which represent the
overwhelming majority of domestic iron and steel producers and their
workers, as well as associations representing fabrication and
manufacturing of iron and steel products, we write to express our
collective support for Buy America policies that maximize the U.S.
economic impact of infrastructure investments.
We applaud your enduring commitment to strengthening domestic
content preference policies, including through Executive Order 14005
and implementation of the ``Build America, Buy America'' (BABA)
policies enacted as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).
Prior to BABA, our nation's Buy America laws were limited in their
coverage, eroded by unjustified waivers, and narrowed further by agency
loopholes. As a result, billions of federal assistance infrastructure
dollars have been used annually to purchase foreign products and
materials--bypassing American workers ready to produce the inputs
necessary to build our infrastructure. Full and immediate
implementation of BABA to additional programs will ensure that American
workers continue to produce the iron and steel products that comprise
the backbone of our country's public works infrastructure, as well as
manufactured products and construction materials covered under the new
law.
To ensure that BABA implementation matches the intent of Congress
and your commitment to the policy, we wish to raise several pending
implementation challenges that require careful recalibration. Congress
established a May 14, 2022, statutory implementation deadline for
departments and agencies to ensure that financial assistance awards
comply with the new Buy America law. However, departments continue to
deploy general waivers to repeatedly delay BABA implementation--
including for iron and steel products that have established supply
chains, have been subject to program-specific Buy America laws for
decades, and are well-understood by infrastructure stakeholders. For
instance, in addition to its initial six-month delay, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently proposed more waivers to
further delay BABA coverage for iron and steel products that extend
into late 2024. These delays have consequences for American workers and
capital investment decisions, as billions of dollars from the BIL and
other federal assistance are being spent absent major elements of the
BABA law.
Furthermore, we are concerned that many departments have proposed
de minimis, small grants, and minor components general waivers that are
not only inconsistent with, but that also erode longstanding Buy
America coverage for iron and steel products under existing statutes
and well-established policies. Congress included a ``savings
provision'' in the BABA statute to ensure that no existing policies or
laws would be weakened during implementation. We are concerned,
however, that several departments have advanced policies in their
implementation of the new law that conflict with the ``savings
provision,'' overlooking the spirit and the letter of BABA and its
precursor federal Buy America requirements.
For instance, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed a
``de minimis'' waiver that would allow non-compliant products totaling
five percent of overall costs, or up to $1 million, in its federal-aid
infrastructure projects. Because DOT proposes to calculate its de
minimis exception based on a percentage of overall costs rather than a
percentage of materials costs, the amount of non-compliant, foreign
products permitted to be used (5%) exceeds FHWA's own estimate of the
cost of all iron and steel (4.8%) used on a typical highway project. In
other words, DOT's proposed de minimis waiver effectively repeals Buy
America coverage for iron and steel on highway projects less than $20
million.
While we have no objections to reasonable exceptions and
flexibilities to facilitate project compliance, many of the proposed de
minimis, small grants, and minor components waivers being proposed by
DOT and other departments are inconsistent, would undermine the new
BABA law, or, worse yet, would erode existing Buy America laws and
policies. The intent of the BABA law was not to create new loopholes to
be exploited by foreign competitors to the detriment of U.S.
manufacturers and their workers. We strongly urge that these general
waivers be revised and that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
update its April 18, 2022, memorandum, ``Initial Implementation
Guidance on Application of Buy America Preference in Federal Financial
Assistance Programs for Infrastructure'' (M-22-11), which is being
relied upon by departments to justify these lenient implementing
policies.
Again, we applaud your enduring commitment to strong Buy America
policies, which ensure that the benefits of our infrastructure
investments are felt by workers throughout our supply chains. Robust
implementation of BABA directed by well-calibrated OMB guidance and
department-level implementing policies will result in more American
taxpayer dollars reinvested back into our economy--bolstering domestic
supply chains, strengthening U.S. national security, and helping to
revitalize the U.S. manufacturing base to the benefit of workers and
communities across the country.

Mr. Bost. OK, now that we have got that in there, Mr.
Needham, can you please speak to how the delays affect Nucor's
ability to meet demand?
Also, have you been able to talk with the administration
about how to speed up the implementation?
Mr. Needham. The implementation specifically of Buy
America?
Mr. Bost. Mm-hmm.
Mr. Needham. Because what I would say is the delays that we
are seeing is in the actual breaking ground of projects. From
an IIJA standpoint and certainly some of the IRA, some of that
is certainly--I think one on the panel mentioned labor
constraints and actually executing and building the projects.
And then the other I would say is, just the process, the
regulatory process of getting things through.
From a Buy America standpoint, from our perspective on the
steel side, this has been implemented for over 40 years through
the DOT and the Federal Highway Administration and the FTA, and
that has been very effective. So, we have not seen delays
because of that process. It's very well established from a
standpoint of certifying projects.
As we produce steel, a critical part of our process that we
have been doing from day one is certifying what are the
components of the steel. And so, we issue certified mill test
reports, and that will show the origins of the steel. And so,
that has worked very well and continues to work well. So, I
wouldn't say that we have seen delays from that standpoint on
Buy America.
Mr. Bost. So, my second question, as many of you know, I
have been a strong supporter of Buy America, especially with
our steel industry. I have worked closely with many of my
colleagues, including the chair, that our domestic
manufacturing base is strong.
Now, over the past few decades, the American steel industry
has been fighting foreign trade cheats. During the Trump
administration and supported by this administration, the
Department of Commerce took steps to fight back against illegal
dumping of steel with trade tariffs. Now, this action to help
boost the industry, however, seems to be at odds with the
decision of drastically increasing and minimizing the threshold
for Buy America requirements.
Now, I understand that there should be a reasonable level
for exempting a product, but changing it from $2,500 to $1
million is a pretty drastic increase. Do you feel that these
two policies align together, or how does the dollar amount from
$2,500 to $1 million open the door for the same foreign actors
to play the same games they did, but the Department has been
trying to stop?
Mr. Needham. Thank you for that question. No, we don't
think that that is a reasonable raise. And the reason for that
is, the American steel industry today is operating at about 76
percent capacity utilization. So, there are millions of tons
available for us to provide to these types of projects. And so,
raising the de minimis is doing exactly what you have said, it
is allowing foreign steel to come in when we can supply that.
The other thing it does--and I mentioned previously--is
that the steel made here in the United States is 66 percent
less in greenhouse gases. So, it's worse for our climate by
bringing in foreign steel. And today, in America, about 70
percent of our steel is made through the circular steel method,
with Nucor and our competitors leading the way.
Mr. Bost. Well, thank you for answering that question. I
just wanted to make sure we got that on the record. It is my
hope that every administration in the future understands how
important it is to make sure that we are using American-made
steel and other products. We know how it affects our
communities, how important it is to keep people working. But
not only that, to know that the quality of the product that we
are putting in meets that standard that we expect.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Menendez.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ms. Salrin, I appreciate the United Steelworkers being one
of the strongest proponents of Buy America policies. As you
know, the Biden administration has issued new, stronger Buy
America standards for electric vehicle chargers. Unfortunately,
some in Congress attempted to repeal those standards earlier
this year. So, it's important to set the record straight,
especially given the importance of electrification projects
across the country.
A few local examples from my district include New Jersey
Transit's efforts to convert their bus fleet to electric
vehicles and their work on converting diesel ferries to
electric. I am excited to share that earlier this year, they
received a Federal grant of $7 million to carry out this
important work.
Ms. Salrin, can you speak to the importance of strong Buy
America standards and their impact on the electrification of
the broader transportation industry, such as electric buses and
electric ferry programs?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, thank you for the question.
To discuss the EV charger waiver that DOT had implemented,
basically this waiver deviates from a 1983 manufactured product
waiver. DOT acted proactively to ensure that EV chargers and
the manufacturers started domestic capacity because 3 years
ago, we had zero manufacturers manufacturing EV chargers. And
so, with the waiver implementing policy, this allows for
manufacturers to invest, build up domestic capacity in order to
meet the 55-percent domestic content threshold, and we believe
that DOT has taken the right steps and continues to do so, and
so, we are supportive of their efforts to increase domestic
production of EV charging stations.
Mr. Menendez. Great. Thank you for that.
Mr. Enders, thank you for your testimony this morning
highlighting the importance of Build America, Buy America
exemptions for the asphalt paving industry. New Jersey's Eighth
Congressional District is one of the busiest transportation
hubs in the country. Thanks to the IIJA, in fiscal year 2022
and 2023, New Jersey was awarded $110 million in grants for
road and bridge improvements, and the State was reimbursed $166
million for their work. These projects are critical to
improving New Jersey infrastructure, and asphalt pavement is a
critical material in completing these projects.
Mr. Enders, can you share how road and bridge projects in
New Jersey are impacted by construction material exemptions?
Mr. Enders. Yes, thank you for the question.
In different areas of the country, the availability to get
asphalt binder or the availability to get quality aggregates
differs. In Wisconsin, we have quality aggregates, and we can
get them right there in Wisconsin. And it's pretty rural, so,
the ability to open a quarry and get rock is a lot different,
I'm sure, than it is in New Jersey, New York, and areas like
that, where there isn't the room and the challenges.
So, having the ability to bring in materials to that area
from, let's say, Canada and other areas like that, supplement
the products that exist. And I think also what it does is it
gives contractors flexibility, it gives them resources that are
going to allow them to bid on more projects, complete more
work.
Mr. Menendez. Yes. You mentioned some of the dynamics
specific to areas like New Jersey and the Northeast. How
critical is recycled asphalt pavement usage within the New
Jersey roadway market?
Mr. Enders. So, recycled asphalt is making up, right now,
over 20 percent of new asphalt mix that goes out onto the
roadway. When you are in urban areas that you are describing,
the amount of reclaimed asphalt is--there's plenty. And the
ability to continue to use more reclaimed asphalt, which
ultimately gives you aggregates and asphalt binder, continues
to help you be less reliant on the materials you are getting
from other places.
Mr. Menendez. Yes, and there are other benefits, as well.
You also mentioned in your testimony that recycled asphalt
pavement is a big part of the asphalt industry's focus on
sustainability. Can you share more about that effort and the
importance of exempting asphalt binder?
Mr. Enders. Part of exempting asphalt binder, again, it's
not that we don't produce it in the United States, right? Over
80 percent, I believe, is produced in the United States. We are
using it to supplement what we have going on.
The recyclability, as we continue to be able to do more of
that, it helps us go closer to net-zero emissions by 2050, and
it continues to be an avenue to reuse our materials that we
have down. I mean, that is one of the benefits of asphalt, is
that it continues to be reused and reused, most of the time
back in the asphalt mix itself.
Mr. Menendez. Great. Thank you all so much, and I yield
back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Needham, kind of a side thought on this. China was
known for a long time as taking so much of our scrap metals and
such. Do you have an idea what that percentage is these days?
Are they using less of our scrap? Are we keeping more of it,
like you were talking about in that circular conversation you
were saying?
Mr. Needham. I don't have the specific content or amount
that they are taking. But what I would tell you is, China
produces steel predominantly through the extractive method. So,
they would use less scrap in their process, although they have
expanded in their----
Mr. LaMalfa . That is what you are alluding
to, but it seemed for at least a long time that they were
taking the bulk of American scrap and reconfiguring it over
there.
Mr. Needham. Yes, the bulk of American scrap is recycled
here in America. So----
Mr. LaMalfa . Yes, that is good.
Mr. Needham . Today about 20 percent, at most,
15 to 20 percent would be going export. But most of it is
staying here in the U.S.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, good. That's a big plus for all the
logistics. I know you keep talking about greenhouse gas, but I
have to remind everybody CO2 is only 0.04 percent of our
atmosphere. And all this net-zero talk is folly, especially
when you consider that America is one of the countries already
flattening the CO2 curve, and China and others keep upping
theirs. And so, we will do good by doing that, but we are going
to throttle ourselves if we keep pursuing these crazy CO2 goals
and net-zero stuff. So, maybe we could back off on that a
little bit.
But I wanted to ask also Mr. Braceras and Mr. Edmondson, as
we keep going hell-bent towards this electric vehicle and these
charging stations, and they are doing waivers in order to get
the material from somewhere else, get these projects from
somewhere else, do you think perhaps we could prioritize other
infrastructure, other projects while we wait to scale up this
domestic manufacturing for chargers that could be made here,
and the other components so we are not sending so much dollars
to foreign competitors?
Mr. Braceras. Yes, thank you for the question.
In Utah, we take an approach of all of the above. We can't
just put all of our eggs in one basket. And so, air quality is
one of the concerns that we deal with in Utah. We live in a
basin. And when we get the winter inversions, the air gets
trapped in there, and the air is not moving. And so, air
quality is a very high concern for our citizens. And so, going
towards electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, hydrogen is
something that we are looking at. We still believe that coal is
going to play a good part of our portfolio, and oil and gas is
a big part of the extractive industry in Utah, as well.
So, we believe that an all-of-the-above approach, and that
how you get there is really important. I mean, we all agree on
the goal of where we want to be, but we need to figure out the
right transition methods so that the markets can see where we
are going, the markets can adjust to where we are going as they
can minimize risks to make investments in the long run.
Mr. LaMalfa. That's not really an answer. What I am looking
for is, can we prioritize other things instead of having to buy
foreign products because we have to hurry on this electric
charger bit?
Mr. Braceras. I am probably not understanding your question
very well. We believe electrification will be part of the
future in Utah. We would like to have seen the guidance come
out a little quicker out of the administration to help us
implement this, and we do need some flexibility, but we're
not----
Mr. LaMalfa . Thank you.
Mr. Edmondson, would you take a crack at that?
Mr. Braceras. OK.
Mr. Edmondson. I would answer the question this way. I
think the manufacturing capacity in the country will move to
the available markets, whatever those are. I mean, it will be
the EV market, it will be the component of the product example
I gave. I think the capacity in this country to move into those
markets and fill the needs that we're going to have will
definitely take place.
Is there going to be a priority given to EV over a
generator manufacturer being able to meet that? I----
Mr. LaMalfa . Well, in that we're doing
waivers in order to make EV charging systems and they have to
come from somewhere else, whereas maybe we could be working on
other things instead of hurrying EV chargers and having
American jobs and American manufacturing. That's what I am
getting at.
Mr. Edmondson. That's part of our argument with--we want a
clear process that is not politicized, and it allows the
manufacturers to move into the markets where we need to move.
And that's part of our concern.
The way it is programmed right now, OMB is basically going
to dictate a lot of these answers, and that's why we are a
proponent----
Mr. LaMalfa . That's a thing--that's not a
market, that's being forced into a market that we are seeing
that consumers are not chasing with electric cars as you see
Ford pulling back, others pulling back.
And then a recent story I just saw on hydrogen, which, hey,
would be great, but it seems like there are people a lot less
confident in hydrogen's future.
So, I better yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
the witnesses for your testimony today.
For years, we have listened to Donald Trump, better known
as ``Individual 1,'' brag about Made in America as his White
House defended his own companies producing products overseas in
countries such as China, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Donald
Trump's rhetoric about Made in America was like his
infrastructure week, and his replacement for the Affordable
Care Act, and his desire to build the wall. It was all words
and no intention to get it done.
On the other hand, President Biden came in with a serious
plan and competently took swift action and passed the
bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act within his
first year in office. The result is the U.S. economy, which is
experiencing some of the strongest economic growth in the
world, rather than trickle-down economics, it's expanding the
economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
President Biden's policies of upgrading infrastructure and
promoting domestic procurement through robust Build America,
Buy America provisions is an important component of that
economic growth, and the mandates to use American-made
materials to boost domestic manufacturing, fortify supply
chains, and foster the creation of high-quality union jobs is
making a tremendous difference in the lives of the American
people.
Ms. Salrin, last month, I had the honor of welcoming EPA
Administrator Michael Regan to my district to celebrate the
announcement that the DeKalb County School District has been
awarded $20 million to purchase all-electric buses under the
Environmental Protection Agency grant program. And with major
interstates running through my district, exposing residents to
particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, which are especially
harmful to our children, I fully support the transition to
electric vehicles and schoolbuses.
Buy America plays a crucial role in creating U.S. jobs and
strengthening our economy, particularly as the global economy
transitions away from the internal combustion engine to cleaner
renewable energy sources that ameliorate the effects of climate
change. So, can you speak to the importance of the Buy America
on the global transition towards electric-powered vehicles and
on how Buy America contributes to U.S. economic growth?
Ms. Salrin. Of course. So, USW is the largest union in the
auto supply chain. We manufacture a variety of auto parts
specific to internal combustion engines, as well as numerous
parts that go into EVs. And we also represent a majority of the
oil workers.
But Buy America, proper implementation of Buy America, will
allow us to transition and have a larger stake in the electric
vehicle market. Like I mentioned before, 3 years ago, we didn't
have any EV charger manufacturers, and that is a problem
because the transition is happening, and we need to make sure
that we are ready for it, and workers are trained, and jobs are
there for workers to transition to.
And so, Buy America policies offer that kind of flexibility
and ensuring that we can have the good-paying jobs still during
the transition to cleaner and a diverse electric vehicle fleet,
yes.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. The United Steelworkers
union is one of the strongest proponents of Buy America
policies, and the Biden administration has issued robust Buy
America standards for electric vehicle chargers. Unfortunately,
however, some in Congress tried to repeal those standards
earlier this year, but fortunately, they did not prevail. Can
you speak to why President Biden's Buy America strict standards
for EV chargers are so important?
Ms. Salrin. Yes. So, Biden's policy deviated from a 1983
Manufactured Products Waiver, which basically would have made
EV chargers not covered by Buy America at all. And what his
policy did was phased-in implementation, and it requires final
assembly to be done in the United States while manufacturers
invest in critical capacity.
And then, in July, the requirements will be exactly what
BABA had: 55 percent domestic content for EV chargers. And so,
what the Biden policy did is it encouraged domestic investment
to meet those requirements.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much.
Mr. Needham, I want to real quickly ask. You said Nucor
does a 66-percent cleaner than the original blast furnaces.
Does that take into account the original make of the steel you
are recycling?

Mr. Stauber. Just yes or no, because I have got to move on.
Mr. Needham. Can you repeat that, please?
Mr. Stauber. So, 66 percent cleaner, you said, Nucor,
right?
Mr. Needham. Yes.
Mr. Stauber. Than the blast furnaces. Does that percentage
take into account the original make of the steel?
Mr. Needham. The recycled content, the scrap, is--the
makeup of that is not part of----
Mr. Stauber . It's not. OK. OK, so, it
doesn't include it. Obviously, from the Iron Range, I am going
to protect the taconite.
Ms. Salrin, thank you for being here today. I appreciate
you being here. Recently the EPA has finalized the Nation's
first-ever limits on emissions of mercury at taconite plants.
Are you aware of the rule?
Ms. Salrin. I am aware of it, but I have not been--I do not
handle that issue for the steelworkers.
Mr. Stauber. You don't handle the issue for the
steelworkers?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, that is a different staffer, but I can----
Mr. Stauber . Do you realize that six of the
seven taconite plants in this country are USW workers in the
district I represent?
Are you concerned that this impact is going to put our
steelworkers out of work and foreign source to steel? Are you
concerned about that?
Ms. Salrin. The USW is concerned, and we have been having
discussions with EPA.
Mr. Stauber. Did the USW in the rulemaking put any comments
forward?
Ms. Salrin. We did, and we are happy to provide those
comments to you, yes.
Mr. Stauber. OK. I don't think you did. I can't find any
USW opposition to this rule. So, we will--I will look forward
to----
Ms. Salrin  Yes.
Mr. Stauber . If I am wrong, I look forward to
you correcting me, OK? Because I have no knowledge of USW
pushing back against this rule.
We talk about EV charging stations. So, in northeastern
Minnesota, we mine the taconite that makes 82 percent of the
steel made in this country. In your testimony--and what you
said today is USW opposes waivers, and you said we need to
build up our domestic capacity. And just moments ago you said
we need to build up our critical capacity. Let's just talk
about EV charging stations. You are aware the Biden
administration wants to scrap Buy America for the EV charging
stations, correct? You are aware of that?
Ms. Salrin. That is not correct.
Mr. Stauber. That is correct. That is correct. In fact,
$7.4 billion you want to waive to allow removing the Buy
American. We had a hearing on it. Do you support waiving Buy
American for the steel and the concrete and the critical
minerals in the EV charging stations? Do you support that?
Ms. Salrin. It is a product-specific waiver----
Mr. Stauber . Wait a minute.
Ms. Salrin . That allows us to build up
domestic capacity.
Mr. Stauber. How can you build up domestic capacity when
Biden has shut down our critical mineral mine? You can't build
up domestic capacity. We have in northeastern Minnesota, ma'am,
we have the biggest copper nickel find in the world: 95 percent
of the nickel, 88 percent of the cobalt, over one-third of the
copper, other platinum group metals that go into the EV
chargers, et cetera, EV vehicles. And he shut it down.
So, when you say build up domestic capacity, let me kind of
rephrase it, what you are saying. Currently, the administration
that you support is working on memorandums of understanding
with the Chinese Government in the Congo that own 15 of the 19
mines that use child slave labor, no environmental standards,
and no labor standards. I want our union workers in
northeastern Minnesota to mine those critical minerals, don't
you?
Ms. Salrin. We do, too, yes.
Mr. Stauber. And so, how can we build up critical capacity
when Joe Biden and his administration shuts it down? It doesn't
make sense to me in your explanation on building up critical
capacity. It's not happening. You're outsourcing it. You don't
want to outsource that, right? Because that removes union jobs.
Am I right?
Ms. Salrin. That is correct.
Mr. Stauber. That is correct. Don't we want to build up
domestic supply?
And remember, as a candidate, Joe Biden in October of 2020
said to the American people, we are going to mine these
critical minerals domestically. That was music to our ears.
After he was sworn in, what did he do? What did he do? He
changed his mind from mining domestically. That hurts our
steelworkers.
I want you to make sure that our boots-on-the-ground
steelworkers in northeastern Minnesota are taken care of. The
EPA rule on mercury, for you not to comment on it and then
supporting a waiver--you said you don't support waivers. The
USW supported the waiver on the Buy American for the EV
charging stations, and I think this is simply unacceptable.
We need the work. Northeastern Minnesota can mine these
critical minerals, ma'am, like, better than anybody in the
country.
Ms. Salrin. And we agree.
Mr. Stauber. And I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Mann.
Mr. Mann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being
here today.
I represent the Big First District of Kansas, a primarily
rural district in the western two-thirds of Kansas, where
transportation is very, very important. We have 83,000 miles of
roads, more than 4,000 miles of railroad tracks, 67 public
airports. And we rely heavily on this infrastructure to get our
ag products out of the fields, off the farms, away from feed
yards, and to markets.
Buy America requirements have expanded domestic
manufacturing capabilities and have had positive impacts on
both Kansas and the U.S. workforce and economy. However, there
has been significant confusion and uncertainty, as I see it,
around the implementation of IIJA and the included Build
America, Buy America Act.
At a time when our country is facing historic inflation and
supply chain disruptions, OMB issued implementation guidance
without consideration of our country's domestic manufacturing
capabilities in the first place. This inconsistency and lack of
transparency and waiver requirements has put significant
strains on the industry and has led to increased cost delays
and the inability to source and procure products, as mentioned
earlier. OMB must produce consistent, transparent, and timely
guidance on Build America, Buy America for compliance so these
projects do not continue to be stalled.
A handful of questions. First for you, Mr. Edmondson--
again, thanks for being here. Currently, OMB final guidance
provides agencies with discretion concerning the issuance of
Build America, Buy America, these waivers we have been talking
about. What do you believe we need to do to streamline and make
the process more efficient?
Basically, how do we need to fix these waiver issues that
we keep hearing talked about?
Mr. Edmondson. The best example I can give you is AGC of
America, specifically our utility infrastructure division,
works closely with the EPA, and they are very knowledgeable on
our concerns. They are knowledgeable on the products we are
having trouble with. The more we utilize--let the agencies that
deal with the projects be more involved. That is the easiest
solution that I can give you.
And it works because, again, our relationship just with the
EPA is invaluable. And it's creating a great platform and a
great forum for us to discuss the problems, and then they can
then take it to wherever they have got to take it to deal with
the issues that we are seeing. But they are very familiar with
what's going on in the market, and I think that would be the
case whether it's a highway issue or--well, pick your example,
Federal issue, whatever. It's going to be the same, I believe.
Mr. Mann. Many comments filed in the docket in response to
OMB's Build America, Buy America guidance emphasized the need
for consistent implementation of the legislation's
requirements. In its final guidance, OMB stated its intention
to regularly convene interagency working groups to ensure that
the Federal agencies implement Build America, Buy America in a
consistent, uniform, efficient, and transparent manner.
Again, Mr. Edmondson, do you think the State DOTs have been
invited to engage in these working groups to bring frontline
experience and reality?
I mean, are these working groups helping? Are the working
groups working, so to speak, and are we seeing improvements?
Mr. Edmondson. Yes. In North Carolina, we have a joint
committee with our DOT, our Carolinas AGC, our local chapter.
That has been a great resource. And it's a great forum for us
to voice any concerns that we have in the marketplace. And then
it also--they have that information and they're helping to, on
the design side, they're helping to mitigate, where they can,
any issues that aren't going to be sourced or that would be
difficult to source here.
Mr. Mann. OK, and for you, Mr. Braceras, kind of the same
question. What is your thought on these working groups? Have
you all been invited to participate? Any feedback from your
standpoint?
Mr. Braceras. Yes, thank you, Congressman.
Yes, I think relationships have been mentioned before, but
the folks at the Federal Highway Administration, they are
friends of ours, and they listen to us, and they are constantly
reaching out and asking what they can do to help. We have folks
in our division office that are Utah citizens that are aware of
what we are dealing with, and that relationship really helps us
get through some of these more difficult conversations.
At the end of the day, it's going to get down to us
understanding the supply chains and what the market truly is to
understand how we can get to the point where 100 percent of
everything--we don't have to even ask for waivers.
Mr. Mann. Yes.
Mr. Braceras. But it's a deliberate process of doing this,
and we have to do it with the input from the stakeholders.
Mr. Mann. Great. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Ms. Titus.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We have heard a lot about the impact on Buy America for the
economy and how it creates jobs, it's good for workers. I
suspect that the Buy America plan also benefits our
environment. Can you talk about how it contributes to a more
sustainable construction industry, maybe Mr. Needham?
Mr. Needham. Yes. What I have referred to before is that it
certainly does benefit our environment, and one way it does is
that the American steel industry, from our perspective and
today, over 70 percent of it produces steel by the circular
steel method. So, recycled scrap. So, the way we make steel
here in the United States is 66 percent lower greenhouse gases
than the blast furnace average around the world. So,
absolutely, it does benefit from that standpoint.
Ms. Titus. That is another benefit from Buy America, just--
--
Mr. Needham . Absolutely.
Ms. Titus . Saving the planet.
Ms. Salrin?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, so, I would like to draw your attention.
In my written testimony, I highlighted how Buy America is so
good for our shared environmental goals. And the National
Academy of Sciences did research that showed a large fraction
of Chinese emissions are due to the manufacture of goods for
foreign consumption. They cited that Los Angeles experiences at
least 1 extra day a year of smog that exceeds Federal ozone
limits because of nitrous oxides and carbon monoxide emitted by
Chinese factories making goods for exports.
And so, it is really important that we limit our
procurement to American-made so that we are not benefiting
Chinese polluters for entering our market and degrading our own
environment.
Ms. Titus. Thank you.
Anybody else want to comment?
Mr. Enders. I would just like to add that the exemption
allows the asphalt industry to use reclaimed asphalt pavement.
Currently, we are recycling over 90 million tons of asphalt in
the United States and continuing to look at increasing that.
Ms. Titus. That's great. I am glad to hear that. I think
that's worth mentioning and putting on the record, so, thank
you very much.
My second question has to do with waivers. I think you
mentioned this in your testimony, that we need fewer broad and
general waivers of Buy America, but that the time-limited,
product-specific waivers can be useful tools or useful signals
to the market. Would you elaborate on that?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, of course. So, USW strongly opposes the
general applicability, public interest waivers that cover a
variety of products like the 1983 Manufactured Products Waiver.
With product-specific waivers, we give manufacturers the
ability--if they are transparent, you give the manufacturers
the ability to go in, see the waivers, see the products that
the waivers cover, and build up domestic capacity. And not only
does that allow for us to be able to supply those products
later, when the time limit is up, but it also allows Congress
to know kind of where our supply chain gaps are, and it allows
for transportation workers and State DOTs to continue projects
without any delay if they are having trouble sourcing products.
So, product-specific waivers are really good, and the more
that we have them, the more it means Buy America is working
because we are making sure that we are investing in domestic
capacity by that.
Ms. Titus. So, they act as incentives for us to develop
those industries that we are now having to get a waiver for to
go outside.
Ms. Salrin. Correct, because the decades of
deindustrialization--it doesn't happen overnight, and so, they
allow us to build up that capacity.
Ms. Titus. Anybody else?
All right. Well, thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Owens.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Build America, Buy America does not simply represent a
policy. It represents a fundamental goal to reinvest America
taxpayer dollars at home in our own communities, supporting
American workers, businesses, and communities. However, even in
the best Government, policies need refinement if it's not
working for the cities, States, and communities.
Following exorbitant Government spending by this
administration, Buy America requirements could not be more
relevant. Every member of this committee shares the common
goals of strengthening infrastructure, revitalizing American
manufacturing, and fostering economic growth. Let's continue
working together for this reality without the undue burden
placed on American innovators and job creators.
First of all, I appreciate the education that I am getting,
actually, the idea of what waivers mean and how that impacts
us, and our goal to kind of make sure we are doing it right.
Mr. Edmondson, you mentioned part of the solution would be EPA
taking a bigger role. What I want to do is ask each--Mr.
Braceras, Mr. Needham, and Mr. Enders, what do you see is the
best way of keeping our priorities on America first, but yet
tweaking our waivers so that it can fit in so we can grow this
process where we can actually get to a point where we don't
need waivers again?
So, your industry basically, how would you do that? I will
start with Mr. Braceras.
Mr. Braceras. Thank you, Congressman.
So, I think it's important to recognize that there are a
lot of moving parts to this. And as State DOTs are trying to
move projects forward, we have got that goal of getting those
projects advertised to get the safety benefits and the mobility
benefits out there. And so, we really encourage our Federal
partners to recognize what we are trying to accomplish, but we
are trying to do it within the parameters and the rules that
are set by Congress and by those Federal agencies. And
sometimes it doesn't feel like we have that necessarily they
are recognizing what we are trying to accomplish. It feels like
there might be more of a singular focus on what their rule is
or what their goal is.
And so, I think encouraging the continual collaboration so
that when we are having a conversation with the different
Federal agencies, there is a recognition of what the end goal
is. We are trying to save lives and make lives better,
fundamentally. And we can do that, and we can still meet the
provisions of Build America, Buy America if we all agree that
we are going to work together towards those common goals,
recognize some elements are going to be more difficult to get
to. They are a very small percentage of what's actually being
invested in transportation. Let's figure out what it takes
together to get there.
Mr. Owens. OK. Mr. Needham?
Mr. Needham. Yes, thank you for the question. What I would
say, from a waiver standpoint, absolutely necessary, but
applied in a narrow project-specific basis. And the reason I
say for that is a lot of times what is not understood well is
most of these products can be made right here in the United
States, in America, with American-made teammates and workers.
And so, the exceptions are very few.
And so, having a robust process around the waiver process
is very important. From our standpoint, the guidelines give 15
days to respond to that, and that seems adequate. Sometimes,
though, we are seeing that we have 7 days or less to reply, and
so, I think it's important to have that robust process because
a lot of these exceptions are made when we can just make the
products here, and that's not well known.
Mr. Owens. OK. Mr. Enders?
Mr. Enders. Yes, I think for the asphalt industry, maybe
it's slightly different because what we are getting exemptions
for on waivers are some of the inputs coming in to America. One
hundred percent of the asphalt in our parking lots and the
roads we are driving on is produced and made here in the United
States.
As we continue to look at alternative ways in areas of the
country where maybe they don't have access to quality raw
materials, I think some of those alternatives can maybe provide
ways to get to your goal.
Mr. Owens. OK. I am just going to say this. We need to
continue to advocate for your voices. And the point was made
earlier, we have small business owners that truly are at risk.
And our culture has to give them that room. That is where the
base--that is our country, that is our freedom. So, whatever
you can do to advocate for those small business owners, let us
know. We are going to get more innovative legislation, that is
our goal, to make sure we can hear from you guys and do the
right thing. So, thank you so much.
And I yield back my time.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Carbajal.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
First let me say thank you to all the witnesses being here
today.
Ms. Salrin, my father was once affiliated with the United
Steelworkers of America as a copper miner in Arizona, so, I
have an affinity for your union.
Mr. Enders, thank you for the acknowledgment regarding our
committee's work on ensuring that OMB understood your
industry's unique insights and various comments communicated to
the agency. Now, with the Buy America ambiguity settled, what
is the biggest priority facing your industry as we work on the
next highway bill?
Mr. Enders. Thank you, and thank you for your help for our
Buy America exemptions.
Really, the biggest priority for the asphalt pavement
industry is sustainable road funding. The funding we have now,
as I mentioned earlier, created over 1,300 projects in the
State of Wisconsin, predominantly where we work, but there are
many more on the shelf. And sustainable funding is something
that can lead us to do those projects.
Mr. Carbajal. Great. As a followup question, we are now
2\1/2\ years into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It is hard
to believe that much time has gone by. As we are entering the
final stages of this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and start
turning our attention towards the next highway bill ahead of
2026, does the certainty provided by OMB help clarify how the
construction materials supply chain may operate, and minimize
delays and cost overruns as it relates to your pavement
production?
Mr. Enders. Yes, it does. We were very nervous as it went
through the process to understand where we were going to be
able to get resources to build roads. And when we don't know
where the materials are going to be coming from and different
things, we worry about hiring, investing in equipment,
different things like that. So, yes, we are happy with where we
are at.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Braceras, I think we can all agree that it is good
policy to increase the domestic manufacturing base in the
United States. However, we know we can't flip a switch and
create new industries overnight. Can you give me your opinion
on the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Buy
America provisions from the perspective of a State department
of transportation, specifically how the implementation process
is working in Utah?
Do you have any recommendations on how to improve the
implementation process?
Mr. Braceras. Thank you. Yes, I would say generally the
implementation of IIJA is working well in Utah and working well
for all State DOTs around the country. You should be proud of
your State departments of transportation and how they are
implementing that.
The certainty is important in any program, especially when
we are making these types of investments. So, we like to know
what is expected of us. And so, that early definition and
guidelines are very important, especially as it pertains to
IIJA.
We saw a little bit of, I will say, a speed bump in the
implementation of the electric charging program because we are
waiting for the guidance on that one right now. So, we look
forward to continuing to work with this committee on the
reauthorization.
I love my--the comment down here was long-term sustainable
funding. The formula funding program provides us that stability
to be able to make strategic investments into the future. Thank
you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Chair, I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And Mr. Edmondson, well, I will talk a little bit to you,
and thanks for coming up in the conversation we had before
today's hearing. I am grateful for that.
So, our country produces 95 million tons of cement every
year. We use 120 million. And for that reason, I think IIJA
really called out--really exempted cement and cementitious
materials from some of these Buy American requirements. And yet
we still had a lot of conversations today about the
uncertainty. You had mentioned in your testimony that
contractors can deal with two different State DOTs who have
slightly different interpretations. And so, let's dive into
that a little bit more.
I mean, tell me about the contractors and the confusion
they may have when they bring cement onto a worksite, trying to
understand whether or not Buy America applies to that.
Mr. Edmondson. Again, we would ask our suppliers to be
involved in that process to identify the issues they've got,
and that's probably our biggest resource. We rely on them to
provide all that critical information. So, if they are seeing
those issues, we would then take it to the project owner and
deal with it that way.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, what causes the confusion?
I mean, as Mr. Carbajal mentioned, I mean, we are 2 years in.
And I know we have gotten some additional clarity, and we are
probably a lot further along than we were a year ago, but it
still seems that I keep hearing about these conversations.
Mr. Edmondson. Yes, probably the biggest thing is, we are
just--I think this flow of money that's going to have this
requirement is just now hitting the market. So, I think you
have had this long delay, but it has been in design and it has
been going through the engineering process. So, I think we are
just now on the front side of seeing the requirements go into
effect, so, that has probably been some of the confusion, and
when was it going to be implemented. It kept getting moved. And
then back in the fall, it was implemented, and that's what I
think it is.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Braceras, talk to me about
the Federal Highway Administration. What can they be doing
better in this arena?
Mr. Braceras. Yes. I think, we could always do some things
better. And again, let me say that Federal Highways has been
great partners in how we implement this.
One of the true advantages Federal Highways has is they
have Federal Highway employees in every single State in the
country who understand how we operate, and they understand the
challenges that we have. And so, it's to continue to provide
that resource and to help, I will say, support them in their
decisionmaking roles. They are making decisions--we go to them
all the time, asking them, ``Well, what do you think of this?
Can we do this?'' And if they don't have to look over their
shoulder back to Washington too often, if they actually are
trusted to make those decisions, that would be very helpful,
and I think this administration is doing a good job supporting
those amazing men and women there.
We, as States, we are kind of quirky in that we will say,
like, well, we want flexibility, except for when we want
consistency. And we all know, we have all been there in that
type of situation.
But I think Federal Highways is a model in terms of how to
implement Build America, Buy America. I would love to see more
consistency. We do a lot of transit work, as well. Things are
not necessarily consistent between the modal agencies. And so,
I think consistency from U.S. DOT over all their modal agencies
would be helpful not only for the departments of
transportation, but probably also for our contractors, as well.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I think that is really well
said about the need for consistency between and among agencies.
And you are right, there is this natural push and pull for the
Federal Highway folks in the States. Giving them that sort of
autonomy makes a ton of sense. Rhetorically it's strong, but
doesn't it contribute to this patchwork quilt we have heard
about today?
Mr. Braceras. I would say that there is not a significant
patchwork. There is consistency in making sure that the law is
followed, the rules are followed. But there is an understanding
of the uniqueness. Every State has some unique market
differences, material sources differences. And those folks at
the Federal Highway Administration, at the State level, they
can recognize those unique differences and help us deal with
it.
I mean, we had a cement powder shortage in the State of
Utah over the last year and a half. We were bringing in cement
powder from South Dakota and North Dakota, and we work with
those State DOTs to say, hey, does this meet the spec, does it
have all the compliance? So, there is great collaboration going
on across the industry.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Well, I am sure the GCC plant
in Rapid City, South Dakota, was happy to help.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields, and Ms. Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Chair Crawford and Ranking Member
Norton, for holding this really important hearing, and thank
you so much for our witnesses for being here today, sharing
your insights into the challenges and opportunities of Buy
America.
When Secretary Buttigieg testified in front of this
committee in September, he noted that the Department of
Transportation is looking to implement strategic on-ramps to
Buy America to address supply chain concerns and build the
necessary domestic infrastructure to meet that 70-percent
threshold. I have a number of questions.
Ms. Salrin, my first question is for you. I represent over
700 employees of a tier 1 auto supplier that is working to
build the first automated electric vehicle in America. They are
committed to utilizing American labor and American materials,
but they need 5,000 tons of steel annually. Do you believe
temporary waivers to the Buy America requirements are the best
way for companies like theirs to fulfill their supply
requirements until domestic manufacturing can build up and meet
those needs?
And feel free to offer suggestions to tweaks, as well.
Ms. Salrin. Yes. Without knowing what kind of steel this
company needs, the steel industry has a lot of capacity, and
so, they are able to support a lot of needs. But without
knowing that, I will say project-specific waivers are really
important because they allow that domestic capacity to be built
up over time if we don't have it currently available.
Ms. Scholten. Mr. Enders, there are two major highway
improvement projects needed in my district in west Michigan.
These projects will rely on American asphalt. I am glad we were
able to maintain waivers in the IIJA for materials like
aggregate and asphalt binder to ensure economical and
sustainable sourcing.
Are there concerns about other roadway materials that would
benefit from the identified strategic on-ramps or temporary
waivers, and how might you suggest that we address those?
Mr. Enders. Looking at the waivers we have, most of the
other things we are getting are produced here in the United
States and in our States. So, I think we just continue with the
exemptions that we have for our industry, and I think
everything falls in line with that.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. My last question: The new policy
entitled, ``Waiver of Buy America Requirements for Electric
Vehicle Chargers,'' the title of that program sounds like a
weakening of the Buy America standards.
Ms. Salrin, can you explain why that's not the case?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, of course. So, it actually strengthens Buy
America standards for EV chargers. It's an implementing policy
that allows the manufacturers of EV chargers to build up
domestic capacity while they are brought online.
And the current waiver or implementing policy requires that
final assembly already be built in the United States, and so,
that is one good thing that's in the waiver, but it also
requires the iron and steel of that charger to be built here,
too.
And then, in July, it will take full effect. Buy America
coverage will be in full effect for EV chargers. And so, this
allows domestic manufacturers to build up capacity to meet the
demand of the EV charging network. And so, the Biden policy
actually strengthens Buy America coverage for EV chargers, not
weakens it.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. If we are to hold these companies
to unrealistic standards, what is the impact there?
Ms. Salrin. I am sorry. Can you repeat your question?
Ms. Scholten. You are talking about it not weakening the
standards, but strengthening. Implementing unrealistic
standards, what are the impacts there on the steel industry?
Ms. Salrin. Yes. I would say the impacts of unrealistic
standards open up our supply chains to or put our manufacturers
and our workers at risk for foreign inputs to come in, and
allows projects not to go through. And so, having these
specific waivers allows that flexibility which is needed,
especially since our Nation has had disinvestment and
deindustrialization for over decades now, and we need to build
up those critical supply chains because of the lack of
industrial policy that we have had in the past.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, very helpful. Thank you all for
your time today.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman yields. Mr. Yakym. Just
kidding. Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer.

Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. You never know who's going to show up
right behind you, and you're like, aw, you thought you were in
line. Thank you, Chairman.
Thank you all for being here today. As a new Member of
Congress and representing Oregon's Fifth Congressional
District, there is so much to learn in this industry.
Ms. Salrin, thank you for being here on behalf of America's
steelworkers. We do such great work in the steel manufacturing
sector, one of the most important sectors to our economy and
national security. Of course, having loopholes in Buy America
provisions do not benefit the taxpayer, nor the businesses and
industries these provisions seek to benefit. But it also
undermines the various rules and regulations industry must
adhere to, from environmental to worker protections.
And critical to this conversation we must recognize that
they aren't extraterritorial. China's steel companies do not
adhere to U.S. regulations. So, when DOT policies allow the
purchase of foreign steel, we undermine these very regulations
and subject our own companies and workers to an unfair playing
field at the taxpayer's expense, no less. It has been said a
lot today, but I think we can all benefit if we get Buy America
right. Without closing Buy America loopholes or streamlining
regulations, only our competitors like China seek to benefit.
Ms. Salrin, you mentioned in your testimony that a January
2023 poll conducted by Morning Consult identified that 83
percent of Republican, Democratic, and Independent voters agree
that taxpayer dollars should go toward infrastructure projects
that utilize American-made products like iron, steel, and other
construction materials versus products that are imported from
foreign countries. So, Ms. Salrin, how do we achieve this
consensus in Washington?
Is it the Buy America loopholes that are in the way, or is
it something else?
Ms. Salrin. Thank you for your question, and you hit on
some very, very important points.
I will note that voters are sometimes way ahead of
policymakers, mostly because they see firsthand how
deindustrialization or how a bridge made of Chinese steel can
impact them, as workers, but also their communities. And so,
the hollowing out of our industrial base is not a Republican or
Democratic issue. It is everyone's issue, and we must address
that.
We also need a strong steel sector for our national defense
and to independently build our infrastructure without being
reliant on potential hostile or unreliable trading partners.
And so, Buy America is a bipartisan policy, and we need to
keep it that way, and we need to make sure that the
implementation in the administration is robust and strong, and
ensures that no new loopholes are created.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you. You may be aware of the I-5
Interstate Bridge, which crosses the Columbia River and is a
major transportation connection between Oregon and Washington
State. It has been undergoing major repairs, but also delays
for replacement in the infrastructure.
We are all haunted by the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
replacement project a decade ago, where California turned to
Chinese steel to help to repair that bridge. Again, this in no
way benefits American steel manufacturers. So, how do we ensure
this doesn't happen again?
And to add to that, how do we prevent Federal and State
governments turning to foreign products and steel to help
repair this I-5 Bridge?
Ms. Salrin. Yes, so, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
is, honestly, without a doubt, the epitome of bad Buy America
loopholes. That project was a product of a segmentation
loophole which allowed California to use State dollars to go
ahead with the project, benefiting not only Chinese
manufacturers, but Chinese workers, as well, and leaving
American workers out of the equation. And that project ended up
being way over budget and way past due.
And so, we learned a lot of lessons. And in the 2015 FAST
Act, that loophole was closed. And so, to remain vigilant, I
think, for your project--and thank you for supporting that--we
need to make sure that no new loopholes are created.
And I will also highlight that the State of Oregon has
implemented a State Buy America policy, which will allow
stronger Buy America policy used with State and local funds.
And so, thank you.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you.
Mr. Needham, it's my understanding that demand for
domestically produced steel will likely increase in response to
the recent implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS Act. In
fact, I have seen some estimates that steel demand is projected
to increase by 5 to 8 million tons annually as a result of
these pieces of legislation.
So, given the likely increases in demand, does the domestic
steel industry have enough capacity to supply federally funded
highway and transit projects, as well as other infrastructure
projects like the I-5 Bridge that may be subject to the Buy
America requirements?
And your time is limited. I am over, so, if you could
answer that very quickly, I would appreciate it.
Mr. Needham. Yes, thank you for that question. As I
mentioned, the U.S. steel industry is about 76 percent capacity
utilization. So, we have the capacity to supply those.
And also, the other thing that I mentioned earlier, Buy
America, what it allows is for the confidence to invest in the
future. We just started a new plate mill in Brandenburg,
Kentucky, that is capable of supplying those types of projects.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Needham.
Thank you.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman's time expired. Mr. Burchett.
I am sorry, it is Mr. Kean. My bad.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
and thank you for our witnesses being here today.
Mr. Enders, you mentioned in your testimony that reclaimed
asphalt pavement is a big part of the asphalt industry's focus
on sustainability. Can you share more about that effort, and
why exempting asphalt binder is such a key necessity to
incorporate?
I know that New Jersey isn't using as much of it as it
should, but it sounds like it would help in utilizing current
products/materials already in circulation while maintaining
performance.
Mr. Enders. Yes. I mean, reclaimed asphalt pavement,
currently we are recycling over 90 million tons of asphalt
pavement. I mean, we are estimating that that's saving over $3
billion in costs for new asphalt pavement. And part of it is,
we can continue to recycle it. It goes back down, we can
recycle it again. And so, in areas like New Jersey, where you
have an abundance of reclaimed asphalt pavement, being able to
insert that into your current asphalt mixes could provide both
savings, and it keeps materials out of the landfill.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
Director Braceras, in your testimony, you talk about the
difficulties in securing Buy America waivers. Congress wanted
to make it difficult to obtain a waiver, but not impossible.
What recommendations do you have to improve the Buy America
waiver process?
Mr. Braceras. Thank you very much. I think fundamentally, I
agree, it shouldn't be easy to do, and waivers should be
limited. And if you look at what's going on right now, they are
limited right now.
But there needs to be less of a wait time. There needs to
be more of an understanding of how long the process will take.
We need to have clear guidance on what is expected in terms of
documentation to justify a waiver. And so, if those three
things are implemented, I think we can meet the goal of not
having many waivers, but also giving a path forward because
this is a pretty time-sensitive element for us.
If you heard Mr. Edmondson's testimony, when a contractor
is preparing a bid, they are getting quotes from suppliers for
all different types of things, and it's a short bid time. It
could be a 4-week time period in which they are trying to get
those prices locked down. And to be able to know that they are
working off of products that meet the qualifications is
critical. Otherwise, they are going to add risk to their bid,
which costs the taxpayers more money.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
Mr. Needham, while the DOT has been implementing the Buy
America policy for decades, IIJA expanded the application of
those requirements to components and products that had
previously been exempted. This expanded funding has led to
other cabinet agencies like the Departments of Treasury,
Interior, or HUD attempting to adhere to Buy America guidelines
that may have previously been unknown to them.
Obviously, steel is used across all sorts of Federal
products. Has there been consistency of implementation of Buy
America provisions across the Federal Government?
Mr. Needham. No, there hasn't been consistency. In fact,
HUD has delayed implementation to August of this year for
several programs on iron and steel products. It has also
delayed until next year the implementation for construction
materials and manufactured products in a couple programs.
So, what I would say to that is a great example of it is
the Federal Highway Administration and how they have
administered this. And I think, as we look within our company
of how we look at best practices, I think that would be a great
way for other agencies to look at them and see how they have
implemented it.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. OK, and if you are looking at that
example, and you mentioned HUD, for example, as one of the
people who have delayed the implementation, what impact does
that have on society, inflation, and varying costs if these
things are delayed?
Mr. Needham. So, what it does is, it encourages foreign
products to come in when we can supply it here domestically
very easily.
And actually, I mean, you are moving products from all over
the world, so, the costs are absolutely--would be higher. Now,
some of them you are not dealing with free market
considerations. But certainly it's bringing products, shipping
them from all over the world. Not great for the environment,
not great for building our projects here.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Ms. Maloy.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Braceras, good to see you. You said when you started
your testimony that American money should be spent on American
stuff to benefit Americans, to which I say amen. But I have
been sitting here listening, and it sounds like we have a
tension between two problems with spending American money to
benefit Americans. We want to Build American, Buy American with
American steel, but if waivers take a long time or if products
can't be found, then projects get more expensive and taxpayers
are paying for that, too, and those are American dollars.
And so, I just want to know, is there an area in particular
where Build America, Buy America requirements create a
particular challenge?
Because we keep hearing that DOT is the gold standard, and
if everybody could do it the way you do it, it would work
better. But you are saying there are still challenges. What
area can we help you with?
Mr. Braceras. Thank you. You actually hit the hammer on the
nail, and that is one of the challenges we have with this
program.
We are trying to accomplish a couple of very worthy goals
with the same tool, and so, it requires a little bit of, I say,
flexibility and adaptability in terms of how we get there.
We want to grow the manufacturing base, we want to improve
jobs for Americans, but we also want to deliver the projects
that save lives and make people's lives better. And so, that's
a little bit of a tension that exists in trying to achieve
those two worthy goals. The challenge we experience right now
with the Build America, Buy America is in--like I said earlier,
represents a very small percentage of our projects. But it's
those elements that have to be part of that project in order to
complete it successfully.
And so, I really think, even from a Federal Highway
Administration perspective--because they have been doing this
for a long time, I think they do a great job--but it's better
understanding what goes into these jobs, what are those
elements that are a challenge to meet the Buy America, Build
America, and then trying to figure out what kind of market
incentives can we provide to help develop those companies that
will build those products in this country.
And part of this is, companies need to know that this is
not just a 5-year program. This is something that we are
committed to for the long term, because if a business is going
to grow, it's going to want to make an investment for 50 years,
for 75 years. And so, the long-term signals that Congress can
send, I think, are really important to help us get to where we
get to 100 percent on Build America, Buy America.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Mr. Needham, you represent the business side of this. Do
you have anything to add to that?
Mr. Needham. Yes, I think that putting a process in place
to really nail down to and narrowly define what are the pain
points, and I think that is a great example that Mr. Braceras
talked about, is what are those actual items. Because I think,
from an iron and steel standpoint, we have been implementing
this for quite a while. I am not aware of major pain points.
What I think is, we need a robust process to be able to
bring those to the forefront and review them quickly, and
that's what's needed. And that works, certainly, from our
perspective, when we have the 15-day review and we can give a
great example of are we capable of producing that here or not,
and the exceptions to that are very few.
Ms. Maloy. OK, thank you.
Mr. Edmondson, do you have anything to add?
Mr. Edmondson. I agree with that. The earlier we can define
what those pain points are, the better off we all are, and I
think that's the key.
And open communication, the collaboration between the
industry, the manufacturing capacity, the funding, all of that
needs to work together to improve that process.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Mr. Enders, in the few seconds I have left, is there
anything you want to say that they haven't already covered?
Mr. Enders. I think they covered what I was thinking.
Ms. Maloy. OK. Thank you all for being here.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman yields. Mr. Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to
thank all of you for being here today.
Mr. Edmondson, I'm from Louisiana. We have spent an
extraordinary amount of money trying to build roads and water
resource resiliency-type projects. Over the past few years, I
have watched these projects very closely. I have seen routinely
as projects are coming in 40 percent to, on the high end, 300
percent over initial project estimate.
Let me see if I can get my singing voice back here.

Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Are you seeing similar outcomes
from the projects that you are involved in?
Mr. Edmondson. We have seen an increase. A lot of it was
supply chain-related.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Supply chain, labor, inflation,
all of those things----
Mr. Edmondson . We are seeing the supply
chain issues. They are improving. We have seen that happen over
the last 18 months.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Are the estimates that I have
given, are those out of bounds compared to what you have seen
in projects?
Mr. Edmondson. I think over the past 4 to 5 years, we have
seen that kind of increase.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you.
Mr. Braceras, are you seeing similar types of outcomes, and
are you being challenged in implementation, as well?
Mr. Braceras. Yes, we are. I can't say it's--Build America,
Buy America is not----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana . Labor, supply
chain, inflation----
Mr. Braceras . Yes, oh----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana . Just the cumulative
effect.
Mr. Braceras. As an example, in 2021, we saw--maybe I'll
start--we have our 5-year, what we call State Transportation
Implementation Program, STIP. That's our little transportation
nerdiness. That's about $5 billion for the State of Utah. The
Federal portion makes up about 20, 20.5 percent of that total
program. We normally program in for the cash flow, a 5-percent
increase in projects a year. In 2021, we saw a 16-percent
increase. In 2022, that was a 12-percent increase. In 2023, we
were at 8 percent.
So, we are starting to come back down. But you can imagine
the inflationary impact that has had to our entire program.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. When you say ``come back down,''
you mean the rate of growth?
Mr. Braceras. The rate of growth, exactly.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes.
Mr. Braceras. Exactly--no, price--and I keep reminding my
legislators at home--prices probably are not going back to
where they were before, but the rate of growth is starting to
come back down into something that we can better manage.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, when I do some quick math
based upon the numbers that you have thrown out and based upon
what we have seen at home, there was a lot of excitement that
the infrastructure bill was going to come in and provide all of
these additional or excess supplemental funds. And based on
what we are seeing at home, it is more than being consumed
based upon the supply chain, the labor, inflation, and other
impacts and costs. Are you seeing similar outcomes?
Mr. Braceras. Me?
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, sorry.
Mr. Braceras. I just say thank God for IIJA. That increase
was just critical for us to be able to help absorb these
changes. I have seen increases like this before leading up to
the 2008 crash that we had, and at that time we saw up to a 20-
percent increase in project costs.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. But based upon the additional
funds that were included in IIJA, what we are seeing at home is
that we are actually--the additional funds are being eaten up
by the higher costs. Are you seeing similar----
Mr. Braceras . Yes, the formula program is,
which is what we rely on, that's the foundation for us, we are
not even quite break even.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, that is----
Mr. Braceras . So, there is not extra. The
discretionary program is, obviously, the sugar on top.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes.
Mr. Braceras. And that could be more, but that's not--you
can't really plan for things on the discretionary program.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes.
Mr. Braceras. That's a one-off.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Sure, sure. Yes, well, I think we
are seeing similar things at home and, obviously, need to
figure out how to address this. And I will say it again: I
think it's a cumulative effect, the inflation, the labor,
supply chain, and other factors.
Ms. Salrin, look, I want to be very clear. I think
everybody here, we certainly are very supportive of Buy America
and want to use as many American products as we can in
everything that we do, but I also have pretty extraordinary
frustration looking at these Buy America standards that are
being put in place, whether it's for the energy bill or for the
infrastructure bill, and not having anywhere near the supply
chain that's needed.
And so, we have seen on EV charging stations that haven't
even been built yet, that they just did a blanket waiver.
Congress tried to step in and stop that, and the administration
blocked us. How do you feel about this, basically, invitation
to bring in all these foreign products whenever the goal was to
ensure that we had U.S. labor, U.S. products?
Ms. Salrin. I will note that the EV charger waiver is an
implementing policy, and it allows for critical capacity to get
built up over time since we didn't have any.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. But if I recall correctly, they
did a 5-year waiver.
Ms. Salrin. No, implementation goes in full effect in July
of this year.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. But I thought--and I might be
misremembering, but I thought that the waiver that they did
gave a 5-year waiver for the charging stations.
Ms. Salrin. The 55-percent domestic content----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana . Right.
Ms. Salrin . For EV chargers goes into effect
July of 2024.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, maybe I need to go back and
figure out what I am----
Ms. Salrin . I am happy to provide that
information. Yes, for sure.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, what about--I mean, does the
fact that, here we are, years later, and we are not even
building it, it seems like the--oh, I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I
will wrap.
I will just close and say this, and maybe I will offer some
questions for the record. The regulatory agenda that we are
seeing just doesn't seem compatible with the implementation
agenda, and that here we are, years later, and we still have 80
percent of the money in the bank from the infrastructure
program, which is incredibly frustrating, I know, to me.
Mr. Chairman, I apologize for going over. I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. No problem. The gentleman yields.
Are there any other Members that haven't been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I want
to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony. Thank you
again for being here today.
And the committee stands adjourned.

Submissions for the Record

Letter of March 1, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, Chairman,
and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on
Highways and Transit, from Trygve W. Hoff, P.E., ENV SP, Director of
Government Relations, American Concrete Pipe Association, Submitted for
the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
March 1, 2024.
The Honorable Rick Crawford,
Subcommittee Chair,
Highways and Transit Subcommittee, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Subcommittee Ranking Member,
Highways and Transit Subcommittee, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Subcommittee Chair Crawford and Subcommittee Ranking Member
Norton:
The American Concrete Pipe Association asks that the attached
statement be included in the official record of the hearing on the
implementation of the ``Build America, Buy America Act'' (BABAA)
provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that
was held by the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit on February 15,
2024.
After viewing the hearing, we firmly believe that the perspective
of the ACPA and the cement and concrete industries are critical to the
Subcommittee in fully understanding how the rollout of the ``Build
America, Buy America Act'' (BABAA) is impacting suppliers, contractors,
and project sponsors.
The effective and efficient utilization of the IIJA funding will
depend, in part, upon Buy America rules that are clear and realistic as
well as a waiver mechanism that can provide rapid exceptions to those
rules, when warranted, so that worthy projects can be delivered on time
and on budget.
Unfortunately, we are seriously concerned with a number of aspects
of the Office of Management and Budget's BABAA guidance that are
inconsistent in its treatment of competing materials, products, and
manufacturing processes. The Guidance also fails to recognize or
appropriately provide for regional material shortfalls and supply chain
challenges faced by domestic producers of concrete pipe. Taken
together, these inconsistencies will lead to uncertainty and ultimately
slow the delivery of surface transportation projects.
OMB vs. Funding Agencies. As other associations in the
transportation and infrastructure sectors have pointed out, the
guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not
reflect the knowledge of federal funding agencies about the
construction materials, manufactured products, and iron and steel used
in projects under their jurisdiction. The exclusion of these agencies
and their expertise has produced a set of rules that are unnecessarily
bureaucratic and, in some instances, lack consistency.
To cite just one example, compare the treatment of reinforced
concrete pipe and plastic pipe, two competing products used for
drainage in federally funded highway projects. Under OMB's final
guidance, concrete pipe is classified as a ``manufactured product'' and
the origin of the cement, steel, and aggregates used to make the
concrete pipe must be factored into the 55% threshold. In contrast,
plastic pipe is considered to be a ``construction material'' and the
resin used to make the plastic pipe is not factored into the threshold
calculation. These are competing products but the rules for calculating
domestic content for the products under the OMB guidance are entirely
different. It is difficult to imagine that a funding agency that
routinely incorporates drainage pipe in its projects would create
different rules for competing products that carry out the same function
and are the product of similar manufacturing processes.
Concrete Pipe: Cement, Aggregates, and Reinforcing Steel. The core
components in the manufacturing of concrete pipes are cement,
aggregates, water, and reinforcing steel. Each of these three materials
accounts for roughly one-third of the cost of producing a concrete
pipe.
The 400,000 tons of reinforcing steel purchased annually by
concrete pipe producers is American-made. The reason for this is that
many of our customers are state departments of transportation and other
public agencies responsible for the construction of taxpayer-funded
infrastructure projects. Consequently, the reinforcing steel in
concrete pipe must be domestically produced in order to comply with
long-standing Buy America or other domestic content laws. In fact,
every state transportation department requires reinforcing steel be
made in the United States.
The supply chain for cement is fragile. The supply of domestically
produced cement exceeds demand; however, the availability of cement
varies significantly by geographic region. Under OMB's final guidance,
cement that is used away from the job site--such as a precast
manufacturing facility--will be counted in the 55% threshold
calculation. This is another way in which the OMB guidance provides
different rules for different products--precast concrete made in a
factory setting must meet the 55% threshold, but cast-in-place concrete
is exempt.
Similarly, the availability of aggregates differs by region. The
reason for this is that the availability of aggregates is determined by
specific types of geologic formations, which may or may not be present
in any given region. If aggregates are not readily available, they must
be transported from a different location.
We are concerned that any future shock to the supply chain related
to any of these primary ingredients could seriously disrupt not only
production of precast concrete products, but also the delivery of much-
needed and long overdue infrastructure improvements.
Waivers. The realistic possibility of future disruptions in the
supply chain for cement or aggregates, or both, makes it imperative
that appropriate waivers are available and can, when necessary, be
obtained quickly.
In years past, the waiver process hasn't functioned properly. More
recently, the Biden Administration has said it intends for waivers to
be a viable tool, but intends to limit any waivers, perhaps by project,
duration, or geographic region. That said, the waiver process has yet
to be completely outlined and a track record has not been established.
In implementing the appropriate use of waivers, ACPA believes it is
critical that agencies develop and use clear, consistent criteria in
determining whether a waiver should be granted.
We urge the Subcommittee to continue its oversight of the
implementation of BABAA, keeping a close watch on the waiver process to
ensure that it offers a timely and transparent response to requests
from project sponsors.
In closing, the ACPA appreciates the Subcommittee's attention to
this important aspect of infrastructure construction. Our members
support efforts to ensure clarity and flexibility in the application of
the requirements of BABAA. This will be critical to ensuring American
concrete pipe producers can meet the needs of their customers.
Sincerely,
Trygve W. Hoff, P.E., ENV SP,
Director of Government Relations, American Concrete Pipe
Association.
Letter of February 15, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford,
Chairman, and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit, from Richard A. Juliano, CAE, General Counsel,
American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Submitted for the
Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
February 15, 2024.
Hon. Rick Crawford,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515.
Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Norton:
The American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA)
appreciates your leadership in oversight of the ``Build America, Buy
America Act'' (BABAA) provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA), and your holding today's hearing.
ARTBA's diverse membership includes nearly 8,000 private sector
firms and public agencies, many of whom work with Buy America
requirements regularly. They include contractors building
transportation improvement projects, as well as suppliers and
manufacturers of vital products, and agencies (including more than 20
state departments of transportation) who plan, fund and own the
infrastructure assets themselves. All share a common interest in
effectively implementing BABAA while building projects safely,
efficiently and cost-effectively, especially given the IIJA's record
federal investments. Similarly, all share a common concern that
conflicting federal policy objectives can dilute the timely economic
and safety benefits of those investments. This submission to your
subcommittee reflects insights from across our membership in this
context.
ARTBA's Buy America Policy and Implementation Priorities
ARTBA wholeheartedly supports BABAA and the principle of
strengthening domestic manufacturing. Our members would prefer a market
through which they could always procure products made in the United
States.
However, the short-term realities of that market reflect:
Continued difficulties with elevated costs and lead times
in procuring key materials.
Inflation and supply chain difficulties following the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Particular challenges with domestic sourcing of
construction materials newly covered by Buy America.
Strong competition for materials across multiple sectors
of construction and the broader economy.
ARTBA's priorities for our members in BABAA implementation include
the following:
The risk associated with Buy America compliance should
not fall disproportionately on a project's contractor. Some agencies,
like the Florida Department of Transportation, have adopted a
collaborative approach in identifying and denoting Buy America-
compliant products for use on their federal-aid projects. Regrettably,
others have simply notified the industry of the new BABAA requirements
while informing contractors of their unilateral responsibility to
comply. Ultimately, contractors ``price'' risk in their bids.
Unreasonable transfer of risk to contractors will often result in
higher project costs, to the detriment of taxpayers.
Buy America compliance should start during the design and
specification stages. Incorporating domestic preference realities early
in the project's lifespan can minimize the subsequent need for Buy
America waivers and associated delays.
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and
its Made in America Office (MIAO) should focus on assessing materials
markets and developing a common catalog of BABAA-compliant products.
These offices are uniquely situated to work across agencies and with
project partners including federal-aid recipients, contractors,
manufacturers and suppliers. OMB and MIAO can take a proactive approach
in identifying problem areas and anticipating the need for targeted
waivers.
Buy America requirements should be as clear and
consistent as possible. Numerous construction firms work across
multiple states and transportation modes. They should be able to
maintain confidence in their BABAA compliance approach when working in
any of those jurisdictions. This underscores the importance of
comprehensive and accurate BABAA training for officials from state and
local agencies. Moreover, because OMB has issued a series of iterations
of BABAA guidance over the past two-plus years, some contractors'
portfolios include projects being built under one or more of four
different Buy America regimes.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) must maintain
its longstanding Buy America waiver for manufactured products. FHWA is
now completing its statutorily-required review of the waiver, and
appears under political pressure to roll back or repeal it, including
through a spam campaign conducted by an advocacy group prone to
sensationalism and name calling while possessing no demonstrable
understanding of transportation construction. In reality, altering or
eliminating this waiver will result in enormous new administrative
costs for recipients and contractors. It also risks significant new
project delays, as these parties attempt to document (often futilely)
the origins of infinite components comprising a panoply of manufactured
products used for transportation projects.\1\ The bottom line will be
fewer projects completed with IIJA dollars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ An attached ``exploding diagram'' of a generator used in a
highway rest area illustrates the impossible task of fully documenting
hundreds of inexpensive components to a common manufactured product.
Inexpensive commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)
products should not be subject to Buy America requirements. The origins
of items such as nuts, bolts, tie wires, washers, and the like are as
impossible to document as they are inexpensive to procure. Requiring
their domestic sourcing does little to advance BABAA's principles,
while again adding to project costs. A recent ``de minimis'' waiver
implemented by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) may
help on a limited basis, but not for COTS-heavy projects such as rest
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
areas and traffic operations centers.
The Buy America waiver process must be timely and
transparent. Under a new requirement established by President Biden
through a 2021 executive order and codified in BABAA, the Made in
America Office reviews proposed waivers from all federal agencies. This
has added a major step to a process already fraught with delay and
uncertainty among many agencies.
BABAA compliance should not threaten the viability of
small and disadvantaged businesses. Many of these firms do not maintain
the resources to navigate compliance with Buy America requirements for
a growing list of products. Others, such as specialty contractors and
suppliers, were disproportionately harmed by the recent cost spikes for
key products, as described above.
Industry Survey Details Its Concerns
In May 2023, ARTBA conducted a nationwide survey of transportation
construction contractors.\2\ The Associated General Contractors of
America joined us in this project, to maximize the response. Several
findings detail the concerns of the industry regarding BABAA
implementation:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ A summary of survey results is attached.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Construction Materials
About two-thirds of contractors expected cost increases
and/or delays on their projects because of new domestic preference
requirements for plastics and non-ferrous metals.
In addition, more than half of the respondents expected
the new requirements to ``significantly'' worsen costs and availability
for these products, given supply chain and inflationary pressures of
the past several months.
Manufactured Products
Nearly two-thirds of contractors expected significantly
negative effects on their projects if FHWA changes its policy on
manufactured products.
Clarity and Competition
62 percent of contractors described current Buy America
policy in their state(s) as somewhat or very confusing.
26 percent said they were less likely to bid federal-aid
work because of concerns or frustration with the new Buy America
requirements.
Collaboration of National Associations
Because of ongoing unease with BABAA implementation as outline
above, ARTBA has joined with the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA), Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) and
National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) in petitioning OMB for a
new rulemaking to clarify a number of these issues. Over the past
months, our associations have submitted dozens of detailed comments and
participated in numerous meetings with federal officials, yielding few
tangible results.
We also strongly believe OMB should play a ``big picture'' role in
implementing BABAA, such as creating the aforementioned compendium of
compliant products that could be used across the federal government. In
contrast, individual federal agencies, such as the modal
administrations at U.S. DOT, bring decades of experience in
implementing domestic preference requirements, and should be enabled to
fully deploy their detailed knowledge of the projects, recipients,
markets and industry specific to their respective programs.
Our coalition's petition also seeks to improve the waiver process
under the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act.
We hope this petition results in meaningful improvements to BABAA
implementation and a more collaborative approach among all parties to
federal-aid policies and projects, including OMB itself.
Conclusion
As you continue your oversight role of IIJA implementation, we
respectfully ask that you consider the insights of ARTBA members
working to deliver projects funded by the IIJA, while maximizing the
law's benefits in safety, mobility, job-creation and other forms of
economic growth. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Richard A. Juliano, CAE,
General Counsel, American Road & Transportation Builders
Association.

Executive Summary
Survey of Transportation Construction Contractors
on Buy America Compliance
The American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) and
Associated General Contractors (AGC) of America jointly surveyed their
members on May 10-18, 2023, regarding current Buy America issues. 300
firms responded nationwide.
For more than 40 years, the Buy America law has required a domestic
manufacturing process for iron, steel and certain manufactured products
permanently incorporated into federal-aid highway and transit projects.
In 2021, through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's ``Build
America, Buy America Act,'' Congress expanded domestic preference
requirements to five categories of construction materials (non-ferrous
metals, plastic and polymer-based products, glass, lumber, and
drywall).
Both associations have reaffirmed their support for Buy America's
overarching objective of strengthening domestic manufacturing in the
long term. However, as federal and state agencies work to implement the
current Buy America requirements, the survey sought to quantify the
industry's short-term challenge of complying while minimizing project
cost increases and delays.
The following are highlights of the survey . . .
Construction Materials
About two-thirds of contractors expect cost increases and/or delays
on their projects because of new domestic preference requirements for
plastics and non-ferrous metals.
Respondents were asked about procuring various categories of
domestically-produced construction materials and characterize how that
process would affect their projects now and in the near future. Options
for responses included:
MAJOR EFFECT--It will be difficult or impossible to find
U.S.-made products, resulting in larger cost increases and/or project
delays;
MINOR EFFECT--This requirement may cause some smaller
cost increases and/or project delays; or
LITTLE OR NO EFFECT--We can find the U.S.-made we need
with minimal difficulty.
Here are the findings for the construction materials newly subject
to Buy America \3\:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Besides the responses listed, others include ``Not Clear at
This Time'' and ``Does Not Apply.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plastic and Polymer-based Products
+ Major Effect--40 percent
+ Minor Effect--26 percent
+ Little or No Effect--11 percent
Non-ferrous Metals (such as copper, aluminum, lead, zinc,
silver, gold and titanium)
+ Major Effect--31 percent
+ Minor Effect--30 percent
+ Little or No Effect--11 percent
Glass
+ Major Effect--22 percent
+ Minor Effect--17 percent
+ Little or No Effect--14 percent
Lumber
+ Major Effect--22 percent
+ Minor Effect--30 percent
+ Little or No Effect--16 percent
Drywall
+ Major Effect--22 percent
+ Minor Effect--17 percent
+ Little or No Effect--14 percent
In addition, more than half of the respondents expected the new
requirements to ``significantly'' worsen costs and availability for
these products, given supply chain and inflationary pressures of the
past several months.
Manufactured Products
Nearly two-thirds of contractors expect significantly negative
effects on their projects if the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
changes its policy on manufactured products.
Since 1978, FHWA has exempted many manufactured products (such as
signal heads, pumps, generators, pavement marking and many more) from
Buy America requirements. The agency determined that it would be
prohibitively expensive or impossible to determine and certify the
origins of many components within these products.
FHWA is now reviewing its manufactured products waiver and
considering various options. The survey asked how a roll-back or repeal
of the waiver would affect upcoming projects:
65 percent said a change would have a ``major effect,''
requiring significant additional time and cost to document and certify
the components within manufactured products.
16 percent said it would have a ``minor effect,''
requiring some additional time and cost.
Just 4 percent said it would have ``little or no
effect,'' requiring minimal additional time and cost.
Waivers
Federal policymakers have emphasized that project sponsors can
request Buy America waivers if covered products or materials are
unavailable or greatly more expensive in domestic form.
About half (48 percent) of respondents reported having no
experience with Buy America waivers on their projects over the past two
years.
16 percent said the waiver process had caused major
project delays or uncertainty.
16 percent said it caused no or only minor delays or
uncertainty.
Clarity and Competition
Authoritative federal guidance will help ensure the new Buy America
requirements are implemented consistently by state transportation
agencies. With guidance from the White House Made in America Office
still pending, ARTBA and AGC have monitored initial state-level
implementation of the new requirements, making note of any
inconsistencies. The survey asked respondents to characterize the
clarity of this policy in their respective state(s).
62 percent of contractors described current Buy America
policy in their state(s) as somewhat or very confusing.
29 percent described it as somewhat or very clear.
When viewed as unclear or unachievable, federal regulations can
disincentivize contractors from bidding on federal-aid work and dampen
competition, particularly given the variety of opportunities in other
construction sectors. The survey asked if the new Buy America
requirements would affect their decision to bid federal-aid highway and
transit work in the next year.
26 percent said they were less likely to bid federal-aid
work.
50 percent said it made no difference.
2 percent said they were more likely to bid.
Conclusion
The survey results underscore the need for federal officials, state
agencies and industry to work collaboratively in preventing short-term
disruptions on projects that could result from revisions to Buy America
policy. To help maximize the benefits from unprecedented federal
transportation investments, while seeking to strengthen domestic
manufacturing, contractors need a clear, achievable regulatory
framework, backed by market data and appropriate use of Buy America
waivers, to do their part.

Statement of the American Traffic Safety Services Association,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
The American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA)
appreciates the opportunity to submit this Statement for the Record to
the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit regarding the hearing entitled ``Implementation
of Buy America Provisions: Stakeholder Perspectives.''
Given the impact of the Build America, Buy America (BABA) policies
on the ability of state departments of transportation (state DOTs) to
meet the investment goals of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA), the Committee is to be commended for providing the necessary
oversight of this important topic.
Incorporated in 1970, ATSSA is an international trade association
with over 1,500 members who are focused on advancing roadway safety.
ATSSA members manufacture, distribute, and install roadway safety
infrastructure devices such as guardrail and cable barrier, traffic
signs and signals, pavement markings and high friction surface
treatments, and work zone safety devices, among many others. As a
leader in roadway safety infrastructure, ATSSA was the first non-
governmental organization to adopt a Towards Zero Deaths vision and
ATSSA members are committed to making zero fatalities a reality
nationwide.
Implementation of Buy America Provisions
Just as important as the federal funding from the IIJA is in
meeting the roadway safety needs across the country and reducing the
number of traffic fatalities, the implementation of the many policy
provisions in the IIJA can be just as impactful. ATSSA members
understand the goals of the BABA requirements in the IIJA. Increasing
domestic construction and manufacturing capacity in the United States
is a worthwhile endeavor; however, the manner and methods used to
attain these goals is critical.
ATSSA members continue to express concerns with the way the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Department of
Transportation (USDOT) have approached implementation of the BABA
requirements. To better facilitate the process, ATSSA offers the
following recommendations:
USDOT should provide additional guidance to state DOTs and industry
stakeholders
OMB issued final guidance related to the updated BABA provisions
that went into effect on October 23rd. Since that time, there has been
considerable confusion across the country on how this guidance will
impact the ability of the transportation industry to meet the BABA
requirements.
Since the effective date of the OMB final guidance, ATSSA continues
to hear from members in various states about the lack of clarity and
consistency in the implementation of the new BABA requirements by state
DOTs. This lack of uniformity across states is not only creating
considerable confusion but is leading to a fear that the BABA
implementation will result in 50 states all with different requirements
and certification processes.
OMB clearly anticipated the possible need for further Federal
agency implementation guidance and information, stating in the August
23rd Federal Register Guidance for Grant Agreements that: ``It is not
possible for OMB to issue comprehensive guidance on every issue that
may arise for different Federal agencies in the context of directly
implementing their own unique Federal financial assistance programs . .
.''.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grants and Agreements, August 23, 2023--https://www.govinfo.gov/
content/pkg/FR-2023-08-23/pdf/2023-17724.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OMB guidance goes on further to say: ``Federal agencies, in
directly implementing BABA, may issue further guidance and provide
further information to their recipients and other stakeholders on their
own Federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure.'' \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grants and Agreements, August 23, 2023--https://www.govinfo.gov/
content/pkg/FR-2023-08-23/pdf/2023-17724.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the impact of this final OMB guidance on ATSSA members, we
continue to ask that the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
provide the critically necessary clarity to minimize disruptions and
address concerns being raised across the country. This additional
clarity would not only benefit ATSSA members but state DOTs, other
transportation industry stakeholders and Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) Division Offices.
Standardization needed for state DOTs and transportation industry
partners
The BABA certification process required by state DOTs varies across
the country. Some states require self-certification from contractors
and product suppliers. Other state DOTs certify products themselves.
Many companies who provide products and materials for
transportation projects work in more than one state--often regionally
or across the country. When state DOTs use individually developed forms
or processes to demonstrate compliance with BABA requirements, this not
only creates confusion but also requires companies to devote additional
staff resources to the paperwork process. It would be extremely
beneficial for state DOTs and USDOT to require standardized information
during the certification process.
Clearinghouse for BABA product compliance should be established
It would be extremely useful to the transportation industry and
state DOTs if there were a centralized clearinghouse of construction
materials and manufactured products that meet BABA requirements--an
approved or qualified product list that would be available for use
across the country on all federal transportation projects. Such a
clearinghouse would provide clarity and certainty for state DOTs and
make the compliance process for industry more efficient, less
confusing, and less time-consuming.
Clarification on temporary use versus permanent incorporation of
products
The OMB final guidance clearly makes a distinction between
temporary use and permanent incorporation of a product utilized in an
infrastructure project by stating: ``On the issue of permanent
incorporation, Memorandum M-22-11 explained that the Buy America
preference only applies to articles, materials, and supplies that are
consumed in, incorporated into, or affixed to an infrastructure
project.'' \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Office of Management and Budget Federal Register Guidance for
Grants and Agreements, August 23, 2023--https://www.govinfo.gov/
content/pkg/FR-2023-08-23/pdf/2023-17724.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite this distinction, ATSSA members have expressed concern with
the compliance form or certification requirements that state DOTs
utilize to ensure a product is or is not BABA compliant or is a
temporary use product. Often, companies must choose between checking a
``yes'' box or a ``no'' box when certifying that a particular product
is BABA compliant. As noted above, when a product is intended for
temporary use on an infrastructure project, it is does not have to
comply with BABA requirements--so a company would check the ``no'' box.
But checking the ``no'' box can imply that the product should not and
cannot be used on an infrastructure project--when, in fact, as a
temporary use product, it can be. There needs to be a third box on such
forms or another opportunity that allows a company to state that their
product is intended for temporary use and therefore does not have to
meet the BABA requirements.
Improvements to the BABA waiver process are needed
The process to seek a product waiver from BABA requirements is
difficult. While it is understandable that waivers should not be easy
to attain, they should also not be impossible to secure.
The OMB final guidance provides information related to the
justification of such waivers by stating: ``Justification of waivers. A
Federal awarding agency may waive the application of the Buy America
Preference in any case in which it finds that: (1) Applying the Buy
America Preference would be inconsistent with the public interest (a
``public interest waiver''); (2) Types of iron, steel, manufactured
products, or construction materials are not produced in the United
States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a
satisfactory quality (a ``nonavailability waiver''); or (3) The
inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction
materials produced in the United States will increase the cost of the
overall infrastructure project by more than 25 percent (an
``unreasonable cost waiver'').\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The process to apply for such waivers must be transparent. It is
often unclear the type of supporting documentation needed to
successfully secure a waiver under the three conditions from the OMB
final guidance cited above. Providing additional clarification as to
the documentation required on a waiver application, requiring USDOT to
acknowledge receipt of a waiver application, and providing waiver
applicants with a timeline for approval or disapproval of their request
would give state DOTs and the transportation industry some degree of
certainty in how to manage the waiver process.
Federal Highway Administration manufactured product waiver needs to be
retained
FHWA issued a public interest waiver of general applicability of
Buy America requirements for manufactured products that do not contain
iron or steel in 1993. ATSSA strongly urges FHWA to continue this
current public interest waiver. With the growing challenge of
increasing traffic fatalities in recent years, it is not an appropriate
time to potentially hamstring the ability to deploy life-saving devices
and countermeasures on U.S. roadways when the USDOT, state and local
agencies are aggressively moving to combat these fatalities.
If FHWA does decide to terminate the current manufactured product
public interest waiver, ATSSA requests the opportunity to comment on
the process to impose BABA requirements on manufactured products and
recommends a sufficient transition time to avoid unnecessary project
cost increases and delays.
Conclusion
With the construction season upon us, it is important that every
effort be made to assist state DOTs and the transportation industry in
meeting the compliance requirements of the BABA provisions. ATSSA
recognizes the importance that this Committee places on safety--safety
for the users of the transportation system and the construction workers
who go to work every day to make our roadways safer. As this Committee
continues its oversight of the IIJA, ATSSA members ask for your
assistance in ensuring the necessary BABA information and clarity is
made available. ATSSA continues to work with its members to understand
BABA requirements and facilitate the process for compliance. But we
cannot do this in a vacuum. We look forward to working with our state
DOT, industry and USDOT partners on this issue in the months to come.

Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Highways and Transit,
from Kristen Swearingen, Vice President, Legislative and Political
Affairs, Associated Builders and Contractors, Submitted for the Record
by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
The Honorable Rick Crawford,
Chairman,
U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit, Washington, DC 20515.
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Holmes Norton and Members of the
U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit:
On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors, a national
construction industry trade association with 68 chapters representing
more than 22,000 members, I write today to thank you for holding a
Hearing on the Implementation of Buy America Provisions of the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). ABC urges the
subcommittee to continue to weigh the impacts of these requirements on
workers, small businesses, and the success of infrastructure projects
funded by this bill.
While ABC supports strategies to expand domestic jobs and
manufacturing to avoid global supply chain disruptions and capture
economic benefits within America, ABC continues to have concerns
regarding the immediate implementation of the guidance's domestic
content requirements.
Enacted in November 2021, the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act expanded and made significant changes to Buy
America requirements for federally funded infrastructure projects. The
IIJA requires the following Buy America preferences and broadens the
preferences to include nonferrous metals, such as copper used in
electric wiring; plastic- and polymer-based products; glass, including
optical fiber; and certain other construction materials, such as lumber
and drywall:
All iron and steel used in the project are produced in
the United States. This means all manufacturing processes, from the
initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in
the United States.
All manufactured products used in the project are
produced in the United States. This means the manufactured product was
manufactured in the United States, and the cost of the components of
the manufactured product that are mined, produced, or manufactured in
the United States is greater than 55% of the total cost of all
components of the manufactured product unless another standard for
determining the minimum amount of domestic content of the manufactured
product has been established under applicable law or regulation.
All construction materials are manufactured in the United
States. This means that all manufacturing processes for the
construction material occurred in the United States.
The final guidance largely implements the guidance as proposed,
with some limited technical modifications. It codifies the rules
outlined above and is intended to clarify several aspects of Buy
America implementation:
Defines ``cost of components'' for manufactured products
as acquisition cost and transportation costs for components purchased
by the manufacturer, and all costs associated with manufacture of any
components created by the manufacturer;
Specifies manufacturing standards for various
construction materials; and
Defines ``manufactured products'' as products that have
been processed into a specific form or shape or combined with other
materials, ``do not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or
both'' and are not construction materials.
In 2023, ABC commented on the proposed guidance to urge OMB to
balance Buy America requirements with safeguards against increased
costs and delays of infrastructure projects funded by taxpayers.
ABC and our members are committed to building our nation's
infrastructure projects with the highest standards of safety and
quality. ABC members stand ready for the opportunity to build and
maintain America's infrastructure to the benefit of the communities
that it will serve.
Sincerely,
Kristen Swearingen,
Vice President, Legislative and Political Affairs,
Associated Builders and Contractors.
Statement of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, Submitted
for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
The National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (NSSGA) appreciates
the opportunity to provide comments on the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Highways and Transit Subcommittee's oversight hearing on
the ``Implementation of Buy America Provisions: Stakeholder
Perspectives.''
NSSGA members consist of stone, sand and gravel producers;
industrial sand suppliers; and the equipment manufacturers and service
providers who support them. With upwards of 9,000 locations, the
aggregates industry produces 2.5 billion tons of materials used
annually in the United States. Aggregates are the building blocks of
our modern society and are needed to construct and maintain
communities, roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, our water supply,
sewers, electrical grids and telecommunications.
Section 70917 (c) Materials
The NSSGA worked with Members of Congress, including on this
Committee, in 2023 to ensure section Sec. 70917(c) of the Build
America, Buy America Act Part 1 (BABAA) of the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. No. 117-58, was correctly
implemented in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) proposed
BABAA guidance and amendment to 2 CFR 184 and 200.
Section 70917(c)(1) established an important limitation to the term
``construction materials'' as the term is used in BABAA. The limitation
excludes ``cement and cementitious materials, aggregates such as stone,
sand, or gravel, or aggregate binding agents or additives'' from the
term ``construction materials'' as used in BABAA, and thus does not
establish a domestic content procurement preference for these items.
Section 70917(c)(2) prohibits the same construction materials from
being included as ``inputs'' in ``all manufacturing processes''
producing ``construction materials.'' OMB is required to ``issue
standards'' defining the term ``all manufacturing processes'' for
construction materials to which BABAA does apply a domestic content
procurement preference. Because Section 70917(c)(2) prohibits the
definition of ``all manufacturing processes'' from including the listed
items as inputs, the combination of the listed items as concrete or
asphalt mix are not a construction material for which BABAA establishes
a domestic content procurement preference.
With support from Members of Congress, NSSGA was successful in
seeing the OMB final guidance and 2 CFR amendments correctly recognize
the intent of Congress concerning Section 70197(c).
Post-OMB Guidance Implementation Issues
The OMB's final guidance was issued Aug. 28, 2023, and became
applicable 60 days later. While the guidance in many ways remained
consistent with the OMB's April 2022 initial guidance memorandum, the
August guidance did make changes to BABAA implementation and failed to
address gradual implementation issues. BABAA implementation at the
State DOT level and below remains challenging.
For example, Sec. 70914 requires procurements with federal
financial assistance meet BABAA's domestic content procurement
preference. The BABAA law, however, does not provide detailed
instruction on how a compliant procurement is certified. OMB's August
final guidance and rule implementing the BABAA law is similarly silent
on detailed compliance certification. State DOTs have thus developed
their own ``BABAA Compliance Certifications'' without instruction or
guidance. States' BABAA compliance forms and processes vary state-to-
state, and are often confusing and, or insufficiently reflect BABAA's
compliance requirements for manufactured products, listed construction
materials and exempt construction materials. The Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) needs to issue guidance on BABAA compliance
certification forms and processes to remove confusion and delay.
Many State DOTs have added BABAA compliance as an additional
feature of their ``approved product lists'' (APL) or ``qualified
products lists'' (QPL). These lists predate BABAA, and their purpose is
to confirm compliance of product input or component specification with
a DOT's procurement specification. Often, however, an item on an APL/
QPL may not be procured by the DOT for individual use. Instead, the
item may be a component of a manufactured product. An item itself may
be deemed not BABAA compliant individually but can be a component of a
BABAA compliant manufactured product. FHWA guidance clarifying BABAA
compliance at the APL/QPLs level is needed to avoid confusion, delay
and potential false shortages of certain compliant products or
construction materials.
In its final guidance, OMB stated its intention to regularly
convene ``inter-agency workgroups'' to ensure ``that federal agencies
implement BABAA in a consistent, uniform, efficient and transparent
manner. OMB should include State procurement authorities like State
DOTs in these ``workgroups'' to bring front line experience and reality
to the workgroup's efforts.
The FHWA had a waiver for manufactured products for many years.
Section 70914 (d) of BABAA requires any pre-BABAA waiver to be
reviewed. As of this date, the FHWA Manufactured Waiver has not been
officially reviewed. This delay and lack of communication from FHWA on
the status of the waiver contributes to confusion among procurers and
suppliers as to the applicability of the waiver today, and whether or
when it will be updated and made available for public comment.
As discussed above, BABAA Section 70917 (c) excludes ``cement and
cementitious materials, aggregates such as stone, sand, or gravel, or
aggregate binding agents or additives'' from BABAA's domestic content
procurement preferences. This exclusion also applies to wet concrete
and asphalt. These excluded materials are, in some cases, not
adequately recognized in state DOT BABAA compliance certification forms
and processes. The FHWA should provide guidance to clarify that
excluded construction materials are not subject to BABAA compliance
certification.
BABAA itself and OMB's final implementing guidance devotes much
attention to product classification analysis for manufactured products
and listed construction materials. In its final guidance, OMB provides
an extensive narrative on classification processes, but only addresses
a limited number of fact specific scenarios as examples of ``correct''
classification. These classification issues within the FHWA
jurisdiction could be ameliorated with FHWA guidance for product
classification analysis scenarios specific to road construction.
In conclusion, the practical reality of BABAA implementation will
require ongoing guidance and direction to procuring authorities.
Successful BABAA implementation will require at least some agency
specific guidance to address implementation issues unique to each
agency. This is certainly true with the FHWA and, as discussed above,
prompt guidance from FHWA on those issues will be a positive step
towards achieving the investment goals of the IIJA.
Letter of February 15, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford,
Chairman, and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit, from the Portland Cement Association and the
National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
February 15, 2024.
The Honorable Rick Crawford,
Subcommittee Chair,
Highways and Transit Subcommittee, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Subcommittee Ranking Member,
Highways and Transit Subcommittee, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Subcommittee Chair Crawford and Subcommittee Ranking Member
Norton:
The Portland Cement Association (PCA) and the National Ready Mixed
Concrete Association (NRMCA) appreciate the opportunity to submit a
letter for the record of the ``Implementation of Buy America
Provisions: Stakeholders Perspectives'' hearing. The cement and ready
mixed concrete industries appreciate the opportunity to share our
perspective on the implementation of the Build America, Buy America Act
(BABAA) included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
as it relates to the treatment of cement and concrete mix.
Cement--the primary ingredient in concrete--is used in the
construction of a wide range of federally-funded infrastructure,
including roads and bridges, transit, airfield pavements, airport
infrastructure, drinking and wastewater infrastructure, commercial and
residential buildings, and schools. Cement is the most used material
globally after water. Concrete is made by mixing cement, aggregates,
and water.
In the United States, 120 million metric tons of cement is consumed
annually, while 95 metric tons of cement are produced in the United
States.\1\ Additionally, there are regions of the United States where
the primary ingredients to make cement are not prevalent, making
regions of the country more reliant on imported cement to build the
wide range of federal, state, and local infrastructure projects built
with concrete. PCA and NRMCA shared this information during the
formation of BABAA and consequently cement and cementitious materials
as well as their combination as concrete mix were exempt from the
definition of construction materials BABAA would apply to.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-cement.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, section 70917(c)(1) of IIJA established an important
limitation to the term ``construction materials'' as that term is used
in BABAA. The limitation prohibits the term ``construction materials''
from including ``cement and cementitious materials, aggregates such as
stone, sand, or gravel, or aggregate binding agents and additives.''
Additionally, section 70917(c)(2) prohibits the same construction
materials from being included as ``inputs'' in ``all manufacturing
processes'' for construction materials, to which BABAA does apply a
domestic content procurement preference. The legislative intent of
section 70917(c) is to exempt cement and concrete mix, aggregates, and
asphalt mix from Buy America requirements. Concrete mix is not in a
final form when procured; only its use as a construction material
establishes its final form. Concrete is perishable in that its
plasticity is temporarily maintained by a continuous mixing action
until used for its construction material purpose. All concrete mixes
are mixed in close proximity to their procurement construction material
purpose. Thus, all concrete mixing occurs in the United States.
As the Office of Management Budget (OMB) worked on the guidance to
implement BABAA, their draft proposed rule and notification of guidance
included questions that suggested ambiguity between cement and concrete
mix. PCA and NRMCA joined the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel
Association and the National Asphalt Pavement Association in filing
detailed comments to OMB addressing a number of potential issues made
in the draft rule and proposed guidance that failed to recognize
concrete mix first as a construction material and second as a
construction material exempt from Buy America.\2\ In the final rule and
guidance, OMB's accompanying comments clarified that ``section 70917(c)
materials should not be considered manufactured products when they are
used at or combined proximate to the work site--such as is the case
with wet concrete.'' \3\ We are pleased the final rule and final
guidance recognizes that concrete mix is an exempt construction
material. We applaud OMB's hard work to ensure that the final rule is
consistent with the legislative intent of BABAA.

17724/guidance-for-grants-and-agreements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the final guidance and rule did not extend the
exemption of concrete mix--or its components, including cement and
cementitious materials as well as aggregates--to the concrete mix used
in manufactured products incorporated into an infrastructure project.
For example, concrete pipes, culverts, and bridge components. This
nuance between the treatment of cement and concrete mix as a
construction material and when it is incorporated into a manufactured
product has engendered questions and confusion around whether a cement
or concrete mix is Buy America compliant. In some cases, our concrete
mix is being brought to a construction site, and in other cases, it is
being incorporated into what OMB has characterized as a manufactured
product. This unfortunate ambiguity poses significant challenges in
application of Buy America.
We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure BABAA is
implemented to meet the legislative intent of section 70917(c) to
exempt cement and concrete mix from Buy America requirements and the
impacts of BABAA on the construction of infrastructure funded in part
with federal funding. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate
to follow up with Sean O'Neill with PCA or Andrew Tyrrell with NRMCA.
Sincerely,
Sean O'Neill,
Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Portland Cement Association.

Concrete Association.
Letter of February 14, 2024, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure, from Veso Sobot, P.Eng., Associate
Director Corporate Affairs, Housing and Infrastructure Products,
Westlake Corporation, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Tim Burchett
February 14, 2024.
Re: House Transportation Committee Hearing 15 Feb 2024
Dear Chairman Sam Graves (R-MO):
Westlake Corporation (www.westlake.com) is a manufacturer of long-
life building products headquartered in Houston, Texas.
We take this opportunity to inform your House Transportation
Committee hearing scheduled for February 15th at 10:00 a.m. on our
experience with ``Buy Back America'' and would appreciate this letter
being submitted into the record.
Westlake is an interested stakeholder, with operations in Kentucky
(Rep. Thomas Massie), Lodi, California (Rep. Doug LaMalfa and John
Duarte, Rep. Jared Huffman, Rep. Grace Napolitano, Rep. Julia Brownley,
Rep. John Garamendi, Rep. Salud Carbajal, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier),
Brownsville/Newbern, TN (Rep. Tim Burchett, Rep. Steve Cohen), Wichita
Falls, TX (Rep. Troy Nehls, Rep. Colin Allred), McPherson, KS (Rep.
Tracey Mann), Janesville, WI (Rep. Derrick Van Orden), Greensboro, GA
(Rep. Mike Collins, Rep. Henry Johnson), and Yucca, AZ (Rep. Greg
Stanton).
Westlake would like to make the committee aware of some unintended
consequences of ``Buy Back America''.
In the making of municipal pipe and fittings for infrastructure
projects, virtually 100% of the raw materials used to make pipe and
fittings are manufactured in America. Those raw materials are sent to
our Canadian wholly owned operations and converted into a unique and
innovative earthquake-resistant biaxially oriented pipe with
accompanying fittings. Those pipes are often sent back to the U.S. The
strict enforcement of BABAA (Buy American, Build American Act) has led
to exclusion on federally funded projects even though the raw material
content of the pipe is 100% American. Moreover, exclusion is now
happening on non-federally funded projects by distributors reluctant to
deal with paperwork and/or carry two inventories.
Westlake requests that provisions be made for American companies
with operations in USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement)
signatory countries to qualify for an exemption to BABAA if raw
materials predominantly originate from the U.S.A.
That reasonable change to the BABAA requirements will lead to lower
prices for taxpayers for American infrastructure, without stranding
American assets. It will also provide a safety mechanism for logistical
channels to avoid supply chain issues experienced during COVID-19.
Yours truly,
Veso Sobot, P.Eng.,
Associate Director Corporate Affairs, Housing and Infrastructure
Products, Westlake Corporation.
Statement of the National Association of State Outdoor Recreation
Liaison Officers, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Val T. Hoyle
On behalf of the National Association of State Outdoor Recreation
Liaison Officers (NASORLO), we appreciate the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee holding a hearing to better understand the
implementation challenges and opportunities for the Build America, Buy
America requirements.
NASORLO is the organization that represents the states and
territories related to their administration of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund (LWCF). Our organization was formed in 1967 when
representatives from state and territorial governments were called
together by the federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation to address
administrative matters related to a new state outdoor recreation grants
program called the Land and Water Conservation Fund. For over 50 years,
our members have served as liaisons to the National Park Service in the
administration of LWCF in funding outdoor recreation at the state,
territorial, and local government level. As States' representatives, we
understand how Americans will benefit greatly from a vibrant and
dynamic State Assistance Program.
While the program we work closest with--the Land and Water
Conservation Fund Stateside Program--is not within this Committee's
jurisdiction, we are hopeful that lessons learned from BABA
implementation can be utilized across agencies. We work on projects
that involve playgrounds, recreation, trails, and other close-to-home
infrastructure--development of which often includes equipment and
materials impacted by BABA. As we heard in the hearing from witnesses,
suppliers are struggling to certify ``Made in America'' goods. This is
also true across states outdoor recreation projects, especially when
some states' projects typically are not more than $1 million.
One of our primary goals is to strengthen local economies where we
build and maintain outdoor spaces. Unfortunately, requirements set
forth under BABA often act as a roadblock for small communities looking
to complete LWCF projects. Communities are facing limited resources and
manpower with BABA adding to the overall impacts and as result, vital
conservation and recreation initiatives that could greatly benefit
these communities are often delayed or abandoned altogether, further
widening the gap in access to outdoor spaces and environmental
preservation efforts.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gave agencies the authority to
issue a waiver if necessary, and we have asked for temporary assistance
to enable state liaison officers to continue implementing outdoor
recreation projects while we work with the federal government to
identify domestic manufacturing gaps.
Supply chain issues, inflation and workforce shortages during the
pandemic have already made it more difficult than normal to build and
maintain local parks. Many of our states are already behind schedule
with prices now much higher than when states sent their original
proposals which were prior to the passing of the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act. We know that the National Park Service is
dedicated to making the Land and Water Conservation Fund work, as are
we, but are extremely alarmed that, without a waiver, or retro-waiver
for an already approved project, we will be unable to expend grant
funds due to the unavailability of supplies needed to construct
necessary infrastructure. Examples of this include:
Historically appropriate lighting. All available product
is manufactured in China.
Any electrical parts, including LED lighting, breakers,
lighting control systems, irrigation control systems, computers, point
of sale (POS) systems, software management systems are either
manufactured directly in China or have majority components that are
directly manufactured in China.
Plumbing supplies are predominantly manufactured in
China.
Sheet metal is predominantly manufactured in China.
Lithium batteries, used for exit signage for example, are
all manufactured in China.
Iron and Steel products are approximately 50% more
expensive when purchased from American manufacturers than when
purchased from overseas manufactures such as China and India. That
significantly impacts a budget not designed for BABA requirements.
While we see the value in Build America, Buy America, we hope that
this requirement will spur more American companies to manufacture these
products in the United States, this will take years and BABA waivers
can be revisited as this transition takes place. For background, the
BABA requirement appeared in our grant requirements last year with no
additional guidance. States handle compliance differently, with some
states confirming compliance before submitting requests and some states
relying on applicants to comply with requirements. Given the differing
expectations, we worry that small communities charged with
understanding the legal ramifications might not have the tools to
comply. In all cases, we are concerned that the communities most in
need of LWCF funding will not have the resources to identify hard-to-
find materials and ultimately decide not to apply for these projects.
Given that the Department of Transportation is better versed in
BABA requirements, we look to your Committee to encourage DOT, OMB, and
other agencies to work across the federal government on best practices
and expand waivers across federal agencies. We believe these
recommendations can apply to all agencies and we hope to work with your
Committee to lend our perspective:
Determine who certifies these funds for compliant
vendors. We recommend that federal agencies provide States with an
overview of what needs to be certified consistent across each program
related to BABA. Whether that is a letter from the vendor certifying
the product is Made in America or other form of certification, we
recommend clear guidance to the States so that State Liaison Officers
and applicants can take on the task.
Offer guidance to local governments. In many states,
compliance falls on the local government applying for the project. We
hope to give these communities as much information as possible to
comply with Buy America requirements. We suggest that agencies begin
providing training and guidance on BABA compliance emphasizing
requirements, waivers, and alternatives and to give states an
opportunity to provide examples of the impact on projects prior to the
training.
Work with states to identify alternatives for products
not manufactured in the United States. Many project applicants are
tasked with BABA compliance--often without realizing what that implies.
We recommend offering webinars, access to staff, and other available
resources to identify construction alternatives that are BABA-
compliant. We recommend an expedited waiver process or a blanket waiver
for purchase of items that are not available inside the United States,
rather than states requesting individual waivers for the same item.
Commit to providing extension amendments for projects
under federal programs. States are often facing supply chain
constraints outside of their control, which burns up most of the time
of the allotted project. We recommend that agencies lay out a
transparent process to offer extension amendments for the original
projects--in this case, individual LWCF projects--to states facing BABA
compliance complications.
Share waivers across agencies. Waivers approved in
different agencies, where applicable, should be able to be shared. For
example, we see an opportunity for the $750,000 Recreational Trails
Program could carry over to National Park Service and LWCF since funds
can oftentimes be used together.
Overall, we support BABA goals and objectives, but need to have a
plan in place during the transition period. On behalf of the states
administering LWCF, we hope to work with your Committee on
administration-wide implementation of these requirements.
Appendix
----------
Questions from Hon. Jefferson Van Drew to Ty Edmondson, Chief Executive
Officer and President, T.A. Loving Company, on behalf of the Associated
General Contractors of America (AGC)
Question 1. What can be done to make the waiver process simpler and
more transparent?
Answer. Several measures can be taken to create a streamlined and
more transparent waiver application process. Although the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) has a 15-day process to determine approval
of a waiver once it is posted, the agency must get pre-approval from
OMB to even post the waiver for public comment.
This OMB pre-approval to post a waiver originates from Executive
Order 14005 titled ``Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by
All of America's Workers,'' not from are the Build America, Buy America
Act (BABAA) contained in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA). Removing these requirements for OMB involvement in multiple
stages of the waiver process would significantly expedite the waiver
process.
To increase transparency, the www.MadeInAmerica.gov website should
allow applicants to monitor the status of their requests. As it is
right now, the time between when a recipient submits a waiver request
and when it is posted by the agency can take months or even years. To
increase transparency, the requests should be posted immediately when
they are received by the agency and allow the public to comment.
Instead, we have agencies are often sitting on requests that the public
is not aware of. One of the prime benefits of public posting is that it
allows domestic manufacturers the ability to potentially provide a
BABAA-compliant item that could not otherwise be found.
Question 2. How are the smaller companies impacted by these
policies more so than some of the bigger manufacturers?
Answer. As the representative for the construction industry, AGC of
America's expertise lies primarily within the construction services
sector. Consequently, AGC is not in the best position to comment on the
law's impact on manufacturers.
From the perspective of construction firms, some larger firms have
dedicated or partially dedicated personnel to handle Buy America
requirements, but smaller construction companies most likely lack the
resources. The requirements add additional responsibilities to workers
already wearing many different hats at a time when the construction
industry is facing an unprecedented shortage of qualified workers.\1\

09/06/new-survey-shows-significant-flaws-nations-approach-preparing-
workers-construction-careers-and-how
Question 3. Do these guidelines have any impact on the workforce?
Answer. As new Buy America requirements take effect, construction
companies will have to provide additional training to their employees.
This training will need to ensure that workers involved in various
stages of an infrastructure project, including design, bidding,
procurement, and construction, are well-versed in the intricacies of
the new requirements to ensure compliance. While Buy America policies
aim to support the domestic manufacturing industries, the delays in the
waiver process can delay or halt construction projects, which in turn
negatively impacts construction workers.
Question 4. What would be a reasonable timeline for these policies
to be phased into practice by manufacturers without negatively
affecting their output and bottom line?
Answer. OMB should have implemented Buy America requirements on a
product-by-product basis based on research of supply chains and
domestic manufacturing capacity. Instead, the final guidance was issued
on October 25, 2023, yet federal agencies such as the EPA and DOT are
still in the process of gathering information concerning the
manufacturing capacity and availability of various construction
materials and products.\2\ \3\

According to feedback from AGC members, construction companies
anticipate requiring approximately three years following the
finalization of the rules. This would provide them an adequate amount

Questions from Hon. Marilyn Strickland to Brian Enders, Vice President,
Walbec Group, on behalf of the National Asphalt Pavement Association
(NAPA)
Question 1. Last summer, I had the pleasure of visiting an asphalt
plant from a NAPA company in my district--Granite Construction. During
this visit, we discussed the same issues of the asphalt industry that
you noted in your testimony, along with similar construction materials,
and the need for the exemption to be seen through. I am glad the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's efforts have helped us
get to that goal, however, could you share any potential concerns if
this issue were to be opened up again?
Answer. To begin, thank you for visiting an asphalt plant--it is
that engagement that allows us to better tell our story and allow
officials like you to better see how our product is made and understand
all the complexities the asphalt industry must consider.
As you know, the asphalt industry would certainly suffer supply
chain disruptions and price increases if we do not have this
construction material exemption. While we operate in the Upper Midwest
and can't speak specifically to the market in the Pacific Northwest, we
do know that states like Washington and Oregon would have significant
supply chain disruptions as that market--like ours--must rely upon a
majority of its necessary asphalt binder imported from Canada and other
friendly trade neighbors. We are worried that as we plan and build in
the final years of the IIJA package, and your Committee works on its
successor in the 119th Congress, that we mitigate precious federal
resources if we arbitrarily exacerbate the construction material supply
chain.
In short, it would be creating unnecessary obstacles to complete
vital road projects on time and on budget.
Question 2. While Walbec does not operate in Washington State,
could you share from an anecdotal perspective how the Pacific Northwest
is equally impacted by construction material exemptions?
Answer. Absolutely--while our markets are very different from a
climate, traffic and state topography perspective--we are very similar
in the asphalt binder we need to import in order to domestically
manufacture the necessary asphalt we need for local road construction.
Like Washington, Wisconsin has minimal refining capabilities, and given
its geographic proximity to the Canadian border, we are able to utilize
Canadian crude--which is a ``sweeter'' crude and better suited for
asphalt production. Without getting too much into the complexities,
asphalt binder is the ``glue'' to ensure the pavement is durable and
effective on our roadways; Canadian crude has certain proprieties that
really help with pavement mixtures--it has more viscosity and when
utilized in certain pavement mixes, could help extend pavement
lifespans. This is a long way of saying that states like Washington and
Wisconsin benefit from being closer to Canadian refining production and
can implement these raw materials in local pavement mixes more
efficiently. Because of these similarities, our markets import over 75%
of asphalt binder from Canada compared to other markets across the
country.
If we undo our Buy America exemption for construction materials, it
will upend these markets considerably and create increased costs and
material delays. Markets like the PNW and Upper Midwest are some of the
most vulnerable if our construction material supply chain exemption
were to be eliminated.
Question 3. In your testimony, you raised RAP a few times. How
critical is RAP usage within the Washington State roadway market and
its ability to mitigate additional virgin material usage?
Answer. Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is the most recycled
product in the country, as we utilized over 90M tons in 2021. Utilizing
RAP allows asphalt producers to mill up current roadway asphalt
pavement--which is 99% recyclable--while adding minimal asphalt binder,
aggregate, various emulsifiers and additives, and deploy that material
on the same roadway it had come from. We believe we can deploy more RAP
in markets across the country, including states like Washington, which
will save taxpayer dollars and meet/exceed pavement specifications. In
fact, State DOTs and FHWA save over $3B in costs by using RAP, and our
industry stands ready to do more. The national average for RAP usage
across State DOTs is about 20.8%; if we were to raise that national
average by just 1%, we would eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from
the equivalent of +25,000 cars every year.
Deploying more RAP in Washington would vastly save on costs and
prevent hundreds of thousands of tons of paved asphalt going unused or
put into landfills. It is a vital and effective pavement mix design for
the Washington DOT to consider and about 20% of their road mixtures use
RAP, but they could certainly use more. We hope that the next highway
reauthorization can include language to help promote and entourage RAP
deployment in our national roadway market, and we'd be happy to assist
with more insights as the Committee begins its work.
