SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER
TO: LMembers, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure
FROM: LStaff, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure
RE: LFull Committee Hearing on ``Department of
Transportation Discretionary Grants: Stakeholder Perspectives''
_______________________________________________________________________
I. PURPOSE
The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will
meet on Thursday, March 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of
the Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony at a

Grants: Stakeholder Perspectives.'' At the hearing, Members
will receive testimony from the National Association of
Counties (NACo), the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments, and
the Florida Department of Transportation. The witnesses will
discuss issues and opportunities related to applying for and
securing competitive discretionary funding administered and
awarded by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT
or Department).
II. BACKGROUND
The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I or
Committee) authorizes programs carried out by DOT modal
administrations and offices including the:
LFederal Aviation Administration (FAA);
LFederal Highway Administration (FHWA);
LFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(FMCSA);
LNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA);
LFederal Transit Administration (FTA);
LFederal Railroad Administration (FRA);
LMaritime Administration (MARAD);
LPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA);
LGreat Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway Development
Corporation (GLS);
LOffice of the Inspector General (OIG); and
LOffice of the Secretary (OST).
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT
On November 15, 2021, the President signed the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58)
into law, representing the largest Federal investment in
decades in the United States' infrastructure.\1\ This
legislation authorized and appropriated a combined $1.2
trillion for infrastructure programs over the five-year period
from fiscal year (FY) 2022 to FY 2026, to sustain and modernize
the Nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, transit,
railroads, ports, and airports, as well as energy and broadband
infrastructure.\2\ Of the total authorized and appropriated in
IIJA, approximately $661 billion is administered by DOT.\3\ The
Department is responsible for implementing 103 programs and 157
subprograms under IIJA, which includes 72 competitive programs
and 93 competitive subprograms.\4\ Of the $661 billion, 67
percent is distributed by formula (58 percent through existing
formula programs and nine percent through new formula programs)
and 30 percent is distributed through competitive programs (19
percent through existing competitive programs and 11 percent
through new competitive programs).\5\

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT
On August 16, 2022, the President signed the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169) into law, which appropriated
$5.3 billion in FY 2022 for three new competitive FHWA-
administered programs: the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant
Program, the Low-Carbon Transportation Materials Grants, and
Environmental Review Implementation Funds.\6\ Funding for all
three programs is available for obligation until September 30,
2026.\7\

III. IIJA IMPLEMENTATION
Through IIJA, Congress created several new discretionary
competitive grant programs; authorized and appropriated
increased funding for existing programs; and created and
expanded program and recipient eligibilities, including for
non-traditional applicants.\8\ The majority of authorized DOT
IIJA funding will flow to recipients through $446 billion in
formula grants and $196 billion in competitive grants.\9\ A
comprehensive list of these programs across modal agencies and
total funding available for each program can be found on DOT's
website.\10\ Since IIJA's enactment, as of February 11, 2024,
DOT indicated it has announced nearly $290.9 billion in IIJA
formula funding and competitive grant awards to states, local
governments, transit agencies, airports, ports, and other
project sponsors.\11\ IIJA authorized $262.7 billion in formula
and competitive grant funding for FY 2025 and FY 2026 that is
not yet available to DOT.\12\ Since enactment of IIJA, DOT
issued at least 87 Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs)
totaling $64 billion in available funding for IIJA and IRA
competitive grant programs.\13\ Relative to the previous
authorization period, an analysis by the Eno Center for
Transportation (Eno) estimates that IIJA included an
approximately five-fold increase in the amount of competitive
grant funding that the Secretary of Transportation will
award.\14\ Eno also estimates that in calendar year 2023, DOT
announced more than $40 billion in discretionary competitive
grant awards.\15\

PROGRAMS UNDER T&I'S SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS' JURISDICTION
Additionally, IIJA created a new Railroad Crossing
Elimination Grant Program to address safety concerns at
highway-rail or pathway-rail grade crossings nationwide.\27\
IIJA also expanded eligibility for the renamed Federal-State
Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail program, including for
projects on the National Network that no longer need to be on
publicly-owned infrastructure and gives priority for projects
on corridors in the Corridor Identification and Development
Program.\28\ The Act further builds on the Fixing America's
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-94)
allowance for the Secretary of Transportation to identify out-
year funding needs for rail projects through letters of intent
by creating phased funding agreement authority.\29\ This
permits the Secretary of Transportation to issue letters of
intent or phased funding agreements for multi-year projects,
subject to advance or future appropriations.\30\ Over the FY
2022-2026 period, IIJA appropriates $44.3 billion in advance
funding and authorizes $15.3 billion in spending subject to
appropriation for FRA-administered competitive programs.\31\

IV. GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS
Discretionary grants are awarded by DOT to eligible
applicants through a competitive selection process.\39\ For
competitive grant programs, DOT first issues a NOFO which sets
forth eligibilities under each grant program, factors for
applicant evaluation, the period of time during which
interested parties can apply, and other relevant
information.\40\ DOT posts NOFOs and applicants generally apply
through the Federal website www.grants.gov.\41\ To provide
assistance and information on future funding opportunities for
potential applicants, DOT has posted on its website anticipated
dates for future grant notices. A historical listing of
previously issued and closed NOFOs is also available on DOT's
website.\42\ DOT has created a dashboard, which allows users to
view IIJA funding by modal administration, fiscal year, and
other factors such as funding source and program type.\43\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eligibility requirements and other criteria for competitive
grant programs are generally specified in statute. Typical
recipients include but are not limited to states, the District
of Columbia, territories of the United States, Federally
recognized Indian Tribes, units of local government, public
agencies or publicly chartered authorities, special purpose
districts, public authorities with a transportation function,
non-profit organizations, Amtrak, transit agencies,
universities, and private-sector applicants, among others.\44\
Competitive grants primarily support planning or construction
of transportation infrastructure projects; research and
development; safety; vehicle replacement; hazard mitigation;
resiliency projects; education and workforce development;
technical assistance; and compliance with environmental, civil
rights, or other laws, among other activities.\45\ NOFOs
explicitly confirm that applicants must demonstrate compliance
with applicable laws, such as the Build America, Buy America
Act (BABAA).\46\ This Act requires that when procuring iron,
steel, manufactured products, and construction materials for
use in infrastructure projects that receive Federal funding
assistance, preference must be given to materials produced by
companies and workers in the United States.\47\ These
provisions apply to all infrastructure projects whether funding
is allocated through IIJA or other Federal programs.\48\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A NOFO may also set forth requirements for grant applicants
to demonstrate effort with respect to priorities established in
executive orders or broader Administration or DOT-wide
goals.\49\ Project selection by the Department may also
consider broader Administration goals. For example, the
Justice40 Initiative (J40), created by President Biden's
Executive Order 14008, establishes a goal to devote 40 percent
of certain Federal benefits to funding in disadvantaged
communities.\50\ DOT's implementation of J40 affects the
decision-making processes for at least 39 programs and
approximately $204 billion in authorized IIJA funding.\51\ DOT
has outlined in its FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan its goals of
advancing safety, economic strength and global competitiveness,
equity, climate and sustainability, transformation, and
organizational excellence.\52\ In order to increase the
likelihood of securing a grant award, DOT encourages applicants
generally, and within their NOFOs, to align applications with
DOT's defined strategic goals and to detail how their
respective projects would help DOT achieve these goals.\53\
While applicants must comply with statutory requirements for
grants, pursuant to the NOFO they will have a greater chance at
securing a grant award if they meet this Administration's
additional criteria related to equity, Justice40, and climate
change--although some competitive grant programs also include
these same factors as statutory evaluation criteria.\54\

On its website, DOT provides a preparation checklist to
assist applicants seeking grant opportunities.\55\ These
guidelines provide clarity on requirements mandated by statute
in order to receive federal funds, such as compliance with
environmental planning policies and regulations outlined in the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Applicants are also
subject to program-specific statutory requirements, that can
include a capital projects benefit-cost analysis (BCA) or a
requirement to secure non-Federal funding to support a
project.\56\ DOT also provides a process timeline for
considering, issuing, and disbursing awards.\57\

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DISCRETIONARY GRANTS: STAKEHOLDER
PERSPECTIVES
----------
THURSDAY, MARCH 7, 2024
House of Representatives,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:03 a.m. in room
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Sam Graves (Chairman
of the committee) presiding.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. The Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure will come to order, and I ask unanimous consent
that the chairman be authorized to declare a recess at any time
during today's hearing.
Without objection, that is so ordered.
As a reminder, if Members insert a document into the
record, please also email it to DocumentsTI@mail.house.gov.
So, with that, I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for the
purposes of an opening statement.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN,
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. Graves of Missouri. We are here today to discuss the
discretionary grant programs at the Department of
Transportation and to hear firsthand from stakeholders about
their experiences with the Department's grant processes.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the IIJA,
authorized $196 billion over 5 years for new and existing DOT
competitive grant programs. This represents 30 percent of the
total funding provided by the IIJA. The committee has a keen
interest in ensuring that these taxpayer-funded grants follow
the intent of the law and support projects that actually
improve our Nation's infrastructure network and the supply
chain.
The committee has heard concerns from stakeholders
regarding the implementation of the IIJA, specifically citing
the Department's delay and inconsistency with the issuance of
Notices of Funding Opportunity, or NOFOs, and the length of
time it takes to execute grant agreements after an award has
been announced.
On the front end of the process, NOFOs have incorporated
the administration's Executive orders on climate, equity, and
environmental justice into their grant criteria, requiring
applicants to demonstrate efforts in advancing the
administration's very progressive agenda.
For example, a recipient of a 2023 Safe Streets and Roads
For All grant award not only must certify compliance with 75
Federal laws and regulations, but they must also certify
compliance with 12 Executive orders. These additional criteria
may exclude otherwise qualified projects from receiving Federal
funding for worthwhile infrastructure improvements.
On the back end, grant recipients are experiencing longer
than normal wait times for the execution of grant agreements.
As a result, IIJA funds are trickling out, limiting the ability
of stakeholders to put these funds to good use.
As the committee prepares for the next highway bill in the
next Congress, it's important that we continue to ensure the
best use of the infrastructure funding and find ways to improve
the grant process.
I also look forward to hearing from each of our witnesses
today, including one from my district who I will introduce here
in just a little bit, about their experience in applying for
Federal funding and how they are using Federal dollars to
improve the state of our Nation's transportation network.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Missouri, and Chairman, Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure
We are here today to discuss discretionary grant programs at the
Department of Transportation (DOT) and to hear firsthand from
stakeholders about their experiences with the Department's grant
processes.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized $196
billion over five years for new and existing DOT competitive grant
programs. This represents 30 percent of the total funding provided by
IIJA.
The Committee has a keen interest in ensuring these taxpayer-funded
grants follow the intent of the law and support projects that actually
improve our Nation's infrastructure network and supply chain.
The Committee has heard concerns from stakeholders regarding the
implementation of IIJA, specifically citing the Department's delay and
inconsistency with the issuance of Notices of Funding Opportunity, or
NOFOs, and the length of time it takes to execute grant agreements
after an award has been announced.
On the front end of the process, NOFOs have incorporated the
Administration's Executive orders on climate, equity, and environmental
justice into their grant criteria, requiring applicants to demonstrate
effort in advancing the Administration's progressive agenda.
For example, a recipient of a 2023 Safe Streets and Roads for All
grant award not only must certify compliance with 75 federal laws and
regulations, but they must also certify compliance with 12 Executive
orders. These additional criteria may exclude otherwise qualified
projects from receiving federal funding for worthwhile infrastructure
improvements.
On the back end, grant recipients are experiencing longer than
normal wait times for the execution of grant agreements. As a result,
IIJA funds are trickling out, limiting the ability of stakeholders to
put these funds to use.
As the Committee prepares for the next highway bill in the next
Congress, it is important that we continue to ensure the best use of
our infrastructure funding and find ways to improve the grant process.
I also look forward to hearing from each of our witnesses today,
including one from my district who I'll introduce later, about their
experience in applying for federal funding, and how they are using
federal dollars to improve the state of our Nation's transportation
network.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. I now recognize Ranking Member
Larsen for his opening statement.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Graves, for
holding this hearing to explore how competitive grant funds
from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are providing
opportunities and delivering results.
The law provides record-breaking funding for critical
infrastructure projects. Over 5 years, the BIL invests $661
billion in roads, bridges, transit, buses, ferries, airports,
ports, and rail. Congress provided 30 percent of this amount,
about $196 billion, to be distributed through 72 competitive
grant programs. Many of these grant programs were established
in the BIL, and this investment level and volume of new
initiatives far exceeds previous transportation bills.
DOT has risen to the occasion to get this money into the
hands of communities by issuing nearly 90 Notices of Funding
Opportunity, or NOFOs, in the 2 years since the enactment of
the law, and this level of grantmaking is remarkable. Compared
to formula funds, these grants provide new and expanded
opportunities for local and Tribal governments to pursue local
priorities and receive grant awards directly.
For example, the BIL's Safe Streets and Roads For All
program, for which States are not eligible to apply, is widely
heralded as a model for assistance to local governments to
improve safety. In the first two rounds of funding, over 1,000
local safety projects received grants, a huge boost to
communities with needs that may not rise to the top of State
DOT priorities.
Congress also delivered an unprecedented 5 years of funding
certainty for rail in the BIL, a level of commitment not seen
since the creation of Amtrak over 50 years ago.
The Federal Railroad Administration has awarded over 238
rail projects under the BIL, including a $2 million grant to
the city of Burlington in my district for a railroad crossing
elimination. The FRA is working with communities to develop or
enhance, as well, 69 intercity passenger rail corridors
nationwide.
Yet much of this BIL discretionary rail funding is subject
to appropriation, and therefore at the mercy of caps and cuts,
because rail does not have a dedicated revenue source. And the
cuts to Amtrak in the proposed THUD bill, which stalled
consideration of the bill last fall, demonstrated this
committee will have to remain vigilant to protect investment in
rail.
Infrastructure investment means jobs. Ensuring that
infrastructure benefits reach all communities requires a strong
working relationship among Federal, State, regional, and local
government partners.
My State of Washington has a robust process to distribute
transportation dollars to all areas, including rural counties
and communities in my district. WSDOT leads the process by
partnering with local governments and passing through Federal
transportation dollars with a lot of input from State
legislators, I might add, as well.
Distribution of transportation funding through the State
legislature further supports the reach into communities. As a
result, we have seen success in addressing transportation needs
in my district and other districts around the State. This
collaboration further supports success in the competitive grant
process. Local governments, including Whatcom and Skagit
Counties, and the Tribes, such as the Lummi Nation in my
district, have successfully applied for and been awarded
grants.
So, in all, Washington and my district have received more
than $120 million in competitive grants from the BIL, so, it
can happen.
We are only 2 years through a 5-year bill, which means
there is more to come: more projects, more jobs, more safety
improvements, more pollution reduction, and more communities
uplifted.
Congress directed investments in the BIL to address climate
change and reduce carbon pollution, as well. We have directed
these investments to improve safety and equity outcomes on our
transportation network, and we put more decisionmaking power
into the hands of local communities who know their needs best.
DOT's grant competitions reflect these directives from
Congress. DOT's competitive grant considerations align with
goals shared by those who voted for the BIL and are advancing
cleaner, safer, and more equitable transportation.
Now, beyond the benefits of individual projects, BIL
resources are building local government capacity to deliver
projects, because in some respects, the local governments don't
have that capacity to apply for these grants. So, DOT is
actively helping applicants new to the Federal transportation
grant process to navigate this competitive process.
The Thriving Communities Program supports disadvantaged and
underresourced communities to advance transportation projects.
The program's capacity builder organizations work directly with
local communities to build their technical knowledge. The first
year of funding, $21 million, supported 64 communities,
including 27 in rural areas. This program to build the bench of
project sponsors will transform communities that have not
previously accessed Federal funds and will deliver jobs,
mobility improvements, and economic benefits for years to come,
especially in rural areas.
So, I welcome this opportunity to celebrate the benefits to
each of our districts and constituents. I also welcome the
opportunity to look at how we can make it better. As a former
county councilmember, I can assure you I understand the
frustration that counties and cities have in accessing Federal
money, and sometimes they choose not to. So, I fully understand
that. But we are making progress in this particular version of
the transportation funding through the BIL to try to address
that technical capacity deficit so that, again, we can build a
longer term bench to increase the number of project sponsors
for competitive grants.
I will finally say that there is one area where State
legislatures, State DOTs, the local governments, city and
county and Tribal governments all agree: there is never enough
money from the Federal Government when it comes to
transportation funding. So, if we can all agree on that as we
look forward to 2026, when we have to do this all over again,
we should keep that in mind, as well, as we are looking to
improve the process.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thanks, Rick, and I do want to
welcome all of the witnesses here today.
And just to kind of briefly explain the lights, you will
each have 5 minutes to give your testimony, and then green is
go, and yellow means you are running out of time, and red is
try to conclude as quickly as possible.
With that, I would ask unanimous consent that witnesses'
full statements be included in the record.
And without objection, that is so ordered.
I would ask unanimous consent that the record of today's
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them
in writing.
Without objection, that is so ordered.
I would also ask unanimous consent that the record remain
open for 15 days for additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, that is so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made a part of the
record, the committee asks that you, as I mentioned earlier,
limit remarks to 5 minutes.
So, before we get to our witnesses, I do want to welcome
some constituents in the audience today: Pike County Presiding
Commissioner Bill Allen is in the office, and Audrain County
Road and Bridge Engineer Brian Haeffner.
Welcome to both of you for coming in and helping out with
this.
Our first witness today is also a constituent of mine, and
I want to welcome Alan Winders, the presiding commissioner of
Audrain County. He also serves as chairman of the Better 54
Coalition. The Better 54 Coalition has been working to make
improvements to Highway 54 between Mexico, Missouri, and
Louisiana, Missouri. He is also the chairman of the Mark Twain
Regional Council of Governments. And given those roles, he is
very familiar with applying for DOT grants, as well as many
other grants.
Thanks for making the trip out, Alan. I really appreciate
you being here. And with that, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
TESTIMONY OF HON. ALAN WINDERS, PRESIDING COMMISSIONER, AUDRAIN

PERDUE, P.E., SECRETARY, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
TESTIMONY OF HON. ALAN WINDERS, PRESIDING COMMISSIONER, AUDRAIN
COUNTY, MISSOURI, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
COUNTIES
Mr. Winders. Good morning, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, and distinguished members of the committee. It's an
honor to be here today. There is only one Audrain County in all
of these great United States, and it's my great honor to be the
presiding commissioner. It is also my honor to be here today.
Audrain County is about 700 square miles, about 25,000
people, and is a rural county in northeast Missouri. It is
rural by all definitions. Today, I am here in the capacity as a
member of the National Association of Counties, or NACo, which
represents the interest of each of America's 3,069 counties,
parishes, and boroughs. Thank you for the opportunity to
provide the county perspective on U.S. Department of
Transportation's discretionary grant process as it relates to
programs in the IIJA.
Nationally, America's counties own 44 percent of roads and
38 percent of bridges. In Audrain County, it's a little higher
than that. But annually, America's counties invest over $60
million in the construction, maintenance, and operation of the
Nation's transportation systems. We are doing our part at the
local level. County-owned roads and bridges do not receive any
direct, guaranteed Federal support, although they serve far
more than just our residents. Making matters worse, 45 States,
including Missouri and Washington, cap the ability of counties
to increase revenues in various ways.
In rural America, where tax bases are small, our ability to
maintain infrastructure is even further strained, leading to
dangerous conditions. Sadly, a driver is twice as likely to die
in a crash on a rural road than an urban road. In rural areas,
however, where almost 70 percent of the Nation's transportation
system lies, along local roads and bridges that make up the
first and last mile of America's daily commutes, America's food
leaves the farm on local roads.
Foremost, America's counties are tremendously grateful for
the funding opportunities in the IIJA and urge lawmakers to
protect the level of investment in the next law. Competitive
grant programs represent the only way counties can access
Federal transportation funds to carry out the projects that we
deem a priority. And for that, we are immensely grateful.
When counties are successful, countless examples
demonstrate our ability to turn Federal investments into real-
life projects that improve the quality of life for our
residents. However, competing is not easy. Not only do counties
have to compete with ourselves, we also must vie with cities,
States, regional organizations, Tribal governments, and others.
Like Audrain, two-thirds of America's counties are rural
and have serious capacity constraints that put the average
county at a great competitive disadvantage in Federal grant
programs because these programs are structured to reward
applicants that have the most resources. This means that urban
centers are typically successful, while smaller entities
struggle to compete, even though the infrastructure serving
these communities is no less important.
From interstates to gravel roads, all parts of the system
are critical to its efficient operation. Small and rural
counties simply do not have the resources to determine which
grant program is the right fit, prepare or contract out a
competitive application, complete environmental reviews, meet
the local match, et cetera.
Other challenges exist that we have seen firsthand through
our role in the Highway 54 Coalition. While this project is
critical to our region, we lose rating points in the RAISE
application based on unrelated, nonstatutory criteria. While
the IIJA significantly increased the number of competitive
programs counties can apply to, it did not change how the
programs are fundamentally structured, applying the same
reporting requirements to State departments of transportation
and rural counties alike. This is true for counties of all
sizes. Overly complex regulations and guidance can make
implementing an award just about as challenging as competing
for it.
When we are successful, counties need responsive Federal
partners who produce timely and clear directives that do not
prescribe how funds are spent beyond what is required in the
statute.
Federal permitting requirements can also make competitive
grant programs unattractive for potential applicants. Too
often, simple, local projects that use Federal funding trigger
NEPA, even when they are carried out in an already disturbed
public right-of-way where categorical exclusion should apply.
Awardees are reporting unprecedented timelines of up to 24
months for grant agreements. Delays of this nature degrade
investment and slow the delivery of projects. We strongly
encourage the U.S. Department of Transportation to address this
issue.
In closing, the message is simple: please get grant funds
out the door as quickly as possible. Counties stand ready to
work with you as willing and able partners to help ensure that
dollars invested in our Nation's infrastructure over the course
of the IIJA continue to benefit Americans for generations to
come.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the
committee for the opportunity to be here today to talk, to give
some feedback on how we see the program working from our
perspective, and I look forward to answering any questions you
may have.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Alan Winders, Presiding Commissioner,
Audrain County, Missouri, on behalf of the National Association of
Counties
Introduction
Good morning, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and
distinguished members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity
to provide feedback on how America's county governments are faring in
the competitive grants process as it relates to U.S. Department of
Transportation (USDOT) funding opportunities in the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA/P.L. 117-58).
My name is Alan Winders, and I am the Presiding Commissioner in
Audrain County, Missouri, where I have served since 2016. Among
Missouri's 114 counties, Audrain occupies approximately 700 square
miles in the east central part of the state. Home to just under 25,000
residents with a population density of 36, the county is considered
rural by the 2020 U.S. Census.
With its rich, fertile land, Audrain is one of the state's leading
agricultural communities with primary farm products consisting of
soybeans, corn, grain, wheat, beef and pork. In value-added
agriculture, a biodiesel plant and an ethanol plant located in Audrain
County provide renewable fuels to the region. We are home to numerous
manufacturing firms, service industries, and other small businesses
ranging from retail shops to light manufacturing, distribution and food
products. Our residents enjoy an economic climate marked by variety and
progress.
I also serve as Chair of the U.S. Highway 54 Corridor Coalition
(Coalition), comprised of Audrain and Pike Counties, Mo. and Pike
County, Ill., as well as the various communities that make up the route
between Mexico, Mo. and Pittsfield, Ill. The Coalition's goal is
improving safety and increasing corridor capacity through the
implementation of an innovative, shared four-lane facility and
associated intersection improvements. The coalition has been diligent,
continuing its efforts for nearly 20 years.
In addition to my county roles, I am testifying in my capacity as a
member of the National Association of Counties (NACo). NACo represents
the interests of all of America's 3,069 counties, parishes and
boroughs. Like Audrain County, nearly two-thirds of the nation's
counties are rural, located outside of an urbanized area and
encompassing less than 50,000 residents. At the same time, there are
over 120 urban counties where local services are provided to 130
million residents each day.
Through participation in NACo's ten policy committees, county
officials work together to develop common legislative and regulatory
solutions at the federal level. As a member of the NACo Transportation
Policy Steering Committee, I work with my peers from around the country
to advance our national transportation priorities, the number one of
which is securing consistent federal funding for county-owned roads and
bridges.
As we approach the midpoint of the IIJA, America's counties thank
you for your attention to the law's processes and, specifically, to the
ability of local governments to access the multitude of new competitive
opportunities created by the IIJA within USDOT. We hope you will use
this feedback to inform your policy considerations for future surface
transportation legislation.
Counties offer the following considerations:
Counties hold a large ownership share of the nation's
roads (44 percent) and bridges (38 percent) yet receive no direct,
guaranteed federal funding to support these assets that serve many more
than just our residents.
Counties must compete with other counties, our city and
state partners, and others for direct federal funding for local
transportation needs, often unsuccessfully, and we urge Congress to
streamline this process.
To ensure the IIJA meets its intended goals, federal
policymakers should produce timely, clear criteria and guidance and
eliminate barriers to project delivery.
Counties hold a large ownership share of the nation's roads (44
percent) and bridges (38 percent) yet receive no guaranteed federal
funding to support these assets that serve many more than just our
residents.
County governments collectively own, operate and maintain
significantly more public road miles (44 percent) than any other level
of government, including states (20 percent). We also own and operate a
significant amount of the nation's bridges (38 percent) compared to
cities (8 percent) and townships (5 percent). Beyond roads and bridges,
counties are direct supporters of 34 percent of airports and 40 percent
of public transit systems that keep Americans connected in every corner
of the country and throughout the globe.
Home to the ``last mile,'' where the majority of Americans both
begin and end their days, counties are leaders in the national
infrastructure network and major investors, annually spending over $130
billion on the construction of transportation and infrastructure and
the maintenance and operation of public works.
In Missouri, counties own half of all bridges, well over the
national average. In Audrain, the county owns and operates just over 71
percent of bridges and 65 percent of road miles. Much of the Sixth
District of Missouri looks like Audrain, with its 39 counties
accounting for nearly 40 percent of all bridges in the state. In
Washington, counties own 40 percent of bridges, with the county-owned
bridges in the 2nd District accounting for seven percent of the state's
nearly 8,500 bridges.
While we own a substantial share of the nation's roads and bridges,
counties receive no guaranteed federal funding for these assets that
serve many more than just our residents. Compounding the problem,
Missouri, Washington and 43 other states limit the ability of counties
to raise revenue in various ways, making intergovernmental support
vital to meeting our public sector responsibilities, especially in
small and rural communities where property tax bases--the predominant
revenue source of most counties--are insufficient.
Because federal surface transportation laws have historically
apportioned 90 percent or more of transportation funding directly to
state departments of transportation (DOT) via formulas, counties must
rely on competitive funding opportunities that largely make up the
remaining 10 percent to meet the needs of locally owned infrastructure
outside of the National Highway System that makes up the majority of
the nation's roads and bridges.
While counties greatly value our partnerships with state DOTs, the
productivity of these relationships can vary by state and even county
by county. Further, even when the intergovernmental relationship is
effective, DOTs have their own infrastructure responsibilities that are
posited above our own which they too may be struggling to meet,
especially in rural states like Missouri.
Still, examples of county-state best practices exist nationwide.
The Missouri DOT works closely with counties through its off-system
bridge set-aside fund that combines the set-asides from both the Bridge
Formula Program and the Surface Transportation Block Grant. This
practice reduces the amount of the local match required from 20 percent
to roughly 12 percent.
For counties in Oklahoma, where only three of its 77 counties
retain a professional engineer, the state DOT has taken over the
complex reporting requirements that accompany federal awards at no
charge and is also supporting a portion of application costs. In
Indiana, the State Community Crossings Match Grant supports local
investment in infrastructure projects.
Unfortunately, these examples are not the experience for all
counties, leading to inconsistencies in the system that vary by
location. The divide is more easily discernible, however, within the
states themselves because of the federal transportation funding gap
that persists between urban and rural communities.
Nearly two-thirds of America's counties are rural. According to
USDOT, these areas--while sparser in population--are where 68 percent
of the nation's total lane-miles are located. In 2019, the
Congressional Research Service reported that, of the over 1.6 million
miles of rural county roads, just 13.7 percent are eligible for federal
aid.
Due to chronic underinvestment by our state and federal partners
and limited local tax bases, rural roads have serious safety concerns.
Rural areas are home to just 19 percent of the U.S. population but
represent where 43 percent of all roadway fatalities occur. Simply put,
a driver is almost twice as likely to die on a rural road than an urban
road. This reality is an example of the real-life consequences of USDOT
having to select winners and losers.
While rural infrastructure is deteriorating, it continues to
support the bulk of the movement of people and goods. USDOT reported
that ``large volumes of freight either originate in rural areas or are
transported through rural areas on the nation's highways, railways, and
inland waterways.'' This includes 46 percent of the total miles
traveled by heavy trucks, which can weigh 80,000 pounds or more in
states with exemptions to the federal threshold.
Due to their size and prevalence, heavy trucks have huge impacts on
local infrastructure felt most acutely in rural areas where travel
times can be twice as long as urban settings due to the nearly 60,000
bridges closed or posted with weight restrictions. Heavy trucks also
pose serious safety risks for our residents and other travelers who
drive along county roads each day.
According to a 2023 local bridge study, ``local bridges represent
76.4% of all bridges, but 89.6% of poor bridges . . . Local bridges,
being in worse condition overall, are more vulnerable to the potential
damage caused by heavier trucks.'' Counties urge lawmakers to prevent
heavy truck size and weight increases not accompanied by adequate
support to remediate impacts on locally owned infrastructure.
Some county bridges may carry low traffic volumes but represent
literally the only connection to work, school and emergency services
where a failure has the potential to isolate an entire community. No
traveler begins their trip on a highway and the functionality of the
system depends on every cog. The connectivity of the network, ranging
from interstates to local gravel roads, is vital. In summary, a route
is only as good as its weakest mile (or bridge).
Because areas with higher populations receive larger shares of
federal funding across the government, small and rural counties are
continuously overlooked, though the infrastructure serving these
communities is just as important to its residents as urban dwellers.
Competitive programs that do not have statutory population requirements
should help address this inequity, though some FY 2022 awards have
called this into question.
It is evident that needs exist throughout the system, both big and
small. Action is required from every level of government; however, some
levels of government are not as equally equipped to access federal
transportation funds.
Counties must compete with other counties, our city and state
partners, and others for direct federal funding for local
transportation needs, often unsuccessfully, and we urge Congress to
streamline this process.
The IIJA was not only historic in the amount of investment it
provided for American infrastructure but also because it increased the
number of actors eligible to meet the nation's transportation needs.
While process improvements can be made, counties are tremendously
grateful for the new funding opportunities created by the IIJA and urge
lawmakers to protect the level of investment in the next
reauthorization.
Competitive grants represent the only method for counties to
directly access federal funding to address community needs which, as
local leaders, we understand best. However, while the IIJA created
dozens of new opportunities within USDOT, many remain inaccessible to
county governments due to several obstacles, some stemming from the
competitive grants process itself.
To this end, NACo joined other stakeholders to make five
recommendations to the White House Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) that would simplify the federal grants process:
1. Promote simplified concepts, accessibility of key timing/
thresholds based on entity size
2. Streamline common identifiers for tracking purposes
3. Utilize ``plain language'' instruction for the layman whenever
possible
4. Lengthen timelines to accommodate local governments due process
5. Streamline application processes
Even with process improvements in place, federal grants are
structured to reward applicants with resources to compete, and many
counties face stiff barriers. As a member of the Coalition, Audrain
County has experienced first-hand the challenges faced by rural
applicants. We believe our experience with applying for funding through
the USDOT Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and
Equity (RAISE) grant program, and the Better Utilizing Infrastructure
to Leverage Development (BUILD) grants under the previous
administration, is an example of how the process can work against local
governments.
The Coalition has yet to see success after actively seeking a RAISE
grant for the past six years on behalf of a state asset. Despite
submitting for the same project each year and updating its application
to meet changing criteria, the county's rating has continued to drop
from its highest in 2019 to its lowest in the most recent round of
awards. Once considered innovative by agency evaluators, USDOT has most
recently rated the application low in this category. In the Coalition's
experience, ratings can vary based on the reviewer, creating immense
uncertainty for applicants.
Coalition members have spent over $15,000 alone on developing and
updating RAISE's required benefit-cost analysis. Lacking the means for
a consultant to assist with the application, the Coalition relies on
support from the local area's regional planning commission, the Mark
Twain Regional Council of Governments. This funding shortfall is common
in rural areas and places communities on an uneven playing field with
urban and state-level applicants even when resources are pooled.
Undoubtedly, cost is a significant obstacle to competition for
counties for who lack capacity, both financial and human. Counties with
small populations and limited instruments to raise revenue must first
evaluate whether pursuing federal funds is a good use of scarce
resources by asking ourselves several questions, including:
Can we afford a consultant?
Can we meet the local match?
If awarded, can we front the cost of the project as
required by the reimbursable nature of USDOT programs?
Can we administer the grant, if awarded, as grant
administration costs are disallowed?
Federal notices of funding opportunities (NOFO) are long and
complex. Difficulty in deciphering funding announcements forces
interested applicants to hire expensive third parties to understand and
respond to the criteria. This is especially true for nontraditional
applicants seeking funding for the first time, which represents a
significant number of real and potential IIJA applicants.
Seriously complicating matters further, non-statutory NOFO criteria
has proved difficult for some counties, especially small, rural and
first-time applicants. Meeting additional requirements, as worthy as
they may be, only makes access more difficult for applicants who have
not historically benefited from federal funds.
The Highway 54 project might serve as a prime example where the
goal of the Coalition is to build capacity by expanding a two-lane
highway into a shared, four-lane highway in rural Missouri, about 50
miles northwest of St. Louis. This project is critical to our region
and will improve safety, congestion, economic development and the
efficiency of the national network efficiency; however, our RAISE
applications lose rating points in sections such as ``innovation'' and
``environmental justice.''
In our rural area and other similar communities, county officials
simply do not have the resources necessary to be competitive with our
urban and suburban neighbors in these types of endeavors. Ours is a
road project though largely unrelated criteria continues to keep it
from moving forward in the application process.
Many rural counties are still trying to bring our infrastructure to
states of good repair, and it is unreasonable to expect cash-strapped
communities who have never before sought and/or received federal
funding to exemplify innovative practices when we are struggling to
keep our local roads and bridges in safe and working order.
To competitively respond to NOFOs, counties across the country are
investing tens of thousands of dollars in consultant services to
produce applications that have no guarantee of success. In fact, a NACo
analysis of key USDOT awards to counties in FY 2022 showed that
counties are significantly less successful when up against our city and
state partners in USDOT programs across the board:
Counties fared best in the Safe Streets and Roads for All Program,
a competitive grant created by the IIJA with a unique eligibility that
excludes state governments. This allowed local governments to perform
significantly better in comparison to other discretionary grant
programs, all of which allow state DOTs to apply in addition to the
formula funds they annually receive. Counties performed worst in the
Reconnecting Communities category where no FY 2022 awards were made to
county governments despite the submission of over 40 applications
deemed eligible by USDOT.
Of note, the Bridge Investment Program has three funding
categories. Included in NACo's analysis are large bridge grant awards
for projects over $100 million, which account for the majority of the
program's award total and went mainly to states. Removing this data and
looking at planning and regular bridge grants combined, counties
slightly outperformed cities 53 percent to 47 percent. While this may
seem more equitable, counties own 38 percent of bridges compared to
cities' eight percent where 51 percent of county-owned bridges are off-
system versus just seven percent of cities.
Among the seven programs examined, counties received just eight
percent of awards overall, demonstrating that counties simply cannot
continue relying solely on competitive funding opportunities to repair
and modernize local infrastructure. In the next surface transportation
reauthorization, counties urge lawmakers to develop a direct,
guaranteed funding source for locally owned roads and bridges.
In addition to funding challenges, small and rural counties also
face personnel shortages. In many communities, the responsibility to
find a grant, apply, administer an award, and meet reporting
requirements can fall to the county clerk or treasurer who are seldom
proficient in this responsibility that largely falls outside of their
job description.
Nevertheless, since the current funding structure demands we
compete, counties appreciate the wealth of staff time and technical
assistance resources USDOT has provided since the enactment of the
infrastructure law. Counties specifically applaud USDOT's amendment to
the FY 2024 RAISE NOFO that allows the Department to consider advance
payments on a case-by-case basis for recipients who cannot complete a
project on a reimbursement structure, though we recommend this
information be available in the original NOFO going forward and that
this practice be expanded to additional programs.
We value our partnership with the Department and their many best
practices around the IIJA, including:
Allowing for advance repayment in some cases in FY 2024
RAISE NOFO
Facilitating local planning by providing access to key
information, like opening and closing dates for NOFOs, and allowing for
rolling deadlines and multi-year NOFOs
Reducing administrative and cost burdens for counties by
using templates and ``common applications'' that allow counties to
apply to multiple opportunities using a single application
Engaging rural communities with in-depth program webinars
and other targeted resources
To ensure the IIJA meets its intended goals, federal policymakers
should produce timely, clear criteria and guidance and eliminate
barriers to project delivery.
As discussed, capacity issues and constrained finances are common
at the local level and these factors continue to impact an applicant
throughout the process. Should a small or rural county overcome the
odds to receive a federal grant, the subsequent reporting requirements
associated with 2 CFR Part 200 are extremely long and complex and
likely too onerous to comply with.
While the IIJA significantly increased the number of competitive
programs counties can apply to, it did not change how programs are
fundamentally structured. This means that the same reporting
requirements that previously applied to more sophisticated entities,
like state DOTs, now apply to much smaller entities, like rural
counties. Like consultant costs, this can prevent eligible entities
from pursuing federal programs that could otherwise benefit local
communities.
True for all recipients of federal infrastructure funds, confusing,
complex and unnecessary regulations can make implementing an award just
as challenging as competing for the opportunity. When counties are
successful, we need responsive federal partners who produce timely and
clear guidance that enshrines local flexibility. Federal guidance and
regulations should not inhibit flexibility or prescribe to state and
local governments how to spend awards.
To ensure compliance, local governments rely on direction from our
federal partners, such as OMB's Build America, Buy America
implementation guidance and instructions from USDOT's modal
administrations, such as the Federal Highway Administration. County
officials urge our federal partners to avoid being overly prescriptive
in crafting guidance and other resources, instead focusing on issuing
clear directives that grant maximum flexibility.
Federal permitting requirements can also make competitive grant
programs unattractive for applicants interested in carrying out simple
projects that can erroneously trigger environmental reviews even when
they are categorically excluded. Streamlining the federal permitting
process is a longstanding priority of local governments, who bear the
costs of unnecessary delays created by the decades-old process
established under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA/P.L. 91-
190).
NEPA must be tailored to meet its actual goal of protecting the
environment and not its unintended consequence of delaying and
sometimes even preventing the delivery of critical infrastructure for
our residents, including after natural disasters. Unintended
consequences resulting from the current NEPA process continue to
degrade county budgets and delay even the simplest of projects that
have little to no impact on the surrounding environment, such as
sidewalk repair projects in an existing right-of-way (ROW). While
categorical exclusions (CEs) are intended to address projects like
this, in practice they may be disregarded for fear of litigation or
other reasons, forcing a county to undergo the same process it would
have without the exclusion.
Confusing matters further for local recipients, interpretations of
CEs vary from agency to agency. From the Stafford Act (P.L. 100-707) to
the IIJA, federal legislation is interpreted and implemented
differently between its own agencies and regions. Counties encourage
lawmakers to apply a more uniform and broader approach to expedite
existing infrastructure repairs and improvements, to local standards,
to minimize the impact of delays to the public. Maximizing the
utilization of CEs to include the exemption of road and bridge repairs
and improvements made within the existing, previously disturbed, public
ROW stands to provide tremendous benefits to the public.
Additionally, as strong supporters of the One Federal Decision
(OFD) initiative, counties were pleased to see elements of OFD codified
by the IIJA and furthered in the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA/P.L.
118-5), though we are concerned by the White House Council on
Environmental Quality's most recent rulemaking in response to the FRA,
which threatens to weaken these provisions. The IIJA also improved CEs,
though counties support further increases to these thresholds.
While federal permitting problems are a familiar source of
frustration for local governments, an emerging issue among IIJA awards
has become more pointed: the time it takes to execute a grant
agreement. Counties and other eligible entities are reporting
unprecedented timelines of up to 24 months, compounding the effects of
permitting delays by further degrading federal and local investments
and slowing down the delivery of critical projects. Counties strongly
encourage USDOT to address this issue.
The county message is simple: get grant funds out as quickly as
possible to the communities where they are needed most. In the current
economic environment, construction materials are extremely expensive,
and delays can result in unmanageable project cost increases.
Inflation, combined with the four-year expiration date on most USDOT
funds, can have disastrous consequences for the IIJA's investments.
Conclusion
In closing, I hope it has become evident that the safety and
operability of county owned roads and bridges cannot continue to rely
upon competitive funding opportunities. Counties urge you to provide a
guaranteed funding source in the next surface transportation
reauthorization.
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and distinguished members of
the Committee, thank you again for your attention to this important
matter and the opportunity to testify before you today. America's
counties greatly appreciate your continued bipartisan efforts to
strengthen America's infrastructure.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you. Next up is Mr. Chuck
Baker, who is the president of the American Short Line and
Regional Railroad Association.
Mr. Baker, 5 minutes.
TESTIMONY OF CHUCK BAKER, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN SHORT LINE AND
REGIONAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION
Mr. Baker. Thank you. On behalf of the Nation's 600 Class
II and III small business freight railroads, commonly known as
short lines, thank you for the opportunity to be here today.
The short line industry exists to preserve rail lines that
would otherwise have been at risk of abandonment. These lines
were expensive to maintain, didn't have much traffic, and were
generally unprofitable and unloved by their previous owners.
After the Staggers Act of 1980 allowed them to be sold to local
entrepreneurs instead of abandoned, the new short line owners
focused on customer service, business development, running a
low-cost operation, and trying to scrounge up the funds to
rehabilitate the infrastructure. Overall, this has worked quite
well, and it's generally considered an American success story.
We now support 478,000 jobs and 10,000 businesses nationwide.
To keep that infrastructure functional, we invest up to
one-third of our revenues in it, which makes short line
railroading one of the most capital-intensive industries in the
country. I know many members of this committee have visited
your local short lines and have heard from customers about how
important rail service is to their business. If you haven't
made it out yet, we are happy to facilitate.
Short lines partner closely with everyone in their
community--shippers, economic development offices, and local
and Federal officials--which brings me to the subject of
Federal grants. We are proud to work closely with Congress and
the U.S. DOT in strengthening the country's rail network.
Federal grant funding helps our industry advance the goals we
all share: improving safety, creating economic opportunities,
supporting well-paying jobs, ensuring an efficient supply
chain, defending America's freight network from malicious
actors, and harnessing the environmental benefits of moving
freight by rail.
The key Federal grant program for short lines is the FRA's
CRISI program. More than $12 billion is needed to allow short
lines to fully modernize our infrastructure and meet the
country's freight needs. In 2015, Congress recognized this and
created the CRISI program and then built upon it in the 2021
Infrastructure Law, giving it guaranteed appropriations.
The program also has a clear safety mission. Each dollar of
CRISI rebuilding work helps prevent derailments, given that the
leading cause of derailments on short lines is simply old,
worn-out track. Because we partner with U.S. DOT on CRISI,
Railroad Crossing Elimination, INFRA, RAISE, and PIDP, we have
insight into ways the grant process can be improved, and I will
highlight a few of those now.
One, we support robust, permanent staffing at the FRA so
they can develop subject matter expertise and advance NOFOs,
selections, and project execution more quickly through the
pipeline.
Two, we urge Congress to protect CRISI's ability to address
the needs of freight rail. There are some efforts to expand
CRISI eligibility to include commuter rail. We oppose this. We
do partner with commuter rail and passenger rail and call them
friends, but they can already avail themselves of other sizable
funding streams that are closed off to short lines. There was
$66 billion dedicated to rail in the infrastructure bill; $58
billion of that was set aside for passenger rail, $3 billion
for at-grade separations, and $5 billion for CRISI. Given that,
we do think it would be OK for CRISI to focus a bit more
heavily on freight in the future.
Three, the FRA should ensure that small freight rail
projects continue to receive fair consideration, and that a few
larger projects don't blot out the sun, taking finite resources
away from smaller dollar but highly impactful short line
projects.
Four, provide predictable, regular grant application timing
and confidence in the amount of funding available. This means
that Congress can encourage the FRA to stick to regular, annual
timing on a given grant program, that Federal agencies should
just run 1 year of funding at a time, rather than combining
NOFOs and creating a lumpier program, and Congress should
continue to provide advance appropriations like it did in IIJA,
which has been a real game changer for predictability and
planning.
And five, streamline processes such as NEPA, which can
needlessly delay important projects that clearly won't have any
meaningful environmental impact.
Grants can be a huge help, but I do have to note a few
challenges that may underline some of those gains.
California now has a misguided environmental rule on the
books that means some short lines would ``be eliminated'' due
to the cost of proposed regulations, and that is CARB's words,
not mine. It's especially galling, considering how beneficial
for the environment it is to move goods by rail. EPA is now
reviewing a waiver request from California to allow them to
advance this rule, which we hope that they reject.
We are also braced for an imminent crew size rule from the
FRA that would mandate some of our members hire personnel they
don't need, forcing small railroads who already operate with
tight margins to invest limited resources in the wrong places.
We hope to continue working with this committee to overcome
those challenges, just as we worked so well together to advance
investments into short line rail infrastructure. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Chuck Baker, President, American Short Line and
Regional Railroad Association
Introduction
As president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association (ASLRRA), the trade association representing the more than
600 Class II and III freight railroads (commonly known as short line
railroads or short lines) and hundreds of suppliers that make up the
country's short line freight rail economy, I appreciate the opportunity
provide testimony for this hearing.
The short line industry is a great American success story, and
members of the industry are tremendously proud of their vital role in
the country's economy. I look forward to discussing that story as I
answer your questions, especially how competitive federal grant
opportunities have bolstered our industry's ability to serve customers
in the thousands of rural and urban communities where we operate, to
drive local economies forward, and to increase the fluidity and
efficiency of the national freight rail network and the overall supply
chain. We appreciate this committee's focus on providing successful
grant programs and ensuring they are efficient and properly
administered. We look forward to continuing to work with you on this
topic as well as advancing smart, sensible and bipartisan goals we all
share, like improving safety throughout the transportation network,
creating economic opportunities and supporting well-paying jobs,
ensuring an efficient supply chain, and harnessing the very real
environmental benefits of moving freight by rail.
The Short Line Freight Rail Industry
Short line railroads and the national network. Short lines have
been serving customers for well over a century and occupy a significant
place in the country's freight supply chain network. Short lines are
small businesses: the typical short line employs about 30 people,
operates about 80 route miles, and earns about $8 million in revenue
per year. Our significance is not our size but who and where short
lines serve. For large areas of rural and small-town America, short
lines are the only connection to the national rail network. As Caren
Kraska, president and chairman of the Arkansas & Missouri Railroad in
Arkansas and Missouri and who appeared before this committee three
years ago would say, ``For our grain, animal feed, frozen poultry and
other shippers, you can't get there from here without short line
service.'' Our industry's first-mile/last mile service touches one in
five railcars on the national rail system, ensuring that businesses in
small towns and rural communities have access to markets across the
country and to the ports that reach global markets.
Short lines' history and investment needs. The short line industry
as we know it is the product of the Staggers Act of 1980, which made
the sale or long-term lease of light-density lines from Class I
railroads to local entrepreneurs possible, thankfully avoiding the
abandonment of those lines and the ripping up of their track for scrap.
These lines were spun off from Class I networks for a reason: they
faced high hurdles to continued business operations, were burdened with
decades of deferred maintenance, and often had few customers. To bring
these businesses back from the brink, these small railroads focused
like a laser on world class customer service, relentlessly marketed the
service and knocked on every door they could find, and frequently spend
up to a third of their annual gross revenues on maintenance and
improvements, making short line railroading one of the most capital-
intensive industries in the country. Despite the challenges, the short
line industry has emerged as a great American success story. Short
lines have revived those marginal lines they inherited, turned them
into thriving enterprises that preserve service for thousands of
customers and jobs for thousands of employees, and emerged as a pivotal
link in the economy. Short lines now manage one-third of the freight
rail network and touch one-fifth of all carloads while still only
accounting for six percent of the freight rail industry's total
revenue. Short lines are prevalent in the districts represented by
members of this committee, and I know many of you have visited those
properties over the years and have heard from short line customers
about how important rail service is to their businesses.
Short lines are economic engines for localities, particularly
small-town and rural America. Together, our members are tied to an
estimated 478,000 jobs nationwide, $26.1 billion in labor income and
$56.2 billion in economic value-add--providing a service that 10,000
businesses nationwide rely upon to get goods and products to market.\1\
Our members ship all types of commodities and serve industries
essential to our country's economic health--like the manufacturing,
agricultural, energy, and chemical sectors that are particularly
reliant on short line service. The availability of rail service
provided by short lines is often the tipping point for manufacturers
and shippers in deciding where to grow and expand, driving new, well-
paying jobs particularly in rural and small-town America where job
creation is often the most difficult. Short lines proved their
flexibility during the pandemic, responding to customers' and the
nation's needs.

Short Line Railroad Industry, prepared by PwC for ASLRRA (2018) (``PwC
report'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short lines' personnel live and work in the communities they serve.
Short lines are managed and staffed by individuals who are part of the
fabric of their local communities. Because short lines run relatively
short distances, employees live near their job--and their customers.
This local focus makes for a strong customer orientation, greatly
reinforced by the fact that the loss of one primary customer on a short
line can easily make the difference between a successful operation and
severe financial difficulties. Many short lines are family-run
businesses--providing safe, efficient, flexible, and cost-effective
service is personal to them.
Short lines are environmental stewards. The freight rail industry
is inherently a sustainable, environmentally friendly mode of
transportation. No other surface mode of freight transportation comes
close to the efficiency of a steel wheel on a steel rail. U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data show freight railroads
account for only 0.6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and
only 2.1 percent of transportation-related sources. On average, freight
railroads move one ton of freight 480 miles on a single gallon of
diesel fuel, approximately four times as far as our over-the-road
competition. Short line service alone keeps 31.8 million heavy trucks
off highways and public roads, saving lives, preventing costly wear and
tear on the roads, and relieving congestion, in addition to improving
our air quality. Short lines are committed to doing their part and then
some to help the environment, by working to move more heavy freight off
trucks and onto trains and continuously seeking ways to reduce their
environmental impact with the implementation of technology and
operating practices that reduce emissions.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ ASLRRA is currently partnering with the FRA and short line
railroads to test locomotive emissions by studying fuel injectors and
additives. Products like these that increase fuel economy may also
yield emissions benefits. This is a two-year project that will give
ASLRRA a better understanding of how small railroads can utilize cost
effective methods for reducing their impact on the environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Lines and Federal Grant Opportunities
Competitive federal grants are critical for strengthening the short
line rail network. In 2015, Congress recognized the outstanding
rebuilding needs of the short line industry and acted, creating the
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI)
program. Congress wisely made Class II and Class III short line
railroads directly eligible recipients of competitive funds. Since the
first CRISI grants were awarded in 2017, short lines have used CRISI
program resources to replace track and crossties, add and extend
sidings, rehabilitate bridges, improve drainage and roadbeds, replace
rail and upgrade and replace motive power, among many other
investments. An important achievement of many of these projects has
been to enable these lines to handle the industry-standard 286,000-
pound railcars, ensuring national network interoperability. With
federal grant support, short lines have revitalized significant
sections of the rail network, allowing for greater volume of service,
elimination of bottlenecks, and reduction of congestion as well as
harnessing the significant environmental benefits of moving freight by
rail. Perhaps most important, every dollar invested in improving rail
infrastructure is a dollar invested in rail safety.
Below are a few examples from previous rounds of CRISI awards:
An $8 million CRISI award in FY2022 in Missouri will fund
the rehabilitation of 52 miles of Missouri Eastern Railroad track in a
rural area, increasing operational safety and capacity and making the
infrastructure more resilient to future flooding events.
The state of Washington received a $73 million CRISI
award for an ambitious rural project to upgrade short line railroad
infrastructure, improving the infrastructure of all three branches of
the Palouse River & Coulee City Rail System, operated by three
different short lines. This project will improve the weight capacity of
the lines, increase track speeds, and enhance resiliency to weather
events such as flooding. Another CRISI award in the state will enable
the replacement of two older diesel switching locomotives with zero-
emission battery electric models by Tacoma Rail.
A $7 million CRISI award will fund track rehabilitation
and bridge replacement on the Texas North Western Railroad in a rural
area of the northern Panhandle of Texas. This project will improve
safety and enable the railroad to handle industry-standard 286,000-
pound railcars and larger modern locomotives, which are important
benefits for the agricultural shippers served by this line.
Even with these vital investments made to date, our industry
estimates more than $12 billion is still needed to allow short line
railroads to fully modernize and meet the country's freight needs.\3\
Of course, the ultimate beneficiaries of railroad infrastructure
improvements are short line shippers, and they will tell you that the
benefits are real and substantial. We have collected and will continue
to collect shipper accounts in this regard and have attached to this
testimony a national cross section of comments from those who
benefitted from CRISI projects. (See attached addendum.) These are but
a sample selection, but collectively they demonstrate the importance of
these projects from the front lines of local economic activity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ PWC report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not just CRISI. Other federal grant opportunities can also
have an outsized impact on our members' ability to serve their
customers. Short lines work with public entities to access these other
important programs, including the Railroad Crossing Elimination program
(RCE), which recently made a $2 million dollar award to fund a planning
project to eliminate three busy railroad highway at-grade crossings in
Kansas City. Similarly, the RCE program provided $37 million for the
first phase of the West Belt Improvement Project that will create a
sealed corridor along a line of the Houston Belt & Terminal Railroad,
replacing seven busy at-grade crossings with vehicle underpasses. And
there are other programs, like the Nationally Significant Multimodal
Freight and Highway Projects program (INFRA), the National
Infrastructure Project Assistance program (Mega), the Rebuilding
American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) program,
the Rural Surface Transportation grant program, and the Port
Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP). CRISI remains the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA )program with the broadest
eligibility for almost all types of short line projects and the one
easiest for small railroads to access.
IIJA bolstered competitive grant opportunities for short line
railroads. In 2021, Congress passed the IIJA, recognizing many unmet
needs facing our national rail network and parts of the nation's
transportation system.
CRISI. IIJA dramatically expanded CRISI's scale,
providing advance appropriations of $1 billion per year for five years
and authorizing up to an additional $1 billion per year. An emphasis on
eligibility for upgrading locomotives to achieve significant reductions
in emissions was also added to the statute. We strongly urge Congress
to continue working to meet this vision, appropriating the full
authorized $1 billion in each fiscal year. We appreciate the leadership
of everyone on this committee who has fought for strong funding levels,
as those have been reflected in some recent spending bills.
+ Fiscal Year 2022's budget law brought the first full year of
IIJA's implementation--and, with it, new and significant investments in
short line freight rail projects. The Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) selected 47 projects that were advanced by short line railroads
or short line partners. These projects improved safety, strengthened
network efficiency for shippers, further minimized short line rail's
environmental footprint, and built new economic opportunities, many in
rural areas and small towns across the country. Of these, 13 projects
included grade crossing safety and trespassing mitigation elements. 14
projects invested $300 million to upgrade track to move industry-
standard railcars weighing up to 286,000-pounds. Twenty projects
upgraded or repaired bridges. Six short line projects upgraded or
replaced more than 30 locomotives, which will result in significant
reductions in emissions. In all, short line projects in 48 states have
received awards via CRISI.
+ Fiscal Year 2023's budget agreement was a continued show of
strong, bipartisan support for the CRISI program and a testament to all
in Congress who back this important effort. In carrying out the
spending legislation and IIJA, we understand FRA plans to announce a
funding opportunity in the coming weeks that would provide nearly $2.4
billion for competition. This will combine Fiscal Year 2023
discretionary funds and advance appropriations with Fiscal Year 2024
advance funds. Short lines are absolutely thrilled by the opportunity
to continue putting forward smart, resourceful and competitive grant
applications, and partnering with FRA and states, localities and
communities nationwide to bolster the country's freight rail backbone.
+ Fiscal Year 2024's budget agreement--now swiftly on its way to
becoming law--continues the important, bipartisan work of providing
additional funding for CRISI beyond the guaranteed advance
appropriation. The overall CRISI funding amount in the deal, while not
at the level that Congress funded for the first two years of IIJA and
disappointingly below the initial levels produced in either the House
or the Senate, is still appreciated and reflects tough choices Congress
must make. Of course, we think funding CRISI at the highest level is
very compelling, and ASLRRA looks forward to working with this panel,
the Appropriations Committee and your colleagues in Congress to ensure
CRISI gets the resources it needs so it can keep investing in the many
rural and urban communities represented by the entire panel today.
Other critical programs at USDOT (RCE, INFRA, Mega,
RAISE, Rural Surface Transportation, and PIDP, among others): CRISI was
not the only meaningful improvement in IIJA, so too were several other
major programs that received significant new resources. While short
lines are not directly eligible applicants in these programs, short
lines have successfully partnered with other entities to advance key
program goals. For example, in the recently announced INFRA and Mega
awards, short lines and their customers stand to benefit from sizeable
awards for bridge replacements and major upgrades in and around several
busy ports. In advancing rail-related projects, U.S. Department of
Transportation (USDOT) recognized rail's ability to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions when there is a modal shift in moving freight via rail
instead of truck.
+ RCE: IIJA took an especially important step forward for rail
safety with the creation of the new Railroad Crossing Elimination (RCE)
Program. This is a tremendous policy achievement, providing new
resources to eliminate dangerous crossings. Moreover, the creation of
this as a separate new program allowed CRISI to focus on tackling even
more rail safety challenges. For example, CRISI--with the robust
funding levels unleashed in IIJA--can now advance even more projects
like repairing worn-out track, the leading cause of derailments on
Class II and III railroads. While short line railroads are not directly
eligible for RCE grants, ASLRRA has encouraged its members interested
in advancing an RCE project to coordinate with eligible public
applicants. In the most recent round of awards announced in June 2023,
of the 63 projects funded, ten involved Class II or III railroads--or
about $72 million of the $573 million in awards. We understand the
funding notice for Fiscal Year 2023 funds will be released in the
coming months, and we are excited about any possibilities for this
program to help address crossing safety in the communities we serve. We
urge Congress to keep momentum for this program going strong as it
makes funding decisions for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026 and beyond,
providing as much in resources as possible beyond the guaranteed
appropriations already set in IIJA.
More resources may be needed by short lines to face new challenges.
Earlier this year, a new rule went on the books in California that
threatens to impose drastic new financial obligations on short line
railroads. Implementing the rule, the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) even admits some short lines ``would be eliminated'' due to
``the costs of the Proposed Regulation'' (emphasis added).\4\ Should
this rule stand (and even worse proliferate nationwide) and California
be granted the inappropriate waiver that it has requested from the EPA,
short lines would require ever more resources to ensure they can make
investments in their network while simply trying to keep their business
afloat. We calculate that this rule could force California short lines
to try to make nearly half a billion dollars in motive power fleet
investments over only a few years. That would be a steep change by
multiple orders of magnitude above historical short line locomotive
capital investment levels. We expect the next round of the CRISI
program will see several applications for funding for locomotive
projects from California short lines as they attempt to respond to this
huge and problematic unfunded mandate.

Short Lines' Perspective and Suggested Reforms:
CRISI and Other Grant Programs
The administration's efforts to advance CRISI and other programs of
importance have been commendable: USDOT's team has been collaborative,
dedicated and consistently willing to engage and ensure short line
stakeholders are informed. Likewise, Congress has been very eager to
collaborate and work in a bipartisan way to strengthen CRISI and other
programs important to short lines. While ASLRRA and the short line
industry are ever appreciative of the commitment from Congress and the
administration to CRISI and other programs that invest in the rail
network, there are areas where continued diligence is especially
necessary and otherwise where these programs can be further
strengthened or improved.
Protect CRISI's ability to bolster the freight rail network. ASLRRA
strongly discourages set-asides within CRISI for passenger rail
projects or expansions of the program to include major new eligible
applicants such as commuter railroads. With so many challenges facing
our supply chain, short lines ought to remain viable competitors for
these limited funds. While we have no opposition to passenger rail,
IIJA already provides Amtrak and passenger rail applicants with a
massive amount of funding, well beyond what is available through
CRISI.\5\ Likewise, commuter rail already has access to substantial,
well-established, and dedicated funding programs administered through
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), such as formula funding and
the Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program. Commuter entities are also
eligible for department-wide competitive grant programs, like Mega and
RAISE, and federal loan programs such as RRIF, another federal funding
source utilized in the past to support Amtrak service. It would be
unfair, unnecessary and against Congressional intent reflected in IIJA
to divert limited funds that would otherwise be open to short lines
toward passenger and commuter rail activities that have so many other
federal programs that they may access.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Fiscal Year 2023 passenger rail funding includes funds for
Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor ($1.1 billion authorized, $1.2
billion in advance appropriations), which could benefit commuter rail;
Amtrak's national network ($2.2 billion authorized, $3.2 billion in
advance appropriations), and the Federal-State Partnership for
Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program ($1.5 billion authorized and
$7.2 billion in advance appropriations).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensure flexibility in size of awards. ASLRRA encourages grant-
making agencies to recognize that a series of smaller awards spread
across a diversity of smaller railroad projects can have the same, if
not more, positive impact as an award to a single major corridor. While
short lines' experience on this front is largely CRISI-related, it
applies to all grants. While larger projects understandably appear an
easier way to deploy CRISI funding, this needs to be balanced with the
realization that small railroads by nature will often have smaller
projects, however no less important to the communities they serve.
Upcoming FY23/24 CRISI NOFO: Avoid preference for high-
dollar projects: ASLRRA's concern is especially prominent in the CRISI
space as FRA will soon unveil the combined FY23/FY24 funding
opportunity. We understand that FRA plans to release a very sizeable
funding opportunity for CRISI in late March 2024. Short lines are
confident they will continue to put forward competitive projects
nationwide. ASLRRA is, however, concerned that the massive amount of
funding in the NOFO could be challenging to administer and could lead
to decisionmakers choosing a handful of higher dollar projects instead
of a perhaps larger number of small dollar applications. Just a few
large-scale passenger rail projects could easily consume most funding
available. This dilemma is exacerbated by the timeline we understand
FRA has set for itself to announce awards, which would be around
October. Having so little time to award such a large amount of funding
could lead to difficulties in giving the expected large amounts of
short line-related applications proper, equitable review. In other
words, the NOFO could attract many applications for very large projects
from large project sponsors, and potentially be inadvertently tilted
against making smaller projects and rural awards as big of a portion of
CRISI as they have been seen in past cycles. It is important for CRISI
to be balanced, not only geographically but also on the size of the
project. Congress could, for example, include report language in an
appropriations measure encouraging FRA to continue their past (and very
much appreciated) practice of supporting many small project awards, and
clearly communicating that intent in the upcoming NOFO and their public
engagement materials.
Ensure realistic match requirements. We understand there may appear
to be rationale at times to favor grant applications that ``over-
match,'' or that pay more of their cost share than necessary, but this
could come at the serious detriment of important short line projects
that simply cannot provide an overmatch in funds. We appreciate efforts
to ensure recognition of this, and, furthermore, to help level the
playing field and provide a significant federal cost share for
applicants with smaller projects, in rural areas, and with severely
limited resources for any sort of match, much less the resources needed
for major upgrades of expensive supply chain infrastructure.
Ensure sufficient opportunities to compete. We generally discourage
efforts to limit state departments of transportation in the number of
grant submissions they are allowed in a round of funding. For programs
that short lines cannot directly apply for, short lines must partner
with other entities to advance rail investments. Limits in the
application number can force pre-application competition between
smaller short line projects and other major projects, often putting the
smaller project at a disadvantage. We appreciate efforts to ensure that
short lines are not inadvertently restrained in project opportunities.
We further appreciate efforts to ensure that in programs like CRISI,
short line projects are not at any disadvantage simply because they are
made by the railroad directly.
Advance transparency wherever possible. We encourage efforts to
make more of the application process open and public to ensure
applicants--including future potential applicants--gain clarity that
can facilitate their project development and future application
efforts.
Provide consistent and more detailed explanation of awarded CRISI
grants. With the announcement of CRISI awarded projects, ASLRRA
recommends FRA release a robust explanation of each award. This should
include high level financial metrics of the project (total cost, CRISI
award, amounts and sources of matching funds), scope of work,
environmental readiness, and proposed grant project performance
metrics. In the initial CRISI awards associated with FY22, announced in
2023, FRA made a good step forward in this by consistently posting the
matching funds to the award. Continuing enrichment of this information
in a reasonable way will take some of the pressure off debriefing on
unsuccessful applications and provide clearer understanding of why
specific projects were awarded CRISI funding.
Aim for regularity in calendar of grant application timing. We
strongly support efforts to bring predictability to the timing of
funding opportunities and application cycles, i.e., knowing when each
year's application window generally opens and closes--like a football
season. While we understand the outside forces that can lead to highly
variable application windows, knowing generally when to expect a
funding window is critical for short line railroads and other small
businesses, who could use this certainty to ensure they are ready and
able to put their best and most competitive foot forward in the
application process.
Advance appropriations = predictability. IJJA's provision of
advance appropriations was a significant game changer; ASLRRA strongly
encourages Congress to include similar advance appropriations in future
reauthorization bills so that grant-making agencies can move forward
with funding opportunities regardless of year-to-year political
dynamics, giving short lines and other small businesses the ability to
plan for funding rounds. Government investment in long-term
infrastructure is much more effective if all stakeholders can
realistically plan for it--unpredictable, highly variable funding is an
inefficient way to invest finite resources.
Continue to build out USDOT and FRA's monitoring and reporting of
grants status. We appreciate FRA's effort to provide critical
information on grant program activity, such as FRA's Fiscal Year 2022
CRISI, Fed-State Partnership, RCE, and Restoration & Enhancement Grants
Reports, as required by Congress. These reports provide useful, high-
level reporting of the progress of grant awards by program and fiscal
year through achievement of obligation and closeout. We encourage
efforts like these to include more information on individual projects
and performance obligations. This data will support development of
enhanced performance objectives for the CRISI program and other
programs, improving the exchange of relevant data with Congress for
performance monitoring and oversight.
Support FRA staffing, engagement, and outreach needs. ASLRRA
appreciates USDOT's efforts to engage with stakeholders like the short
line rail community. These efforts, both before and after the
submission of grant applications, whether at a high level of detail or
deep into the weeds of application details, greatly improve the project
development process. We appreciate these efforts, and we recognize they
require precious time. We support efforts to provide permanent staffing
at stable funding levels and for all levels of program managers,
administrators, and other experts, especially on complicated
environmental matters. Permanent staffing signifies proper resourcing
to establish a stable core of civil servants to handle the myriad tasks
associated with grant programs management. This should be a workforce
that develops significant subject matter expertise and consistent
practices and procedures. Ideally this workforce should be authorized
and funded reliably over time, as contrasted with approaches that might
seek to use ``takedowns'' that can fluctuate from year to year or those
that might encourage heavy use of contracted support services.
Streamline and standardize processes where possible. In reviewing
applications, we encourage efforts to improve technical analysis
processes at FRA and throughout USDOT. We suggest a review effort in
which applicants simply provide structured inputs for technical
analysis, with the review process using a standardized process to
analyze these inputs. This will provide multiple benefits: remove
variances on how projected project outcomes are valued in the
application, provide a clear basis of expectations for project
performance if an award is made, and ease processing of applications.
Likewise, we encourage USDOT--whether in CRISI, RCE or other programs--
to only require information mandated by the program's governing
statutes; requiring applicants to put forward additional, extraneous
information can be unduly burdensome on time-starved entities. After
awards are announced, short line grant winners consistently express
frustration with the time it takes from the announcement of an award to
the execution of a grant agreement and actual project work beginning.
We recognize FRA aims to move quickly, and we encourage any efforts to
streamline this process through standardized agreement templates. We
also encourage efforts to improve and simplify the Benefit-Cost
Analysis (BCA) process for grant applicants, ensuring they are as
straightforward as possible and only required when truly necessary.
Improve elements of the NEPA process. Short lines are an
environmentally beneficial means to move goods and freight. We
encourage efforts to ensure National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
requirements reflect this sustainable way to move freight and do not
undermine it.
Specifically, we believe there could be room within USDOT's NEPA
implementing regulations to expand definitions of selected categorical
exclusions (CEs) without risking significant environmental impacts. One
area is for bridge rehabilitation projects and for construction of
smaller railroad facilities. The definitions for these CEs have some
fixed elements--such as ground coverage and watercourse definitions--
that could be adjusted to grant the agency more discretion and
flexibility to make its class of action determination. The definitions
built into these CEs have arbitrary elements that can force certain
projects into costlier and more time-consuming environmental
assessments that may not be justified by the environmental impacts of
the project. We encourage USDOT and FRA to explore their regulations in
this area and seek to increase their flexibility.
We appreciate the efforts of USDOT, and especially FRA, to continue
to standardize their NEPA review procedures and to improve the guidance
and documentation they provide to grant applicants. Clarifying guidance
documentation that is unclear or may cause confusion is helpful, as is
the provision of clearer guidance on analyses and permitting
requirements associated with different environmental impact areas.
Examples of environmental impact area analyses products or awarded
permits can be especially helpful to applicants and awardees that are
new to NEPA. NEPA compliance is a complex topic. By providing clarity
for applicants on exactly what needs to be done and when during pre-
and post-award periods, there could be fewer delays in getting to grant
agreement.
Build America, Buy America. As recipients of federal funds,
ASLRRA's members are keenly interested in requirements regarding the
production of materials used in construction. We appreciate any efforts
to ensure that these mandates come with the recognition that they may
be exceedingly difficult to satisfy, and thus the waiver process should
be fast, fair and efficient.
Conclusion
ASLRRA appreciates the committee's close attention to the items we
have noted in our statement, and we welcome future opportunities to
work together on these matters.

TESTIMONY OF AMY O'LEARY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOUTHEAST
MICHIGAN COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, and members of the committee for the opportunity to
testify today.
SEMCOG is a regional planning agency serving almost 5
million people in the 7-county area of Metro Detroit. We are a
local government association with over 180 members that are
cities, villages, townships, and counties. As a metropolitan
planning organization, SEMCOG is responsible for ensuring data-
driven, efficient use of the transportation funds. This
includes development of a long-range transportation plan for
our complex system of roads, bridges, transit, nonmotorized
transportation, and freight. We also develop and manage the
current list of federally funded road projects, which, for 2023
through 2026, totals $5.8 billion in Federal funds.
Discretionary funds have made a significant difference in
our region, which can be described in three buckets.
Bucket 1 involves emerging issues and current challenges.
Our best example is Safe Streets For All grants. While we were
making progress on road safety prior to the pandemic, we
experienced a spike in fatalities during and post-pandemic.
Safety is one of several issues best understood and addressed
at the local level, which is why we have advocated for the
direct funding to MPOs, cities, and counties.
SEMCOG proactively adopted a data-driven safety plan, and
the award of over $10 million will help us put this plan into
action via safety audits on our high-injury roads and quick-
build safety pilot projects.
In addition to SEMCOG's grant, communities in our region
received over $80 million, including construction funds awarded
to the cities of Detroit and Dearborn.
Due to the immense need to improve transportation safety
nationwide, we would encourage considering a formula program in
the future.
The second bucket of discretionary funds is focused on
innovation, and the PROTECT Grant Program focuses on innovation
and resiliency. Like many parts of the country, we have
experienced an increase in extreme weather and flooding. SEMCOG
works to find solutions, including developing a nationally
recognized flood risk tool and coming up with updated current
and future precipitation estimates with our experts. This work
sets us apart and makes us ready to develop an actionable
transportation resiliency improvement plan under PROTECT. This
funding will accelerate the implementation of projects to
manage these flooding events by identifying the best locations
and the best techniques that we should be using.
Another innovative program is the Reconnecting Communities
Grant, which provides funding to address the physical barriers
due to dividing communities and neighborhoods from important
services due to highways. In partnership with the State of
Michigan, our region received $21 million in the city of Oak
Park, which is divided in half by I-696. With significant
disadvantaged populations, the project will provide access to
local businesses and schools by foot and improve connectivity.
The third bucket of discretionary funds is for large
projects which exceed the scope of formula funding, including
INFRA and RAISE. Innovate Mound in Macomb County received $98
million through this program to reconstruct 9 miles of road to
support economic development in the State's defense corridor. A
$104 million INFRA grant will help to reconnect one of
Detroit's once predominantly Black and economically strong
neighborhoods that was divided by highway construction. The
reconstruction of I-375 will convert a sunken freeway to a
lower speed surface-level boulevard. The third project is a $24
million investment through the Railroad Crossing Elimination
Grant Program for a grade separation in the city of Monroe.
This critical project will improve response time for emergency
vehicles and increase safety.
Finally, I would like to mention the critical roles regions
play in pursuing these discretionary funds. One way we assist
is by applying for the funds on behalf of our local
communities, and then passing those dollars through to our
communities. We also assist by convening meetings with
community leaders and developing partnerships to determine the
most strategic way to pursue the grants and which grants to
pursue.
Regions play a key role for frustrated communities who
don't have the capacity or resources to apply. In response to
these frustrations, we partnered with the State of Michigan's
Infrastructure Office, who developed a program to write grants
and provide match through a vetted process.
I would like to conclude by thanking members of the
committee and acknowledging the important role that regions do
play in providing much of the needed fund that helps us do our
job and improve the lives of our residents. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Amy O'Leary, Executive Director, Southeast
Michigan Council of Governments
Introduction--SEMCOG--Southeast Michigan Council of Governments
Thank you Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of
the Committee for the opportunity to testify today.
My name is Amy O'Leary, and I serve as the Executive Director of
SEMCOG, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. SEMCOG is a
regional planning agency serving almost 5 million people in the seven-
county region of Southeast Michigan. Our region is home to 58% of
Michigan's economic activity and nearly half the population. We are
both an association of local governments and a Metropolitan Planning
Organization.
As a local government association or council of governments, SEMCOG
has over 180 members, including counties, cities, villages, townships,
intermediate school districts, and community colleges. We help
facilitate coordinated planning and decision-making to address regional
challenges and opportunities. This includes transportation planning,
environmental stewardship, economic development, and quality-of-life
improvements. By bringing together local governments and agencies,
SEMCOG encourages sustainable growth, transportation infrastructure
development, and preservation of natural resources, ultimately
enhancing the region's overall well-being.
SEMCOG also has numerous federal designations, including
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), water and air quality
planning agency, and Economic Development District for the metropolitan
Detroit region. As the region's MPO, SEMCOG has the responsibility for
ensuring that existing and future expenditures of government funds for
transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing,
cooperative, and comprehensive planning process. This is conducted
through the development and implementation of a long-range
transportation plan. In this capacity, we support coordinated, local
planning with technical data, and intergovernmental resources for the
region's complex transportation system of more than 25,000 miles of
road, 2,900 bridges, 8 fixed-route transit providers, 4,000 miles of
all-season truck routes, 7 commercial marine ports, 34 airports, and 8
international border crossings that account for 36% of the U.S. trade
with Canada. Our current 2023-2026 Transportation Improvement Program
includes $5.8 billion in federally funded road projects, which
represents the success of the federal formula funding program in our
region.
Through our work as the regional planning organization, we support
a regional vision of:
All people in Southeast Michigan benefit from a connected,
thriving region of small towns, dynamic urban centers, active
waterfronts, diverse neighborhoods, premier educational
institutions, and abundant agricultural, recreational, and
natural areas.
Successes and Challenges of Discretionary Programs
Discretionary funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL),
and other federal programs, have been positive for the region,
enhancing our capacity to undertake larger and more diverse
transportation projects and leading to substantial improvements in
local and regional transportation networks. From our experience, the
positive aspects of these funds and programs can be placed into three
broad buckets that allow for new and needed resources for the region
and our communities.
Bucket 1. Discretionary funds that focus on new or emerging issues and
challenges
The best example for our region is the Safe Streets and Roads for
All (SS4A) Grant Program. For metropolitan Detroit, like the rest of
the country, the safety on our roadways for all users is one of our
most pressing issues. While we were making progress in the years
leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a spike in both
fatalities and serious injuries due to crashes on our roadways. This
increase continues post-pandemic, and it highlights needed investments
in enhanced infrastructure, education, policies, and enforcement.
SEMCOG has long advocated for funding to be directly allocated to
MPOs, cities, and counties on transportation issues that are best
understood and addressed at the local levels, and safety is one of
these issues. The goals and priorities of the Safe Streets and Roads
for All Grant Program provide specific and dedicated funding that
previously was unavailable at regional and local levels.
SEMCOG was proactive by adopting a data-driven regional
transportation safety plan, developed through input from all levels of
government, along with stakeholders, advocates, and community
organizations. At the same time, many of our communities have also
developed, or need to develop comprehensive safety plans that direct
limited dollars to the most in-need and impactful locations or
programs.
SEMCOG is thankful to have received over $10 million in SS4A
funding in both rounds of the program. This funding will be utilized to
conduct needed transportation safety audits on our high-injury road
networks, establish quick-build safety infrastructure pilots with an
emphasis on locations in Justice40 Communities, and enhance our
regional public education campaigns. In total, communities in Southeast
Michigan received over $80 million through the first two rounds of this
program, including much-needed implementation and construction funds
for the cities of Detroit and Dearborn. These awards will enhance
safety infrastructure along major corridors for the most vulnerable
road users. Having proactive plans in place in the region benefited our
readiness for these discretionary funds.
While this program and additional funding to address our safety
needs have been successful for the region and our local communities, we
recommend that this funding move from Discretionary to Formula.
Transportation safety is a pressing issue nationwide, and to address it
we need a more reliable and consistent funding source. This is
especially the case in ensuring that the most in need and challenging
roadways can receive and benefit from these funds.
Bucket 2. Discretionary funds that focus on innovation and pilots
Southeast Michigan has experienced several extreme weather events
and flooding disasters--seven FEMA Major Disaster declarations since
2012--which have caused significant and repeated impacts to regional
transportation infrastructure. To begin to address these risks, SEMCOG
has invested in several efforts over the last seven years, including a
Flood Risk Tool, current and future precipitation estimates for the
seven counties in the region, a special interest group to address
stormwater management in the transportation planning process, and a
Regional Resilience Framework as a resource for communities. SEMCOG is
applying for the PROTECT Discretionary Grant Program to build on this
foundation of work and accelerate implementation of equitable, nature-
based resilience strategies across the SEMCOG region, and develop a
Southeast Michigan Regional Resilience Improvement Plan.
The Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods Program is also
impactful to Southeast Michigan. The challenge of transportation
facilities, especially our freeways, is that they often divide
communities and become physical barriers between neighborhoods and
access to core services. While this occurs across the country, it is
especially the case in older cities and metropolitan areas, like
Detroit. One major barrier to accessibility and economic development in
our communities and neighborhoods is I-696. In partnership with the
Michigan Department of Transportation, we were the recipient of a $21
million Reconnecting Communities award for the City of Oak Park, which
is divided in half by I-696. With a significant Orthodox Jewish
community, along with several disadvantaged communities and populations
in the city, the need to access local businesses, schools, places of
worship, and other daily destinations by foot is a necessity. This
award will support a $43 million investment to reconstruct the deck and
plaza over I-696 to ensure residents can safely be connected to vital
destinations.
Bucket 3. Discretionary funds that focus on large projects
The truth is that not every community has an issue or challenge
that these discretionary funds are designed to address, nor are all
communities ready to apply when the funding is made available.
Additionally, there are simply many large, high-expense needs that
traditional and formula funding cannot address. A benefit of some of
the new discretionary programs is that they direct funding to those
communities that are ready or have a specific challenge or need. This
can be seen as a benefit for strategically aligned opportunities,
versus formula funds that go to everyone and in quantities not large
enough for some of the most regionally significant projects and needs.
Three examples of this are the INFRA, RAISE, and Railroad Crossing
Elimination funding programs, which fund large projects that would
unlikely be funded through formula funds or which would only be funded
by several years of pooling funds. In our region, four major projects
have benefited from access to these larger funding amounts.
The first is the Innovate Mound project in the cities of Warren and
Sterling Heights in Macomb County. This project received $98 million
through the INFRA Program, the largest grant ever awarded to a non-
state agency, and is expected to be completed later this year. This
investment, along with funds from Macomb County, both cities, and other
funding sources contributed to the $217 million project. The Mound Road
Corridor is home to more than 47,000 jobs, over $2 billion in earnings,
and national economic drivers such as General Motors, Detroit Arsenal,
the Army's Tank Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), General
Dynamics, and BAE Systems. This project will reconstruct 9 miles of
roadway to support current and future economic development and
Intelligent Transportation Systems, along with improved transit and
nonmotorized facilities.
The reconstruction of I-375 in Detroit from a sunken freeway to a
lower-speed surface level boulevard and grid creates a mobility vision
prioritizing pedestrians and walkable connections. This is another
project that has long been needed, but funding was never available. The
Michigan Department of Transportation received an INFRA grant for $104
million, supporting the $300 million project, to reconnect once-
predominantly Black neighborhoods divided by the highway when it was
built in the 1960s, bulldozing the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley
residential and commercial districts.
Through the RAISE program, the City of Pontiac received a $16
million award to complete and connect one of the region's most popular
trails--the Clinton River Trail--through the city. This project will
increase transportation choices and eliminate gaps through ADA and
universal design improvements in a Justice40 and long disinvestment
neighborhood and community. This is an excellent example of a project
that would have been unlikely to have had the formula funds available
through programs like the Surface Transportation Block Grant or TAP.
The final project is the $24 million federal investment through the
FRA Railroad Elimination Grant Program for the grade separation for the
CSX railroad in the City of Monroe. This critical project will improve
response times for emergency vehicles and increase safety for
pedestrians and motorists.
Transition to Collaboration
While we support the funding made available through these new
discretionary funds, we recognize and represent communities who are
challenged to both understand the funding available and lack the
resources to develop and submit a competitive application. This is a
concern that we've been hearing and echoing over the last two years.
This is where regions come in. We are the connection to our local
communities and one of our main functions is to help line up the
projects with data, information, and funding availability.
1. One way we do this is by applying for grants on behalf of the
region and then passing the funds through to our communities. This is
how our Safe Streets for All project will be administered. This is also
how we've established the region's application for Climate Pollution
Reduction Grant (CPRG) funding through EPA.
2. Regions also convene and partner to ensure we are strategic in
determining the most appropriate entity or entities to apply. This
includes both the alignment of the application to the specific funding
source and the most appropriate entity within the region to apply. For
example, the City of Detroit is applying on behalf of the region for a
CPRG grant, going outside of its geography to apply for hydrogen buses
and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Pulling the appropriate players
together and convening is the role of regions.
3. Regions are a voice for local community concerns and help get
them addressed. We have been a voice for communities that these
applications are expensive and if a goal is to ensure funds make their
way to our most in-need communities, support must be given. The fact of
the matter is that the communities that these programs are
prioritizing, such as Justice40 identified communities, are the same
ones without the resources and capacity to apply. To address this
challenge, SEMCOG partnered with the Michigan Infrastructure Office,
which formed a streamlined program to write grant applications for
communities through a vetted process and has also set aside matching
funds for communities receiving dollars. An example of how this has
thus far been successful, at least in the application phase, is a joint
application submitted for the Thriving Communities Program. Through the
region, we brought together and facilitated an application for three
in-need and underinvested communities--Hamtramck, Warren, and
Ypsilanti. While we are still awaiting notice about this award, the
process of identifying available funding, coordinating with the most
appropriate communities, aligning and funding a grant writing team, and
submitting a competitive application has been a success. This is a sign
of both the strength of regions and the need for additional resources
for our most in-need communities to submit competitive applications.
I would be remiss to not mention the importance and reliance of
formula funding for regions like Southeast Michigan. Regions use the
same data and locally driven approach to successfully implement local
formula programs as well. Three formula programs that our communities
rely on most heavily to make much-needed investments in our
infrastructure are the Surface Transportation Block Grant,
Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP), and the newer Carbon
Reduction Program. While these are formula funds that the region
receives, we've established a competitive process to distribute funds
in which we work directly with communities, provide technical
assistance, and align the eligibility of the programs with the needs of
the community and region. For each program, we've had successful
implementation through strong partnerships at the local, regional, and
state levels. Through the TAP program, we are investing $10 million
annually to build out our regional trail network while also enhancing
our critical safety needs by enhancing crosswalks, closing gaps in our
sidewalk systems, and connecting people to core services and transit
lines.
Recommendations
The array of grant programs under BIL is highly valued by SEMCOG
and our peer regions to address specific local needs, particularly
those that do not align with traditional formula funding parameters.
However, there is a need to balance discretionary and formula funding,
with a particular emphasis on increasing formula funds to ensure
consistent support for foundational planning activities. Discretionary
funding has been pivotal for advancing projects with a strong focus on
equity, environmental sustainability, safety enhancements, and
technological innovation, filling critical gaps left by formula
funding.
We urge simplification of the grant application process, provision
of clearer guidelines, and more flexible match requirements to make
these funds more accessible to all regions and communities, especially
the smaller and less-resourced ones. Additionally, streamlining
processes to reduce delays in procurement and grant agreement
finalization, coupled with efforts to simplify compliance and reporting
protocols, will facilitate smoother project execution. Adopting direct
recipient funding structures, akin to the SS4A program, for other
discretionary grant programs could significantly expedite funding
distribution and reduce administrative delays, enabling streamlined
project implementation.
I would like to conclude by thanking the members of the Committee
for acknowledging the important role of regions and providing much-
needed funding that helps us do our job and improve the lives of our
residents.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. I will now turn it over to the
gentleman from Florida, Mr. Webster, to introduce our next
witness.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Chairman, I appreciate
that. Today, I am honored to introduce the secretary of the
Florida Department of Transportation, the Honorable Jared
Perdue. And I just want to tell you, he is a hard worker. As a
matter of fact, he began his career with the Florida Department
of Transportation, and he is still there, and he has worked his
way through just about every position there is, and learned
much about what we need in Florida, and is a valued asset to
this panel. So, I am appreciative of that.
His leadership roles are known, and he also knows Florida's
transportation better than anybody. And he also knows the
struggles our State has had in facing the implementation of
Federal discretionary grants and how difficult that is.
In addition to graduating from The Citadel with a civil
engineering degree, he also is a family man. He has five
daughters, and we are proud of that. And he is a hard worker,
and he is a motivated public servant, sticking it out with the
Florida Department of Transportation, and we appreciate that.
I am encouraged that Florida is well represented here
today, because it is a large department, and it's one that
needs to be heard from on this very, very important issue.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Thanks for being here, Secretary Perdue. Sorry I missed our
meeting yesterday; I was on the floor. But with that, you are
recognized for 5 minutes.
TESTIMONY OF HON. JARED W. PERDUE, P.E., SECRETARY, FLORIDA
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Perdue. Thank you. Thank you, Congressman Webster, for
the introduction. Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity
to be a part of today's hearing. It truly is an honor, and I
appreciate your commitment to protecting and advocating for our
country's infrastructure.
My name is Jared Perdue. I currently serve as the secretary
for the Florida Department of Transportation. I am a Florida
native, a professional engineer, and have been a public servant
with FDOT my entire 20-year career.
Florida has one of the most diverse transportation
portfolios in the country. FDOT's dedicated team oversees
12,000 miles of roadway, maintains over 7,000 bridges, and has
nearly 7,500 miles of bicycle facilities. Florida is the only
State with four large-hub airports amongst its 19 commercial
airports. Our 15 deepwater seaports are major contributors to
America's supply chain, totaling 4.3 million TEUs in 2023,
which is roughly 10 percent of the Nation's total. Almost 3,000
miles of rail and our 48 transit systems keep our goods and
people moving throughout Florida daily. Finally, Florida leads
the Nation as the fastest growing, most forward-facing State
for space development. In 2023 alone, our Space Coast launched
over 70 rockets.
With our dynamic transportation system, expectations from
our 22 million residents and 137 million annual visitors are
higher than ever before. To help meet those expectations, FDOT
has strong support from Governor DeSantis and our Florida
Legislature, with 76 percent of our budget coming from State
funding, which means 24 percent of our budget is supported by
Federal funding.
Federal dollars come from a combination of measures through
IIJA, including discretionary grants. IIJA serves as a great
example of increasing investment for infrastructure needs
across our country. However, pieces of IIJA are hampering State
flexibility and slowing the delivery of infrastructure to our
communities, specifically through its emphasis on competitive
discretionary grant funding over formula funding.
Under traditional formula funding, States rely on their
calculated apportionment to plan, program, and deliver projects
for their communities. Historically, States have received 90
percent of total surface transportation apportionments in
formula funds. Under IIJA, however, approximately 15 percent of
funding is now being directed to discretionary grant programs,
adversely impacting States who should be receiving more funding
based on population, lane-miles, land mass, or vehicle-miles
traveled. Florida's $500 million in discretionary grant awards
equate to only 1.04 percent of the funding available for
discretionary grants.
Of the formula funding, Florida receives nearly 5 percent
of the apportionment total under IIJA. As a growing State
facing dynamic population and economic growth, Florida would be
better positioned to meet emerging transportation needs through
long-established formula programs. If IIJA funding made 90
percent available in formula funds instead of discretionary
grant funding, Florida would receive an additional $2 billion
over the 5 years of the act.
Since the inception of IIJA, FDOT has set aside resources
totaling over $430 million in the pursuit of discretionary
grant funding at one time or another. While waiting for an
award announcement, this money was not building infrastructure.
Instead, it was waiting to learn if we would be selected.
It's also worth noting that a single quality application
cost approximately $150,000 in fees and staff-hours to develop.
To date, FDOT's total approximate expenditure and application
preparation is more than $5.5 million. I cannot imagine how
difficult it is for smaller State agencies, local governments,
and especially fiscally constrained rural municipalities to
apply for these grants. For these communities, the status quo
seems untenable.
In summary, the current discretionary grant process creates
burdens for transportation providers, arbitrarily picks winners
and losers, and prioritizes political ideologies over physical
infrastructure. Formula allocation of funds is more efficient
and allows States to actually deliver infrastructure that is
specific to their needs and supported by their communities.
FDOT encourages Congress to lay the groundwork for a
transportation authorization that revives stronger formula
funding; encourages U.S. DOT to operate efficiently, not
bureaucratically; rejects the politization of our Nation's
highways; and continues to appropriately increase overall
funding for robust transportation infrastructure across the
country. Our industry is the literal foundation for America's
continued growth and success.
Thank you again for the tremendous opportunity to be here
today, and I look forward to answering any questions you may
have.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Jared W. Perdue, P.E., Secretary, Florida
Department of Transportation
Introduction
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to be a part of today's
hearing. My name is Jared Perdue and I serve as Secretary for the
Florida Department of Transportation. I am a Florida Native, a
professional engineer, and since graduating from the Citadel in 2003,
have been serving my state as an employee of FDOT where we work to
deliver the projects that are funded through the Surface Transportation
Act.
Prior to being appointed by Governor DeSantis as Secretary, I held
various roles throughout the state, most notably as the District
Secretary for Central Florida, where I was responsible for executing
the I-4 Ultimate project--the largest transportation project in Florida
history. However, my perspective is not limited to the high growth
areas of central Florida, Orlando, and the Space Coast, as I began my
career working near my hometown of Panama City, Florida as an engineer
in FDOT's rural panhandle area. I have also served in a wide range of
technical expertise areas including as a geotechnical engineer, Traffic
Operations Engineer, Design Engineer, and Director of Transportation
Development.
My team and I don't just build roads and bridges, we construct and
maintain transportation infrastructure that Florida's 22 million
residents and 135 million visitors can rely on. In Florida, we support
every mode of transportation you can think of--from traditional roads
and bridges, rural roadways, tolled facilities, massive interstate
thoroughfares, freight and passenger rail, deepwater seaports,
international airports, and multi-use trails and bike paths throughout
our world-renowned outdoors. We are even engaged in space commerce and
notably in the emerging advanced air mobility industry, just to name a
few.
Today, I look forward to sharing Florida's perspective on the
current flaws in the development, application, and award of
discretionary grants included within the IIJA. I hope my comments
provide a better pathway for how Congress can work to both fund and
deliver transportation infrastructure throughout our country that saves
time and tax dollars.
Florida: A National Leader in Transportation Infrastructure
It should come as no surprise that Florida is a leader throughout
the transportation landscape. While some states rely heavily on federal
support for maintaining their transportation infrastructure, Florida
does not. In fact, thanks to the leadership of Governor DeSantis, FDOT
is currently managing a $65 billion Five-Year Work Program, 76% of
which is funded solely by the state and less than a quarter by the
federal government.
Aside from our geography and position in the worldwide supply
chain, and a growing population that constantly allows for innovation,
the Sunshine State has one of the most robust transportation portfolios
in the country:
FDOT is responsible for more than 12,000 miles of roadway
and maintains over 7,000 bridges and has nearly 7,500 miles of bicycle
facilities;
Among the 19 commercial airports in the state, Florida is
the only state with four large hub airports--Fort Lauderdale, Miami,
Orlando, and Tampa;
With 15 deepwater seaports in Florida, we are a
significant contributor to America's supply chain as evidenced by the
4.3 million total TEUs moved in 2023 equating to 10% of the nation's
total;
Almost 3,000 miles of rail keeps our goods and passengers
on the go, along with the 48 transit systems across the state; and
Florida leads the nation as the fastest growing, most
comprehensive, and forward-facing state for space-related development,
manufacturing, and flight. In 2023, Florida's Space Coast launched over
70 rockets.
IIJA's Deviation in Structure
Federal Fiscal Years 2022 through 2026 provide an infusion of $550
billion nationwide towards new infrastructure investment whether by
competitive grants or formula apportionment to improve roads, bridges,
water infrastructure, resilience, and broadband. Under IIJA, there are
essentially three types of funding: (1) traditional formula-based
funding; (2) new, required formula-based programs; and (3) a-much-
expanded discretionary grants program.
Previous federal transportation authorizations placed an emphasis
on formula-based funding, which provided flexibility by the state
Departments of Transportation to advance their state-specific
infrastructure goals. Now, with IIJA, the number of competitive grant
programs has skyrocketed from 13 to 45, placing less emphasis on
states' needs with more decisions being made top-down. While the
``competitive'' label attached to these grants may be a good talking
point, it is actually a mask to cover the disservice currently being
done to the delivery of infrastructure nationwide.
Rather than focusing on a state's knowledge and experience to get
the work done, U.S. DOT is administering discretionary grant programs
with ideological considerations that are not focused on reducing
congestion, supporting our supply chain, or maintaining the nation's
aging infrastructure.
Picking Winners and Losers
Now, halfway into the IIJA authorization, U.S. DOT has only awarded
$47.9 billion (out of the $158 billion available) in surface
transportation discretionary grants across the country. Two of the most
populous states in the nation, Florida and Texas, have received some of
the lowest funding amounts per capita from these discretionary
programs, while Maryland has taken home the largest amount. Currently,
Florida has the 2nd lowest per capita award rate in the country. To
date, Florida has been awarded $500.5 million of grants which equates
to $22.52 per capita. The national state average is awards totaling
$740.1 million at $144.02 per capita. Maryland's awards have totaled
$7.2 billion at $1,173 per capita.
Out of the 36 discretionary grant applications that FDOT
has submitted, only eight of those grants have been awarded to us
totaling $246.6 million--$180 million of which come from a single grant
award for Truck Parking expansion in Central Florida.
As of February 29, 2024, out of Florida's 412 cities, 67
counties, and 27 MPOs only 87 applications have been selected by U.S.
DOT, totaling $317.4 million.
Under traditional formula funding, states rely on their calculated
apportionment, to best plan for programming and delivering projects for
their communities. Historically, states have received 90 percent of
total surface transportation apportionments in formula program. Under
IIJA, approximately 15 percent of funding is now being directed to
discretionary grant programs, leaving behind states who should be
receiving more money based on population, lane miles, land mass and
vehicle miles traveled.
Florida's $500.5 million in discretionary grant awards equate to
only 1.04% of the funding available for discretionary grants. Of the
formula funding, Florida receives 4.78% of the apportionment total
under IIJA. As a growing state facing dynamic population and economic
growth, Florida would be better positioned to meet emerging
transportation needs through long established formula programs. If the
IIJA funding made 90 percent available in federal authorization,
Florida would receive an additional $2 billion over the five years of
the Act.
Wasted Time is Wasted Money
With the increase in discretionary programs, FDOT and local
entities are required to compete for federal funding, which is timely,
costly and an overall burden to states and our local partners who want
to deliver infrastructure not wade through federal bureaucracy.
Two years after being awarded the 2021 RAISE grant for the Tampa
Heights Mobility Project, FDOT's grant agreement has still not been
executed by U.S. DOT. On average, the grant funds for FDOT projects
have taken up to 18 to 24 months to be authorized. Currently, FDOT has
received authorization for 13.68% of our awarded grants--leaving 86.32%
waiting for a grant agreement and funds to be obligated by U.S. DOT.
The additional time required to enter into a grant agreement with
U.S. DOT makes many of Florida's top projects untenable for grants, as
delays could jeopardize critical investments into our communities.
Aside from the waiting period, a quality grant application can cost
nearly $150,000 in resource and staff hours to develop. FDOT has
submitted 36 discretionary grant applications under IIJA making FDOT's
total approximate expenditure more than $5.5 million. Florida has 29
Fiscally Constrained Counties (mostly rural)--how are they supposed to
prioritize projects when the resources and expertise for complex
applications are limited?
As an added business consideration, to meet the federal match
requirements for application submissions, a 20% match of state funds
must be committed. While applicants wait months for paperwork to be
reviewed, a considerable amount of resources in FDOT's Work Program are
essentially sidelined in anticipation of a potential grant award. Since
the inception of IIJA, FDOT has had to set aside resources totaling
over $430 million in the pursuit of discretionary grant funding at one
time or another. While waiting for an award announcement, this money
was not building infrastructure, instead it was waiting to learn if we
would be selected. In Florida, we are aware that some industry partners
are opting to not apply for federal discretionary grants to ensure
their funding cycles can remain active and reliable.
By the time a grant award is realized for a community, the effects
of federally-induced inflation, compounded by a 18-24 month delay in
award, have immediately driven project finances into the red. DOTs,
cities, counties, MPOs, and local agencies bear the responsibility of
cost overruns due to the combination of inflation and slow agreements
and authorizations. If FDOT struggles with this scenario, I must
imagine rural and small communities heavily weigh whether they even
apply for grants in the first place--making these discretionary funds
even further out of reach for some who need them most.
It should not be taken lightly that U.S. DOT is under a tremendous
burden, albeit self-inflicted. The magnitude and scope of a
discretionary grant program of this size is formidable, and the sheer
staffing needs required to evaluate and process this program is
overwhelming--and would be for any agency. That is why we must return
to primarily traditional formula-based funding. Transportation
infrastructure is planned 15-20 years in advance to begin with, we
should be doing everything possible for our citizens to bring it to
reality efficiently not prolong it further.
Equity In Action vs. Equity Inaction
IIJA deviated from a time-tested authorization structure for
funding the country's infrastructure. As one of those deviations, U.S.
DOT has made it clear that non-pecuniary factors like DEI and ESG
considerations, may take priority when selecting which transportation
projects are most important for our communities. These ``priorities''
are clearly seen in the goals of discretionary grant programs.
U.S. DOT has declared that there must be equity in transportation,
but Florida, the nation's 3rd largest state, only stands to receive 1%
of competitive grants; rural and Justice 40 communities are actually
disadvantaged and penalized the most by burdensome red tape; and NOFO
requirements force one-sided ideologies to act as a carrot and a stick
simultaneously.
The mentions above are only within the discretionary grant space,
not even venturing into IIJA's new formula-based programs which are now
required. NEVI is part of a vision to force individuals into only
driving one type of vehicle. The Carbon Reduction Program is a program
forcing states to acknowledge there's a carbon emissions `problem'
while in Florida the U.S. EPA admitted we have the cleanest air quality
on record. Some programs are even being promulgated outside of legal
authority. These programs similarly don't prioritize infrastructure,
they prioritize ideologies.
FDOT is very proud of the INFRA Grant we received for trucking
parking last month. With this funding we will be able to add over 900
truck parking spaces to the network of truck parking FDOT has been
building for years. It truly is a great win for our state. It is
unfortunately overshadowed by the realization that our selection was
most likely embedded in the Administration's belief that reducing
carbon emissions was a priority consideration for our application, not
the fact that the backbone of our supply chain, our truck drivers, need
a place to rest and that Florida was the most financially- and
technically-qualified to deliver this complex project. These
``priorities'' are not to relieve congestion, increase safety, or
promote innovation; they're not about infrastructure at all.
Conclusion & Where We Hope to Head Next
In summary, the current discretionary grant process creates burdens
for state DOTs and all applicants, unfairly picks winners and losers,
and prioritizes non-transportation factors. Formula allocation of funds
is more efficient and allows states to actually deliver infrastructure
that is specific to their state and supported by their communities.
FDOT encourages Congress to lay the groundwork for the next
transportation authorization that revives stronger formula funding,
encourages U.S. DOT to operate efficiently not bureaucratically,
rejects the politization of our nation's highways, and continues to
appropriately increase overall funding for robust transportation
infrastructure across the country. Our industry is the literal
foundation for America's continued growth and success.
Thank you again for the tremendous opportunity to be part of this
process.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you again to all of our
witnesses, and I will now open it up for questions, and I
recognize myself for 5 minutes for the first questions. So, it
goes to Commissioner Winders.
I know you recently applied for a RAISE grant, a $25
million RAISE grant for Highway 54 in Missouri. I am curious,
can you talk a little bit about the challenges that you had,
and obviously, the benefits of that particular project?
Mr. Winders. Certainly, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
The project itself is taking a two-lane highway, Highway
54, and creating a shared four-lane, which, if you are not
familiar with that, it's effectively passing lanes every so
often.
Doing this project would also complete a shortcut between
the Avenue of the Saints and Interstate 70. The shortcut is
half done, but we need to do--this project would be the rest of
it. We have been unsuccessful in 6 years in applying for RAISE
grants. Our grant application has dropped over the years.
Actually, every year. The first time we applied, we were
``highly recommended,'' and then we went to ``recommended.''
And now I believe the latest iteration was ``acceptable,'' and
this is with, effectively, the same application. What has
changed are the raters and rating criteria. Effectively, it has
been, for us--our experience has been it has been a moving
target.
The first--when we were--I believe when we were highly
rated, we needed to do a benefit-cost analysis, which was a
$15,000 bill. And for a small coalition, that was a little bit
difficult for us. But after our application was rated highly,
one of the things we needed to change was have that benefit-
cost analysis. So, we put together the money and did that, and
then the next year, we were not highly rated, we were
recommended. So, it has been items that--in areas that have to
do with the reviewer or the rating criteria that has changed
that has made our application less favorably looked upon.
The other thing that happens is, as additional rating
criteria have come into being, a county with a road project
with clean air--and it just being a road project--environmental
issues, clean air issues, and innovation, we just don't get a
lot of points for that, in spite of the fact--and now I will
talk a little bit about the benefits of the highway. That
particular road shares traffic with everything from horse and
buggy Amish traffic at 3 or 4 miles an hour to 60-mile-an-hour
heavy-truck traffic, 20-mile-an-hour combines that are 16 or
thereabouts wide, and every vehicle in between. Passing lanes
would be a great safety improvement for that part of the--and a
very much-needed safety improvement. We just have been unable
to make that case in the RAISE grant application.
In addition to that, it's an unfinished project. I
mentioned that this four-lane is halfway done between 70 and
the Avenue of the Saints. Completing this section would allow,
effectively, a shortcut or a bypass on the northeast part of
St. Louis, which should help congestion, and the I-70, the
Wentzville, where the Avenue of the Saints crosses Interstate
70. So, we think it would be a really good improvement for the
State and national system, as well.
Finally, it's an unfinished project. A couple of decades
ago, we--the Federal Government, in conjunction with the
State--did the four-lane halfway through the project to Mexico,
Missouri, and then it stops. So, completing this section is
actually, I believe, the completion of some vision from decades
ago that was positive in terms of how transportation could work
to move people and goods in our area and nationally.
It's not the only unfinished project. So, I assume there
might be others like us that will also have trouble getting
through the rating criteria. One example might be a bypass in
Hannibal in Marion County. The Avenue of the Saints goes
mostly--you can go from Waterloo, Iowa, almost to St. Paul, all
the way to New Orleans, and there are seven stop signs on that
route. The rest of it is four lanes, and those seven stop signs
are in Hannibal. That bypass would really--is really a--we are
talking about a completion of the project.
If we have these problems, I assume that other places do,
as well; other counties do, as well. We simply don't have the
capacity, in spite of the fact that we have the best
transportation planner at our Council of Governments--her name
is Anna Gill, and she is with us here today. We have the best
transportation planner in the State, we just don't have the
financial and human capacity to compete with the larger
projects.
So, I apologize, Mr. Chairman, if that was long-winded, but
that's kind of the story of the 54 Coalition.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
That is a great intro for a question for Ms. O'Leary,
because I wanted to ask you, from a regional planner
perspective, one, if we had more direct allocation of formula
funding to local governments or targeted competitive grants
open to counties, cities, or MPOs, would that be an
improvement?
If so, how would it be an improvement?
And then the second--well, answer that one first.
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you, Mr. Larsen. Yes, I think that would
be an improvement in certain areas, where we have the expertise
at the MPO level or at the local government level. And I think
the Safe Streets For All is a really good example of that.
We at the MPO level across the country have safety plans
that can identify exactly the types of projects that need to
happen. And then we work with our counties and our local
governments, and some of them have even more in-depth safety
plans done and ready to go. So, in that case, where the
projects are really on the ground and local, I think it makes
sense to be able to pass the funds through at that level.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. So, on that point, so, in my
district, I have the Puget Sound Regional Council, which is
kind of the urban planning bit. Then I have Skagit Council of
Governments and Whatcom Council of Governments up near the
border, much more rural areas. I have got Island County, which
is its own thing, as well, very much its own thing. And there
is--I would suggest there is a variety of technical capacity in
each of those, as well, although probably better than, say, any
one of the smaller cities that currently exists.
So, do you have some thoughts about the technical capacity
support that has come through the U.S. DOT?
Ms. O'Leary. Right. So, I think that MPOs provide and
regions provide a lot of opportunity to provide capacity to
local communities, especially smaller ones that don't
necessarily have that knowledge or technical ability to do so.
And that's one of the things that we have been able to do at
SEMCOG. But you're right, we are a staff at SEMCOG of 70 staff
being able to do that, whereas some of the smaller regions and
MPO in the State may have two or three staff.
So, the ability to provide regions some of that technical
support and dollars to be able to gear up to provide that
assistance to local communities, I think, would be very
helpful. I think the Federal programs to provide technical
support are so important, but sometimes they don't necessarily
know the issues like we do at the local level in being able to
work directly with the local community.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Right. Mr. Baker, in the next
authorization, we will need to tackle how to get predictable
funding for rail. Do you have an answer about how to do that?
Mr. Baker. Well, I guess cutting to the end of the answer,
I don't know if you will consider this an answer to how, but
the advance appropriations from IIJA were just a real game
changer for rail, which I think you referenced in your opening
statement. That's been just a massive deal.
Rail has never had that before for short lines, applying
for CRISI. Knowing that CRISI will be well funded every year in
advance is a huge deal and makes it something, frankly, you can
count on and think about long-term business and growth for, as
opposed to something that's subject to the vagaries of the
process. Congress just sort of magically did that last time in
the infrastructure bill.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. We are that good.
Mr. Baker. And so, if that's how it happens again, that
would be OK with us.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. OK, all right. So, thinking
through the discretionary versus the formula, I appreciate,
Secretary Perdue, your comment about having more formula. Roger
Millar from my State wants that, too. I never ran into a State
DOT director who didn't want more formula money.
But the flip side is that either there is more money
overall or, with the money that we authorize, then there is
going to be some split. And we did a lot more competitive grant
programs in this version because there was a need to do that. I
can think of one in particular, one particular need in our
State, with culvert removal as a for-instance. So, there is
just going to be this continual tradeoff.
But then we also have a process in our State--and by the
way, we are better than Florida--21 percent of our
transportation budget was federally funded, so in that regard.
But there is always this tradeoff. And we have a process
between our legislature and our county governments and city
governments using things like the County Road Administration
Board to get dollars from formula allocated into these
distribution mechanisms. And so, that is what we do. It can be
done.
That's kind of my point I made earlier on the testimony.
Does Florida have something like that, or does it all go
through the State legislature?
And nothing wrong with yours or my State legislature, but
sometimes it's the vagaries of the State legislature, as well,
that dictates where the money goes.
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Ranking Member Larsen, for that
question, and yes, actually, there is a time-tested model in
place.
Actually, with traditional formula allocations of Federal
funds, we do have local programs. Florida is a very diverse
State, geographically. We have very rural communities, we have
very urban communities. And we have, actually--like through the
Bridge Formula Program, we have replaced a lot of off-system
local bridges. In cases where local municipalities have the
technical expertise and the staffing and manpower to manage
Federal programs, we are more like a pass-through, and we
administer the funds to the locals. Then, for rural communities
that may not have the staffing or expertise, we actually go in
and deliver those projects for those rural communities. So,
there is a time-tested model in place.
I think there is a very good way for formula distributed
allocations to be utilized to help local communities.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. All right. Well, just before I
yield back, when I came on the committee in 2001, we argued
about donor and donee States and tried to get a formula change.
And this is just--your testimony and testimony from Roger
Millar, and he's great, it is just a version of that donor
versus donee thing that someday will be perfect.
Yes, thanks. I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. While we are here
today to discuss the Department's administration of grant
programs, I would be remiss if I didn't raise my continued
concern with the Federal Highway Administration's final rule to
require a greenhouse gas performance measure forcing State DOTs
and MPOs to set declining targets for carbon dioxide emissions
stemming from transportation on the National Highway System. As
I previously discussed in this committee, this rule exceeds the
administration's statutory authority. This policy was
considered and rejected as part of Senate negotiations of IIJA.
So, Secretary Perdue, does Florida DOT agree that the rule
goes beyond the administration's statutory authority?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman. And yes, absolutely. We
do agree that it does go beyond the authority granted to FHWA,
which is one of the reasons we joined 20 other States in a
lawsuit challenging that rule.
And our mission at FDOT is to deliver transportation
infrastructure that moves people and goods safely and
efficiently. I think the last thing that Floridians want FDOT
to be doing is tracking and monitoring tailpipe emissions when
they choose to drive a car.
Mr. Crawford. So, how will this rule impact the ability of
State DOTs to make their own project selections?
Mr. Perdue. This rule could have a significant impact. We
actually have 27 MPOs in the State of Florida. So, the rule not
only requires DOT to set targets and track, but also those
local MPOs. And so, it is a tremendous effort to ramp that up
and figure out, like, where are the different targets going to
be, how are they going to be set up, what is it going to look
like? There is just a lot of unknowns, and it is just very
burdensome.
Mr. Crawford. Let me shift gears just a little bit. As you
know, Secretary Perdue, I just significantly expanded
discretionary grant opportunities. And there is a process
conducted before the end of each fiscal year known as August
Redistribution, in which outstanding obligation limitation for
nonformula programs is redistributed to State DOTs.
The total amount considered as part of this process has
escalated over the past several years, and more specifically,
grown significantly since enactment of IIJA. Federal Highways
has projected the balance could reach $8\1/2\ billion this
year. The American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials, or AASHTO, recently wrote to
congressional leaders to raise this issue and encourage action.
I appreciate the concerns of the State DOTs, which are left
scrambling to absorb this funding on a short timeline to ensure
it does not lapse. Is this something you at Florida DOT are
concerned about?
Mr. Perdue. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. It is actually a
major concern and a huge challenge. So, yes, redistribution
happens in August every year. And basically, what happens is at
the Federal level, the discretionary funds and the TIFIA funds
that have not been utilized or obligated are then redistributed
to the States. And we are asked to take additional funds at the
eleventh hour of building our programs in the form of formula
distributions.
So, the discretionary funds that are not moving are then
being redistributed to us as formula, but over the life of the
authorization, that reduces our actual formula allocation
balance. The allocation for the discretionary grant program
still stays at what it is.
And I would highlight that we are over halfway through the
IIJA authorization, and only around 30 percent of grants have
been awarded at this time. A lot less than that has actually
been authorized and obligated. So, that redistribution amount
continues to grow. We, as a State, are being asked to take more
and more and more, and all that does is draw down on the
formula funds that we can actually spend in the future.
Mr. Crawford. Any thoughts on how we might fix this
problem?
Mr. Perdue. There are a few opportunities and a few ways to
fix the problem. But one thing that I would definitely
highlight here is that, obviously, if the authorization could
direct more resources to formula programs, as opposed to
discretionary grants, that would be great.
Another potential solution is, when redistribution happens,
if those redistributed funds could add to our overall
allocation of formula funds and at the same time reduce the
overall authorization for the discretionary grant programs, I
think it would be a more predictable and manageable and
consistent way going into the future.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I appreciate you being here.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Ms. O'Leary, while most highway formula funds
go to States, metropolitan regions receive dedicated formula
funds through the Surface Transportation Program, the
Transportation Alternatives Program, and the Carbon Reduction
Program through a process known as suballocation. Can you speak
to the benefits for the communities you serve in having
dedicated, predictable funding streams for your region?
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you for that question. Yes. SEMCOG and a
lot of the larger MPOs across the country do have suballocation
of the Transportation Alternatives Program and the new Carbon
Reduction Program.
One of the reasons that I think that works really well--so,
in our region for TAP, as we call it, we receive about $10
million a year. What's nice about it being formula funds is
that there is consistency that we know we will be receiving $10
million every year from this program, so, we can look forward
at projects that might not quite be ready this year, but they
can get in the pipeline.
We have a group of elected officials at our organization
that actually makes all the funding decisions that we have. So,
we, as staff, take all the applications for the TAP funds and
for carbon reduction. We vet them ourselves from the technical
standpoint, but then we take them to our regional review
committee of elected officials that represent fairly our entire
region to make the final decisions about which funds happen for
TAP and for carbon reduction. Both have been highly successful
in our region for that way and very equitably contributed.
Ms. Norton. Ms. O'Leary, another question for you. This
committee often talks about the role that highway
infrastructure can play in promoting economic development, but
that's not always the case. Your testimony cites Interstate 696
as--and here I am quoting you--a ``major barrier to
accessibility and economic development,'' and discusses how
predominantly Black neighborhoods were razed in the 1960s to
make room for Interstate 375 in Detroit.
I helped create two programs, Reconnecting Communities and
Neighborhood Access and Equity, to begin redressing some of
these harms. Can you discuss how reimagining and rebuilding
highway infrastructure can improve economic development?
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you for that question, yes, and thank
you for starting those programs for us. I talked for a bit
about the Reconnecting Communities Project, and in the instance
of the 696 cutting one of our communities in half, and the
ability of our citizens to be able to get across the freeway to
be able to go to their schools or go to their places of
worship, has been a challenge for them. And so, being able to
receive that spurs economic development, and it's a citizen's
right to be able to go to their community centers and things
that were across the freeway. So, it has been a very exciting
program.
In the case of I-375, that is a very large program, so that
is a $300 million reconstruction program. And while we would
have loved to use Reconnecting Communities, that pot of money
was a little bit smaller. So, they went with the larger pot of
money under INFRA to be able to fund over $100 million to look
at raising the grade because, yes, 375 in the 1960s cut very
prominent Black neighborhoods in half and destroyed commercial
areas back in the 1960s. So, this will raise it back to grade,
and slow it down, and make it more pedestrian friendly.
And at SEMCOG, one of the things we do is the travel
modeling to make sure that the system can handle that, that the
freeways we work with our State DOT very closely and make sure
that all of that can work, so that when we bring things up to
grade, it will end up having an economic boom in our downtown,
but also, more importantly, connect our citizens across that
freeway.
Ms. Norton. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Bean of Florida . Thank you very much, and
good morning, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Let's continue. Let's go to the great State of Florida, where
Dan Webster is recognized.
Representative Webster, you are recognized.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Chairman.
Secretary Perdue, the drawn-out timeline for MARAD and DOT
during the grant obligation process, like the Port
Infrastructure Development Program, so forth, forces recipients
to adjust their scopes due to inflation. I think other
pressures, too, would cause readjustment.
Considering the Port Infrastructure Development Program as
an example, what is the average time it takes DOT to complete a
grant contract?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. And
yes, I would say in the transportation industry specifically,
we have seen, year over year, close to 20-percent increases in
the cost of delivering projects.
Currently, what we are seeing with discretionary grants
under U.S. DOT is that it's actually taking from 18 to 24
months to get from award announcement to actual execution of a
grant agreement, which is when you can actually access the
money.
For an entity like a seaport, who is typically delivering
infrastructure and financing it through a myriad of sources--
one would be they utilize State funds from FDOT, they utilize
their own funds, they utilize bonding, and they also rely on
these Federal grants--having to wait 18 to 24 months to
actually access the money puts them in a real bind with their
capital plan, and they find themselves with the cost of the
project having gone up and then having to readjust their
programs and plans and potentially find different ways to
finance the project.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Can you give an example of how we
might be able to avoid those delays?
Mr. Perdue. There are a few different opportunities.
One suggestion that I could bring is especially for
entities and agencies that have been managing Federal programs
for many, many years. I mean, like FDOT, we deliver billions of
dollars' worth of infrastructure with Federal funds on it.
Instead of going through this lengthy kind of bureaucratic
process of having to enter into a separate grant agreement for
every single award, the funds could actually be distributed to
those entities that are time tested and proven and know how to
manage Federal funds, and directly administered to those
agencies to deliver the projects. That would speed things up
significantly.
The other suggestion would be just speed up the time it
takes to execute a grant agreement. I mean, there is no reason
it should take 18 to 24 months.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, as you know, the House--we
didn't have much say in what went into the IIJA. Most of us
were on the side that didn't even vote for the bill because of
various reasons. But if we had a say in the final bill, we
probably wouldn't have had so many discretionary grant
programs.
So, the multiyear planning program is difficult, and we
have to rely on discretionary grants, but we don't have to as
much. And as we rewrite, in the coming years, the IIJA, do you
have any recommendations on why we might use more formula-
driven programs?
Mr. Perdue. I do, Congressman, and thank you. And I am
happy to be on this panel with a colleague from the MPOs,
because they are very important.
And just to give a little context, transportation
infrastructure is not dreamt up overnight. It takes years to
plan infrastructure projects out. And we work very closely with
MPOs and local communities to develop those plans using data
and science and growth models to plan what projects are going
to be needed 20 years in the future. And once the project is
conceived, we immediately begin working on the development
process.
And even NEPA alone--to administer Federal funds, you have
to go through the NEPA process. That process alone takes 3 or 4
years a lot of times. And so, the fact that we have
discretionary grants available is great, but there are a lot of
additional requirements in those grants that may not have been
part of the considerations for that planning. And you can't
just dream up a project overnight and change the direction you
are going.
And so, for instance, in the State of Florida, we have
billions of dollars of infrastructure in the pipeline right now
that was conceived by local communities that they are waiting
for us to deliver. And the faster we can get our hands on that
funding, the better it is going to be for that infrastructure.
And so, like, looking into the future, formula distribution,
formula allocation is much more effective, and there are a lot
of opportunities in that. And if local communities are the
focus, I think that there is a way to use those formula
distribution, those formula allocations to help those local
communities, as well.
And in a lot of cases in Florida, like for our fiscally
constrained local communities and those that are rural, they
actually need State DOT's help to administer projects with
Federal funds. And so, it is actually a--it is beneficial for
our communities if those formula allocations, even the ones
that are going directly to communities, come through State
DOTs. For those local communities that have the staffing and
expertise to manage Federal funds, we can be a pass-through and
administer the funds to the locals. And for those that can't,
we can step in and actually help them deliver those projects.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much for your
answer.
I yield back.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much, Representative.
Let's go to the great State of California, where Representative
Garamendi is recognized.
You are recognized, 5 minutes.
Mr. Garamendi. Good heavens, Mr. Chairman, such enthusiasm
for an introduction. Thank you.
I am sitting here listening to this. You guys have never
had it so good. The State of California has never had it so
good. Cry me a river. There is a river of money flowing from
the Federal Government to the States, both in formula as well
as in grants. And what I hear is a lot of crying about, well,
it isn't this, we should do that, we have to sign, we have to
have a little bit more information, and they are not approving
it quite as fast as they ought to.
And by the way, Mr. Perdue, you are complaining that with
the allocations you are getting more money upfront and then
later, down the years in the future, you may not have as much
because you are getting it now rather than later. Cry me a
river, folks.
The IIJA has provided more money for infrastructure of all
kinds, including transportation, than ever, ever before in the
history of this Government. So, cry me a river. Yes, there are
restrictions, there are formulas. Mr. Winders, you complain
about not getting your thing because the criteria has changed.
You didn't say one word about what was wrong with the criteria.
That would be useful to us. If you don't like the criteria that
has been written in the current law and implemented by the
Department of Transportation, then tell us what is wrong with
the criteria.
And I suspect some of it is, well, the criteria has
changed, we are going to worry about communities that have been
divided and destroyed by previous infrastructure, and we want
to address that. You guys got a problem with that? Yes or no,
Mr. Winders, a problem with that policy?
Mr. Winders. No.
Mr. Garamendi. Good. Mr. Baker, problems with that policy?
Mr. Baker. No.
Mr. Garamendi. How about Ms. O'Leary?
Ms. O'Leary. No.
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Perdue?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman. You know, the----
Mr. Garamendi . Yes or no.
Mr. Perdue . The increased funding is----
Mr. Garamendi . No, the policy question is,
should we be allocating money by grants to communities that
have been destroyed by previous infrastructure projects?
Mr. Perdue. I would say it's much more efficient and
effective to allocate money by formula distribution.
Mr. Garamendi. All right, then you want to do away with all
the grants, including the $15 million that Florida received for
high-speed rail. Got it. We will just eliminate the high-speed
rail grant program for Florida. And by the way, your ports
receive mostly grant programs. You want to do away with that
also? We could do away with that.
The bottom line is we have a situation here where this
Congress--excuse me, the previous Congress, not this one--the
previous Congress authorized and appropriated more money than
ever for formula, as well as for discretionary grants. I
understand none of us get everything we want. Certainly, we
don't get everything I want for my district. But I do know that
the opportunity to get it exists today. So, just a couple of
questions.
Mr. Perdue, Florida reduced its gas tax to 0, gasoline tax
to 0 in 2022. Is that correct?
Mr. Perdue. No, that is not correct.
Mr. Garamendi. So, was there a reduction in the gasoline
tax in Florida in 2022?
Mr. Perdue. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. Garamendi. I believe your Governor signed a bill that
did that. But you know better than I, I suppose.
I just found that the utility of this hearing would be:
What are the specific questions that you have about the
discretionary funding mechanisms and formulas? The criteria?
What is wrong with the criteria that is out there? I gave one
example. Are there other examples of criteria that you think
are incorrect? I think you can provide that to us in writing.
I will also note that this little--we are sitting here with
the IIJA providing more money than ever before for all kinds of
infrastructure, including transportation. And there were 13 of
my Republican colleagues that voted for it. Only four of them
still are in Congress, but they are happy to vote no and take
the dough. So, the question for us as we go forward is: If you
don't like the formula, if you don't like the discretionary
allocation, what is wrong with it?
The fact of the matter is that the Department of
Transportation has pushed out a vast amount of money through
both formula, as well as discretionary funding. So, please
deliver to us in the days ahead what of those criteria in the
discretionary funding that you find inappropriate.
I yield back.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much.
Let's go to the Lone Star State, the great State of Texas,
where Dr. Babin, Representative Babin, you are recognized.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. Thank
you, witnesses, for being here, as well.
I represent the 36th Congressional District of Texas, home
to some of our most critical ports in the Nation and waterways
and, really, more refineries and petrochemical plants than
anywhere else in the country, rail, highway infrastructure,
manufacturing, industrial sector facilities. And I am very
pleased we are having this hearing to discuss these issues and
opportunities related to competitive discretionary funding from
DOT.
My first question is for all of the panelists. If you would
give a very brief answer, I would appreciate it. In
conversations with the Texas Department of Transportation, or
TxDOT, I have heard that the U.S. Department of Transportation
conducts debriefs with grant applications that were not
selected. And I have also heard that these debriefs are not
transparent whatsoever. Applicants aren't allowed to seek
additional information or even see the scoring sheets or speak
to those who scored the applications. What is your experience
with these debriefs?
And what do you think could be changed to make them more
beneficial and transparent, please?
Go ahead, Mr. Baker.
Mr. Baker. For short line railroads, anyone who doesn't win
a CRISI grant typically does request a debrief, and they get
them. We do appreciate the opportunity.
I would agree with the premise of the question, though. The
whole process could be more transparent.
Dr. Babin. Yes.
Mr. Baker. Frankly, we would love to see much more public
information about who applies, who doesn't win, and for the
ones that do win, exactly what was in the application, where it
stands, how it's progressing. I think sunshine would be a
tremendous----
Dr. Babin . Amen.
Mr. Baker . Benefit for the whole process.
Dr. Babin. It's amazing how sunlight can help things.
Anybody else?
Mr. Winders. We would agree. I believe that the debrief
process is helpful and can be helpful. In our particular
circumstance, it affected what we did. We went and got the
benefit-cost analysis, but it didn't help us. So, not knowing
necessarily everything about the criteria and especially how it
would be rated the next year was--it would have been helpful to
know that.
Dr. Babin. Thank you.
Nobody else? OK. Another question for all of you, and
anyone feel free to chime in briefly.
Many local governments receiving grant funds do not realize
that the money is provided on a reimbursable basis, which can
be very critical to a small city. I was a small city mayor,
myself. Is the DOT doing a good job of letting locals know
that?
What should DOT do to ensure that this is understood, so
that locals can consider this in their decisionmaking process?
Who would like to answer that one?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir.
Mr. Perdue. Yes, thank you Congressman. Absolutely, I can
provide a little insight on that.
Some of them--I would say some of your more progressed that
have staffing and expertise are aware of that. Others, a lot of
rural communities, underserved communities may not be aware of
that. And it can be a real challenge. And I mentioned in my
testimony the demand on resources just simply to pursue grants
and also even provide the matching requirements. This is one of
the challenges with discretionary grants programs.
At Florida DOT, we actually had to set up an entire team to
support our local governments and local communities, especially
as they are staring in the face the potential opportunity to
directly receive Federal grant moneys. It is very cumbersome,
very difficult, very challenging to manage projects with
Federal dollars on them, and there is a lot of requirements and
rules you have to meet, and it takes a lot of expertise to do
that.
And so, it is taking a lot of assistance from FDOT in
support of those local communities, and it can really be a
challenge.
Dr. Babin. OK, thank you very much. The last question is
for you, Secretary Perdue. As you know, it is important that
State DOTs maintain awareness of projects on their own system
to ensure coordination with local partners and the appropriate
project planning that must go forth. Are you finding that the
U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding funds to
transportation partners in your State on projects that are on
the State system without notifying you?
Are there any examples you would like to share?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman. I don't have any
specific examples. We did identify this as a major risk early
on, which is one of the reasons we established our team. The
risk is there. The opportunity for that to happen is there. And
so, we have kind of set up a process internal to FDOT to have
consistent, frequent communications with those local
communities that are pursuing grants. And we have even offered
our support in terms of the grants they are pursuing, just so
that we will have that awareness, because that is a potential
risk.
Dr. Babin. OK, thank you.
And I am going to yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you, Dr. Babin. Let's go to the
great State of Nevada.
Representative Titus, you are recognized. Good morning.
Ms. Titus. Good morning, and thank you very much. I just
wanted to point out that the grant moneys that have come from
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have really helped southern
Nevada recover, and they have been coming pretty rapidly, and
we appreciate that.
You may have heard about the $3 billion that we got as part
of building a super-speed train from Las Vegas to Los Angeles,
which will certainly help with our tourism economy. And another
program that we have gotten considerable funding, $13.3
million, is for Safe Streets and Roads For All.
And Ms. O'Leary, you mentioned in your testimony that your
area has a similar program, and you suggested that it
transition from discretionary to formula funding. Would you
elaborate on that, and tell us why that would make such a
difference, and what a problem it might be if this whole
program went away?
Ms. O'Leary. Right. Well, thank you for noticing that in
the testimony.
When I mentioned the buckets of discretionary funds, one of
the buckets was for kind of new challenges. And safety isn't a
new challenge, but post-pandemic and during the pandemic, it
became a challenge again with fatalities. We were seeing a
trend of it going down, and suddenly, during the pandemic, it
started going up, and post-pandemic, it continues to go up.
Ms. Titus. The same in Nevada.
Ms. O'Leary. So, I think noticing that, and then saying,
OK, that is a challenge, and having discretionary funds to be
able to address it is vital, but it's not going away. We
wondered if it was a blip during COVID that then we would see
it start going back down again, and we haven't. So, that's what
makes me think this is a problem that is across the country,
not in just Michigan, right, and not just in Nevada. We have
got it everywhere.
And that's where it does seem to make sense to me that in
the next round that we talk about it being more formula because
it does impact everyone across the country. And again, locally
derived solutions are really making a game changer.
Ms. Titus. Well, thank you. When you provide safety for all
the different users of the road, it's not only good for those
users, but it gets more people perhaps out of cars and on
bicycles, or mass transit, or just walking to the store, or
whatever it might be. But we have got to be sure those streets
are safe for all those users. So, thank you. I would like to
consider making that change next time.
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. Yes. And then I would just ask all of you this
question. Mr. Yakym and I introduced a bill called INVEST in
Our Communities Act, and it was about promoting economic
development.
One of the things we looked at is capacity building. Small
towns, rural areas don't have the same resources to apply for
certain grants, and we wanted to see about building that in. I
wonder if some of you would comment on how that might make a
difference. Is it needed? Should we look at that in the next
transportation authorization bill as we consider different
grant programs?
Mr. Winders. I believe we would appreciate and support
anything that would provide technical assistance to rural
communities and counties as it relates to navigating through
the grant processes, the notices of Federal funding, and
compliance with the rules. So, I believe that we would support
that.
Mr. Baker. There are some small short line railroads that
would make some of those small towns and counties look like
major metropolises by comparison. So, I am not sure if the bill
applies to small businesses, but in general, we would welcome
any sort of help. Applying these programs can be very
challenging, and it just looks like a Mount Everest of
bureaucracy if you are a small business trying to conquer this.
Ms. Titus. And sometimes in small governments or rural
areas, it's, well, ``here, you're not busy, write us up a grant
proposal,'' and that's just not going to be competitive today.
We need that expertise and those resources. Anybody else want
to comment?
Ms. O'Leary. I would just add, I think it's a great idea.
One of the things we've noted is that, with the grant
opportunities, it would be--we talked just about that. It would
be nice if there was some capacity building built right into
it. So, I think that's a really great idea.
I would say it is rural areas, but it's also our small
urban cities. So, while some of our large urban cities have
more staff and more capacity, some of our small urban cities,
they are very limited in staff and the ability to write these
grants, as well. We formed a committee at SEMCOG of just those
mayors to come together, and we actually have a meeting
tomorrow to talk about what their issues are. And then one of
the number-one things they say is their ability to write these
grants and the capacity building that they need. And they are
very urban communities, they are just very small.
Ms. Titus. OK, thank you.
Well, thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much. Let's go to the
great State of North Carolina, where Representative Rouzer is
recognized.
Representative Rouzer, good morning.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Secretary Perdue, in your testimony, you state that your
department was awarded a RAISE grant in 2021, but the U.S.
Department of Transportation has not yet finalized that grant
agreement. In fact, you mentioned how grant delivery can often
take 18 to 24 months to be disbursed. Consequently, by the time
funding for these projects is delivered, they are already in
the red.
So, that has been the experience in North Carolina, as
well. In October of 2022, the North Carolina Department of
Transportation was awarded an INFRA grant to widen 10 miles of
the I-85 FUTURES Corridor. This grant has been pending for more
than 18 months. At the time of the application submittal, the
estimated cost was $640 million. In June 2023, the project was
set to cost $720 million. By November of 2023, the project was
at $839 million, meaning a total increase of at least $200
million--$200 million. In August 2022, the department was
awarded a RAISE grant to reconstruct 28 bridges in several
counties across North Carolina, and this grant agreement with
the Federal Highway Administration has still not been
finalized. And while it may be somewhat of a complex project,
that's inexcusable.
So, one aspect of this grant debate that we have not really
dived into are the cost overruns. Can you talk about your
experience in Florida with regard to that?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman, and what you are
describing that North Carolina DOT is dealing with is the same
that every public transportation provider is dealing with.
Especially over the last 3 years, nationwide, the economy has
been volatile. The cost of doing business has continued to
increase. We have seen in some regions increases as much of 20
to 30 percent year over year.
If you look at the discretionary grant process as a whole,
from the time you decide to pursue a grant to the time that you
actually are able to access the funds to build the project, you
are looking at potentially 3 years. This is not an efficient,
effective way to deliver infrastructure.
And I will just go back again to my statements about
formula allocation. When we receive the formula allocation in
those funds, regardless of what programs they are for, they can
go directly on projects and be put to work immediately.
So, this is a tremendous challenge. I have already heard
from several transportation entities in Florida that are
considering not pursuing Federal grants because of the
financial liability and financial risk with having to wait so
long to actually access the money.
Mr. Rouzer. Yes, and the bottom line is, you can fund
something all you want to fund it, but if you don't have a
good, quick pathway to get the money there and get it
delivered, what does that mean, you know? It's just a lot of
extra cost, a lot of extra burden. And the last time I checked,
money is a scarce resource, it's not infinite.
The North Carolina Department of Transportation has found
that the new, multistep application process for the Bridge
Investment Program to be somewhat helpful. Specifically, this
program now gives applicants a period of time for dialogue to
address initial feedback from the U.S. Department of
Transportation before a final decision is made.
The North Carolina Department of Transportation recently
applied, in fact, for a Bridge Investment Program grant for the
Cape Fear Memorial Bridge replacement project in Wilmington,
North Carolina. It is going through this process. Has your
department benefited from this program at all, this process?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman. Actually, no, we have
not benefited from it. We have applied for three projects in
the Bridge Investment Program. One of them is known as DuPont
Bridge in Bay County, Florida. It serves, actually, a major Air
Force base that is going through a tremendously huge rebuild
after Hurricane Michael. It is also in need of capacity
improvements and is also deficient, and it's time to be
replaced.
We were not successful in getting that award. The feedback
we received was really not transparent, was inconsistent,
incoherent. We are not really sure why it was not a good
candidate, but we had to go ahead and fund the project anyway,
because we have to deliver this major bridge project for the
Air Force base.
And secondly, we submitted one in the Florida Keys along
Key bridge, and we were not successful for that one, either,
which, as you know, there is only one way in and out of the
Keys, so, that bridge project is extremely important for
hurricane evacuation.
Mr. Rouzer. Yes, absolutely.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much. Up next is the
great State of California.
Representative Carbajal, you are recognized. Good morning.
Mr. Carbajal. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also referred to as BIL,
one of a few names that people give it, provided an
extraordinary amount of competitive grant funding through the
72 programs. The Department of Transportation has issued nearly
90 Notices of Funding Opportunity to distribute this funding.
However, in recent meetings with MPOs, counties, and cities
in my district, I know there are challenges for local
governments to compete for grant funding.
A two-part question, Mr. Winders. From your perspective, do
you agree that Congress should continue to provide
infrastructure funding directly to local governments?
And two, if the multitude of competitive grants under the
BIL poses challenges, what are your recommendations to build
local capacity and make it easier for local governments to
succeed as we begin to turn our attention to our next surface
reauthorization bill?
Mr. Winders. Thank you, Representative, for that question.
I believe that the position of the National Association of
Counties is clear that we would like to see this level of
investment in our Nation's infrastructure continue. So,
hopefully, that is the answer to your first part.
Your second question is a little more difficult. We do need
to find ways and would support ways that our Federal partners
could help us gain capacity to be able to go through Notices of
Funding Opportunity, and to navigate the things that have to be
done, the laws and regulations when a grant is awarded. But
even before you--so, we would appreciate that and support that.
But in addition to that, we would support the concepts of
making things more simple and making the objectives clear,
exactly what is it that we are trying to do, and how the
applications will be rated. We are absolutely in support of
local flexibility, which could mean direct funding for counties
in terms of infrastructure.
We also support the removal of barriers into the project.
And you identified one that we have also identified, which is
critical, and that is capacity, financial and technical
capacity.
So, I just want to touch a little bit more about
objectives. If the objective is to build a road--and that is,
of course, what I am talking about, we want to build a road. I
don't know how we are going to affect air quality. I don't know
how we will meet some of the other rating criteria, which is
not to say that they are not important, which is not to say
that we don't value clean air, which is to say we can't write
an application--or I don't know how we can write an
application--that will compete with places that have that issue
and issues like those.
So, clear, single-minded grants to do specific things with
specific goals in mind, we would support.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Winders. That was kind of a long answer.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Having served in local government
as a county supervisor, and working with the National
Association of Counties, while we appreciate our State
partners, it is always nice when funding could be directed to
local governments. And I think that has always been advocacy
for many of local governments throughout our country, and
certainly in the State of California in my region.
Mr. Baker, in 2015, Congress created the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements, CRISI, program. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $5 billion in Federal
funds for the CRISI grant program to help support short line
and passenger rail projects. How has this program been
beneficial to your industry and the public?
Mr. Baker. Thank you. CRISI--essentially, my entire
testimony focused on CRISI. It's a huge, huge deal for short
lines. It's allowing us to rehabilitate and preserve lines that
otherwise would be at risk of abandonment.
And short lines, without boring people with the origin
story of short lines, but they essentially exist to preserve
lines that otherwise would go away, typically serving small
towns, rural areas, disadvantaged areas, some small ports. And
it's very expensive infrastructure. But frankly, the reason
it's a short line in the first place is because it doesn't have
enough traffic to be a Class I. It's just not busy enough.
And so, we do our very best to run lean and scrounge every
penny we can. But if we are going to maintain expensive
infrastructure, and rebuild bridges, and do it all safely,
sometimes we need some Government help. And the Government,
luckily, has been supportive of short lines for a long time.
And this new level of CRISI has taken it even to a higher
level, so, we are extremely appreciative.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much.
I am out of time, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you, Representative.
Let's head north to the great State of Minnesota where,
Representative Stauber, you are recognized. Good morning.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much. And to my colleague,
Representative Carbajal, being a former county commissioner, we
are speaking the same language. I appreciate you.
Smaller governments often face difficulties when applying
for Federal grant dollars due to the complex, time consuming,
and expensive process. Larger cities with bigger budgets can
hire grant writers and lobbyists to apply for Federal grants,
giving them an advantage in the overall process.
Mr. Winders, I looked at your history, read your testimony.
You have been a great public servant for a long time. We need
more of you. That's all I can say. But I do have some
questions. What has been your experience in applying for DOT
competitive grants from a cost and resource standpoint?
Mr. Winders. It has been difficult. Thank you for the
compliment, Representative. I appreciate that very much.
It has been difficult for us to keep the resources together
to put together an application. Obviously, we have not been
successful in putting the right resources into our application
or answering the questions correctly. Or--and this is what I
think is the case--the rating criteria just don't match up with
rural Missouri or rural America, so, the competitive field is
tilted, is tilted away from rural America.
We are very fortunate in that we have a great regional
planning commission, a very dedicated staff----
Mr. Stauber . Which you led several years
back.
Mr. Winders. That may be true. But they are still limited.
We have 8 counties, something under about 100,000 people and 5
staff members.
So, our experience, I think, is not unique in rural
America. Those folks do a great job with the limited resources
they have. But when it comes to writing a grant application
that's competitive, it's difficult.
Mr. Stauber. A couple of things here. So, would you agree
that the process is not easily understood and not simple to
use?
Mr. Winders. I would 100 percent agree with that,
Representative.
Mr. Stauber. Yes. So, rural communities are at a
disadvantage, I agree, in applying for these grants.
And one of my great frustrations with the IIJA was that it
was drafted without the input of a single Republican Member of
Congress. My constituents were not given a seat at the table,
and it is evident in the legislation. For example, the Rural
Surface Transportation Grant, this grant was created through
IIJA as a carve-out for rural communities. I want to emphasize
rural communities.
Unfortunately, there was an oversight in drafting, as the
definition in statute for ``rural'' is, as you know, 200,000
people or less. That is the definition of ``rural'' that was in
the IIJA. There are 855 cities in Minnesota; 796 cities have
populations of under 20,000.
So, under this current definition in the IIJA, those that
would qualify for rural roads would be everybody in the State
of Minnesota, with the exception of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.
So, that means our northern communities with 3,000 people are
fighting the suburbs of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. And so, had
it gone through regular order, we would have caught that and
changed that definition. Now we are trying to backtrack it with
legislation to change it, and it's very frustrating.
At the end of the day, I am looking at ways to make the
grant process more accessible to not only my district, which is
rural Minnesota, but across America in your district, as well.
I have helped introduce the Rebuilding Rural Roads Act, which
Congressman Finstad from southern Minnesota and I lead. It
strikes the 200,000 people in the Rural Surface Transportation
Grant and inserts 20,000 in its place.
And I also have cosponsored the Simplifying Grants Act,
which would require Government agencies to simplify the
difficult process for all current and future Federal grant
opportunities. Not 150 pages, 20 pages.
I just want to thank you all for being here.
And just real quick in my 30 seconds, Mr. Baker, the short
lines are so important, as you know, in northeastern Minnesota,
with the mining. We have an awesome opportunity. And you know,
I think that, as we look at the opportunities for economic
development, and particularly in northeastern Minnesota and our
mining industry, we have to really ensure that the railroads
are properly maintained. And I can tell you that the safety is
as important to the constituents as it is to you. And we have a
good working relationship in northeastern Minnesota, and we
appreciate that. Safety is the number one, number two, and
number three priority.
Mr. Winders, again, thank you for your service. And county
government is so precious. Thank you.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much, Representative.
Let's go to the land of Lincoln, the great State of Illinois,
where Representative Garcia is ready to go.
Good morning. You are recognized, Representative Garcia.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking
Member, for this hearing, and to all the witnesses who have
joined us.
I would like to begin by offering a statement for the
record from the Cook County Department of Transportation and
Highways. I ask unanimous consent to include the statement in
the record.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Without objection.

Statement of Jennifer Killen, Superintendent, Cook County Department of
Transportation and Highways, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Jesus G.
``Chuy'' Garcia
Introduction
I am pleased to submit this statement on behalf of the Cook County
Department of Highways and Transportation (DoTH). Cook County's
transportation system is one of its greatest assets--key to the
national and international movement of people and goods and to the
economic vitality of the region. DoTH prioritizes investment in its
existing transportation assets, recognizing it as an investment in the
County's future and the lives of its residents. DoTH is equally
committed to identifying and responding to changes in demands on the
transportation network by building a multimodal system that supports
the economy, improves mobility, reduces transportation costs, and
creates livable communities.
Cook County is at the center of the nation's third largest
metropolitan area with nearly two million households and more than five
million residents. We also are at the center of our nation's
transportation infrastructure, with access points to national and
global markets via two major airports, ten interstate expressways, six
of the seven Class I railroads, 16 intermodal facilities, and the Port
of Chicago. Cook County accounts for 40% of the State's residents and
43% of all state jobs. Transportation matters because it provides
access to jobs, and also access to schools, health care, fresh food and
much more. This makes transportation an asset worth investing in.
DoTH has jurisdiction over 561 center-line miles of roadway and
maintenance responsibility for 1,620 lane miles of pavement, 365
traffic signals, 7 pumping stations, and 4 maintenance facilities. It
also has jurisdiction over 93 structures (bridges and large drainage
culverts) and shares responsibility with other agencies for another 42
structures. In addition to these assets, Cook County leverages
investments in transportation projects throughout the county and
manages relationships with other transportation agencies to support
regional transit, freight, and alternative modes of transportation.
Cook County's role as an umbrella unit of government, covering a
geographic area comprised of 134 municipalities and 29 townships,
crisscrossed railroads, with roadways under local, state, and federal
jurisdiction, means DoTH often supports or leads multi-jurisdictional
projects with unique community and environmental concerns. Cook County
is uniquely positioned to provide the transportation leadership,
expertise, and resources required to advance regionally significant
projects which cross multiple agency and municipal boundaries. Through
coordination with its partners, the County also develops an annual
program that will preserve existing infrastructure, improve
connectivity and accessibility, build safer communities, generate
economic investment, and advance the regional transportation network.
We would like to thank the Members of this Committee who supported
the Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act (IIJA), which provided the
largest one-time infusion of federal funds into our nation's
infrastructure and transportation network. This legislation has allowed
the County to expedite several critical transportation projects.
Furthermore, we are pleased the Committee is holding this important
hearing to examine U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
discretionary grants through the lens of transportation stakeholders.
We would like to share from a county perspective how we utilize
discretionary funds and ensure that taxpayer dollars are well spent. To
do so, we'd like to highlight our Invest in Cook program and some
examples of local partnerships that have been widely successful and
have allowed us to assist communities that may not have the tools to
apply for or be highly competitive for discretionary grants.
Invest in Cook
Launched in 2017, the Invest in Cook program makes available up to
$8.5 million annually to support planning, engineering, land
acquisition or construction for transportation improvements that
support the five policy priorities of Connecting Cook County, the
County's long range transportation plan. Invest in Cook helps
communities tap into new fund sources and accelerate the completion of
projects that may otherwise languish. In its first seven years, Invest
in Cook awarded $56.4 million to fund 243 projects throughout the
County.
The Invest in Cook program provides assistance to projects that
have tremendous merit or potential but might otherwise stall because of
a lack of local match or lack of local staff resources. As such, the
program invests mostly in projects located off the County highway
network and emphasizes multimodal projects that expand the traditional
purview of the Department. The County has sought to fund early phases
of projects--planning and preliminary engineering--to help develop a
pipeline of strategic transportation improvements. Also, the program
often provides a critical final piece of construction funding for
larger projects or helps supply the match required for State and
Federal grants.
Invest in Cook additionally positions projects for future federal
funding opportunities that are competitive through the State, such as
the Surface Transportation Block Grant program or the Transportation
Alternatives Program. Most of these programs require projects to
complete preliminary engineering before projects become eligible to
apply. These provisions make it difficult for lower capacity
communities, such as those in south Cook County, to access the largest
sources of competitive transportation funding in the region. To
illustrate, Cook County's seed investment of $820,000 of preliminary
engineering on three freight projects in 2017 has already yielded
federal and state commitments of almost $38 million to advance these
projects through design and construction. In 2023, seven projects in
Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP)'s recommended FY24-28
CMAQ and TAP-L programs which were previously funded by Invest in Cook
were approved for $40.8 million of follow-on funding.
To date, Invest in Cook has helped complete 26 transit, 70 roadway,
32 freight, and 115 bicycle/pedestrian projects. Every dollar from
Invest in Cook leverages $3.50 from federal, state, and local sources.
Rail and Transit Partnerships
The IIJA and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provide unprecedented
funding opportunities for transportation infrastructure. Through Invest
in Cook, Cook County can provide matching funds for grants that transit
operators and other local agencies apply for that help bring needed
funding to the Chicago area. For example, the landmark All Stations
Accessibility Program (ASAP) brings new resources to metro areas, such
as Chicago, with legacy transit systems lacking adequate Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility. Cook County partnered with Metra
on a successful ASAP application in 2022 for the 95th Street/Chicago
State University Metra station, helping better connect a major
educational institution to transit and support revitalization along the
95th Street corridor. The station modernization is also a major part of
the campus master plan developed by Chicago State. The City of Chicago
and Chicago Transit Authority also received a planning grant for this
same corridor.
The West Cook Rail Safety Improvement Project is another example of
how the county partners with other entities to successfully carry out
discretionary federal grants to complete vital projects. Between 2017
and 2021, Cook County had the second highest number of trespass
fatalities of all U.S. counties, with 43 fatalities. The West Cook Rail
Safety Improvement Project will reduce pedestrian safety incidents
along the BNSF line, which is the busiest line for the Metra commuter
rail system as well as a major freight corridor. This corridor is a key
safety hot spot in the county, with a total of 25 pedestrian-involved
injuries or fatalities between 2012 and 2021. The project limits are
along the Metra BNSF line in west suburban Cook County, including the
municipalities of Berwyn, Brookfield, La Grange, and Riverside. Cook
County is implementing the project using a $2.9 million Consolidated
Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant from 2022.
Conclusion
The IIJA and IRA provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fund
our country's transportation network. While there will always be
challenges tied to administering new grant programs, we believe that
Cook County is a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars, and we are
proudly leveraging our own resources to help our communities and
partners secure these discretionary grants for important projects that
may not be funded by any other means. Our Invest in Cook program is an
example of how larger units of government can help smaller communities
be successful in applying for and administering grant funding.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chairman.
In my district, Cook County Department of Transportation
and Highways has done an excellent job at leveraging
discretionary grants from the IIJA at the local level. The
Invest in Cook program makes up to $8.5 million available
annually to support planning, engineering, land acquisition,
and construction of transportation projects. The Invest in Cook
program provides assistance to projects that might otherwise
stall because of a lack of a local match or local resources. In
its first 7 years, the program has awarded $56 million to fund
243 projects.
A question to Ms. O'Leary: Invest in Cook is a great
example of how regional governments can play an important role
in assisting local communities with grant applications, project
data, and funding. This model has been effective for winning
IIJA discretionary grants throughout my district. Your council
seems to have found a similarly effective approach. Can we
encourage standards and best practices to be more widely
adopted so that more counties can leverage this funding, in
your opinion?
Ms. O'Leary. Yes, thank you so much.
I would like to say that building local capacity is really
right up the alley of the MPOs and the regional governments
that you mentioned, as well, and the great program that you
just described. That is exactly what we try to do at SEMCOG,
and many of us across the country that are the MPOs or the
council of governments do for our membership, is to be able to
provide that capacity building, get people together, make sure
they know about the grant opportunities, and help them figure
out what is the right grant to apply for, what is the criteria,
what is their chance of success. Because it is expensive to
apply, and we want to make sure that we are connecting all of
the data and information that we have.
And it sounds like your group is doing exactly the same
thing. So, I do think there is quite an opportunity there for
other MPOs across the country to be able to do that, as well.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Great. Thank you, Ms. O'Leary. Your
testimony also mentions the Safe Streets For All grant program,
and the need for this to become formula funding rather than
discretionary. I know a couple of my colleagues have raised
this issue. How would transitioning to formula funding for this
program impact the amount of funds available for Justice40
communities that need investments the most?
Ms. O'Leary. The reason we thought that it could evolve
into a formula program is one that we mentioned. It really is
an issue across the whole country. We are all struggling with
this issue post-pandemic, and so, formula funds would be
helpful to be able to do that.
But also one of the benefits of formula funds is really
understanding what you are going to receive, for the most part,
every year, and be able to line those projects up and work with
our partners and our local governments over the years. And that
is what we have successfully been able to do with our TAP
program and our CMAQ and our carbon reduction programs, so that
we are all working together and we know what to expect every
year. And I think that's what we thought would be the benefit
of moving it to a formula program.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. So, the certainty and the
predictability would be----
Ms. O'Leary . Absolutely.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois . A big asset to you
all. Well, thank you so much.
I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Thank you very much. I now will take
us to the free State of Florida, where I recognize myself for
just a brief series of questions.
Guys, you're doing great.
Mr. Secretary, what an honor it is to have you also from
the free State of Florida. Would you agree that Florida is on
fire right now? Florida's population has just skyrocketed and
continues to skyrocket every day. Would you agree with that?
Mr. Perdue. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Not only is our population
skyrocketing, but also the number of people that visit Florida
has skyrocketed.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Very good. And not only are they
building houses and condos and residential units, we need
roads, and we need those roads that have already been there
repaired. Is that a fair statement?
Mr. Perdue. That is a fair statement.
Mr. Bean of Florida. And it is a challenge. You do have to
do it smarter, faster than everybody else to keep up.
Would you also say that--some would argue--Florida doesn't
get its fair share of transportation dollars? Is that a fair
statement? Could you argue that?
Mr. Perdue. That is definitely a fair statement in terms of
discretionary grant distribution.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Very good. Speaking of discretionary,
some would say that we should do away with them because
transportation departments don't work with local governments.
Is that true? And how do we do it in Florida?
Mr. Perdue. That is 100 percent inaccurate. And thank you
for bringing that up.
Actually, local governments and local communities are
really the heart and soul of every single transportation
project, regardless if it is a road project, a transit project,
seaport, airport. Transportation infrastructure goes through an
extensive process of grassroots planning at the local community
level.
As a matter of fact, every transportation project that we
deliver as a State DOT is conceived of and prioritized by the
local community before we ever spend $1 on it.
Mr. Bean of Florida. That is the type of--that is what we
want to see. Members of Congress--I was, as you know, in the
Florida Senate for 10 years. We put our money where our mouth
is because we didn't get, we think, our share, but it demands
it. Those roads have to be built, have to be maintained. But
the only way to do it is, as you said, is the coordination with
local governments. We are all in it together.
So, Florida is just--everybody is coming to Florida. Maybe
there is a State law that in the Northeast, if you turn 70, you
have to move to Florida.

Mr. Bean of Florida. That's a joke. That's not really what
happens, but it seems like it does.
So, how do you do it? I know there is an initiative, Moving
Florida Forward. Would you talk about that--maybe other States
are listening--of how to get it done?
Mr. Perdue. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And having been
in the State legislature, you know we have a very solid history
in Florida of our legislature continuously investing in
transportation infrastructure.
Governor DeSantis has been a tremendous leader in that. As
a matter of fact, we have had record numbers of general revenue
surplus. And it was through his initiative called Moving
Florida Forward that the legislature invested another $4
billion in general revenue surplus into our already record work
program, which was about $65 billion over 4 years. And so, that
is tremendous. And it has enabled us to move many major complex
projects forward, like I-4 in central Florida, that a lot of
people know. Even if they don't live there, they know it. We
have been able to move those projects forward in a time when it
is very difficult to get our hands on Federal funding through
the discretionary process.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Is there a secret sauce to getting
projects done on time and under budget?
Mr. Perdue. It takes extensive work with local communities
generating that grassroots support, which is something that we
have really learned to value at Florida DOT.
Every single community is different. Every single community
has its own character, its own vision. Making sure that the
projects we deliver are aligned with their goals and their
values and their vision for the future will speed it up like
you have never seen.
Mr. Bean of Florida. Fantastic. Thank you so much, Mr.
Secretary.
I now take us back to North Carolina, where Representative
Foushee, you are recognized. Good morning.
Mrs. Foushee. Good morning, and thank you. And thank you to
the witnesses for being here with us today.
We know that discretionary grants are a vital part of our
funding infrastructure that make our infrastructure projects
like roads and bridges and our transportation projects like
rail lines and new buses possible. I am thankful for the Biden
administration's work on expanding discretionary funding
opportunities, and glad to say that my district, NC04, has
received over $130 million in discretionary funding in recent
fiscal years.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law appropriated billions of
dollars for infrastructure programs, many of those dollars
being available through competitive grant programs. Now that
these funds are available, we must make sure that DOT has the
resources necessary to administer them in a way that is
accessible for our stakeholders. I look forward to hearing from
you on the ways that you would like to see the discretionary
grant process improved, and how we can work together to ensure
the process realizes its full potential.
My first question is for anyone who would like to weigh in.
I would like to ask about Notices of Funding Opportunity, or
NOFOs, and the information provided to stakeholders when
applying for these grants. What additional information or
resources can DOT provide to improve the clarity of NOFOs or
answer any questions stakeholders may have when applying?

Mrs. Foushee. Not all at once.
Mr. Baker. Well, I think we have discussed that I think
everyone here would welcome help building capacity, especially
of smaller applicants who struggle to deal with the
bureaucracy.
But I do also think there is an opportunity for DOT to
simplify the NOFOs. I don't know that making them ever more
complex, and then offering ever more resources to help people
deal with ever more complexity is a productive way to view it
as much as it is they could be much simpler, there could be
standardized templates, they could be shorter. There is, I
think, a big opportunity for DOT to get to the point quicker.
It doesn't need to be a 40-page NOFO for a small applicant
to access a small grant program.
Mrs. Foushee. Others?
Mr. Winders. Representative----
Mrs. Foushee . Well, my second question is
for Ms. O'Leary.
As the executive director of the Southeast Michigan Council
of Governments, I am sure you have helped many local
governments through the grant process. You alluded to some of
those in your testimony. What are some of the top issues you
see local governments experience when applying for
discretionary funding?
And what recommendations do you have for streamlining the
application process through DOT?
Ms. O'Leary. I would say the top issues that we see are a
lot of what has been spoken about, one is connecting with the
right grant. There are a lot of opportunities, so, which grant
fits with my project. And so, we try to talk to them about what
are you really trying to achieve, what is your project, or what
is the issue that you are having? And then some of us who have
the knowledge of the grant programs could help connect them to
the right grant to apply for.
The second is really, as was spoken of, the cost to apply
for the grants can be an impediment to some to be able to
apply, especially if they don't have a grant writer on staff.
The amount of money really varies, depending on--if it is a
more small planning grant, it could be $10,000 to $20,000. I am
seeing $40,000 with our Safe Streets For All application, but
that was planning more related. And then, as you get into the
RAISE-- you have much more experience over here
with what those costs would be.
And then I think the match. That is a concern for people,
as well. Especially as the projects get larger, the ability to
match, especially in our underserved areas, is very difficult
for them to be able to take it on and be able to do the match.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you. I see my time is approaching.
I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito . I now recognize Mr. Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for being here. I appreciate your testimony.
Secretary Perdue, I know a lot of folks who were excited
about the infrastructure bill and the suggestion that it was
going to provide increased funds for things like roads and
bridges. In my home State of Louisiana, we have seen where the
assumption of an increase in funding has been more than
consumed by the bureaucracy, by inflation, by supply chain, by
labor. Are you seeing similar outcomes in Florida?
Mr. Perdue. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. And absolutely, we
are. As a matter of fact, if you look at the increase in the
cost of doing business over the last 3 years, the actual
increase of the formula distribution in IIJA was not even
enough to fully cover the cost of inflation. It basically came
just in the nick of time.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, and that is what we are
seeing at home, as well.
Another question for you. Your testimony was fascinating in
that you indicated $150,000 in terms of the cost of applying
for some of these discretionary grant programs.
I want to make note, Mr. Chairman, you can buy a home for
$150,000 in a lot of the communities that I represent in south
Louisiana. So, it is an extraordinary cost.
And you indicated that millions of dollars that
cumulatively you have spent applying for discretionary grants,
yet not seeing the outcomes or performance that you think is
fair to the State of Florida. What do you attribute, one, the
higher cost--and I know you talked about this a little bit,
but, one, the higher cost; and secondly, just the lack of
performance of your grant applications compared to what you
have seen historically?
Mr. Perdue. Well, to start with, the lack of performance, I
am not really sure why we are not being awarded grants. I mean,
we have world-class infrastructure in Florida, just like many
other States. Quite honestly, it doesn't make sense. I mean,
right now we are at 1 percent of grant awards. We have the
third largest population in the Nation, so, it just doesn't
make sense.
Now, with discretionary grants, inherently, there is an
assumption that it is competitive. And so, every entity
pursuing grants wants to produce and submit the best possible
application they can submit. This takes time. This takes
resources. We are seeing the cost of preparing an application
continue to increase. And I would say the more awards we don't
receive, the more we try to figure out what more do we need to
do to receive a grant because we are just not real sure
anymore. And it's becoming a real struggle, and we don't get a
lot of feedback on why we are not being awarded grants.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And in
that regard, I used to run a multibillion-dollar infrastructure
program. And I know that certainty and predictability and clear
criteria was always something that was very helpful to us. And
in this case, this administration has brought new criteria to
the table, including under the auspices of Justice40, which
implicates over $200 billion in funds, effectively setting
aside 40 percent of it for this criteria that I believe really
distorts or provides a lack of clarity for criteria related to
transportation.
For example, some of the criteria that was brought to the
table to determine where grants for transportation projects
will be issued are things like climate change, racial equity,
enhancing union opportunities, things that don't really have
criteria that are traditionally applied to transportation
projects.
Have those criteria that--I will say it again, it's not
time saved in traffic, reduced emissions, safety improvements,
things that are historically criteria that apply to
transportation projects--has that complicated your ability to
figure out how to apply or how to compete for some of these
discretionary grants?
Mr. Perdue. Yes, it has. And you are exactly right, they've
brought a lot of requirements to the table that are not
directly connected to infrastructure that we are supposed to be
building and delivering for the residents of Florida.
And I will go back to this statement: The infrastructure
that is in the pipeline has been planned for the last 15 to 20
years by our local communities. They built models, they used
data, they used science to determine what was going to be
needed 15 to 20 years in the future. What transportation
providers find themselves doing are trying to figure out ways
to take the infrastructure in the pipeline and shoehorn it back
into these random requirements that are being included in
NOFOs.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. That is very helpful, thank you.
Mr. Winders, you noted that the complexity of complying
with Federal regulatory requirements is incredibly costly in
terms of trying to advance projects that are priority for you.
Can you talk a little bit more about maybe the comparison of
projects that you have built without Federal funds using State
and local that don't trigger Federal regulatory requirements,
as compared to those that do trigger Federal regulatory
requirements?
Mr. Winders. Yes, thank you for the question.
The projects that we do with local county money, the
requirements are much less onerous. There are State
requirements, of course, but we can budget, we can budget and
execute the projects. We build several bridges every year, and
it's much quicker.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Last quick question. Do you trash
the environment when you build projects without complying with
Federal requirements?
Mr. Winders. No sir, we do not.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I didn't think so. Thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. D'Esposito. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes
Ms. Scholten for 5 minutes.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you so much
to our witnesses for being here today. It is especially great
to see a representative from my home State, the great State of
Michigan.
Ms. O'Leary, you spoke in your testimony about how the
simplification of the grant application process would help make
funds from key pieces of legislation, such as the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, more accessible to smaller and less
resourced communities.
As a member of both this committee and the Small Business
Committee, I understand how many hurdles there are in these
grant application processes. We actually hired a specific
grants and outreach coordinator in our office just to help
address a lot of these issues. What specific hurdles come to
mind for you, and what would that process for simplifying the
grant application look like to you?
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you. It's great to see you.
Well, our local governments have a lot of issues relating
to applying for the grants. And I think one of the big problems
is just really connecting what grants need to be applied for
for what projects. And having that guidance can be a challenge.
And that is where regions are trying to play that role to
really understand--we play that role on a lot of things,
whether we try to understand a grant program or understand a
regulation. Our local governments are really busy running their
government, and so, we need to be able to play that role and
say, OK, we as regional entities can talk to you about here are
the grant applications, here are the ones that would fit with
what you want to get done.
So, that is one of the number-one things I talk to them
about is what are the issues you are hearing? We brought
together 35 to 40 mayors. They are meeting again tomorrow to
talk about what are their issues in their community. And
infrastructure was still the number-one thing they said, both
transportation and water infrastructure, and lack of capacity
to be able to apply for the grants.
Ms. Scholten. Yes, yes, thank you. You also cite the
importance of helping communities prepare for extreme weather
events that are becoming more frequent with climate change. To
that end, what could the PROTECT discretionary grant program do
for communities like those in southeast Michigan experiencing
extreme weather events like the August 2023 floods?
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you. Well, we are pretty excited about
the PROTECT grant, both on the planning side--we are a regional
planning agency, of course--but also on the implementation
side. Being able to develop a transportation resiliency plan
will actually lower the match for those that then apply for
PROTECT implementation dollars, which is--one reason to do it,
right, is to be able to address the match issue for our
communities.
But what we have also seen is, with the amount of rain and
flooding and flooding disasters that we are having in our
region, the infrastructure isn't going to handle that amount of
rain, and we can't build ourselves out of it. We can't pull all
the infrastructure out and put larger pipes everywhere.
So, what we are trying to do, which we think is pretty
innovative, is looking at the PROTECT funds to figure out where
in the region does it make sense to store large amounts of
floodwater above ground using large-scale green infrastructure
or other techniques because our region and many urban areas are
very complicated. You can't just put the water in one spot and
think it is going to work. You have to understand how the sewer
system and the stormwater system work together. And so, we are
excited about that opportunity to be able to identify actual
locations that then can lead to implementation dollars.
Ms. Scholten. Yes, that is fantastic. We look forward to
continuing to work with you on that, as well. Using my last
minute here to stay on the theme of water, in my district over
in west Michigan, water is critically important. It is a way of
life for all of us in Michigan. But the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law's unprecedented investment in communities is
already being felt. Earlier this year, the EPA announced $177
million for Michigan drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater
infrastructure upgrades. Essential. I can think of places to
put that just within Michigan 3.
Everyone deserves access to clean water, but we know well
in Michigan that aging infrastructure has not been replaced at
the rate that it needs to, and can lead to really detrimental
results. So, if you can stay on that theme a little bit and
speak to specifically for clean water, drinking water, how will
this impact these funds, the State, going forward?
Ms. O'Leary. Sure. Well, we have done an analysis in our
region where we need $3 billion a year for the next 20 years
just to keep our infrastructure at a level of good service. So,
that is not even managing the amount of new rainfall that we
are seeing in the region and the improvements that you need to
see at a wastewater treatment plant. That is $3 billion a year
just in southeast Michigan. So, it is a huge investment that is
needed.
And in our State, the lack of being able to do stormwater
utilities is a real challenge. And so, we are trying to address
that at the State level. The program dollars through the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are unprecedented, but we need to
remember a lot of those are loans, right? They go into the SRF
program and they need to be paid back. And local governments
sometimes don't have the ability to pay them back.
Ms. Scholten. Yes.
Ms. O'Leary. So, principal forgiveness is a big part of
that.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. That is very helpful.
I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The
Chair now recognizes Mr. Burchett.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is for Mr.
Baker.
The Department of Transportation seems to be increasingly
requiring applicants to focus on merit criteria, and this is
like our President's climate equity and justice goals. And some
of these are very woke. Would you say that these criteria are
useful for evaluating funding for short line rail and regional
rail applicants?
And do you think the Department of Transportation's grant
application process is intuitive for applicants?
Mr. Baker. Well, answering the second question first, it's
not intuitive. It's a big hurdle. I think we have talked a lot
about that this morning already.
For small applicants, particularly short lines who might be
applying for one grant in the history of their company, it's a
big hurdle to clear. And I think there is a lot of room for the
process to be simplified. And I think that would be a ripe area
for Congress to require in the next reauthorization.
To answer your first question on the merit criteria, I
would say a lot of that is not a real natural fit for a short
line railroad application kind of one way or the other. And you
do have to bend yourself into pretzels a little bit trying to
apply.
I will say, to be fair, it hasn't been a huge hassle at the
end of the day for short lines. And there are some aspects of
short lines where we serve rural and disadvantaged areas, and
there are small companies that are good for the environment
that are a reasonable fit. So, we've learned to live with it,
but it's not a natural fit.
Mr. Burchett. Well, what would you recommend to the
Department of Transportation, just point blank?
Mr. Baker. Thank you. I think there is a lot of room for
improvement. I have hit on a few of them.
I think for CRISI in particular, there is an opportunity to
focus that program more on freight rail, with passenger rail
having a dedicated access to the other $58 billion of the $66
billion in rail from IIJA.
I also think that predictable timing on the grant programs,
where you would know in advance it is going to come out at the
same time every year; doing one NOFO at a time, as opposed to
the combining. The combining really creates kind of a lumpy
program that is hard to predict and hard to plan on. And then I
do think, from Congress' point of view, the advance
appropriations really do help make the program function and
make it predictable. Trying to count on a program that is at
the vagaries of an annual appropriations process is going to
be--it is just hard to make any long-term planning based on
that.
Mr. Burchett. It was stated in other earlier testimony that
the expense of doing this seemed to be kind of exorbitant. How
do you absorb that, or how do you prepare for that type of
thing? Is that something you know in advance what it's going to
cost you, the time it takes? Or is it just--it seems like a
moving target.
Mr. Baker. For me still?
Mr. Burchett. Yes, either one of you. I know Mr. Winders--
it looks like he is itching to answer.
So, go ahead, brother.
Mr. Winders. Thank you, Representative. Itching to answer
may be a slight overstatement, but----
Mr. Burchett . Well, you were reaching
towards the buzzer, so, I will----
Mr. Winders . Yes, sir, I was.
Mr. Burchett. I will let you go, brother.
Mr. Winders. Yes, sir, I was. The question was what can be
done with the program, or how do we prepare for the costs. And
the way we prepare for the cost is, we have to keep our costs
down very low. We don't have the ability to throw a lot of
resources for a grant program that, in our experience, the
playing field is slanted against us, and we are probably not
going to get anyway. So, it keeps us from being able to do
that.
When we do need to do that, our coalition--as when we did
the benefit-cost analysis--was able to pool some resources and
pay for that.
Mr. Burchett. Do you have any way to share that information
with, maybe not your competitors, but people in an area where
you are not, and maybe figure something out?
Because it just seems to me this is--these things are
always--I guess they start out maybe in a good spot, but they
always end up helping the big boys or somebody who is connected
with somebody. And to me, that just stinks.
Mr. Winders. Yes, yes, we would like to--we would
definitely like the playing field to be competitive. We think
our project and many others in rural America will compete as a
road, but they won't necessarily compete on all the other
criteria that you mentioned, Representative.
Mr. Burchett. I always say we need to put the best players
in, Coach. And if the NFL was Congress, Peyton Manning would
probably still be waiting to get in. So, thank you all so much.
I have 5 seconds, and I will yield that back to the
committee because I am very generous like that, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, sir. The Chair now recognizes
Mr. Payne for 5 minutes.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank our
witnesses for offering their testimony today.
Ms. O'Leary, in your testimony, you mentioned how the
Southeast Michigan Council of Governments strategically works
with the local partners to determine the best entity to apply
for grant opportunities. Through this process, what have your
local partners learned about the grant application process?
And has this spurred them to pursue additional funding from
the Federal Government?

Mr. Payne. For competitive grants. I am sorry.
Ms. O'Leary. OK, thank you. I have a couple of examples.
One is under our Safe Streets For All application. We
brought together local communities to talk about what their
projects might be in our region. And in that first round, we
consolidated about 30 local governments to submit their ideas,
and we vetted them through, and we also included safety audits
from SEMCOG. And actually, that time we weren't successful in
getting it. We received the money to do the safety audits, but
not to be able to do those individual community projects.
So, we had a conversation with the Federal Government about
what was needed to improve our application the next time, which
we did. And we were happy that we received $10 million that now
we are able to pass through to our communities directly. So,
that's one way we have brought them all together.
The other is right now we are meeting with counties and
cities together to apply for the Climate Pollution Reduction
Grants, which I know is under the IRA. But we are bringing all
of them together to look at what are the topics that are the
most strategic to apply for, and we will be applying for a set
of money as a region representing all of those entities again,
and passing through to them.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Mr. Baker, I appreciated that your testimony refers to the
need for funding predictability for rail. Thanks to the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we now are operating with 5
years of guaranteed funding for freight and passenger rail.
Unfortunately, we are still dealing with the
unpredictability of the annual appropriations process. Thank
goodness we were able to reject the 65-percent cuts to Amtrak
funding, including a 93-percent cut to funding for the
Northeast Corridor, along with elimination of certain grant
programs that some Republicans initially proposed.
What does that funding certainty mean for rail?
Mr. Baker. Thank you for the question. The advance
appropriations, I have said earlier, is a game changer for
rail. We have never had that before for--obviously, I represent
the freight rail side and the short line freight rail side, and
I don't get to speak for my Amtrak friends, but I feel
confident in saying everyone in the rail industry recognizes
the total shift in reality that the advance appropriations
allowed.
And it's a long-term business. We are on year 197 of
railroading in the United States. It's the kind of thing you--
we have rail in place from 1895, and we have locomotives that
last 50 years long. It's big, heavy investments. They need to
last a long time. They take long planning horizons. And waking
up each year and seeing what the appropriations process
provided is just not a realistic way to do it if you are
serious about the program trying to be effective. So, the
advance appropriations is a huge deal.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, yes, and these are the types of
efforts that on this side of the aisle, we have tried to make
in order to move everyone forward in a positive manner. And
predictability is the key to saving money and having great
success.
So, with that, sir, I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito. The gentleman yields. The Chair now
recognizes himself for 5 minutes.
I want to thank you all for being here this morning--I
guess now this afternoon.
Mr. Baker, short line railroads are important to this
Nation. And Long Island, where I am from, is not excluded. The
New York and Atlantic Railway provides freight services on
lines owned by the Long Island Rail Road, transporting food
products, building materials, waste and recyclables, among
other products to and from local, critical, important industry.
This railroad is vitally important to my district and the
rest of Long Island, Brooklyn, Queens, and the outer boroughs,
as it forms a critical link connecting industries to the entire
North American freight railroad network. The railcars that
travel also remove over 120,000 heavy-truck trips from the
roads and highways of New York City and reduce transportation
emissions by 75 percent. It is important that short line
railroads such as the NYA are supported and have access to
expedient Federal funding.
As you mentioned, short lines became eligible for the
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements
program administered by the Federal Railroad Administration to
replace, upgrade, rehabilitate, and provide funding for
countless other investments. Can you just explain why these
grants are so critically important, and why we need to continue
funding them?
Mr. Baker. Thank you very much. The NYA is a unique short
line, but at the end of the day, there are 600 short lines and
they all have their own unique story. One of the things they
have in common is they tend to be small businesses with a
limited amount of customers, limited amount of revenue, but
very, very expensive infrastructure to maintain.
Blessedly, from the very beginning of the short line world,
Congress--both sides of the aisle--has really seen the public
policy benefit in helping support short lines and allow them to
preserve and maintain that infrastructure, and CRISI has really
taken that to a new level. We are very, very appreciative. I
tried to start and end my testimony with that. We do have
plenty of constructive suggestions for how it can work better,
but CRISI is crucial to short lines, and the New York and
Atlantic is a great success story, and you probably did my job
better than I could do it with all those trucks off the road in
such a busy area. It's a big success.
Mr. D'Esposito. So, I think one of the criticisms that we
have heard, and it is not just to this specific grant program,
but I think grant funding programs, it is just--it is a
problem--is the idea of when the grants are actually announced
and when they are obligated or implemented. So, what can the
DOT do better to make sure that that funding--like, so, when it
is announced, the money is actually delivered much more
expediently so it could be invested in infrastructure?
Mr. Baker. Yes, the premise of your question is right on.
It is an amazing delay. I mean, we have $6 or $7 million grants
for basic track rehab, you know, replace ties and rail. And it
can be 3 years later by the time you are done with getting a
categorical exclusion from the NEPA process and getting a
historic preservation review.
And so, there are big opportunities for streamlining, and I
think that would be a fantastic place for Congress to be pretty
specific in the next reauthorization about mandating that
streamlining.
And I also think, as we spoke earlier, I think public
accountability and transparency, putting these projects on some
sort of dashboard, which I recognize would take a fair amount
of work at FRA, and the staff would have to be paid for. But
being public about where all these projects stand and what
stage they are in, I think, would help. And people would say,
why have some of them advanced and the rest are sitting around
not moving?
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Baker.
And again, thank you all for being here. I now recognize
Mr. Stanton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
to the witnesses for being here today.
Successful implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law is our shared priority. And you, as key stakeholders, help
us evaluate that effectiveness. So, it is appreciated.
Arizona, my home State, has received millions and millions
in discretionary competitive grants. We benefited from a $25
million RAISE grant that is funding the construction of a Rio
Salado bike and pedestrian bridge, allowing the community to
cross the riverbed, an alignment with 3rd Street connecting our
community, promoting sustainability, advancing our shared
vision for Rio Reimagined.
Recently, we had an even bigger win. In January, Arizona
received nearly $100 million in a competitive INFRA grant from
the U.S. Department of Transportation for major improvements to
widen Interstate 10, a major corridor important not just to
Arizona but to the entire country. The grant was awarded to
improve the safety conditions on the 26-mile stretch of I-10,
located entirely within the boundaries of the Gila River Indian
Community.
That is what I want to raise today: the experience of our
Tribes and Tribal governments, our Nation and nation partners
in the discretionary grant programs authorized by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Overall, the Department of
Transportation has made improvements. There are over 155 grant
programs that specifically make Tribal governments eligible for
funding. These programs range from broadband, highway safety,
clean power, and resilience.
However, the discretionary grant system is set up in a way
that does not always work well for our Tribal partners. Many
grants, especially larger dollar grants like INFRA and Mega
programs, are only successful when States make the application.
Tribes can't make the application directly with the Federal
Government. Tribal governments are our sovereign Federal
partners. And despite the nation-to-nation relationship with
our Tribes, Tribal governments often have to work underneath
local and State governments to apply for these discretionary
grants, even when they are technically eligible for the grant,
they have the technical capability to apply for and implement
the grant. Many matching grants create barriers. Sometimes
there is a 20-, 25-percent match requirement with a minimum of
$1 million or more. Tribal partners are deterred from applying,
and even when they do have capacity and work with State and
other partners, it is not always clear that the grant
applications are made on behalf of the Tribe.
In my State, the Gila River Indian Community applied for a
different discretionary grant funding for the I-10 widening for
years. Last year, when they were denied the Mega grant, it was
in part because they scored low on the equity portion, despite
being a Tribal government applying for these resources.
Eventually, the Arizona Department of Transportation, working
with many partners in the State, was able to secure an INFRA
grant. But there is still much work to do to ensure our Tribes
and Tribal governments, our Nation and nation partners, are
front and center as we evaluate a discretionary competitive
grant.
So, the bottom line is the system does not work as well as
it could for Tribes. I know that the self-governance of Tribes
works. I see it in my State over and over and over again, as we
have more than 20 outstanding Tribes that do great work,
professional work, and they deserve that support. We don't have
a witness here speaking on behalf of Tribes today, but some
stakeholders like the National Association of Counties, I want
to give them a shout out. They work hard to bring Tribal
partners on their boards, on their working committees, et
cetera.
But ultimately, we need to do more, and I hope I can work
with my colleagues here and stakeholders in front of us today
to improve the system, make sure we evaluate the needs and
sovereignty of our Tribal partners, and make sure the grant
program works better for them.
With that I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Ezell . The gentleman yields. The Chair
recognizes Sheriff Nehls.
Sheriff.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being
here.
Mr. Baker, Mr. Perdue--Mr. D'Esposito just talked about
grants, how we can--you mentioned streamlining grants,
transparency, efficiency. Mr. Perdue, we talked a little bit
about that with some of the other--this is Congress. This is
Washington, DC. Those words really don't exist in Washington,
DC, talking about streamlining and transparency, and it
certainly doesn't exist with this administration.
Mr. Winders, you oversee National Association of Counties,
right? How many counties in this great country of ours? I have
an idea, but why don't you share with us?
Mr. Winders. About 3,000----
Mr. Nehls . 3,000? That's exactly right,
3,000 counties across the entire country.
Did you know that in 2020, Joe Biden won 509 of them, 16-
point-something percent, 16 percent of counties? I think it
would be good food, good thought here to--would you get back
with me and let me know about these grants and how many of
those grants, these grants that people are applying for, are
going to the 509 counties? The lowest number ever, ever, ever a
President wins the election. He won it with just 509 counties,
16 percent. I am kind of curious what it would look like to see
where these grants, these discretionary grants are going. Maybe
you can help me out with that a little later on.
I will tell you, Mr. Baker, I thank you for being here. I
chair the railroads, right, the Subcommittee on Railroads,
Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. And I love it. I love CRISI
grants. I think they are good. I believe it helps the Class
II's, the Class III's, and I like that robust funding. I have
spoken to Administrator Bose on this, and I support that
because I think that it's all about safety.
But we don't talk too much about the grade crossing
elimination act. You know, the grade crossing. Now, how much
money is in there for the grade crossings?
Mr. Baker. The grade separation program has $600 million a
year, guaranteed.
Mr. Nehls. $600 million. Is that enough?
Mr. Baker. That would do about 20 or 30 a year.
Mr. Nehls. Yes, yes, yes.
Mr. Baker. And there are thousands that----
Mr. Nehls . Listen, I had a hearing on this
about a month or so ago. We were talking about--and I hear from
all the individuals involved, and they said that is where the
real danger lies, in cars, people going through the gates, some
of them don't have gates, individuals being run over by trains,
all sorts of issues at these grade crossings. So, I like the
idea, and I am assuming you would support that.
Maybe even you, Ms. O'Leary, that we need to do something
about actually addressing an issue, and the issue is I think
there are 220,000 grade crossings across the entire country,
so, we should be addressing those. We should be really, really
passionate about that. Would you all agree with that?
Mr. Baker. I would certainly agree with that. About 95
percent--and I know you know this--about 95 percent of the
fatalities on the rail industry are grade crossings and
trespassing. And it is unfortunately expensive. So, it is a
real challenge for the country. But separating the crossing--
the safest crossing is one that doesn't exist.
Mr. Nehls. I am with you.
Ms. O'Leary, what do you think?
Ms. O'Leary. I agree with you.
Mr. Nehls. Oh, thank you so much.
Ms. O'Leary. You are welcome.
Mr. Nehls. Mr. Perdue, I am from the great State of Texas,
buddy. Did you say you are getting 1 percent? Is it a little
over 1?
Mr. Perdue. That is correct. Just over 1 percent of the
distribution.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. You know where we are, the great State of
Texas? A lot of people come to us too, buddy. A lot of people--
--
Mr. Perdue . It is not much higher than that.
Mr. Nehls. Ah, a little less than 2, a little less than 2.
We gained two seats in the House because everybody is leaving
these other States, coming to your great State, coming to my
great State. They are fleeing the oppression.
And our formula is around 10 percent, and we are getting
less than 2. How do you feel about that? Do you think that DOT
is distributing these grants fairly? Would you say they are
distributing them fairly?
Mr. Perdue. I would say thus far it's certainly not
commensurate with population, lane-miles, vehicle-miles
traveled. Definitely not. Our formula allocation is around 5
percent, and we have only seen 1 percent of grant awards.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. Well, I appreciate all the panel for being
here. And it would just be a treat for the American people to
see Congress working for them.
We talked about cost overruns. I think Mr. Rouzer was
talking North Carolina, about--let's just say a $1 million
project. Now, after 3 years, all the redtape, NEPA, all this
other stuff, environmental impact, it is $1.2 million. Who
covers the other $200 million? In your testimony I think it is
the State DOTs and the local stakeholders. Is that right?
Mr. Perdue. Yes, Congressman. That is exactly right.
Mr. Nehls. Yes.
Mr. Perdue. I mean, State DOT, we have to cover the cost
increases and balance our finances.
I would say for local governments, local communities, other
entities that are much smaller, it is very difficult to
manage----
Mr. Nehls . I would make an assumption,
because of the inefficiency, some of the projects they say we
can't do it anymore. We can't afford to come up with the over
cost overrun. Can't do it.
Mr. Perdue. That has happened.
Mr. Nehls. Just eliminate it. Shameful. We can do better.
I yield back.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr.
Menendez for 5 minutes.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chair, and I appreciate all the
witnesses for appearing here today, and their thoughtful
testimony.
I am proud to say that my district has received over $11
billion in discretionary grants from the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act. And after the prior testimony, I would
just remind everyone that there is a project in every single
congressional district, red and blue States, rural and urban,
that is funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
So, we are putting this money to work across the entire
country, regardless of whether those Members voted for the bill
in the 117th Congress.
These funds are being used for several exciting projects in
my district, including improving and updating the Bayonne
Drydock, electrifying ferries in Elizabeth, improving road
safety in Jersey City, and for the Gateway Program. The Gateway
Program is the most urgent infrastructure project in the entire
country. The Northeast Corridor is the most heavily used
passenger rail line in the United States. The section that goes
through my district, New Jersey's Eighth Congressional
District, handles 450 trains per day and over 200,000 daily
Amtrak and New Jersey transit passenger trips. This project is
important not just for my district, but for the New Jersey-New
York metropolitan region and for anyone traveling on the
Northeast Corridor.
Ms. O'Leary, your testimony touches on the importance of
INFRA and RAISE grants. As I just mentioned, our district has
benefited from these programs, and the funds will go towards
critical infrastructure projects. Can you talk more about the
importance of consistency in funding these programs?
Specifically, how does consistency impact regions and
States' ability to plan for large projects such as the Gateway
Program?
Ms. O'Leary. Thank you. Yes, consistency is very important
with these programs.
And I would say in Michigan, or at least in southeast
Michigan, prior to BIL, our ability to receive a lot of the
RAISE funding and the predecessor names of that funding was
more limited. The increased funding that has been available now
through INFRA and RAISE has led to more projects in our region,
one being the largest project on Mound Road, which I spoke to
in my testimony, is the largest nonstate-funded project in the
country, at $100 million, to upgrade the transportation along
the economic development corridor of the defense industry.
Mr. Menendez. I appreciate that. How would making these
programs mandatory or formula-based impact planning for large
projects?
Ms. O'Leary. I am sorry, could you repeat----
Mr. Menendez. Sure. How would making these programs
mandatory or formula-based impact planning for large-scale
projects?
Ms. O'Leary. Well, what we see is, with the formula funds,
there is not enough of them to be able to do these large
projects in our region. So, I don't know if there is ever going
to be enough formula funds to be able to do the kinds of
projects that INFRA and RAISE are able to do.
And so, knowing that there is--even though they are
discretionary, they are consistently coming out at a certain
amount of money every year gives us the consistency that we
need and the reliability to be able to get ahead of applying
for them a couple of years down the road, so that we are
properly prepared with our applications.
Mr. Menendez. Sure, I appreciate that. And how does
operating under a continuing resolution impact these projects,
specifically as it relates to planning and cost?
Ms. O'Leary. Operating under the continuing resolution has
been a challenge more for the communities that have combined
these ideas with congressionally directed spending projects,
and not being able to move on those, and trying to figure out
if those projects are really going to go or not go, and if they
should apply for grant funds instead.
So, the continuing resolution has been difficult in the
planning for all infrastructure projects, especially--you are
playing the waiting game for projects that are in the
congressionally directed spending right now.
Mr. Menendez. Right, and it is an allocation of time and
resources, and thinking through what the different funding
opportunities are, and not having that confidence makes you
sort of question which path you should go. And that makes--I
imagine it makes it more difficult to plan, especially on these
large-scale projects.
Ms. O'Leary. Yes, agreed.
Mr. Menendez. All right. I appreciate it.
I yield back.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr.
Yakym.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our
witnesses for being here today.
It is an important hearing that we are having today on the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, which
represented over $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, with a
dramatic increase in discretionary spending.
But each hearing examining IIJA, I only grow more concerned
that the American people aren't getting enough bang for their
buck. I can tell you that in my home State of Indiana, we
certainly aren't. We rank dead last on a per capita basis in
securing IIJA discretionary grants. And that's not just behind
all States. It's behind all Territories, too, including Guam
and American Samoa. Apparently, the Hoosier State just needs a
few more friends at the Department of Transportation.
I have been working with State and local officials to get a
better understanding of why that is, but I am also getting an
earful on the grants that they do manage to win. For example,
let's talk about a lack of clarity. In an attempt to be
helpful, the DOT created a calendar of Notices of Funding
Opportunity, or NOFOs. Despite these good intentions, however,
agencies have missed their own deadlines, which has left at
least one project in my district in a funding lurch.
Let's talk about complex applications. Local stakeholders
are trying their best to keep things ``in house,'' with limited
resources. But the lack of success caused some of them to weigh
the expanded expense of consultants who hopefully know the
secret sauce or buzzwords to get their projects noticed. Others
just aren't bothering to try applying for these funds.
Let's talk about maddening feedback. I appreciate that the
DOT will sit down with those who aren't yet awarded a grant, or
who don't get a grant application. But the feedback can be
exasperating. One local stakeholder whose application was
denied for a planning grant to study a potential grade
separation had a debrief with DOT in which they told them that
they ``might have scored higher if they had included a plan to
add EV charging,'' because what better place to charge an
electric vehicle than under a railroad crossing?
Let's talk about grant agreement delays. For the lucky who
win a grant, the splashy press release goes out but then they
wait 6 to 8 months to finalize the grant agreement. In the
meantime, no work can be done. Then again, it sounds like maybe
they are getting off easy. But the average wait time for a 2021
RAISE grant was nearly 16 months to get an agreement.
And finally, let's talk about inflation. As we all know,
time is money. These delays come at a time of very high
inflation. And let's be clear. The DOT's inflation index for
highway construction is still hitting new highs, meaning
project costs are still ballooning. One locality told me that
it recently won a grant. They are actually giving the money
back to the DOT. Because in all the time that it took to go
through the bureaucracy, the cost of the project tripled.
I know communities and States across the country, including
our witnesses here, are facing the same issues. I hope that we
can look forward to the successor to IIJA as we heed the
experiences and place a renewed emphasis on formula dollars
over discretionary grants. Let's get money to the States who
know which projects need funding, and then get the money out
the door as quickly and efficiently as possible.
I want to return briefly to the topic of discretionary
grants. According to DOT figures, only 93 of 418 grant
agreements have been secured for RAISE grants awarded between
fiscal years 2021 and 2023. And this question is for any
witness. Can you just describe what are the bottlenecks? And
what would you do to speed up the process?
It's like third grade school. So, you can either answer, or
I will start calling on you. So, go ahead, Mr. Baker.
Mr. Baker. That ratio sounds similar to the program I am
most familiar with, which is CRISI. It's slow. It has always
been slow, and it's probably slower now than it used to be, as
the program has gotten bigger as far as getting from
announcement to actual agreement.
How exactly to speed it up inside is a little bit opaque to
grantees on the outside and myself. But I think, frankly,
Congress could essentially just tell them to do it in a future
bill, just mandate that it go quicker. And I think, again,
public transparency, putting it on a dashboard, explaining
what's happening and why. And if it's not done on a certain
timeline, let's say why. And sometimes it's the applicant's
fault, and that's OK. But I think sunshine would fix that, too.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Baker.
And finally, I do just want to say that in order to get
these grants, we have to certify compliance with 75 Federal
laws and regulations plus 12 Executive orders before being
awarded a grant. That seems maddening and dizzying to me. I
think we can do better.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr.
DeSaulnier for 5 minutes.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I request
unanimous consent to enter into today's hearing record four
documents supporting my colleague, Congressman Garamendi's,
questioning today.
Mr. Ezell. Without objection.

Governor Ron DeSantis Signs Largest Tax Relief Package in Florida's
History
by News Releases by Staff

tax-relief-package-in-floridas-history/
Ocala, Fla.--Today, Governor Ron DeSantis signed House Bill 7071
which provides more than $1.2 billion of tax relief for Floridians. The
bill provides for ten sales tax holidays for a variety of items
commonly purchased by Florida families, including fuel, diapers,
disaster supplies and, tools. A one-pager on the bill can be found here
[https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5.6-Sales-Tax-
List.pdf].
``Florida's economy has consistently outpaced the nation, but we
are still fighting against inflationary policies imposed on us by the
Biden administration,'' said Governor Ron DeSantis. ``In Florida, we
are going to support our residents and help them afford the goods that
they need. Florida has been fiscally responsible, so we are in a good
position to provide meaningful relief for families, right now.''
``The Florida House's tax package--the largest middle-class tax
relief package in the history of the state--is now the law of the
land,'' said Speaker Chris Sprowls. ``A bill like this has never been
more needed than it is right now. Reckless federal spending sent
inflation rates spiraling higher than we've seen in generations, and
Floridians are feeling the impacts. From tools to diapers to books for
summer reading, this billion-dollar tax package includes something for
every Floridian, and that's what I'm most proud of. Thank you to Chair
Bobby Payne, the Ways and Means Committee, and to Senate President
Simpson and our Senate counterparts for your leadership and commitment
to keeping money in the pockets of hard-working Floridians.''
``Florida cannot independently fix or outrun all of the problems
leading to the cost increases that are wreaking havoc on families,
especially our most vulnerable,'' said Senate President Wilton Simpson.
``However, we are working to ease the pain with broad-based sales tax
relief and a month-long gas tax holiday. This bill supports growing
families, Floridians looking to prepare their homes for severe weather,
and the blue collar working men and women of our state who are trying
their best to get by amid record-high gas prices and inflation that
many of us have not seen in our lifetime. We are increasing the length
of sales tax holidays for hurricane season and back-to-school, and also
creating new short-term and long-term sales tax relief on key items
needed by families.''
``This year's tax package was truly an effort to benefit every
Floridian in some way,'' said Representative Bobby Payne. ``Giving
people more control over their hard-earned money is the kind of work
that makes me proud to serve in the Florida House. I want to thank
Speaker Sprowls for his support and the opportunity to create the
largest tax exemption package in Florida's history. Additionally, I
want to thank our Senate colleagues and the Governor for his leadership
and for signing this bill today.''
The 10 tax holidays are:
A one-month Fuel Tax Holiday from October 1, through
October 31, 2022, saving Floridians $200 million by lowering the price
of gas by 25.3 cents per gallon.
A 3-month sales tax holiday for children's books from May
14 through August 14, 2022, providing $3.3 million in tax relief.
A one-year sales tax holiday from July 1, 2022, through
June 30, 2023, for baby and toddler clothes and shoes, providing $81.5
million in tax relief.
A one-year sales tax holiday from July 1, 2022, through
June 30, 2023, for children's diapers, providing $38.9 million in tax
relief.
A 14-day Back-to-School sales tax holiday from July 25
through August 7, 2022, for clothing, shoes, backpacks, and school
supplies, providing $100 million in tax relief.
A 14-day Disaster Preparedness sales tax holiday from May
28 through June 10, 2022, for supplies such as flashlights, radios,
tarps, batteries, and fire extinguishers, providing $25.6 million in
tax relief.
A 7-day Tool-Time sales tax holiday from September 3
through September 9, 2022, for tools and other home improvement items,
providing $12.4 million in tax relief.
A two-year sales tax holiday from July 1, 2022, through
June 30, 2024, for impact resistant windows, doors, and garage doors,
providing $442.8 million in tax relief.
A 7-day Freedom Week from July 1 to July 7, 2022,
providing a sales tax exemption for specified admissions and items
related to recreational activities, providing $70.6 million in tax
relief.
A one-year Energy Star Appliances sales tax holiday from
July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023, for washing machines, clothes
dryers, water heaters, and refrigerators, providing $78.5 million in
tax relief.
Additionally, permanent tax relief provided in the legislation
consists of various sales tax exemptions, corporate income tax credit
expansions, and ad valorem tax and exemption provisions that will
generate an additional $190 million in tax savings over two years and
$140 million annually after that.

Motor Fuel Tax Relief 2022, Florida Department of Revenue,

Motor Fuel Tax Relief 2022
October 1-31, 2022
For more information, visit https://floridarevenue.com/MotorFuel/Pages/
default.aspx
The Florida Motor Fuel Tax Relief Act of 2022 reduces the tax rate
on motor fuel by 25.3 cents per gallon. Passed by the Florida
Legislature and signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, the tax rate
reduction begins Saturday, October 1, and extends through Monday,
October 31. The tax rate reduction applies to all gasoline products,
any product blended with gasoline and any fuel placed in the storage
supply tank of a gasoline-powered motor vehicle.
Unlike sales tax, which is assessed on the taxable price of goods
and services, fuel taxes are assessed on gallons when product is
removed from a terminal or imported into Florida. These taxes are
remitted to the state by licensed terminal suppliers and importers who
then pass the fuel taxes down through the supply chain to the ultimate
consumer at the pump. Under Florida law, all segments of the petroleum
industry must pass along the reduced tax rate, so the consumer receives
the full benefit of the tax suspension.

Gas Tax Holiday, Office of the Attorney General, State of Florida,
myfloridalegal.com, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Mark DeSaulnier
Gas Tax Holiday
https://www.myfloridalegal.com/node/9372
Please Note:
Interruptions to gas availability and supplies due to Hurricane Ian
may impact pricing during the Gas Tax Holiday. If you believe that you
witnessed motor fuel pricing that constitutes price gouging under the
Hurricane Ian State of Emergency, please click here for more
information on filing a price gouging complaint.
What is the Gas Tax Holiday?
Pursuant to Florida law, the state gas tax will be reduced by 25.3
cents per gallon on all sales of motor fuel during the month of October
2022. Under this new law, it is unlawful for a terminal supplier,
wholesaler, importer, reseller, or retail dealer of motor fuel to
retain any part of the 25.3 cents per gallon tax reduction or to
interfere with providing the full benefit of the tax reduction to the
consumer.
What is the total amount of the tax reduction during the Gas Tax
Holiday?
25.3 cents per gallon.
Does the Gas Tax Holiday apply to all fuel types?
No. The Gas Tax Holiday does not affect the taxes imposed on diesel
fuel, aviation fuel, or kerosene.
Will we see a 25.3-cent-per-gallon reduction of gas prices at all gas
stations starting on October 1, 2022?
Not necessarily. Florida's tax on gasoline is only one of many
factors that affect the price you pay for gas. Factors aside from the
tax rate may cause the price of gas to fluctuate during the Gas Tax
Holiday.
Further, a gas station is only required to pass on the 25.3-cent-
per-gallon tax reduction to its customers if it purchased gas from its
supplier at the tax-reduced amount. If a gas station does not purchase
gas from its supplier for the tax-reduced amount, then it would not be
required to apply a tax reduction to the price charged at the pump.
Is it possible that some gas stations will not decrease their prices at
all in October of 2022?
Yes. Gas stations that do not purchase tax-reduced gas from their
suppliers would not be required to pass on a tax reduction to their
customers during the Gas Tax Holiday.
During the Gas Tax Holiday, is there a specific price that gas stations
must charge for gas?
No. The Gas Tax Holiday law does not require that gas stations sell
gas for a specific price. The law only requires those gas stations that
buy gas from their suppliers at the tax-reduced amount to pass on those
savings in their sale of gas to the consumer. Please note that market
fluctuations could also affect gas prices at the pump throughout the
Gas Tax Holiday.
If a gas station doesn't reduce the price of its gas in October of
2022, is it considered price gouging?
No. The Florida price gouging law is only enforceable pursuant to a
declared state of emergency in accordance with state statute and only
applies to essential commodities needed as a direct result of the
declared state(s) of emergency within the area for which the state of
emergency is declared. If a state of emergency is declared during the
Gas Tax Holiday (or at any other time) and you witness price gouging on
any essential commodity, including gas, you can find instructions on
how to file a price gouging complaint here.
If I believe that a gas station is violating the Gas Tax Holiday law,
what should I do?
If you suspect a violation of the Gas Tax Holiday law, obtain as
much relevant information as possible and file a complaint with our
Office. Specifically, information regarding the prices being charged by
the gas station, photographs of signs displaying the price(s) of all
grades of gas being sold, and purchase receipts are pieces of
information that could be helpful to our Office in reviewing and
investigating Gas Tax Holiday complaints. Additionally, if you have
information or documentation showing a substantial difference between
the gas price you are reporting and price the gas station charged
immediately prior to the Gas Tax Holiday or in the preceding 48 hours,
please also include that information in your complaint.
Please report any suspected violation online at MyFloridaLegal.com.
Alternatively, if you do not wish to submit your complaint form online,
complaints forms may be printed out and sent by U.S. Mail to:
Department of Legal Affairs, Consumer Protection Division, 3507 East
Frontage Road, Suite 325, Tampa, Florida 33607.
Where can I find additional information regarding the Gas Tax Holiday?
If you have questions not addressed here, you may wish to visit the
Florida Department of Revenue's website at floridarevenue.com or call
Taxpayer Services (8 a.m. ET to 5 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday) at

Holiday.

Here's what you should know about Florida's Motor Fuel Tax Relief
Act of 2022:
What is the Florida gas tax holiday?
The state gas tax was reduced on all sales of motor fuel in
October. Under the law, it is unlawful for a terminal supplier,
wholesaler, importer, reseller, or retail dealer of motor fuel to
retain any part of the tax reduction or to interfere with providing the
full benefit of the tax reduction to the consumer.
How much can consumers save from gas tax holiday?
The state gas tax was reduced by 25.3 cents per gallon.
When is the Florida gas tax holiday?
The tax holiday is in effect from Oct. 1 through Oct. 31.
Can you save at all gas stations?
A gas station is only required to pass on the 25.3-cent-per-gallon
tax reduction to its customers if it purchased gas from its supplier at
the tax-reduced amount. If a gas station does not purchase gas from its
supplier for the tax-reduced amount, then it would not be required to
apply a tax reduction to the price charged at the pump.
Are gas stations required to charge a specific price?
No. The tax holiday law does not require that gas stations sell gas
for a specific price. The law only requires those gas stations that buy
gas from their suppliers at the tax-reduced amount to pass on those
savings in their sale of gas to the consumer.
What about diesel fuel or other types of fuel?
The reduced tax rate does not apply to diesel fuel, aviation fuel
or kerosene.
Did the price go down by 25 cents at the pump?
Florida's tax on gasoline is one of many factors that affect the
price consumers pay at the pump. Factors beyond the state's control may
cause gasoline prices to go up or down during the tax reduction period.
What other tax holidays are there in Florida right now?
Baby and toddler clothing and children's diapers. In
effect until June 30, 2023.
Purchases of children's diapers, and baby and toddler clothing,
apparel and shoes are exempt from sales tax.
Energy Star appliances. In effect until June 30, 2023.
Appliances purchased for noncommercial use, including certain
refrigerator/freezer units, water heaters, washing machines, and
dryers, are exempt from sales tax.
Home hardening. In effect until June 30, 2024.
During this holiday, homeowners' purchases of impact-resistant
windows, doors and garage doors are exempt from sales tax on retail
sales.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you.
First, I just want to make a comment. He is no longer here,
my good friend, Mr. Nehls, and counties--Mr. Winders, having
come from county government in the San Francisco Bay area where
I was a county supervisor--Commissioner, this is just an
observation. You don't have to respond.
County officials get elected by county. Presidents don't. I
have my own questions about the electoral college. So, his
observation about 500 counties--your county, according to the
website, is about 26,000 population. The county I represented
for 14 years has about 1,000,002 people. So, I just want to
make an observation, which is part of the challenge we have
right here, is that we have this amazing infusion of public
investment, the largest since President Eisenhower, in a
country that has changed a lot since then, but still want to
respect your community, my community, and doing that in a way--
and this is to Ms. O'Leary, and I would love to hear the
secretary's response, too, because you have similar
challenges--we do have similarities with Florida. We are both
big States, California and Texas.
In a world where you--having been on the MPO for the bay
area for 10 years, and having been a county commissioner with
local stuff, the idea in my perspective with this huge infusion
is a huge challenge in a world that is changing. And then you
overlay the requirements under the U.S. Clean Air Act signed by
Richard Nixon, and California's was signed by Ronald Reagan.
So, getting the RTP  passed
with the State implementation plan, having this infusion of
money, and having both the discretion of the mobility under the
formula--and I agree with you on this--the formula is right,
but you still want to have discretionary grants that anticipate
the changes we are under.
So, Ms. O'Leary, you come from a region that has changed a
lot--differently than the bay area, for sure--but our big
challenge now is COVID. And with the tech industry, 30
percent--I would bet higher than that--vacancy rates in
downtown San Francisco, so, our traditional commutes for my
community, which has 4 of the 10 largest mega-commutes in the
country, because of the cost of housing versus where the jobs
are, we have a wonderful opportunity, but it's going to take us
a long time, unfortunately, to respond to that change.
So, you have some history in southeast Michigan of
responding to private-sector changes in a different way. How do
we stay--and we have this bothersome infrastructure for a
reason. And it was largely Republican administrations who
wanted to get rid of corruption that was delivered more on
political relationships than on performance.
So, this committee is supposed to be the least partisan.
How do we get this money out the door, working with the
administration and our Republican colleagues in a country that
has such diversity but has incredible demands, to make it
easier for people to get to work, whether it's in a rural
community or an urban community?
And by the way, those urban communities drive 65 percent of
the GDP, gross domestic product, in this country. So, how do we
keep that in this amazing opportunity, all those moving parts,
and accelerate the RTP but still do it thoughtfully, without
taking 20 years to get the research to validate what we are
doing?
Ms. O'Leary. You said a lot right there.
Mr. DeSaulnier. I know. You have a minute to answer.

Ms. O'Leary. And I will say what you are saying is true.
This is a challenge. And we say it's a good problem to have,
right?
We know that our job as regions, and often, as counties and
as the State, is to help our communities get ready. And so,
yes, we are seeing this large influx and opportunity funds,
many of them discretionary. And I feel personally that as
regional leaders across the country, our job is to get our
communities ready.
You have seen a rebound and a resurgence in the Detroit
area, the Detroit metropolitan area. If you haven't been to
visit Detroit, you should be. It's the place to be. And
infrastructure and what we are able to do there is a big part
of it. And I would encourage people to look at what has
happened in Detroit. The collaboration and the partnerships are
a big part of the success that we are having.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Debbie Dingell is a good friend, so, I hear
from her all the time.
Ms. O'Leary. Is she? She is great.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Yes, she is.
Mr. Perdue. Yes, thank you Congressman. And I would say
that IIJA did bring record funding in terms of Federal
authorization. And it's definitely good and something that
should be continued into the future.
With discretionary grants, the challenge is that we are
being asked and expected to do more and to do more faster. It
appears as though with discretionary grants, we are doing less
and doing it slower. I think there are a lot of opportunities
in formula distribution to really address that, because that's
when the funds get pushed out and can actually go on to
projects that are ready to be built.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr.
Kean for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Baker, it's good to see you again.
The IIJA authorized a new Railroad Crossing Elimination
Grant Program. IIJA authorized $500 million annually in
spending, subject to appropriations, and provided advanced
funding of $600 million annually through fiscal year 2026. What
has been your experience with this program, and do you have any
recommendations for improvements?
Mr. Baker. Thank you. The program is a new creation in
IIJA. There has been one round of funding. We think it meets a
pressing need. It's a program that public entities apply for.
Railroads don't individually apply, but obviously it has to be,
essentially, in partnership with a railroad. I think it's
addressing a pressing issue.
I mentioned earlier 95 percent of the fatalities on the
rail system nationwide are either trespassers or grade
crossings. And the busiest crossings, not only are they
dangerous, but they also--they block traffic sometimes, and
people get upset, and it delays motorists. And really, the only
way to permanently solve that problem is make it a grade
separation.
And so, the program, it's a good idea. The challenge for
the country is they are very, very expensive. You can be
talking $20 or $30 million for one of these. So, $600 million a
year guaranteed might get you 30 crossings, which is excellent.
But there are 220,000 in the United States. So, I would say
it's, like all these DOT grant programs, it has been slow to
get started, they are slow to execute. But once it is getting
going, I think people will like how it works, and I think that
there will be an opportunity to increase that program even
further in the next reauthorization.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Yes, thank you.
Commissioner Winders, what are the barriers that keep local
governments, especially those in rural areas, from applying for
discretionary grants?
Mr. Winders. Thank you, Representative.
The key areas revolve around capacity, either the financial
capacity to put together an application or the human capacity
to wade through the notice of Federal funding opportunity, or
the capacity to front the costs of a large project.
So, the notices being complicated and the capacity that is
necessary to wade through those and figure out what works for
whom, and whether or not we actually have a chance at any
particular grant, whether it's worth our effort to put forward,
those are some of the major, major constraints, barriers.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. OK. Are there other things that
Congress can do to help rural communities to secure DOT funding
or for critical infrastructure? Any other recommendations?
Mr. Winders. There has been discussion about direct funding
to counties. There has been discussion about building capacity,
helping to build capacity.
From my perspective--and I believe from NACo's perspective,
the National Association of Counties' perspective--if we can
simplify the rules, make the goals of the program clear and
more singular, not so many goals, then that would levelize the
playing field.
And what I mean by not so many goals is in the rating
criteria. Different counties have different abilities to
compete on such things as clean air. In my rural county, we are
not going to get many points for our road project as it relates
to clean air, but it is a definite safety need. It's a need for
the State and national system. But we don't rate well on those
criteria. So, maybe making sure that the criteria that the
applications are rated on are the things that you, as Congress,
want them to be rated on, not additional criteria.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you. Targeted investments
allow for the effective use of taxpayer funds. If we could
start with you, Mr. Perdue, and then Ms. O'Leary. Can you talk
a bit about what the benefit would be to a State and then to
municipal/regional governments, as well, what would your
recommendations be?
Mr. Perdue. I am sorry. Can you repeat that?
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. What would your recommendations be
from a statewide perspective on what I was just talking to
Commissioner Winders about, and then from a municipal/regional
perspective to Ms. O'Leary. So, it is the same question from a
statewide perspective, and same question on a municipal
perspective.
Mr. Perdue. Sure. In terms of discretionary grants, and
specifically the NOFOs and the requirements in them, my
suggestion or recommendation would be mainly focus the
requirements in those NOFOs on the actual physical
infrastructure and what it is meant to achieve.
Moving people, moving goods safely and efficiently,
bringing all these extra requirements in that some communities
may be able to meet, others may not, as you have heard many
times, makes it very challenging. I mean, it already takes a
concerted amount of resources to pursue these grants.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
Ms. O'Leary?
Ms. O'Leary. I would say a couple of things.
One, when it comes to the formula funds, the suballocation
process works. It works on our TAP [Transportation Alternatives
Program] funds, being able to suballocate down to major
metropolitan areas, at least.
And I think we had a good point earlier, where we work hand
in glove with our DOT, where our part of Michigan gets a
suballocation for some dollars, for TAP, but then the State
works with the rest of the more rural areas to implement TAP
programs across the rest of the State. So, suballocate where it
makes sense.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
recognizes Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to
take us all to a small town in my district, Andover,
Massachusetts, where last year, a beautiful 5-year-old girl,
Sidney Olson, was waiting for a walk sign to cross the street.
And when the walk light changed and she got the signal, she
started out across the street, and a big semitruck which
couldn't see her, started forward. It bumped her. She tried to
get out of the way, and then it jerked forward again and ran
over her, ending her life instantly in front of her entire
family.
Now, this, of course, has devastated her family, her
brother, her mom and dad. It has devastated the truckdriver,
who didn't even know what had happened until after it happened.
It has devastated a community. And what is particularly amazing
is that this entire accident could have been prevented with a
$50 mirror installed on that truck so that he could see what
was in front of him, the same mirrors that are installed on
schoolbuses so they don't do the same thing.
I just want to emphasize that the changes that we are
talking about making, and more that are in the works, have real
urgency. We shouldn't have 5-year-old kids in small towns in
America dying because they crossed the street when they get a
walk light.
Ms. O'Leary, I know you spoke about the Safe Streets
program and some of the impacts that it has had in the Detroit
region. Could you speak a little bit more about what a
difference this can make in your community?
Ms. O'Leary. Absolutely. And I'm sorry that that happened.
And I think sometimes we, as the planners and the engineers, we
talk about fatalities, but it's about people, and we can't ever
forget that. So, I am sorry to hear about that happening.
The Safe Streets For All is kind of a new program for us.
So, the first element of that is doing safety audits. We have
been able to identify the most intersections and roadways that
have the most injuries for pedestrians and bicyclists. And we
are going there and we are doing the audits with this fund to
figure out what is the next step, how do we fix those roads?
And that's one of the roles that we play.
The cities of Detroit and Dearborn both were able to
receive actual construction funds. And so, one of our jobs
right now is while they just received the funding is to try and
line up their funding on the safety side with the other funds
that they have received for the repaving of the road, for
example. And so, that's not always an easy task. So, we are
making sure, as the MPO, that we are aligning all of those
projects together.
And we know we need to make a difference, and that's why
safety is our number-one concern in our region when it comes to
our transportation network.
Mr. Moulton. Well, I just think that we talk a lot about
congestion and travel speeds. And everyone seems to be eager to
add a lane to another highway, despite the enormous amount of
empirical evidence that that doesn't decrease congestion or
travel times. But we often forget the fact that these roads are
going through communities. They are going through communities
with people, people that we are encouraging to walk because
it's good, it's healthy.
Of course, we would have a lot fewer road fatalities and
traffic deaths in America if we had a better rail system. It's
a safer way to transport goods, it's a safer way to transport
people. In the rest of the world, it's a nicer and faster way
to get around the country, as well, although we have a very
antiquated rail system in the United States.
One thing I have never really understood, Mr. Baker, is
when we have these Railroad Crossing Elimination Programs, why
is it always rail funding? Why does it always fall on the
railroads to eliminate crossings, when in most parts of the
country, the roads came after the railroads? The roads are the
ones that have the problem with crossing. So, why are highway
funds not used to close crossings?
Mr. Baker. It's a fair question. And to be fair, the
traditional section 130 program is actually highway money, but
it's only $200 million a year, which is not even a drop in the
bucket as far as 200,000 crossings.
The Railroad Crossing Elimination Program is a big increase
in that, and I think a step in the right direction. But it
actually sounds to me sort of promisingly like a bipartisan
area of agreement where there is clearly interest on both sides
in really increasing that. And some of these crossing
fatalities are the most stubborn part of rail safety. They are
extraordinarily frustrating for us in the industry, and
obviously devastating every time there is an accident there. We
would love to see more crossings closed and work with
communities if they can access the funds to do it.
Mr. Moulton. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope that
communities will consider using funds to make safety
improvements like the Safe Streets, like eliminating crossings,
instead of just adding more lanes to highways. Thank you.
Mr. Ezell. The Chair recognizes Mr. Burlison for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Perdue, some of the largest grants that we have seen--
they were found at the Department of Transportation--were the
electric vehicle charging station grants. Two of these grant
programs can be found in the IIJA, which were authorized at the
tune of $7\1/2\ billion. And I know, to Florida, that's still a
lot of money. In Missouri, that's a lot of money.
We can talk all day about the issues with electric
vehicles, but with our limited time, I wanted to ask you if you
think that these charging station grants were actually good for
the States.
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Congressman.
So, in Florida, we are proud of the fact that the private
industry has always done a great job of fueling vehicles. I do
not believe it should be any different for the power that it
takes to charge electric vehicles. This is just one more type
of transportation, it's one more fuel type. We encourage fuel
freedom. We would like to see the development of all fuel types
and all alternative fuels. And we believe the private sector
can really meet that mark.
With regards to IIJA, there is actually--there is
discretionary grant money for electric vehicle charging
infrastructure. There is also a new required formula program
that was rolled out, and we received roughly $198 million over
5 years. We have taken those funds and developed a plan and
identified gaps in locations. But there are still major hurdles
and challenges and concerns to get over before we actually roll
that program out. I know several States have already begun
implementing it. It's looking like--and this is public
funding--and it's looking like every location, based on the
requirements in the program, are costing around $750,000 to $1
million per site. So, it's a significant investment.
One big question we have in Florida, our adoption rate for
EVs right now is around 1.3 percent. And so, this is public
money building public infrastructure. Assuming our adoption
rate continues to move that slowly, is this a wise investment
of public infrastructure dollars?
Mr. Burlison. Yes, and the other question, Mr. Perdue, is,
is there the infrastructure to support it?
There was an article that came out today from the
Washington Post. The title of the article says, ``Amid
Explosive Demand, America is Running Out of Power.'' It
continues to say that ``vast swaths of the United States are at
risk of running short of power as electricity-hungry data
centers and clean-technology factories proliferate around the
country, leaving utilities and regulators grasping for credible
plans to expand the nation's creaking power grid.''
In Georgia, the demand--I am going to paraphrase this--is
so high that the expectations are now 17 times the current need
that they have today. In other States, they are saying that
they would have to scramble to implement numerous nuclear
powerplants just to accommodate the planned infrastructure
growth of the data centers and all of these.
And with that in mind, would you agree with me that this is
the Federal Government pouring gasoline on the fire of
something that is probably already a crisis in America?
Mr. Perdue. I would say that it's definitely not
sustainable to focus all of your efforts on just one fuel type.
Again, having a diverse portfolio in transportation is
truly how you are sustainable for many, many years to come.
Electric vehicles are just one type. A lot of people in Florida
are still choosing gas and diesel. I personally drive a truck
with a diesel engine, and I will drive that for the rest of my
life. And I am a Floridian, I am American. I have the right to
do that.
And so, I think developing that infrastructure out in a way
that that is diversified and really brings all of the
alternative fuels to the table is the best path forward.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Perdue. I agree with your
comments. This is why I sponsored a bill here in Congress
called the UNPLUG EVs Act, which will eliminate our taxpayer
funding for these charging stations, which, as you mentioned,
the private sector has been doing for quite some time.
Thank you, and I yield the rest of my time.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman yields. I now recognize myself for
the next several minutes, since I have the total captive
audience here. So, thank you very much.
Secretary Perdue and all of you, I have really learned a
lot this morning. So, thank you for what you have done and for
being here today. But I am sure that you understand as well as
anyone that once DOT announces a grant award, the process is
far from over. There was a city in my district that received a
BUILD grant, but is now, unfortunately, experiencing how
frustrating the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, review
process can be.
In this case, the NEPA process took 2 years before the city
could even submit the proposed environmental assessment, which
then took another 5 months before it was approved by the
Federal Highway Administration. I couldn't agree more with your
testimony that wasted time is wasted money.
Can you please share some advice that I may pass on to my
community as to how to help navigate this process?
Mr. Perdue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And yes, delivering
infrastructure with Federal funds is a very complex process. It
takes a lot of resources, a lot of expertise.
At FDOT, we are happy to partner with our local
communities. There is a major challenge for the direct
recipients of these grants, if they are local governments and
communities that are not accustomed to delivering
infrastructure with Federal funds. NEPA is one of those.
Florida is one of the few States that has NEPA delegation in
partnership with FHWA, and we have done a great job with that.
We recently renewed our MoU with FHWA, but NEPA can take up to
4 years, depending on how complex the project is. This is one
of the reasons why we really believe, even with discretionary
grant programs, the requirements and the NOFOs and the things
that you are asking for out of those that are applying for
grants should be focused on the actual hard infrastructure and
what it is trying to achieve.
Moving people, moving goods safely and efficiently, this is
the fundamental tenet of all transportation infrastructure.
That is really where it should be focused. When you do that,
the actual grant applications and the grants you are applying
for and the projects you are trying to move forward are those
projects that local communities have been planning for the last
15 to 20 years.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
Mr. Baker, we have several companies, including the
Mississippi Export Railroad, which are independent short rail
lines that employ many individuals in my district. I also
understand that several times Congress has directed the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, ACHP, to issue a
final exemption for active rail corridors under NEPA and
section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. This is
similar to the interstate highway exemption.
However, several years have passed and the ACHP still has
not implemented this guidance. Why do you think railroads are
not treated the same as highways under these exemptions?
Mr. Baker. It's a great question. I don't know why they are
not.
I also--and I am not an expert on ACHP and congressional
oversight of it, but I don't know why it's OK or how it's OK
that they refuse to do what Congress pretty clearly told them
to do, which is also a commonsense fix, is to not treat the
entire rail corridor as a historic item. If they want to
designate specific sections, that would be OK, just like they
do with the highway system, but it results in some crazy
stories. We don't have time for me to repeat all of them, but
there is a railroad in Massachusetts told me about a bridge
that took them a year of historic review to get through, and
then it took them 4 hours to replace the bridge.
Mr. Ezell. Does this impact project cost and how quickly a
railroad can fulfill a project obligation?
Mr. Baker. It does. It causes huge delays. It causes some
funny stories, the one I just mentioned. A railroad up in
Minnesota just told me about a wooden bridge that they just
needed to replace one support beam with a big concrete beam,
and they eventually got approval to do it, but they were told
they have to paint the concrete beam the color of wood to get
it done.
And so, sometimes they are a little silly. But again, time
is money. We have said it ad nauseam this morning, and ACHP
should really--they should do what Congress asked.
Mr. Ezell. Agreed. Do you see DOT working to reduce NEPA
reviews to help projects get done any faster, or are there any
improvements you can recommend?
Mr. Baker. We have not seen a huge amount of progress on
making the NEPA and environmental process move faster. There
are a lot of good intentions when we talk to people at FRA.
They want to move projects quickly, just like we do. But it
hasn't really seemed to happen yet.
From a short line point of view, the vast majority of our
projects end up getting categorical exemptions. But even that
process is slow. And it's very frustrating. If you are just
replacing wooden ties on an existing rail corridor, an existing
active rail right-of-way, it's sort of blindingly obvious to
everyone that that's going to end up with a categorical
exemption. And I don't understand why we couldn't just start
tomorrow and let's just start building, right? Let's not wait
around for the obvious answer that takes sometimes 6 months, 8
months, 1 year.
Mr. Ezell. Exactly.
Mr. Winders, in the time that I have left, which I have run
over, if you could expand some of the issues you may have faced
on a county level trying to raise non-Federal match funding
while waiting for DOT to announce grant awards.
Mr. Winders. I am sorry, Representative. Trying to raise
what?
Mr. Ezell. Non-Federal match funding.
Mr. Winders. Non-Federal match funding is an issue for
Audrain County, for the Highway 54 Coalition, and for many
rural counties. Particularly, the RAISE grant has an exemption
for rural counties that does not require match. However, it's
questionable as to whether or not your application will be
competitive without match.
At this point, given our experience with the RAISE program
and our inability to get a grant, we have not tried to set
aside match money for something that we're just not sure we're
going to get.
Mr. Ezell. Right. Thank you.
Are there any further questions from any members of the
committee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each of you for your testimony today.
The committee stands adjourned.

Submissions for the Record

Letter of March 7, 2024, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, and Hon. Rick
Larsen, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
from Kristen Swearingen, Vice President, Legislative and Political
Affairs, Associated Builders and Contractors, Submitted for the Record
by Hon. Sam Graves
March 7, 2024.
The Honorable Sam Graves,
Chair,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Rick Larsen,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure:
On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors, a national
construction industry trade association with 68 chapters representing
more than 22,000 members, I write to comment on the U.S. House
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure hearing titled
``Department of Transportation Discretionary Grants: Stakeholder
Perspectives.''
As the committee continues to lead Congress' oversight of the DOT,
including the hundreds of billions of dollars Congress has allocated to
modernize our nation's most critical infrastructure, ABC will comment
on how the DOT has deviated from bipartisan Congressional agreements by
incorporating partisan language into discretionary grant programs--
language rejected by the House and Senate--that hinders the success of
these investments.
Background
While Congress allocated DOT discretionary grant funding in a
bipartisan manner, the DOT has imposed unlawful federal requirements on
states and localities by promoting project labor agreement mandates,
which limit recipient flexibility. These mandates discourage the 89.3%
of the private construction workforce that do not belong to a union and
experienced nonunion contractors from competing to win taxpayer-funded
contracts to rebuild their communities. This action significantly
exacerbates the ongoing construction workforce shortage, limits
potential infrastructure investment by raising costs by 12 to 20% per
project, and discriminates against nearly nine out of 10 construction
workers who o not belong a union. Additionally, for the rare nonunion
construction workers permitted to work on a PLA project, provisions in
PLAs result in the confiscation of 34% of a nonunion construction
worker's compensation package unless they join a union and become
vested in union plans.
ABC has expressed concerns about the DOT's administrative actions,
including efforts to impose unlawful and overly burdensome policies and
restrictive labor requirements on key federal infrastructure funds and
projects. As the committee considers stakeholder feedback on DOT
discretionary grants, ABC writes to highlight partisan policies
advanced by the department and make recommendations to ensure taxpayer-
funded construction contracts are awarded through fair and open
competition.
Application of Restrictive Requirements on DOT Grants:
Despite the needlessly increased costs and chilled competition PLAs
promote, ABC has identified a significant number of Biden
administration federal agency grants--totaling more than $260 billion
for infrastructure projects procured by state and local governments--
subject to language and policies promoting PLA mandates and preferences
that will increase costs and reduce competition on federally assisted
construction projects.
The DOT, which has oversight over the vast majority of IIJA
funding, has played a key role in pushing these costly and unnecessary
agreements. ABC has identified over $214 billion in DOT grant programs
impacted by language preferring PLAs.
For example, in the fiscal year 2023 Rebuilding American
Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant program DOT Notice
of Funding Opportunity, the department included pro-PLA preferences for
contractors, which were not included in the IIJA.
The RAISE grant program provides federal assistance to state and
local government entities for the purpose of major surface
transportation infrastructure projects, making at least $2.275 billion
in funding appropriated by the IIJA and other funding sources
available.
However, the impact of this funding is undermined by language in
the NOFO that attempts to steer these funds toward applicants that
require PLAs on their projects. The NOFO includes specific language
indicating that PLAs will increase applicants' scores for ``partnership
and collaboration,'' improving their chance of receiving RAISE funds.
Likewise, according to U.S. DOT Federal Highway Administration data
released March 1, 2024, in response to an ABC FOIA request, state and
local lawmakers mandated PLAs on 344 state and local construction
projects (totaling an estimated $10.67 billion) that received federal
assistance and formal approval from the FHWA during from Jan. 2021 to
Jan. 2024.
ABC expresses concern with language contained in DOT grant
opportunities that encourages state and local government grant
applicants to support PLA requirements in their application for federal
grant funds. This PLA ``encouragement'' language could have a chilling
effect on otherwise qualified contractors bidding on projects in their
communities, limiting competition and increasing costs.
Recommendations
ABC has urged the DOT to abandon its exclusionary and inflationary
policies and instead welcome the entire construction workforce to
participate in rebuilding America's vital infrastructure. ABC
recommends that the committee closely examine the DOT's policies
favoring PLAs to ensure the DOT is maximizing the return on the massive
investment of taxpayer dollars represented by the IIJA, which ABC
believes should be awarded through fair and open competition--
guaranteeing the best value for hardworking taxpayers while prohibiting
a rigged federal procurement process that discriminates against many
small construction businesses. This is critically important as federal
agencies begin to implement hundreds of billions in federal dollars for
infrastructure construction projects authorized through the IIJA and
ARP, which notably did not have any mention of PLAs, let alone mandate
them on federal projects.
Further, ABC urges members of the committee to support the Fair and
Open Competition Act (H.R. 1209), which would prevent federal agencies
and recipients of federal assistance from requiring contractors to sign
controversial PLAs as a condition of winning a federal or federally
assisted construction contract. This bill would ensure that taxpayer-
funded construction contracts are awarded through fair and open
competition--guaranteeing the best value for hardworking taxpayers
while prohibiting a rigged federal procurement process.
Conclusion:
ABC encourages the committee to promote inclusive, win-win policies
that welcome all of America's construction industry to compete to
rebuild our nation's crumbling infrastructure, increase accountability
and competition and reduce waste and favoritism in the procurement of
public works projects to better ensure the stewardship of taxpayer
dollars.
Ultimately, in order to successfully implement this investment of
taxpayer funds into high-quality infrastructure at the best price
possible for Americans, Congress must ensure the door is open to all
qualified contractors, including those composing the vast majority of
the industry and provide them with a fair chance at competing on
government funded projects.
ABC and our members are committed to building taxpayer-funded
projects with the highest standards of safety and quality. ABC members
stand ready for the opportunity to build and maintain America's
infrastructure to the benefit of the communities it serves. ABC
appreciates the opportunity to comment on the committee's important
work to improve our nation's infrastructure.
Sincerely,
Kristen Swearingen,
Vice President, Legislative and Political Affairs,
Associated Builders and Contractors.
Statement of Dennis J. Newman, Executive Vice President, Strategy and
Planning, National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Submitted
for the Record by Hon. Sam Graves
On behalf of Amtrak, I am submitting this Statement for the Record
of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's March 7,
2024, hearing on ``Department of Transportation Discretionary Grants:
Stakeholder Perspectives.'' Amtrak's statement addresses two of the
matters discussed during the hearing: Consolidated Rail Infrastructure
and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grants and the importance of multi-year
funding for rail programs.
The Importance of CRISI Grants to Intercity Passenger Rail
Although Amtrak and its partners have received relatively few CRISI
grants, CRISI is an important source of funding for Amtrak and
intercity passenger rail projects, particularly for safety and
workforce development projects that are not eligible for other
competitive grant programs.
Providing funding for intercity passenger rail projects was one of
Congress's major objectives when it enacted CRISI as part of the Fixing
America's Surface Transportation Act of 2015 (FAST Act). The discussion
of the FAST Act's ``Intercity Passenger Rail Policy'' provisions in the
Explanatory Statement of the Conference Committee identified CRISI as
one of the Act's ``provisions to improve the Nation's rail
infrastructure and its intercity passenger rail service . . .,'' and
stated that CRISI's purpose was ``to support a broad array of rail
projects and activities.'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ U.S. House. Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 22 (FAST Act)
(H. Rpt. 114-357), p. 511.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Explanatory Statement also indicated that CRISI was intended to
replace a number of grant programs that the FAST Act repealed. One of
those programs was the Congestion Grants Program established by Section
302 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008
(PRIIA) to provide grants to Amtrak and states to reduce congestion in
high-priority rail corridors. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (IIJA) made no substantive changes to CRISI other than broadening
the types of projects--currently sixteen--eligible for grants.
Amtrak and intercity passenger rail projects have received a
relatively small percentage of recent CRISI grant awards. In the most
recent (Fiscal Year 2022) round of CRISI funding, for which awards were
announced last September, Amtrak received four grants for:
A Northeast Corridor (NEC) Fencing Project that will
support Amtrak's efforts to install fencing along portions of the NEC
to address trespassing that has claimed too many lives: 23 in Fiscal
Years 2021-2023 alone;
A Grade-Crossing Improvement Project on an Amtrak long-
distance route in Louisiana and Mississippi that Amtrak is undertaking
in collaboration with the host freight railroad that owns the line;
A Workforce Development Apprenticeship Training Program,
developed in collaboration with the labor union that represents
Amtrak's maintenance-of-way (MOW) employees, that will support a
comprehensive training program for the track foremen who supervise MOW
employees and the track inspectors who ensure the safety of the NEC and
other Amtrak-owned and operated rail lines; and,
The Gulf Coast Corridor Improvement Project that will
allow reinstitution of Amtrak service between New Orleans, Louisiana,
and Mobile, Alabama while also improving freight capacity and safety
along this route.
In addition to the CRISI grants awarded to Amtrak, Amtrak's state
partners received four grants for:
The Franconia-Springfield Bypass Project, which will
reduce congestion that impacts Amtrak, commuter, and freight trains,
and provide capacity for service expansion along a portion of the
Washington-to-Richmond, Virginia rail corridor by constructing
additional tracks to separate passenger and freight operations;
Construction of additional tracks to increase capacity
and facilitate increased, state-supported, Amtrak service on:
+ the Capitol Corridor between Sacramento and Roseville,
California; and
+ the West-East Rail Corridor between Springfield and Worcester,
Massachusetts; and
The Penn-Camden Line Connector Project in Baltimore,
which will reduce congestion and increase capacity on the NEC by
constructing a new connection so that empty MARC commuter trains will
not have to operate over the NEC between Baltimore and Washington to
access MARC mechanical facilities and a new yard that will eliminate
the need to store MARC commuter trains on NEC tracks at Baltimore Penn
Station.
As the descriptions above demonstrate, the eight Amtrak and state-
led intercity passenger rail projects that received Fiscal Year 2022
CRISI grants will enhance safety, alleviate rail line congestion,
support workforce development, and facilitate improvement and expansion
of Amtrak service. These are exactly the types of projects, identified
in 49 U.S.C. 22907(c), that Congress intended to enable when it
established the CRISI grant program.
CRISI also plays an important role in supporting freight railroad
investments in infrastructure and safety. The majority (47) of the 70
Fiscal Year 2022 CRISI grants went to Class II and Class III railroads,
who also received more than half of the funding awarded. (Class I
railroads are not eligible for CRISI grants unless they apply with
another eligible entity.) It bears noting that, unlike Amtrak and its
state partners, the Class II and III freight railroads that receive
CRISI grants are private, for-profit entities which earn operating
profits that can be used to fund many of their capital investment
projects. They also receive the benefit of the Section 45G Short Line
Tax Credit that Congress made permanent in 2020.
Were it not for the CRISI program, many of the intercity passenger
rail projects that have received CRISI grants would not be moving
forward. By law, the supplemental funding the IIJA provided to Amtrak
is reserved for expenditures related to specific kinds of capital
projects, such as acquiring new fleet, replacing aged bridges and
tunnels, and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance work at
stations throughout Amtrak's network. Because of restrictions on what
projects are eligible for other competitive rail grant programs, CRISI
is the only grant program that can provide funds for many vital safety
projects and other projects. Projects that could not be funded under
other competitive grant programs include the NEC Fencing and Workforce
Development projects described above and the Targeted Grade Crossing
Enforcement Partnership, a collaborative effort of Amtrak and local
police departments to improve grade crossing safety for which Amtrak
has sought CRISI funding.
As discussed at the hearing, commuter rail projects are generally
ineligible for CRISI grants. That is appropriate because, while freight
and passenger railroads are funded through rail grant programs, which
are administered by the Federal Railroad Administration, commuter
railroads receive substantial federal funding from the Federal Transit
Administration through federal transit programs for which Amtrak is
ineligible. However, many of the intercity passenger rail projects for
which Amtrak and its state partners have received CRISI awards,
including the Franconia-Springfield Bypass, NEC Fencing, and Penn-
Camden Line Connector Projects described above, benefit commuter
railroads that share rail infrastructure with Amtrak.
Freight railroads also benefit from CRISI grants awarded to Amtrak.
Amtrak has partnered with four Class I freight railroads on
applications for CRISI grants for which those railroads would otherwise
be ineligible. Seven of the eight intercity passenger rail projects for
which Amtrak and its state partners received Fiscal Year 2022 CRISI
grants will benefit freight railroad-owned lines or will improve safety
or increase capacity on Amtrak-owned lines over which freight railroads
operate.
The Importance of Multi-Year Funding
As discussed at the hearing, predictable, multi-year funding for
rail capital projects is essential. Assurance of multi-year funding is
of particular importance for Amtrak and intercity passenger rail.
The advance appropriations for intercity passenger and other rail
programs that the IIJA provided have given Amtrak what nearly every
other transportation mode has long enjoyed but Amtrak had previously
been denied: substantial, assured, multi-year funding for major capital
investments. That funding is allowing Amtrak to advance vital, long-
deferred generational--and in some cases, once every 100 or more
years--capital projects that include:
Replacement of the 150-year-old Baltimore & Potomac
Tunnel;
Construction of the Hudson Tunnel, part of the Gateway
Program that will increase the number of tracks on the most heavily
used portion of the NEC between Newark, New Jersey and New York City
for the first time since 1910; and,
The replacement of the 40- to 50-year-old passenger car
fleets that Amtrak acquired in its first decade.
The multi-year funding the IIJA provides is what makes it possible
for Amtrak and its partners to finally move forward on long overdue
projects like these. Major railroad capital projects require very large
expenditures and take many years--often a decade or more--from
initiation of planning until completion of construction. Such projects
cannot be funded through uncertain, widely fluctuating annual
appropriations under any circumstances. That is particularly true when,
as was the case this year, there is enormous uncertainty about the
level of annual appropriations Amtrak will receive that is not resolved
until almost halfway through the fiscal year.
The IIJA's advance appropriations were a major first step in
providing long needed and essential multi-year funding for Amtrak and
intercity passenger rail capital projects. However, the advance
appropriations extend only through Fiscal Year 2026. In order for
Amtrak and our partners to continue vital capital investments on the
NEC and our National Network, the next surface transportation
reauthorization must also provide substantial, assured, multi-year
capital funding for Amtrak and intercity passenger rail.

Amtrak remains grateful for the historic investments in Amtrak and
intercity passenger rail provided by the IIJA's advance appropriations.
I thank the members of the Committee for their interest in and support
for Amtrak, and I appreciate this opportunity to make known Amtrak's
views on the important issues your recent hearing addressed.

Questions from Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford to Hon. Jared W. Perdue,
P.E., Secretary, Florida Department of Transportation
Question 1. I understand Florida reduced state taxes on gasoline
for part of 2022. Can you please further explain why this decision was
made?
Answer. Governor DeSantis signed a temporary gas tax holiday in
2022, lowering the tax rate on motor fuel by 25.3 cents per gallon, not
to zero as originally suggested by a member of the Committee. That tax
rate reduction was effective from October 1, 2022 until October 31,
2022 and allowed drivers to get relief at the pump when federally-
induced inflation and gas prices were skyrocketing.
Question 2. When a project you submitted a discretionary grant
application for is not awarded, has the U.S. Department of
Transportation provided helpful feedback regarding how your application
can be more successful in the next round of awards?
Answer. While the opportunity to receive feedback from USDOT on an
unsuccessful grant application initially seemed beneficial in order to
strengthen the chances for a future award, our experience with the
debriefs have been anything but.
A perfect example of this would be FDOT's Miami River-Miami
Intermodal Center Capacity Improvements (MR-MICCI) project, which we
applied for 4 times through 4 different funding opportunities. Keep in
mind, this project had strong bipartisan support from South Florida's
Congressional delegation as well as local stakeholders.
USDOT recommended the MR-MICCI project and scored it ``very
strong'' in several merit criteria sections including safety,
environmental, and partnership. Other sections had either zero or minor
comments. According to the 2022 Federal-State Partnership debrief, the
only USDOT suggestion for improvements was to obtain a letter of
support from Amtrak. Not only did the 2023 Federal-State Partnership
application provide a letter of support, but it also provided $1M in
matching funds from Amtrak. The application was not selected for an
award.
On 2/29/2024, FDOT received a debrief for the most recent submittal
of MR-MICCI and non-selection. USDOT's policy has long been to provide
verbal feedback only and have previously provided specific feedback for
each section including scores and comments. This year, however, they
said they could not provide scoring information, feedback on sections,
or comments on the benefit-cost analysis (BCA), but only had general
notes. According to USDOT:
This year, FDOT's budget format was ``difficult to
follow'', despite the fact that FDOT's budget format was the same as
the three previous years and USDOT never expressed concern with those
being ``difficult to follow''.
Opposite feedback was provided stating that the
application was strong in technical merit and ``made sense'' but was
too technical.
In 2022, the roles of FDOT, SFRTA, Amtrak, and CSX were
``very clear what roles each had''. This year, the application included
an MOU between FDOT and SFRTA and were paired with letters of support
from CSX and Amtrak. The debrief this year provided opposite feedback
stating that the roles of each were ``unclear''.
In 2022, it was recommended to ``add benefits from the
BCA into the merit criteria''. The debrief this year provided opposite
feedback stating there were too many references to the BCA, and it was
recommended to move the BCA references to the appendix ``for the
economists''.
It's frustrating when you are consistently told a project is
``strong'' and even recommended by USDOT, only to apply unsuccessfully
3 more times, unnecessarily utilizing a great deal of department
resources and time. FDOT spends up to $150,000 per grant application,
meaning FDOT has spent approximately $600,000 in grant applications for
this project alone. Additionally, we have set aside millions in match
dollars since 2021 for a single project. Instead of inspiring false
hope in applicants with inconsistent recommendations, USDOT should
provide open, transparent, written, and detailed scoring feedback in
their debriefs.
