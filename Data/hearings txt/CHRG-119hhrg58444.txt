OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
WISCONSIN
Chairman Steil. All right. The Committee on House
Administration will come to order.
I note that a quorum is present.
Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a
recess at any time.
Today I want to welcome all of you to the Committee on
House Administration's organizational meeting for the 119th
Congress. I would like to welcome back my friend and colleague,
Ranking Member Mr. Morelle, and my Democratic colleagues. I am
excited to continue to work with all of you.
I also welcome back our Republican colleagues: Mr. Barry
Loudermilk, Mr. Morgan Griffith, Congressman Greg Murphy,
Congresswoman Stephanie Bice, Congressman Mike Carey, and
Congresswoman Laura Lee. Thank you for all your hard work the
past Congress and look forward to the hard work that is coming
ahead during the next 2 years in the 119th.
I would also like to welcome our new Members: Congresswoman
Mary Miller of Illinois and Congresswoman Julie Johnson from
Texas.
Mrs. Miller from Illinois has been a friend and a strong
supporter of commonsense election integrity measures that will
strengthen our election laws and increase confidence in our
elections.
We are excited, Mrs. Miller, that you are able and willing
to join our Committee. I look forward to your work in
particular as it relates to election integrity during this
Congress.
Ms. Julie Johnson from Texas. We just had a conversation
about the rivalry between the Texas and Dallas Cowboys and the
Green Bay Packers. With today's weather, I am reminded, of
course, of the 1967 Ice Bowl, which we both might be reminded
that the Green Bay Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21-17 on
a frigid day. We look forward to your participation in the
hearing as well.
We welcome both of you to the Committee.
The Committee on House Administration was incredibly
productive last Congress, during the 118th Congress. We held 39
full Committee and Subcommittee hearings last Congress on
issues including legislative oversight, election integrity,
legislative branch, modernization, artificial intelligence
capabilities, and other topics.
We passed the COCOA Act in a nonpartisan fashion and got it
signed into law, ensuring congressional election observers are
able to fairly and accurately observe elections across the
country. I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish as
a Committee; however, our work is far from over. We still have
more we can do to strengthen our election integrity and
increase Americans' confidence in our elections.
We will continue working to make the legislative branch
more cost effective and efficient. Most importantly, we will
continue to enhance our campus security to ensure the Capitol
is safe and accessible for all Americans.
I look forward to working alongside my colleagues to ensure
a successful and productive 119th Congress. As I said, our work
is just beginning.
I will now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for 5
minutes for the purpose of offering an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
NEW YORK
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, congratulations on your reappointment as chair of
the House Administration Committee. I am grateful to you for
all your work. Thanks for calling this meeting so we can
formally begin the process and the important work of this
Committee.
Today we will consider a--I am not sure if it is a number
of or if we combine them all under a single resolution--but I
know that are critical to the operation of the House. I guess
we are going to take them all up perhaps as one vote, all the
resolutions.
Before we get to that, I want to officially thank and
welcome all of my colleagues back to the Committee.
Mrs. Miller, welcome, and it is great to have you join us.
Mrs. Miller. Thank you.
Mr. Morelle. I do want to also acknowledge Representative
Terri Sewell and Representative Norma Torres, are two Members
who have served in the past. Ms. Sewell, of course, from
Alabama, and Mrs. Torres from California, whose sadly, I think,
as Mrs. Bice is at the Appropriations Committee but is excited
to continue. I want to make sure that we particularly keep our
thoughts and prayers for the people in California where Mrs.
Torres represents.
As Subcommittee leaders on our side, both Ms. Sewell and
Torres served this Committee with integrity and distinction
last Congress, and I look forward to working with both of them.
I also want to welcome on our side today a fellow former
State legislator, Ms. Johnson, who served in the State House in
Texas, and welcome her both to the House of Representatives and
certainly to our Committee. I think it is rare on our side that
a first-term Member gets appointed to a leadership Committee,
but I think it speaks to Julie's experience and judgment that
Leader Jeffries has asked her to serve with us so early in her
tenure.
The 118th Congress was productive for this Committee, and I
thank you Mr. Chairman for that. While we had our
disagreements, some more entrenched perhaps than others, we
also delivered bipartisan wins for the House and for the
American people. I am eager to continue that fruitful
relationship in the 119th Congress as we tackle the diverse
range of issues we are charged with overseeing.
Through the Committee's jurisdiction over the
administration, all Federal elections, we have a solemn duty to
preserve, protect, and defend the sanctity of American
democracy, and we must ensure that every American is able to
cast a free and fair ballot. Our Nation does well only when
everyone participates but will falter if we elevate the
wealthy, the well-off, and the well-connected above our
friends, neighbors, and the countless working Americans that
have made this country a shining city on a hill.
It is also incumbent upon all of us to ensure the House is
a safe and inclusive place to work for Members and staff. While
we have made considerable strides to this end in recent
Congresses, as evident in the workplace rights resolution we
will consider today, we must still actively work to preserve
and/or expand on those achievements. The sanctity of this
institution is among our most critical missions, and I know we
all take that very, very seriously.
To that end, again, I invite the majority to work with us
on bipartisan oversight of the Capitol Police, Capitol Complex,
security, and the safety of Members and staff. To a certain
extent we were certainly able to do that at the full Committee
level during the 118th Congress. I am grateful to Chairman
Steil and the full Committee staff for their partnership in
these efforts.
This is especially important, given President Trump's most
recent actions freeing violent felons who assaulted police
officers in our Capitol, allowing them into these halls back,
and sending them back into our districts. I urge the Committee
in the strongest terms to take immediate action to address this
new threat as it is happening.
It is my hope that the 119th Congress we can spend
meaningful time ensuring the mental health, wellness, and
morale of the Capitol Police, including continued development
of the Howie Liebengood Center for Wellness, and addressing
systemic deficiencies in a force such as officer training and
recruitment, which I know they continue to struggle with.
We are also not just responsible for the physical security,
but also cyber defenses as well. As the use and advancement of
artificial intelligence expands dramatically, we must be
prudent and thoughtful in its use in the legislative branch.
Throughout the 118th Congress, this Committee--again, thank
you, Mr. Chairman, for that, we worked in a bipartisan manner
to advance the implementation of AI technology.
I am committed to continuing this effort, striving for a
more efficient and effective House, expanding the renewed focus
on responsibly expanding the use of AI across Member offices,
Committees, and institutional partners. Our policies must
adequately protect sensitive data to fortify the House network
and ensure staff are trained in the potential dangers of the
AI. We also serve as guardians of the historical record.
We have much work to do. It is my hope that we can build on
the bipartisan groundwork we laid last Congress and keep the
best interest of our constituents and institution at the
forefront of our efforts.
Again, let me thank you, Mr. Chairman, and your great staff
for the bipartisan work and the cooperation. We look forward to
that again.
I just note as a historical note. I was actually alive in
1967 and watched the game on television. I do not believe you
were actually on the planet yet. We were certainly
anticipating--we were anticipating your arrival. I actually
watched the game. I remember it well.
With that, I will yield back.

were actually on the planet yet. We were certainly
anticipating--we were anticipating your arrival. I actually
watched the game. I remember it well.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. I have watched
the game, but I did not watch it live. That was inaccurate.
I am willing to yield to the gentlelady, Ms. Johnson.
Ms. Johnson. Mr. Chairman, just let the record reflect that
I would hope that Ranking Member Morelle would be on the Cowboy
side of this. I am the Democrat----
Mr. Morelle. I am a Browns fan. That is the worst of all
things.
Ms. Johnson. I will just put that out there. Thank you so
much for welcoming me so nicely to the Committee.
Chairman Steil. Thank you.
Mr. Griffith. Mr. Chairman, if I might?
Chairman Steil. I will yield to my colleague, Mr. Griffith.
Mr. Griffith. It is about the Ice Bowl, Mr. Chairman. I
happened to represent Carroll Dale, who was from Wise County,
was on the 1967 Packers team, was there. He came home to coach
football at UVA Wise, and he is now retired. The football
stadium at his high school is named for him. He was a big part
of the Packers organization in the sixties.
Chairman Steil. The chair will yield to anyone else who
would like to say a positive statement about the Green Bay
Packers. I am not sure Mrs. Miller can do that being from
Illinois, but we will put you on the spot.
No. In a serious sense, back to our business. I will now
call up Committee Resolution 119-1 through 119-8 to be
considered en bloc.
Committee Resolution 119-1 is the rules of the Committee on
House Administration for the 119th Congress.


Committee Resolution 119-2 appoints the majority Members to
the Subcommittees.


Rep. Laurel Lee will serve as chair of the Subcommittee on
Elections. Rep. Stephanie Bice will serve as the chair of the
Subcommittee on Modernization and Innovation.
Committee Resolution 119-3 appoints the minority Members to
the Subcommittee. Rep. Terri Sewell will serve as the Ranking
Member of the Subcommittee on Elections. Rep. Norma Torres will
serve as the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on
Modernization and Innovation.


Committee Resolution 119-4 adopts the parking policy for
the 119th Congress.


Committee Resolution 119-5 promulgates regulations
regarding mandatory anti-harassment and anti-discrimination
policies for House offices.


Committee Resolution 119-6 promulgates regulations
regarding displaying a statement of rights and protections
provided to House employees.


Committee Resolution 119-7 implements the House Retention
through Education Advancement Program known as REAP.


Committee Resolution 119-8 amends the Eligible
Congressional Member Organizational Handbook.


I will now recognize Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, if he
would like to give a statement on these resolutions.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I largely support the resolutions contained within the en
bloc package as drafted, and I will urge my colleagues on our
side to do the same. I would like to spend just a few moments
talking about some procedural protections I would like the
Committee to consider as we move forward in the 119th Congress.
Protection of the rights of the minority, regardless of
which party holds the gavel, has been a fundamental principle
in the House since its inception. Robust, informed debate not
only makes for good policy, but it makes for a better overall
Committee.
To that end, I would respectfully ask that the Committee
endeavor to enforce requirements for the advance submission of
majority witness testimony to allow for better development of
Member questions. Too often last Congress witnesses failed to
submit their written testimony in a timely manner, sometimes
not submitting at all, which really hindered our preparation
and making for a less informed hearing and thus a deficient
Committee record.
I would just encourage that our staffs on both sides work
tirelessly on these proceedings, and delayed testimony only
makes it harder for them to do their jobs.
Second, it has long been the tradition of the Committee to
require a majority vote of the Committee's Members to authorize
the issuance of a subpoena. The reasons for that are simple.
Congress' power to compel is mighty and must be used
judiciously, and after debate, requiring bipartisan
consideration achieves that end.
I ask you to use your discretion as chair to consult with
me as the Ranking Member prior to issuing any subpoenas as much
as possible--obviously, it is not always possible, but--and to
provide us a reasonable amount of notice to the Committee's
minority prior to the issuance of any of those subpoenas. The
amount of suggestions is consistent with I think not only the
Committee's precedent, but also the manner in which you have
conducted this, which is in a bipartisan fashion. I think they
would serve as well as we begin our work here.
With that, I support the resolutions. I welcome our Ranking
Members on the Subcommittee, Ms. Sewell. Ms. Johnson will serve
on that Subcommittee as well on Elections. Mrs. Torres and I
will serve as Members on Modernization and Innovation. I do
again support these resolutions, considered en bloc, and I urge
my colleagues to do the same.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. I appreciate the
comments, and we will continue to work to improve operations on
the Committee.
The clerk will please report the resolutions.
The Clerk. Committee Resolution 119----
Chairman Steil. Without objection, the reading of the
resolution is suspended with. Also, without objection, the
resolution shall be considered as read and open to amendment at
any point.
Does any Member seek recognition?
I now ask unanimous consent that these resolutions be
considered en bloc.
Hearing no objection, the Committee will consider the
resolution en bloc, and the question now occurs on the
resolution.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the
resolutions are agreed to.
Without objection, a motion to reconsider is laid upon the
table.
According to rule 1(p), I appoint Rep. Laurel Lee as vice
chair of the full Committee.


In accordance with rule 14(b) of the rules of the
Committee, I now appoint Kristen Monterroso as the clerk.


I request unanimous consent that the two letters stating
the appointments of the clerk and vice chair be entered into
the record. A copy of these letters will be made available to
all Committee Members.
This concludes all the matters before the Committee, unless
any Members have any comments.
Without objection, the staff is authorized to make
necessary technical and conforming changes.
If there is no further business, I want to thank the
Members for their participation.
Without objection, the Committee on House Administration
stands adjourned.
