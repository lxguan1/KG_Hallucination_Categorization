OVERSIGHT OF THE PERMITTING COUNCIL: IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND COORDINATION ---------- WEDNESDAY, JULY 10, 2024 U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Garry Peters, Chair of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Peters , Carper, Hassan, Rosen, Blumenthal, Ossoff, Lankford, and Hawley. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETERS\1\ Chairman Peters. The Committee will come to order. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Peters appears in the Appendix on page 23. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Over the past three years, the Biden Administration and Congress have worked together to make a once-in-a-generation upgrade to our infrastructure. The investments made through the bipartisan infrastructure law (BIL), the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (CHIPS and Science Act) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have already launched thousands of essential projects all across the country. Before projects like these get off the ground, they need to obtain critical approvals. This process helps to ensure that improving our infrastructure does not come at a cost for our environment, wildlife, public land, or private property. These approvals are generally referred to as permitting, and today's hearing gives us a chance to dive more deeply into how this process works. These landmark new investments give us a chance to do something essential; think critically about how we execute infrastructure projects, and how we can improve transparency, coordination, and accountability in permitting. Today, we can take one important step in that work by taking a closer look at the work of the Permitting Council. The Permitting Council was established almost a decade ago to oversee the process by which government agencies issues permits on our most expensive projects. It coordinates all environmental reviews and authorizations for a wide array of projects, including renewable energy, electricity, transmission, ports and waterways, and broadband. The Permitting Council improves this process in a few key ways. It gives stakeholders more transparency by publishing approvals and timetables online. It designates a single Federal agency that coordinates the permitting process for each project, and reduces the burden on project sponsors, including State and tribal governments, as well as private companies. The Permitting Council also serves as a Federal center for permitting excellence, where it makes recommendations to agencies on the best practices to improve the permitting process. In other words, the Council helps ensure that these investments can deliver on the promises to improve our nation's infrastructure, create jobs, and transition to a clean energy future. Today, we will have a chance to hear directly from Eric Beightel, the Council's executive director about what Congress can do to support his work. His testimony comes at a crucial moment as the Permitting Council goes through some big changes. In 2022, the Permitting Council received $350 million in the Inflation Reduction Act to transfer to other agencies and governments to improve permitting. These resources will help hire subject matter experts, invest in engagement from stakeholders, and purchase technologies that are used in environmental reviews. The Council also recently established the Tribal Assistance Program (TAP) to earmark a portion of funds for tribes. These resources are intended to help overcome the barriers that tribes often face in engaging in an environmental review process. The Permitting Council has made two transfers for tribal assistance so far. This hearing is an essential opportunity to better understand how these funds will be used, how the permitting process can continue to improve, and how Congress should continue strengthening the Council's purview in the future, and I look forward to the discussion. It is the practice of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) to swear in witnesses. Mr. Beightel, if you would please stand and raise your right hand? Do you swear that the testimony that you will give before this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Mr. Beightel. I do. Chairman Peters. You may be seated. Thank you. Today's witness, Eric Beightel, is the Executive Director of the Permitting Council. Director Beightel has more than 20 years of environmental and infrastructure experience in both the public and the private sector. As a senior environmental policy advisor in the Department of Transportation (DOT), he helped streamline the permitting process while delivering better community outcomes. He's also provided subject matter expertise as a policy advisor at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the private sector, Director Beightel has held leadership positions and roles at engineering and environmental consultancies where he helped guide clients through the Federal environmental regulatory landscape. Director Beightel holds a Bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas, and a Master of Public Policy degree from George Mason University Director. Mr. Director, it is great to have you here today, and we look forward to your testimony, and look forward to having a discussion with you. You may begin with your testimony. TESTIMONY OF ERIC BEIGHTEL,\1\ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FEDERAL PERMITTING IMPROVEMENT STEERING COUNCIL Mr. Beightel. Thank you, Chair Peters, Ranking Member Paul, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the work of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, what we call the Permitting Council. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Beightel appears in the Appendix on page 25. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- My name is Eric Beightel, and I serve as the Executive Director and Chair of the Permitting Council. I came to this role with nearly 25 years of experience in the environmental review and permitting of large complex infrastructure projects. I am honored to testify here today about issues I am passionate about, including making our Federal permitting processes more effective and transparent, developing critical infrastructure efficiently and responsibly, and delivering that infrastructure for the good of the American people. These same goals of transparency, predictability, and accountability were envisioned when Congress created the Permitting Council in 2015 through Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). FAST-41 tasked the agency with addressing the concern that the Federal permitting process was uncoordinated and lacking transparency, leaving important projects mired in avoidable delays. To address this concern, the Permitting Council provides targeted permitting assistance to projects that seek coverage under the FAST-41 program, promoting transparency, predictability, and accountability. As Executive Director, I lead an agency of 21 staff with an $11 million operating budget focused on implementing the FAST-41 statute. I also Chair the Permitting Council, an inter-agency body with deputy secretary- level representation from 13 Federal agencies, the Director of the Office Management and Budget, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). In both of these roles, I work to advance permitting excellence by delivering FAST-41-covered projects, and by identifying, elevating, and coordinating environmental permitting best practices across government. Currently, our FAST-41 portfolio includes 27 projects, reflecting a total investment of nearly $75 billion from sectors like renewable energy, ports and waterways, broadband, electric transmission, and others. The Permitting Council does not issue any permits or approvals. Our work is focused on the process, improving efficient coordination between agencies, and also bringing those agencies together with industry to improve transparency. Together, we work to identify emerging issues and facilitate solutions to improve accountability and progress toward permit deadlines. Our role is simple; we bring transparency to the process by developing a permitting timetable, posting that timetable to the publicly available permitting dashboard, and tracking progress toward all necessary permits for a proposed project. That transparency also provides predictability to agencies, developers, and the American public by detailing the steps and duration for the project to complete the permitting process. We also hold agencies and project sponsors accountable, and report on agency performance under FAST-41. Beyond our project portfolio, the Permitting Council also serves as a Federal center for permitting excellence. Leveraging lessons learned in our ongoing coordination with our Federal partners, we identify, elevate, and promote best practices that support permitting excellence for infrastructure projects governmentwide. With $350 million from the President's Inflation Reduction Act, we have been able to expand our efforts by standing up the Environmental Review Improvement Fund (ERIF) Assistance Program, enabling us to make targeted investments to improve the timeliness and efficiency of infrastructure permitting. With the ERIF Assistance Program, we have invested nearly $165 million to increase capacity at Federal agencies as they prepare to process an unprecedented volume of applications spurred by the projects enabled through generational investments in our infrastructure from the bipartisan infrastructure law, IRA, and the CHIPS and Science Act. We have invested over $30 million in information technology (IT) that will help agencies modernize permitting systems, accelerate decisionmaking, and position them for the future. We are also supporting tribes as they engage in the environmental review process for FAST-41-covered projects. Recognizing the resource constraints that many tribes face, we established the ERIF Tribal Assistance Program to provide funding directly to tribes to enable them to meaningfully engage in agency decisionmaking. I am dedicated to building on our recent success, and delivering on our mission to advance critical infrastructure projects and promote permitting excellence. I will accomplish this through four key priorities. One, continuing to build a strong foundation for the Permitting Council as an agency. Two, administering and overseeing investments made through the ERIF Assistance Program to measure their effectiveness and inform future strategies. Three, track and report on permitting performance to measure the success of FAST-41 and better communicate its benefits. Four, fostering permitting excellence across government by investing in people, tools, and training to improve efficiency and effectiveness. As we approach 10 years since the creation of the Permitting Council and the end of my first year as the executive director, we take great pride in the work we have accomplished so far. I look forward to continuing to work with the Committee to improve the Federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects, and to deliver the benefits of infrastructure investments for the American people. Chairman Peters. Thank you, Director Beightel. Members of this Committee hear a lot of concerns about the Federal permitting process on a regular basis, and particularly how we try to manage the, some of the goals like protecting the environment, but also trying to have a very timely process that can work for all of the entities involved. My first question for you is, what do you see as the biggest challenges that are being faced by agencies right now in the permitting process? How would you rank those challenges? Mr. Beightel. I think there are a number of challenges that agencies face as they look at permitting large infrastructure projects. One is sheer capacity and the staffing capacity of the agencies to handle the number of studies and the applications that are coming in as a result of the investments. What we are doing at the Permanent Council, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is that we are investing in staffing capacity and resource capacity at the agencies to help them address that gap. There's also outdated technological systems at the agencies that do not avail themselves of a fast and efficient process. We have invested in technology to help automate some of those processes. Some of these are paper-based systems that can be upgraded to online systems, online portals for application to automate the review. There are things such as automating and increasing artificial intelligence (AI) for the review of public comment on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents. There are thousands upon thousands of comments that often come in on NEPA documents that take a significant amount of time to look at, review, and respond to. There are opportunities to use technology to automate that and increase efficiency there. There's also just the simple fact that many of our underlying environmental statutes are at competing interests. They do not always work in concert together toward a common goal. They have their own resources that they are protecting. The agencies have their own mission that they are trying to adhere to. What we do at the Permanent Council is bring the agencies together with those competing interests to help facilitate the conversation to ensure that while there may be different goals or outcomes that they are seeking for their individual statutes, that we are working toward a common goal to be able to deliver these infrastructure projects, and providing an overlay of coordination and communication that would not otherwise be there. Chairman Peters. Certainly, streamlining that whole process is essential. But as I mentioned in my question, it's also important to ensure that we have high quality environmental review as well. Now, you talked about a variety of competing legislation or policies that are there, but how can we ensure that while we are pushing for greater efficiency, which is critical, that we also have the highest quality environmental review possible to protect our environment? Mr. Beightel. Absolutely. I think it's important to just recognize that FAST-41 is a procedural statute. It's a procedural process that is intended to provide the timeliness and predictability of the underlying reviews, but it does not influence the reviews. The environmental reviews and permitting actions that are undertaken on these projects are not accelerated to shortcut any sort of standard procedure. They still meet the rigor that is necessary for the project. I want to be clear that while there is an intent for us to go faster, and the predictability, and a transparency helps to ensure that we maintain the timeline, it does not mean that we are doing that at the expense of ensuring that these environmental reviews are giving full consideration of the environmental effects of the projects. Chairman Peters. According to latest data, the Permitting Council is only currently coordinating 33 projects. Only 37 more have been completed and coordinated the permitting process. I would think we probably agree that these figures are far fewer than what we originally envisioned for the Council. My question for you is, can you explain why the Permitting Council is not involved in coordinating more projects? Second question is, what policy changes are necessary to facilitate a more significant coordinating role, which is the intent of this Council? Mr. Beightel. Yes, I appreciate the question, and it is definitely my intent as executive director to ensure that we are expanding coverage of FAST-41 to as many projects as we can. I think there are a number of elements that contributed to a slower start to the agency when it was first created. In FAST-41, there was a sunset clause. There was uncertainty as to the future of the agency. The bipartisan infrastructure law removed that sunset clause. So, only since 2021 have we been a permanent agency. We are still kind of standing up some of the fundamental parts of being an agency. That also relates to our ability to familiarize the public with the agency and the work that we do. There is with the uncertainty of the sunset clause, there were not as many projects perhaps that came to us with interest for coverage. But just in the last year, we have added 12 projects. We are in conversation with 12 more potential projects that are looking to submit applications for FAST-41 coverage. I think our efforts right now to raise the profile of the agency, to share the benefits of the FAST-41 program are yielding benefits already. As far as policy changes to increase participation in the program, there are a couple barriers to entry. One, the cost threshold is at $200 million. We have had projects smaller than that that have approached us with interest in FAST-41 coverage. That is one possibility. There are other technical pieces of the legislation that exempt certain types of projects. Department of Transportation- led projects, as well as projects led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) that are funded through the Water Resources Development Act are also exempted from FAST-41 coverage. We have had ports and waterway projects come to us that would otherwise be eligible to accept that they have funding from the Maritime Administration. They are statutorily exempt. We are unable to provide coverage to port projects that would otherwise seek coverage from us. Chairman Peters. We are working closely right now with your staff, as you are well aware, on legislation that will strengthen the Permitting Council's ability to coordinate the permitting clarify projects, some of the things that you just mentioned. Could you talk about how such legislation would help your efforts and why it's needed? Mr. Beightel. Yes, and I appreciate the question, and I really appreciate the opportunity to review the legislation. Your team has been remarkably helpful as we have provided our technical assistance to help, I think, refine some of the proposals. I have not seen the latest legislation, but I know that they are very technical fixes. FAST-41 as a procedural statute is fairly focused in the statutory language and what the authorities of the Council are. The tweaks that are being proposed, from what I have seen, are going to help us do our job better. I appreciate the Committee's interest in our work. Chairman Peters. Good. We look forward to continuing to work with you and have the Committee work on that. Senator Lankford, you are recognized for your questions. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LANKFORD Senator Lankford. Mr. Chair, thank you. Thank you for being here and for the work that you are doing. The challenge that we have is there's really two ways to be able to streamline permitting. One is to create a permitting streamlining entity, and everything stays the same and we try to figure out how to be able to get everybody in the same room, figure out how to be able to work out convoluted, contradictory statutes and to be able to solve it. The other one is to fix the contradictory statutes that are causing the problem in the first place. Do you see that as part of the mandate that you have at this point, to be able to identify where are the conflicting statutes and then to be able to report that back to us, or is it just a matter of work with what you got? Mr. Beightel. I think our role at the Permitting Council is to work with the underlying legislation as it exists and identify pinch points where the conflict exists. Our projects are navigating these different environmental statutes toward issuing decisions that deliver these projects. Once we have identified those solutions where there are conflicts, we identify that as a best practice, elevate that, and then share that with agencies to ensure that we do not encounter that same issue again, or that we have a strategy in place to resolve it if it should emerge. Senator Lankford. How do we get those conflicts, those pinch points that you're getting so that we can determine how to be able to fix those in statute or to be able to come back through regulation to different agencies and say, how do we fix a regulation that is contradictory? Mr. Beightel. Sure. Right now, we provide annual reports to Congress on the performance of the Permitting Council. We also provide quarterly reports on how the agencies are complying with FAST-41. The specific information that you are requesting are not in those reports. Senator Lankford. Right. That's why I am asking. Mr. Beightel. Yes. We would be happy to follow up with you to figure out if there is additional information\1\ that would be helpful for you as we are looking across the landscape. Right now, we do not provide that information. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The information referred to by Mr. Beightel appears in the Appendix on page 39. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator Lankford. OK. That information, I think, it would be helpful to us. I think at this point Congress has created over decades of different laws and statutes that are out there that are being implemented, and where there are contradictions over decades, people are trying to figure out how to be able to work around rather than getting it back to us and saying, hey, this is a problem that Congress made, Congress needs to fix it. Mr. Beightel. Sure. Senator Lankford. I think that would be helpful for everybody. I am not trying to put you out of a job because there's still plenty of issues that would be dealt with there, but it might make the job easier to not have to try to figure out how to navigate three things that have conflict with each other to be able to solve that. But we cannot see that. You see it on a daily basis, and it's not right for the American people for that to be kept from us, and so that we do not have the opportunity to be able to fix it. That would be helpful. The categorical exclusions is one of those things that was put in years ago. That does not seem to have worked very effectively. I know that's under the $200 million mark on it, that's smaller, but it's one of many examples that I see of attempts to be able to help streamline this process that has not been effective in the past. It would be helpful for us to be able to get back both the things to you, what you are working through already, to be able to review legislation to say these things would be helpful. But it would also be helpful to be able to get the different details on it. Mr. Beightel. Sure. Senator Lankford. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently did a study looking at just the broadband implementation and the permitting issues on that. I know you are not dealing with that a lot right now, but they set a goal to be able to have permitting decisions and such made within 270 days. That's still a really long time. The painful part is they are not making the 270-day even mark. That's the goal to be able to be made, but that's not actually making that goal. When you look at the permitting issues that you are dealing with right now and trying to be able to navigate through what's a typical time to be able to get through the permitting process of a different project and you can pick small to large. Mr. Beightel. That's a question that we get often, Senator, and I appreciate the opportunity to kind of provide a little context around the work that we do. When you compare timelines outside of FAST-41, it is very much kind of an apples to oranges because FAST-41 is the only process in government that actually tracks a project from start to finish throughout all of the environmental reviews and permitting. But also inherent with that, is the uniqueness of each project and the different issues that each project may have, and the different permits and approvals that may be associated with each project. We do not have good data yet, but we are getting there on the average timeline for FAST-41 projects and to be able to report out on the benefits of that. What I would say is we are seeing projects move through the process efficiently and hitting their marks more for permitting timetables. I think we are on the improving upswing here for permitting. Also, to just pivot back to a point that you made about category exclusions and broadband, we have provided significant funding to the National Telecommunications and Information (NTIA) to support their efforts to do efficient environmental reviews and approvals of broadband projects. That is both in capacity as well as in IT investments so that they have greater automated systems to process the flood of applications that are going to result from bid. There's also support to U.S. Forest Service for reviewing applications on forest service lands, which many of these remote areas may cross. We have also provided support to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to extend a program comment to allow for a more efficient process for Section 106 review for broadband. So, understanding that the target of 270 may not currently be met, I have not seen the GAO report, but we are making significant efforts to improve that and make sure that we are meeting the demands of the program. Senator Lankford. OK. September 2023, you all put out a proposed rule dealing with mining and that proposed rule that has not been finalized yet. Is that set to be finalized soon, or do you know a timeline when that'll be finalized? Mr. Beightel. We do not have a timeline yet. We are still considering the comments received. The way that that process will works, we will have to have a vote of the Permitting Council, so all the deputy secretaries will take the vote. Senator Lankford. I have one of the comments in that. Good to be able to do that. One of the comments was coming from me that I put in actually in November 2023 asking why the narrowing because you seem to narrow it on the mining portion to critical minerals, which excludes rare earth, excludes gravel, excludes nickel and lots of copper. Lots of other minerals that are obviously very important to our national security and to our economy were excluded from that initially in the proposed rule. My question from November 2023, and so my question now is, why the narrowing there not looking at national significance, or economically significance, or national security significance minerals, why that narrowing, and is that a part of the dialog at this point? Mr. Beightel. It is definitely the part of the dialog now, and the reasoning behind the proposed rulemaking when it was put out was the administration has really put a laser focus on domestic sourcing of critical minerals because of all the benefits that you have identified, economic competitiveness, national security, and as part of an all-of-government approach to really uplift the domestic sourcing of critical minerals. The rule was seen as a way to prioritize the effort of the agencies toward those projects. Obviously, we received comments back from a number of stakeholders who shared similar concerns. Many of the concerns were around the narrowing, and we are still considering those comments. As I mentioned we do not have a timeline at this point for finalizing. Senator Lankford. Thank you. Mr. Chair, if I can make one quick comment on this. If we do not have more copper, we are not going to do electrification. I know that's not on the critical minerals list, but if we are talking about electrification, we have to have more copper to be able to do that. We have to have more rare earth minerals as well to be able to do almost anything in national security or in electrification. I do get the critical mineral side, but as far as for our economy and our national security, there's a broader swathe of minerals that will be important as well and let you go through all the review process you have. Thank you. Chairman Peters. Thank you, Senator Lankford. Senator Hawley, you are recognized for your questions. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HAWLEY Senator Hawley. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Beightel--is that how I say your name, by the way? Mr. Beightel. It is, yes. Thank you. Senator Hawley. OK. Thanks for being here today. Are you familiar with the Grain Belt Express? Mr. Beightel. I am. Yes, sir. Senator Hawley. Tell us about it. Mr. Beightel. Grain Belt Express is a transmission line crossing Kansas and Missouri. It is currently in the NEPA phase with the draft environmental impact statement, I think, targeted for toward the end of this year, the beginning of next year with the Department of Energy (DOE) as the lead agency. It sought FAST-41 coverage from my agency in February of this year, Senator Hawley. 542 miles of overhead high voltage lines that will cut right across the State of Missouri. You have designated it, you have given it FAST-41 approval, is that correct? Mr. Beightel. It is a FAST-41 covered project. Yes. Senator Hawley. What will the effect of that be, the FAST- 41 designation? Mr. Beightel. FAST-41 is a procedural statute that helps bring the agencies who have permitting actions together. It establishes a permitting timetable to provide predictability and transparency to the public as to what the actions are necessary for the project to seek approval and actually get to construction. We have developed a permitting timetable for that project and posted it to the permitting dashboard, and we will maintain active project management of the timetable to ensure that we are meeting permitting deadlines. Senator Hawley. Here's what you said upon approving the Grain Belt Express for FAST-41 status. ``Grain Belt Express exemplifies the type of transformative transmission projects capable of delivering the triple play of affordability, grid reliability, and more domestic renewable energy production.'' Are you aware that the Grain Belt Express is highly controversial in the State of Missouri and vociferously opposed by farmers in my State? Mr. Beightel. I am aware that there is a local opposition to the project. Yes. Senator Hawley. Yes, to put it mildly. Why is it a good idea to go over the heads of the people of Missouri and give this expressway, which is being developed by a private company that's making probably billions of dollars on it as they take farmers' land? Why is that a good idea? Mr. Beightel. Senator, we do not have actual discretion for projects that seek FAST-41 coverage. It was not a decision on my part actually to grant coverage. If a project meets the criteria as defined in statute and they seek FAST-41 coverage, we are obligated to extend that coverage to the project independent of the individual merits of the project. Senator Hawley. Don't you think that it's kind of incredible that this private company, Invenergy, that is responsible now for Greenbelt Express that is making boatloads of money on it, that is taking farmers' land in my State without compensating them? Here's how bad it was Mr. Beightel. In the State of Missouri, Invenergy was refusing to negotiate with farmers, refusing to give them fair market value using the power of imminent domain. I emphasize, this is a private corporation that is doing this so bad that the Missouri State Legislature had to step in and pass special legislation to require the company to compensate farmers fairly for the land that they were taking. All of this, and the State of Missouri still gets-- originally, we were going to get no benefit from the Grain Belt Expressway. Zero. No power was going to flow to Missourians. It was going to come across our land, take our farmers' land, give the money to this private corporation, and we were going to get zilch. What strikes me is farmers have opposed this for years. Farmers have been trying to get a hearing for years. Farmers have been trying to get anybody to listen to their concerns. This private corporation, Invenergy, which by the way, has sat right where you are sitting and testified about how wonderful this program is, although they can never quite remember how much money they are going to make on it--it's a lot--they get whatever they want when they come to you. Boom, they get their designation. When they go to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), they get their designation. It's amazing. Every Federal agency is bending over backwards to give this private corporation everything they want. And working farmers in my State and working people in my State who live on the land, maybe have lived on the land for generations, eking out a living, they can't get anything. They cannot even get compensated for their land. This corporation is making billions, and you are telling me there's just nothing you can do about it. Mr. Beightel. We do not influence the decisionmaking process for the project. Senator Hawley. There's not a decision at all on your part? Mr. Beightel. No. Senator Hawley. You are just a rubber stamp. Mr. Beightel. We do not approve any projects. Mr. Beightel. The FAST-41 you are just saying that that's just merely a what? That's just an administrative designation. I mean, you do not have anything to do with it? Mr. Beightel. It is an administrative designation. Senator Hawley. What's the Permitting Council do then? You do not review applications when you make the designation? Does an algorithm do it? Mr. Beightel. If a project meets the criteria for a covered project, meaning it is subject to NEPA---- Senator Hawley. Who reviews whether it meets the covered criteria? Mr. Beightel. I do. Senator Hawley. OK. So, you do make a determination? Mr. Beightel. I make a determination that it meets the criteria. The minimum criteria is that it has $200 million investment subject to NEPA and multiple Federal approvals, that project meets that criterion. Senator Hawley. There is a decisionmaking process. You are part of it. You have approved this. Listen, this is the same story that we get every time and that, frankly, farmers and workers in my State get every time. It's always that, sorry, there's nothing we can do. The corporation can get whatever it wants. Want to take the land, fine, go for it. Want to designate this as a high transmission zone, fine, go for it. FAST-41, absolutely, we would be happy to do it. But farmers are told, oh, you have concerns, there's just no place for you to be heard. Now, you are telling me that you just did not have any discretion in it, you are just a functionary. The corporation can just get whatever it wants. Maybe that is the law. I doubt it. If it is, it needs to be changed. But I am just here to tell you on behalf of the people of my State, I think it's outrageous that a private corporation can take this kind of land. We are talking about a massive corridor right across the central part of Missouri. We are talking about taking land from farmers whose families it has been for generations. These are not corporate farmers, these are small family farmers. They live on this land. They do not hire lobbyists. They do not appear before your agency, clearly. They do not have any voice, obviously, and they are just told you have just got to suck it up and take it. I just have a problem with that. I just think it's ridiculous. Frankly, if you do not have any discretion and your agency does not have any discretion, I question why you exist. If you really just are rubber stamping whatever comes before you, let's just shut down your council and replace you with a computer algorithm if you do not have any discretion. I just think this is ridiculous. I think the whole thing is ridiculous. I think the idea that a private corporation can leverage the laws of the United States and every piece of the Federal Government in order to get what it wants, and make billions off the people of Missouri when they are getting no benefit is ridiculous. It is why the people of this country hate their government so much and suspect it, and they have every reason to do so. I just think the whole thing is ridiculous. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Peters. Thank you, Senator Hawley. Can you talk a little bit about the Permitting Council strategy and plans for coordinating with State permitting and environmental agencies? Mr. Beightel. Absolutely. I appreciate the question. We are actively engaging with States right now. I see that as untapped potential, really, for the Permitting Council. Obviously, Federal approvals are necessary for infrastructure projects, but there are also going to be State approvals. FAST-41 allows us to enter into an agreement with States for them to opt in where they would place their State approvals onto the Federal permitting dashboard and subject themselves to the same transparency and accountability that Federal agencies do. We are also working with States to identify pipeline of projects, and we recently executed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority (RETA) to essentially establish a relationship whereby they would look at the projects in their portfolio that could qualify for FAST-41, and then direct them to us for conversations to see if FAST-41 coverage would be appropriate. This is building off of the success that we had with the SunZia transmission line in New Mexico. We are looking at ways that we can really engage the States in more thorough conversations about what projects are within their borders that would qualify for FAST-41, but also how we can provide the same strategies that we do to the Federal Government to State agencies. Chairman Peters. You mentioned a number of things. Michigan right now is engaged in making historic infrastructure investments to reach climate neutrality by 2050. You mentioned some efforts that you have been taking to help States, but could you be a little more specific as to how the Permitting Council might support this investment goal in my home State of Michigan? Mr. Beightel. Yes. I applaud Michigan for setting such an ambitious target. I think, the easiest way for us to be supportive is to put projects that are in furtherance of that goal on the dashboard. Extend FAST-41 coverage to those projects because it's an opt-in program. Those projects would have to seek coverage from us, but, I think that's the easiest way. Second, we have actually had conversations with the infrastructure coordinator in Michigan in looking at potential projects that could qualify for FAST-41. There are ways, once a project comes in and is covered by FAST-41, as I mentioned, that opt-in program could be a way for us to help elevate the State approvals and help to provide a framework for them to be more efficient and transparent. Chairman Peters. Very good. What is the Permitting Council doing now to promote engagement with tribes? If you give us a walk through that a little bit would be appreciated. Mr. Beightel. Sure. We recognize the importance that tribes play in the consultative process for the environmental review and approval of projects. Tribes that are engaged on FAST-41 projects, we have had, particularly on the East Coast with the growth of offshore wind and offshore wind Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), reflects the largest proportion of projects in our portfolio. There are a number of tribes who are being asked to consult on multiple projects at once. In response to the demands that we are placing on the tribes, we have created a Tribal Assistance Program using the Environmental Review Improvement Fund, to provide support directly to the tribes to enable them to engage meaningfully in these project reviews to ensure that their considerations are accounted for in the agency decisionmaking process. We also have a dedicated staff person who is our director of tribal affairs. For a team of only 21 staff, I think it reflects the importance and the significance that we place on our engagement with tribes to have a dedicated staff person who is working, particularly with the tribes, to raise awareness of FAST-41 program, as well as the Tribal Assistance Program. We have brought in three tribal broadband projects. With the bipartisan infrastructure law, there was the creation of a new criteria, a tribal criterion, which allows FAST-41 to cover projects that are tribally sponsored and occur on tribal lands. With that, we have had, as I mentioned, three tribal broadband projects come forward, and we are in conversation with other tribes about future projects as well. Chairman Peters. That's all good. Is there anything more that you think we should be doing to assist tribes? Mr. Beightel. Honestly, I think, the more we can provide financial assistance to the tribes to encourage and enable their active participation in these projects, the better off these projects will be incorporating tribal knowledge, and their cultural awareness of their lands, and the artifacts that may be present. An awareness of tribal interests will help us to make these projects designed more appropriately, accounting for the tribal interests. Ultimately, I think it will be more efficient down the road because we will avoid, with early engagement with the tribes, issues that may bubble up toward the end, which would have a much more significant effect on timeline. Chairman Peters. Very good. The Permitting Council is charged with holding agencies accountable when they disagree about how long it takes to issue a permit. Could you tell the Committee about the Permitting Council's work mediating disputes between Federal agencies over these permitting timetables? Mr. Beightel. Yes. I think I mentioned earlier, the competing interest of various underlying environmental statutes that breeds not necessarily a dispute, but there are different objectives for the agencies as they go through their environmental permitting process. On a day-to-day basis, our infrastructure project advisors who are the primary points of contact for these projects, who work with their agency partners, will work through those sorts of challenges, disputes at a very staff level. Not elevating, typically, most of these issues, but every now and then we will have a challenge that warrants elevation. The benefit of having the deputy secretary-level representation on the Permitting Council is that I have a direct line to agency leadership who are responsible for these permits and are able to talk through whatever these challenges are and help to work toward a resolution. Because at the end of the day, what we are trying to do is deliver the infrastructure projects, and deliver defendable decisions that are durable to litigation, as well as incorporating all of the agency interests that they reflect. Chairman Peters. Do you believe the Council has appropriate authorities to coordinate and mediate these permitting timetables? Mr. Beightel. I do. I think there is a little bit of ambiguity in the dispute resolution process itself as it's written in statute that could be further clarified, potentially. But, we do not issue permits, as I mentioned. Ultimately, what we are here to do is to make sure that we have a path forward with the agencies to ensure that they are getting the information that they need, and are able to support their decision on a timeline that is workable with the overall project timeline. I think that we have adequate authority. I think there could be greater clarity in the roles of the participants. Chairman Peters. Very good. Senator Rosen, you are recognized for your questions. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROSEN Senator Rosen. Thank you, Chair Peters. Appreciate it, and thank you for holding this really important hearing today, and appreciate you being here as well. I want to talk a little bit about permitting and public lands in Nevada, because over 80 percent of Nevada land is managed by the Federal Government, the highest percentage I believe, in the Nation. That's over 56 million acres of public lands. It means permitting a project in Nevada, well, frankly, no easy task. There are numerous important stakeholders to engage with. We have our tribes and conservationists, our sportsmen, our ranchers, mining other local community members, city governments, all of that. A project should be really thoughtfully considered and planned so that resource conflicts are minimized from the starts. This means early communication and collaboration between stakeholders and permitting agencies. It's absolutely key and critical. We have made progress in beginning to streamline this process through the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which I was proud to vote for. But we can do more by allowing agencies to work concurrently rather than consecutively through the permitting process. Because if one thing goes after the other, you just run out of time. You delay the time. The States are critically important, so what needs to happen consecutively, we should allow that to go on. Mr. Beightel, has the Council considered ways to do this concurrent work so that we can cut through that red tape and get our project--at least get some determination whether they are going, not going, what do people have to do. This consecutive process just isn't working for us. What's the biggest barrier, if you have not done it, to adopting this process? Mr. Beightel. I appreciate the question. The working concurrently rather than consecutively is a fundamental best practice for permitting and the 41 agencies to work concurrently on permitting reviews and environmental approvals for FAST-41-covered projects. For the projects that come in for coverage under our program, when we create the permitting timetable, we are looking at ways that are going to enable these actions to occur concurrently so that we are working simultaneously toward a common goal of reaching a decision on an agreed upon timeline. I think Senator, we are already prioritizing that. I would also note that the bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule, the NEPA Phase 2 Rule, that CEQ, just finalized, also prioritizes the concurrent review of NEPA and permitting actions to enable the more efficient review and approval of these projects. I think we are taking strong steps in that direction. It will take a little while for it to spread fully across government, I suppose, but for the FAST-41 projects that we have in our portfolio, that is the State of practice, and that is what is expected. Senator Rosen. This is critically important to all the funding that's coming down to Nevada for these critically important projects in wind, water, solar, geothermal, critical minerals, and even implementing broadband expansion, all of the things that we have to do to keep our State growing, thriving and competitive. How can Congress empower the Permitting Council to really take a more significant role? Because you are saying you are directing agencies to do this. Is it coming down to our local levels? Are they understanding that they have to collaborate and coordinate, and where they can, even not just concurrently, maybe they can share some of the data. It does not have to even be done twice, that it can also reduce the cost of a project? Mr. Beightel. No, and I think that that's an important question. What the distinction that I would like to draw is that we have, under FAST-41, we have our covered projects, and we have control or influence over the way that the timetables are developed for our covered projects. But there are a vast number of projects that are not covered under FAST-41, where we have obviously much less influence. What we do, however, is to identify those best practices that we learn from the covered projects and coordinate with the agencies to help them adopt those sorts of strategies, so the-- -- Senator Rosen. Trying to filter it down to the local level. Mr. Beightel. Exactly. Senator Rosen. That's what we really need to do. Because last week I hosted Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, to discuss the barriers of bringing broadband to Northern Nevada. We actually are the most mountainous State in the Lower 48, and we have to bring it to Northern Nevada and rural parts of our State. A large part of the conversation we had last week centered around challenges of permitting on Federal land. NTIA has worked to mitigate delays on the front end by releasing permitting templates, environmental screening tools for all the applicants, but more needs to be done. Can you speak a little bit about how the Permitting Council is working with the Department of Commerce (DOC) to ensure projects like those funded under the bipartisan infrastructure law are able to meet the construction deadlines because the permitting process, again, is slowing them out? Mr. Beightel. Absolutely. We have been working very closely with the NTIA to help them get the resources that they need to be able to manage the influx of applications that are going to result from the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program (BEAD). I mentioned earlier, we have provided funding to the NTIA to increase staff capacity. It's also to improve information technology tools to ensure that they have automated systems to process the applications as they come in. We have worked with the U.S. Forest Service to help develop tools to enable faster, more efficient permitting across forest lands. We have also provided funding to Department of Interior (DOI) to support broadband teams, to enable them to be more efficient. We are looking at additional ways to do programmatic reviews under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for broadband projects to enable that to be more efficient as well. We recognize that there is a high demand for NTIA staff to be able to review and approve these broadband projects, and we are doing as much as we can to help provide results. Senator Rosen. Could you talk about the permitting dashboard that you have been working on? I am a former computer programmer and systems analyst. I know you have talked about we have the permitting dashboard, how that's going to improve the efficiency and efficacy of environmental reviews as it makes sense for us to invest in this digital streamlining for all the stakeholders, everybody that's working on it. How has the technology been helpful in the permitting process, and where do we need to go to utilize the technology, again, to help us move forward faster, whatever the response is in this area? Mr. Beightel. The dashboard really is our, kind of our front porch to the American public. That is where people will go to look and identify the projects that are FAST-41-covered. It serves multiple purposes. It is not only for us at the Permitting Council to illustrate the FAST-41-covered projects, but it also is used by the Department of Transportation for projects that they are undergoing environmental review. It right now is very much a portal for the public to see what is happening and less interactive. I think there are upgrades that we could make to that tool to make---- Senator Rosen. Should you use this as a model for other agencies? Your permitting dashboard would be a good template as we are trying to do this across agencies? Mr. Beightel. It absolutely could, or it could be the portal for agencies. I think what we are hoping to encourage agencies is where there are requirements to post timetables for projects, whether they are FAST-41-covered or not, to use the dashboard. It already exists. Senator Rosen. Yes. I like the dashboard idea. I will be glad to submit some more questions for the record. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Peters. Thank you, Senator Rosen. Senator Carper, you are recognized for your questions. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER Senator Carper. Thanks so much. Mr. Beightel, we welcome you. I understand your wife Hillary's with you. Would you raise your hand, ma'am? Mr. Beightel. Yes. Senator Carper. All right. I understand you got some children here? Mr. Beightel. Yes. Senator Carper. A daughter, Ainsley. Is that you, Ainsley? All right, raise your hand, Ainsley. Ainsley, do you have a brother? Miss Beightel. Yes. Senator Carper. What's his name? Miss Beightel. Max. Senator Carper. All right. Max, to the max. Ainsley, do you have any grandparents here? Miss Beightel. Yes. Senator Carper. Are these your parents? That's a question Hillary--are these your parents? Mr. Beightel. Yes. Senator Carper. Good. All right. We thank you all for coming along. My first question is, and I ask variations of this question, but if you try to get people to explain complex concepts, I say how would you explain this to your grandparents? I am going to say, how would you explain what you do to your in-laws? Mr. Beightel. The simplest way to explain what we do is that we are an agency that provides coordination among the various Federal agencies that are responsible for permitting big infrastructure projects. What we do is provide transparency, and predictability, and accountability to the permitting process. Many times, people do not understand the various steps that go into permitting a big infrastructure project. What we do is break it down into the individual steps and the milestones to achieve those permits, and provide a timeline for the accomplishment of that task. People can look at it and understand if it starts on day one, we have until day 365 to achieve this outcome. Senator Carper. Good. I am looking at your in-laws, and thumbs up, thumbs down. What are you thinking? All right. They are rolling their eyes.  Mr. Beightel. I get that a lot, Senator. Senator Carper. Not really. I have just come from the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, which is having a hearing on the Key Bridge, the bridge in Baltimore that was badly damaged. I have to slip back down there and ask some more questions. I see Rebecca Higgins who was a longtime member of the Environment Public Works Committee, helped us write big parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. Hugely helpful, and during my tenure in the committee. Rebecca, it's nice to see, see you. My question. Last year, the Environment and Public Works Committee held, I think, not one, but a couple of hearings on permitting, common theme at our hearings, on the importance of public engagement. As you may know, we learned that when project sponsors understand community concerns early in the process, sponsors can often include solutions in the project's design. Public engagement can build trust, it can increase public buy-in, can help resolve issues, can help prevent litigation, and ultimately it can save time and money. A question, based on your experience, how does community engagement facilitate timely completion of reviews and improve permitting outcomes? Mr. Beightel. I appreciate that question, Senator. Early and meaningful engagement is a kind of foundational piece of effective environmental review. The bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule, the NEPA Phase 2 Rule, emphasizes early public engagement as part of the NEPA process. What we do at the Permitting Council for our FAST-41-covered projects is ensure that we are providing transparent information to the public about the project and its status in the permitting process. Ultimately, the earlier you engage with affected stakeholders and have meaningful conversations with them to identify their concerns, and also potential issues on a project, the better you are able to incorporate those concerns into project design, into the analysis, to ensure that you are identifying alternatives that will not result in avoidable impacts that would then trigger further complications down the road. The earlier you engage, the sooner you identify the issues, the earlier you can resolve them. What often happens without early engagement and meaningful public involvement is that issues will emerge later in the process that you could have identified sooner, that will have a much more material effect on the permitting timeline. If you can identify early and resolve them early, you can have much more predictability. At the end of the day, project sponsors are willing to account for a slightly longer timeline if they know that it's going to be longer. The unpredictability of unexpected delays is what can really cause problems. Senator Carper. I am reminded of a hearing that we held before the Environment and Public Works Committee. I think it was late last year, and the issue of what can we do to ensure better outcomes in projects. We had a wide range of witnesses, different views. You would not expect them to agree on something like this. They all came back in their testimony, said we are better off when we hear community concerns at the beginning of the process rather than at the end. Then let me ask a second question with respect to the Inflation Reduction Act funds. As you mentioned in your testimony, the Inflation Reduction Act included some $350 million, with an M, million, the Environmental Review Improvement Fund, which we created, as you will recall in the FAST-41 Act, oftentimes when Federal agencies have adequate resources, permitting is more efficient. My question is now, how has the $350 million for the Inflation Reduction Act, for the Environmental Review Improvement Fund, how has that helped the Permitting Council support other Federal agencies, States, and tribes in improving permitting reviews? If you could give us a couple of examples, please. Mr. Beightel. Absolutely. We have provided $165 million to Federal agencies to increase capacity at those agencies, whether that be hiring full time equivalent (FTEs) at the agency, contract support, or other tools, templates that they can develop to improve the efficiency and timeliness of the environment review permitting process. We have also invested $30 million in IT solutions at the agencies to help them build, modernize, I should say, their IT infrastructure, to bring it into the 21st century, in many cases. There is an example that I like to cite is that the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) used to use a Microsoft Word document for their bridge permit application. With the investments that we have made at the Coast Guard, they are actually making an online portal for the bridge application, which will make it much more efficient for review and intake of those permitting actions. We have also provided funds to tribes who are engaged in the environmental review and permitting for FAST-41-covered projects through our Tribal Assistance Program. Senator Carper. All right. Mr. Chair, if I can do a follow- up question? Mr. Chair please? How is the permitting Council using the environmental review improvement funds to promote early and meaningful community engagement? Mr. Beightel. Our tools that we are investing in at the agencies and the resources that we are investing in will enable the agencies to do more meaningful outreach. It will make the process more transparent for project applicants and the public. We are also obviously using our dashboard to provide vital information to the public on the status of the projects. Also, I mentioned the Tribal Assistance Program, that is all about engagement with tribes who are engaged in FAST-41 program. Senator Carper. OK, good. Thanks. I have a bunch of other questions I have, and I will submit those for the record.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The questions submitted by Senator Carper appears in the Appendix on page 00. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I need to get back to my other committee. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Thanks for letting jump in here. I want to say to your children, again, I love it when folks witnesses bring spouses, children, in-laws, and it's a family affair. How old are your kids? Mr. Beightel. They are 9 and 11. Senator Carper. Who's 9, daughter? Mr. Beightel. Max. Senator Carper. Yes. Son, 11. Let me talk to the two of you just for a second. OK. We have as you know, 50 States. He's our Chair, he's our leader on this Committee. He's from the State of Michigan. I am from the State of Delaware, although I am a huge fan of the Detroit Tigers, as he knows. Chairman Peters. We are happy about that. Senator Carper. Yes. But just for your kids. We have 50 States. Every State has two U.S. Senators, and our job is to help make the rules for the country. That's what we do. We help make the rules for the country, and we do not do this by ourselves. We have a lot of people helping us who are sitting behind us and in the audience as well. But that's what we do. Help make the rules for the country. We are delighted to have a chance to work with your dad, your husband, your son-in-law in this effort. This is important stuff. This is important stuff for our country today, and going forward. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Peters. Thank you, Senator Carper. Hopefully, they will both get extra credit for school today. This is a civics lesson. That's very good. That's great. Mr. Beightel. I promised them froyo afterwards.  Chairman Peters. That's even more important for them, clearly. My last question for you, sir, is could you just tell us a little bit about your vision for balancing the two roles of the Permitting Council? First, coordinating specific infrastructure projects, but also, how do we improve permitting process broadly across the whole Federal Government enterprise? Can you give us an idea of that vision and how you see we can be helpful? Mr. Beightel. Yes. I am passionate about improving the overall permitting process for infrastructure. This is something that I have spent pretty much my entire career working on. When I came into this role, I really embraced the idea of the agency as a center for permitting excellence. This is something where we have the opportunity to learn from the projects that we have that are covered under FAST-41. They are, by their nature, very large, very complex and present often unique challenges that we can learn from. We are very focused on ensuring that we are managing those projects to the permitting timetables that they are created. But we are also focused on pulling back. After we have looked at the inventory of projects that we have and the progress that we have made, where were the pinch points. We had a question earlier about the pinch points among the various Federal pieces of legislation and how there might be competing interests. How do we learn from the experience that we have on these very large, complex projects to develop better strategies, better tools, better templates that can be used for other projects? We will never have all of the Federal investments covered under FAST-41, but what we can do is apply lessons learned across government. We are very intentional about extracting these lessons learned. We have a full unit within the agency that is focused on permitting excellence on extracting these lessons learned, working with the agencies to develop new strategies, overseeing the funds that we are investing through the ERIF Assistance Program, to ensure that they are going toward their intended purpose and measuring that effectiveness to inform future strategy. I think, the two roles are separate, in idea and concept, but they are very much integrated in action and very complimentary so that what we learn to apply for future projects outside of FAST-41. But also, those coming in, we are able to provide even better-informed technical assistance to these projects as they approach us, and we are able to develop permitting timetables that are still aggressive and achievable, leveraging these lessons learned. Chairman Peters. Wonderful. Thank you, Director Beightel. Thank you for being here today. Thank you for sharing your testimony as well as your expertise. Congress has made significant investments in the CHIPS and Science Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and the Inflation Reduction Act. Congress has also given the Permitting Council the tools and the authorities to improve coordination, transparency, and predictability, and the permitting process to enable the Federal Government to deliver on these important investments. I believe that additional legislative reforms could build on this progress by clarifying the Council's authorities, as well as the scope of projects covered, and increasing transparency in the permitting process. I look forward to working with the Council. I look forward to working with you and my colleagues on these potential reforms in the near future. Thank you once again for being here. Thank you for bringing your family here--and you need to be proud of your dad. He's doing a great job. It's good to have you here, and thank you for your service to our country. The record for this hearing will remain open for 15 days until 5 p.m. on July 25, 2024, for the submission of statements and questions for the record.  Chairman Peters. This hearing is now adjourned.  A P P E N D I X ----------
