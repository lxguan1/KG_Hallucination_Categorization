AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS: PROHIBITING FOREIGN INTERFERENCE ---------- December 18, 2024 Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in room 1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Bryan Steil  presiding. Present: Representatives Steil, Griffith, Bice, Carey, D'Esposito, Lee, Morelle, Torres, and Kilmer. Staff present: March Bell, General Counsel; Jackie Bossman, Counsel; Annemarie Cake, Professional Staff and Deputy Clerk; Alexander Deise, Counsel; Thomas Lane, Elections Counsel and Director of Elections Coalitions; Kristen Monterroso, Director of Operations and Legislative Clerk; Marissa Mullen, Deputy Director of Member Services; Michael Platt, Staff Director; Jordan Wilson, Director of Member Services; Khalil Abboud, Minority Deputy Staff Director; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director; Sarah Nasta, Minority Senior Advisor and Director; Owen Reilly, Minority Professional Staff; Matt Schlesinger, Minority Senior Counsel; and Sean Wright, Minority Chief Counsel. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REP- RESENTATIVE FROM WISCONSIN Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the chair may declare a recess at any time. Also without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days so Members may submit any materials they wish to be included therein. Thank you, Ranking Member Morelle, Members of the Committee, and our witnesses, for participating at today's hearing. Today, the Committee on House Administration is continuing our oversight of Federal elections. For too long now, Americans have been concerned about the threat of foreign interference in our elections and attempts to destabilize the democratic processes. As Chairman of the Committee, I have worked to restore Americans' faith in our elections, but foreign adversaries still have loopholes they can exploit to influence American elections. Today, we will explore two key things: There are current laws on the books that prohibit foreign interference. We will explore how these laws are working in practice and how they are enforced. There are also loopholes that exist under current law that still allow foreign actors to influence U.S. elections. Let us dive into how that is possible. Federal law generally prohibits non-citizens or foreign businesses from directly giving to candidates' campaigns, super-PACs, or running ads in support for or against candidates. However, it is currently legal for foreign nationals to indirectly funnel money through 501(c) organizations. These organizations can then channel that money to super-PACs or another 501(c) to directly help a candidate or influence a policy. As Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, I introduced, and the Committee passed, the Preventing Foreign Interference in American Elections Act that closes this specific loophole. It is important that we continue to evaluate the current legal system and focus on strengthening and enforcement of our laws to prevent foreign interference in American elections. On the other hand, we have also had to address the illegal methods utilized by foreign adversaries to funnel illicit money into U.S. campaigns. For example, it is currently illegal for someone to donate to a political campaign in the name of another person; yet there are concerns foreign adversaries are utilizing identities of unwitting U.S. citizens in order to donate to U.S. campaigns. We have shown that there are vulnerabilities in our campaign finance system that will allow a foreign actor to use a U.S. citizen as a straw donor in order to contribute. This method would be very challenging to detect but may involve the use of gift cards in the name of an unwitting straw donor to avoid detection when facilitating such transactions. Bad actors may also illegally exploit multiple unwitting identities to break large donations into smaller amounts, allowing them to circumvent individual contribution limits. These efforts effectively disguise illegal donations and allow foreign actors to violate campaign finance laws that are currently in place. In the last year, the Committee on House Administration has been reviewing online donation platform policies that have vulnerabilities that may allow foreign interference to occur. I uncovered recently that major Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue did not automatically reject the use of prepaid gift cards or require users input the card verification value, the CVV--that is that three-or four-digit code on the back of your credit card--that could have been creating a loophole that foreign bad actors could have exploited. In August of this year, I wrote a letter to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, requesting information on its work to combat illicit election funding efforts, particularly from foreign actors. To this day, the Committee has not yet received a response to our questions or a briefing from FinCEN. This is unacceptable. In October, I requested information from the Treasury Department on potential election interference through fraudulent donations and asked to review any suspicious activity reports related to ActBlue. The Treasury Department has yet to allow this Committee or the Committee on Oversight, chaired by James Comer, to review those SARs. Following my investigation into the methods used by foreign adversaries to funnel money into U.S. elections, I introduced the SHIELD Act, which will prohibit political committees from accepting contributions without the disclosure of the CVV or from gift cards. I am pleased to say that this bill passed the House and now awaits Senate passage. Unfortunately, foreign interference in U.S. elections is not confined to the campaign finance space. We have also seen foreign actors try to influence our elections through disinformation campaigns and cyber attacks. Foreign-backed disinformation campaigns take advantage of First Amendment protections and spread false and misleading narratives to undermine trust, polarize voters, and sway public opinion. This is a serious vulnerability. Cyber attacks can illegally target election infrastructure, including voter registration data bases or email systems of political campaigns, in an attempt to disrupt processes or steal sensitive information. We saw an example of this during the most recent Presidential election when President-elect Trump's campaign was allegedly hacked by Iranian nationals. We must ensure that America's election system is secure and fair. Democrats and Republicans agree that elections should be free from foreign interference. This should not be a partisan issue. It is imperative that we continue working to prevent foreign interference, and it starts with closing the loopholes that exist under current Federal law. Throughout this Congress, this Committee has worked to improve Americans' confidence in our elections system. Again, today, we will focus on laws that are currently on the books to prevent foreign interference as well as explore current loopholes that exist. There is more work to be done. I would like to thank our witnesses for joining us today, and I look forward to a robust conversation on these critical issues. I will now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for 5 minutes for the purpose of providing an opening statement.

JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK Mr. Morelle. Good morning, and thank you, Chairman Steil. Thank you to all of our witnesses for being here, particularly so close to the holidays. We greatly appreciate your participation. At the outset, let me say, House Democrats care deeply about the integrity of our elections. That will always be our North Star. Foreign interference in our elections strikes at the very heart of democratic self-government. When we find opportunities to deter foreign interference and protect the integrity of our elections, House Democrats have worked and will continue to work to find bipartisan solutions. As the chair referenced, earlier this week I was proud to support him in passage of H.R. 9488, the SHIELD Act, which will provide additional privacy and security protections for Americans who donate to political campaigns online. The final bill was a product of extensive bipartisan negotiations and reflects, I think, critical revisions that had been secured by Committee Democrats as we worked through the process. Again, grateful to him and to the staff for that work. Regrettably, however, today's hearing is not truly about only protecting and promoting election integrity but an effort at additional partisan posturing, as the majority appears fixated on ActBlue, the prominent fundraising platform, and the majority has made in the past some specious claims unaccompanied by facts--all smoke, in many respects, no fire. If we truly care about deterring election interference, we would look in everyone's backyard. We would look in--and the Republicans would look in their own backyard. I will apologize if I missed this, but I have not seen an oversight letter or subpoena to WinRed, the prominent conservative fundraising platform which was created in response to the tremendous success of ActBlue. According to CNN, WinRed had nearly seven times more Federal Trade Commission complaints than ActBlue from January 1922 through June 2024. One 82-year-old woman, who wore pajamas with holes in them because she did not want to spend money on new ones, did not realize she had given Republicans more than $350,000 while living in a 1,000-square-foot Baltimore condo since 2020. Committee Republicans have not said anything about that or the blatant scheme to swindle older Americans. Focusing on ActBlue is about politics, pure and simple. There are things to get to here, we agree, but not picking one side and ignoring entirely the actions of the other side. Now, my colleagues are also focused on foreign funding of ballot initiatives, and, to their credit, this is a very pressing issue. Some of the testimony before this Committee seeks to blame the problem squarely on the shoulders of a single donor, but, in my neighborhood, we would call that something else but here I will just refer to that approach as ``malarkey.'' We all agree, ballot initiatives are a basic expression of our uniquely American expression of self- government and experience with self-government. Without a doubt, ballot initiatives should be protected from foreign intervention, we agree. Federal campaign finance law bars foreign nationals from contributing or donating money in connection with a Federal, State, or local election. In 2015, I note, however, three Republican Commissioners on the FEC voted to dismiss an enforcement action brought against foreign corporate special interests who spent $327,000 to oppose a California public health ballot measure. In doing so, those Republican Commissioners opened a loophole foreign special interests have exploited. For example, in Maine, a Canadian-owned utility funneled over $20 million opposing a Maine citizen ballot initiative in 2020, dwarfing all other spenders on that campaign. Similar outside, foreign special-interest spending defeated a local Oregon ballot measure opposing the development of a natural gas pipeline in 2017. As we will hear more today, foreign corporate money defeated a 2018 water quality ballot initiative in Montana. You will hear from a native Montanan about the harms foreign corporate spending poses in ballot initiatives--a disquieting story of a foreign company that donated $288,000 to oppose the ballot initiative, which, if passed, quote, ``would increase Montana's ability to avoid polluting the State's waters,'' end quote--to put profits over people. As one Democratic Federal Election Commissioner put it, a-- Commission Commissioner put it, ``A company based halfway around the world made a sizable donation, interjecting itself, in hopes of future profits, into a political debate in Montana over mining and the quality of Montana's waters.'' This story has a lamentable but unsurprising ending: The FEC dismissed the matter, allowing the foreign corporation's spending to influence a local Montana election to go unpunished. This outcome has real-world consequences. Montana's water is now more likely to be less clean, harming public health, the environment, agriculture, ranching, the outdoor recreation industry, and everyday quality of life in Montana. Unfortunately, three Republican FEC Commissioners opened a loophole for foreign corporations to exploit. We need to close this loophole, we agree. We cannot stop there. Since the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United decision, our campaign finance system, to put it lightly, has been broken, and it is going to continue to be broken until we make a fix. It is broken in a significant way. This year, one donor, one single donor, billionaire Elon Musk, spent at least $277 million of his own money backing Donald Trump and other Republican candidates. Also this year, just coincidentally, Musk's net worth climbed by more than $200 billion, with the vast bulk of the increase, $170 billion, coming just since election day. According to OpenSecrets, five donors gave over $100 million during the 2024 election. We need to fix this broken special-interest big-money campaign finance system. The vast majority of Americans support that and understand that getting money--big money out of politics is important for them to have their influence over their Government. We need to stem all avenues of potential foreign interference. We need meaningful disclosure of campaign funds and a functioning FEC. That is why Democrats will continue to support the Freedom to Vote Act. If we are serious about preventing foreign interference, please, let us do this in a bipartisan manner. I welcome it, and I would urge us to do it together. Sadly, given some of the work as it relates to elections here, I suspect that will not happen. Before yielding back, I want to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the CNN article titled ``How Elderly Dementia Patients Are Unwittingly Fueling Political Campaigns,'' which includes an observation that, quote, ``elderly, vulnerable consumers have unwittingly given away six-figure sums to political campaigns--most often to Republicans.'' I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a Washington Post article entitled ``Elon Musk Put $277 Million Into the Election. He's $200 Billion Richer This Year.'' And, with that, I yield back my time. Chairman Steil. Without objection.

Without objection, all other Members' opening statements will be made part of the hearing record if they are submitted to the Committee clerk by 5 p.m. today. Today, we have one witness panel. We welcome Mr. Matthew O'Neill, Ms. Caitlin Sutherland, Mr. Bradley Bowman, and Mr. Derf Johnson. Our first witness, Matthew O'Neill, is a former managing director of the Secret Service Global Cyber Investigative Operations, a position in which he directed and participated in worldwide cyber investigations. Our next witness, Ms. Caitlin Sutherland, is the executive director for Americans for Public Trust. Americans for Public Trust has been at the forefront of reporting on foreign influence in U.S. elections. Our next witness, Mr. Bradley Bowman, is the senior director for the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Mr. Bowman has expertise on the broad spectrum of actions undertaken by foreign state actors to influence American elections. Our last witness, Derf Johnson, is the deputy director for the Montana Environmental Information Center. We appreciate all of you being here today and look forward to your testimony. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of Committee Rule 6, the witnesses will please stand and raise their right hand.  Chairman Steil. Let the record show the witnesses all answered in the affirmative. You may be seated. Let me remind the witnesses that we have read your written statements and they will appear in full in the hearing record. Under Committee Rule 9, you are to limit your oral presentation to a brief summary of your written statement. I will now begin and recognize Mr. Matthew O'Neill for 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF MATTHEW K. O'NEILL, CO-FOUNDER AND PARTNER, 5OH CONSULTING; CAITLIN SUTHERLAND, EXEC- UTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICANS FOR PUBLIC TRUST; BRAD- LEY BOWMAN, SENIOR DIRECTOR, CENTER ON MILITARY AND POLITICAL POWER, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DE- MOCRACIES; AND DERF JOHNSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, MON- TANA ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION CENTER STATEMENT OF MATTHEW K. O'NEILL Mr. O'Neill. Good morning, Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the urgent threat---- Chairman Steil. I am going to--would you just pull the microphone a little bit closer---- Mr. O'Neill. Oh, I am sorry. Chairman Steil . since--I want to make sure people online are able to hear you as well. Mr. O'Neill. Copy that. Chairman Steil. Thank you. Mr. O'Neill. OK. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the urgent threat of financial interference in U.S. elections through financial crimes. Addressing this issue is not just about protecting our democracy; it is a national security imperative. Foreign actors exploit gaps in our financial systems to fund operations designed to disrupt U.S. elections. These efforts often overlap with broader financial crime schemes like money laundering and fraud, which cost the U.S. economy billions every year. In 2023 alone, Americans lost over $12.5 billion to financial crimes---- Chairman Steil. Apologies. The speaker in the room is what is low. We are going to turn it up. Mr. O'Neill. OK. I will speak louder. Chairman Steil. I apologize. A little bit louder---- Mr. O'Neill. OK. Chairman Steil . and I think some of us can---- Mr. O'Neill. OK. Thank you. Chairman Steil. Thank you. Mr. O'Neill. The world once looked to the U.S. as a leader in combating financial crime, but, today, other countries are advancing faster, implementing modernized frameworks and technologies, while the U.S. struggles with outdated systems and insufficient collaboration. Without action, we risk falling further behind. Foreign actors exploit weaknesses in U.S. systems to fund election interference and other malign activities by leveraging shell companies; emerging platforms and digital ecosystems, such as crowdfunding sites and unregulated fintech platforms with minimal AML or KYC requirements; money mule networks. These networks launder money through witting and unwitting individuals, complicating traceability. Our key challenges include: Outdated systems. Tools like section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act rely on slow batch processing, delaying law enforcement's ability to act. SARs often lack key metadata, such as IP addresses, that are critical to tracking cyber-enabled financial crimes. There are regulatory gaps such as: Platforms like crowdfunding sites and payment processors operate in a gray area with little or no oversight. Cryptocurrencies, while valuable for innovation, are being exploited to bypass traditional financial controls. There are limited incentives for financial institutions such as 314(b), which allows voluntary information-sharing. Participation is inconsistent because institutions lack tangible incentives to collaborate. To address these challenges, I recommend the following actions: One, modernize section 314(a) and 314(b). Fund FinCEN to implement real-time, automated query systems under 314(a) to enhance responsiveness. Expand 314(a) and 314(b) to include crowdfunding platforms, payment processors, and fintech companies, applying these updates across the Bank Secrecy Act. Incentivize financial institutions to engage in 314(b) information-sharing through tax breaks or grants. Close regulatory gaps. Extend AML and KYC requirements to include cryptocurrency exchanges, crowdfunding platforms, and payment processors. Mandate unique transaction identifiers to improve traceability across all payment systems. Enhance reporting standards. Require SARs to include metadata, such as IP addresses and geolocation data, for better traceability. Develop feedback mechanisms to show financial institutions how their reports contribute to investigations, encouraging more meaningful filings. Leverage advanced technology. Equip law enforcement with AI and blockchain analytics to identify patterns of illicit behavior. Support privacy-preserving technologies like fully homomorphic encryption to secure data-sharing without compromising privacy. Last and probably most important, encourage private-to- private collaboration. Expand safe-harbor protections similar to 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act to include social media platforms, ISPs, telecommunications providers, domain registrars, and other technology companies. This would allow entities to lawfully share information with each other about suspicious activity, potential threats, and malicious actors, fostering collaboration across industries while mitigating liability concerns. Such a framework would significantly enhance the identification and disruption of election interference and other illicit activities. Addressing election interference through financial crime is not just about closing gaps; it is about reestablishing U.S. leadership on the global stage. The tools we need already exist, but modernization incentives are necessary to fully realize their potential. By expanding information-sharing frameworks, closing regulatory gaps, and leveraging technology, we can protect our democracy and restore public trust in our financial systems. Thank you for your time and attention, and I look forward to answering your questions.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF MATTHEW K. O'NEILL  Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. O'Neill. Ms. Caitlin Sutherland, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Before we begin, the speaker in the room is the challenge for us. We are used to having it incredibly loud. The microphones are working, and those watching online are able to hear. STATEMENT OF CAITLIN SUTHERLAND Ms. Sutherland. Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and Members of the Committee, my name is Caitlin Sutherland. I am the founding executive director of Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to restoring trust in Government by holding politicians and political groups accountable. Since our inception, APT has devoted extensive resources to uncovering and publicizing outside money and influence in politics and policy, including tracing foreign dark money. I thank you for the invitation and opportunity to again join you to discuss the important topic of foreign interference in U.S. elections. The majority of Americans agree that foreign nationals should be prohibited from influencing our elections. In fact, that has been Federal law for 40 years. Unfortunately, Federal law is inadequate when defining what foreign nationals can and cannot do. Essentially, foreign nationals are only prohibited from contributing to a candidate, committee, or super-PAC or participating in a campaign's decision-making process. This means foreign nationals can largely still influence a whole host of other election-related vehicles with zero repercussions. It is currently legal for foreign nationals to pay for get- out-the-vote operations, voter registration, issue advocacy, voter education, ballot harvesting, door-knocking--like how the U.K.'s Labour Party actively recruited British nationals to knock on doors to support Kamala Harris--and State and local ballot issue campaigns. Congress should act to close all these foreign influence loopholes. The issue of foreign nationals influencing our elections is not a hypothetical one but a real and ongoing threat made easier when organizations like ActBlue have failed to put basic protections in place. As I have testified before, a significant source of foreign cash is flowing into our politics from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, who is not a U.S. citizen but whose goal is to, quote, ``reinterpret the American Constitution in the light of progressive politics,'' end quote. According to The New York Times, Mr. Wyss's, quote, ``political activism is channeled through a daisy chain of opaque organizations that mask the ultimate recipients of his money,'' end quote. Through a detailed accounting of publicly available records, APT has been able to trace that at least a quarter of a billion dollars of this foreign money has been funneled through the Arabella Advisors-managed Sixteen Thirty Fund. Sixteen Thirty Fund--the, quote, ``indisputable heavyweight of Democratic dark money,'' end quote, according to The Atlantic--receives this foreign money and then turns around and bankrolls political battles all across the country. How much? Well, in the absence of laws restricting foreign nationals from contributing to ballot issue campaigns, Sixteen Thirty Fund has poured $130 million into ballot issue campaigns in 25 States. Ballot issues, while an important democratic tool, are also used to drive voter turnout to influence candidate races and often push the most extreme version of policies that would not withstand the legislative process. During the 2024 election cycle, Sixteen Thirty Fund spent over $37 million in foreign-backed cash targeting ballot issues in Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, and Ohio. Sixteen Thirty Fund also heavily invests in super-PACs, with their total giving approaching $90 million over the last four cycles. During this year's elections, their millions went toward financing competitive U.S. House races in Nebraska, Iowa, Montana, and Wisconsin; supporting a so-called independent U.S. Senate candidate in Nebraska; as well as propping up a Libertarian Presidential candidate to act as a spoiler to Donald Trump. Mr. Wyss's foreign money has also been allocated to groups like Indivisible, known for disrupting congressional townhalls; to Eric Holder's National Redistricting Action Fund, which works to skew congressional maps to favor Democrats; to Climate Power, which ran television ads backing Biden's Build Back Better agenda and is now seeking to torpedo the nomination of Governor Doug Burgum for Interior Secretary; and even to fake news outlets, like States Newsroom, which operates under local- sounding papers in your State, like Wisconsin Examiner, Florida Phoenix, Oklahoma Voice, and Ohio Capital Journal. Any vehicle that broadly influences the electoral process, from door-knocking to ballot issues, should not be paid for by foreign dollars. These are simple, commonsense loopholes to close. I think we can all agree, foreign billionaires, the U.K.'s Labour Party, and CCP officials should stay out of our politics. I look forward to discussing ways to prevent foreign influence in our elections. Thank you.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAITLIN SUTHERLAND  Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Ms. Sutherland. Mr. Bowman, you are now recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF BRADLEY BOWMAN Mr. Bowman. Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and distinguished Members of this Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today regarding efforts by foreign adversaries to undermine American democracy and the confidence we have in our elections. I applaud the Committee's focus on this important issue, and I welcome the opportunity to hopefully provide some useful context. China, Russia, and Iran are waging an information war against the United States that includes a focus on the U.S. electoral process, yet many Americans do not realize we are under attack. This lack of awareness is ideal for Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran. After all, predators like nothing better than hunting slumbering prey. In June, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies published a major report entitled ``Cognitive Combat: China, Russia, and Iran's Information War Against Americans.'' Much of my testimony is based on research conducted for that report, as well as the analysis of FDD's Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, including the excellent work of Max Lesser, a senior analyst on emerging threats, who co-authored our written statement for today's hearing. I define ``information warfare'' as the messages and means to convey those messages that nation-states use to advance political, economic, and security objectives and to strengthen the Government's foundations of power, reinforce those of allies and partners, and undermine those of adversaries. By that definition, based on our research, Americans and our elections are already under attack by China, Russia, and Iran. Our authoritarian adversaries seek to divide Americans, pitting us against one another, so that we are as domestically dysfunctional as possible. Our adversaries hope we consume our finite time, energy, and resources fighting one another rather than working together to strengthen our country at home and defend our interests abroad. They also seek to degrade our democracy's reputation. They want our model of representative democracy to look less appealing compared to their authoritarianism and autocracy. Our adversaries also seek to deceive Americans into believing, falsely, that we have no important interests or values to defend in places such as Taiwan, Ukraine, and Israel. Authoritarian regimes hope to deprive our partners of American diplomatic, economic, and military support, thereby making those partners more vulnerable to aggression. Why do our adversaries focus so much on our elections? Carl von Clausewitz, the 19th-century Prussian military theorist, promulgated the concept of a center of gravity. He defined it as, quote, ``the hub of all power and movement, on which everything depends.'' Clausewitz's center of gravity is sometimes characterized by analysts as the source of power and strength, the point against which all effort should be directed or protected. The American center of gravity is our Constitution and the rule of law, as well as free, fair, and trusted elections and the peaceful transfer of power. That is the foundation for who we are as Americans, and it is a major reason why we enjoy such extraordinary freedom and stability. Our adversaries understand that, and that is why they target our elections. During this election cycle, Russia sought to undermine Vice President Harris's campaign and Iran attacked President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. China, for its part, attacked both candidates, in addition to some congressional candidates who are critical of China. In short, both parties were attacked, and all three adversaries sought to undermine the faith of Americans in our electoral process. It is difficult to define with precision the effects of these adversary efforts, but initial research by my colleague Max Lesser suggests that America proved remarkably resilient. In many instances, efforts of Federal and State governments, the private sector, and the research community appear to have thwarted Russian, Iranian, and Chinese efforts to shape voters' preferences and undermine Americans' faith in the fairness and integrity of the democratic process. A Reuters-Ipsos poll released several days after the election found that the majority of Americans believe the election was legitimate and accurate. That is the good news. We should not become complacent. We should expect China, Russia, and Iran to continue to attack our electoral process with increasing ferocity and AI-empowered effectiveness. What is to be done? In addition to strengthening our electoral defenses at home, the United States should go on the information-warfare offensive against China, Russia, and Iran to begin to shift their cost-benefit analysis as they contemplate future attacks on our democracy. Such a campaign could systematically expose each regime's corruption, lies, and oppression and help the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian people advocate for their own rights, including more representative governance. Such a campaign would seek to ensure their respective populations know the truth regarding each regime's foreign and domestic policies. If Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran do not like having to fend off offensive information-warfare operations in their respective countries, perhaps they should stop attacking us. There are more details in our written statement. Thank you for the opportunity to testify here today.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRADLEY BOWMAN  Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Bowman. Mr. Johnson, you are now recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF DERF JOHNSON Mr. Johnson. Chairman Steil, Ranking Member Morelle, and Members of the Committee on House Administration, my name is Derf Johnson, deputy director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. Thank you for the opportunity to offer my experience with foreign interference in U.S. elections today. I share your goal in assuring that Americans hold confidence in our electoral system. My comments will focus on the interference of an Australian corporation in a Montana ballot initiative. As a native Montanan, I hold a common sentiment of caring for and valuing the land we call home. Montana is the site of America's first national park and a robust flora and fauna that existed at the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. It is the setting of ``A River Runs Through It,'' which aptly summarize many Montanans' sympathies of no clear line between religion and fly fishing. Since territorial days, Montana has suffered from exploitation and corruption, owing in large part to a mineral wealth and high interest in corporate profiteering. This turn- of-the-century stranglehold is often referred to in Montana as the ``Copper Caller,'' referencing the enormous control of Butte's copper barons and their exertion of political power over our media, our business, and our politics. Even today, Montana is vulnerable to unwarranted corporate and political influence. Our small population, our cheap media market, and interest from corporations in our natural resources can often lead to our local interests being trammeled. Over the centuries, Montana has also had an unfortunate relationship with hard rock mining, from the Berkeley Pit, the U.S.'s largest Superfund site, to the more recent developments such as Montana Tunnels, a defunct mine just south of my home which is now insufficiently bonded at $20 million in bankruptcy and responsible for destroying a trout stream. Pockmarks of defunct mining projects across the State demonstrate these failures and continue to represent an ongoing liability for our residents and sovereign Tribal nations. Due to our history, many Montanans are rightfully skeptical of mining proposals. Mining must contend with certain safeguards in Montana, including an environmental rights provision written into our constitution. Montana also has a ballot initiative process that we have used in the past for regulating hard rock mining, including a potential ballot initiative to protect the Smith River. Montana's Smith River flows 59 miles through a towering limestone canyon in central Montana. For that entire stretch, it does not have any public access points. Due to the largely undeveloped landscape, an excellent trout fishery, and a multi- day float opportunity, people from all across the world, about 10,000 folks, apply every year in a lottery in the hopes of being able to float down the river in some of Montana's wildest country. In 2015, an Australian mining corporation proposed a mine at the headwaters of Montana's Smith River, adjacent to and directly underneath Sheep Creek--and that is the Smith River's most important tributary--and we have been fighting this mine ever since. It is against this backdrop that a group of Montana citizens and organizations worked to pass a citizen-initiated ballot initiative, I-186. It would have required safeguards to prevent unnecessary impacts from mining by stopping what we call ``perpetual pollution,'' acid mine drainage. Acid mine drainage is an unfortunate common occurrence in Montana, both historically and in the current day, and has served as a death sentence for several of our rivers and steams. Sandfire took a high level of interest in I-186 due to its implications for the proposed mine, as the company has repeatedly acknowledged that the mine is being proposed in what we call a massive sulfide zone, which is the precursor to acid mine drainage. Sandfire donated $285,000 of treasury money to campaign against I-186, even though it acknowledged that it did not have any sources of revenue in the United States and a cash-flow of zero. Supporters of I-186 filed an FEC complaint in October 2018, which was dismissed. Commenting on the dismissal, one of the Commissioners expressed her alarm at her ``colleagues' voting to allow such foreign interference in American political life.'' Following I-186, the Montana legislature tried to react, enacting a ban on foreign-national contributions to candidate elections, but that fell short of contributions to ballot campaigns due to intense lobbying from the mining industry. The universe of fundraising available for corporate participation in our ballot initiative process is much, much broader than it needs to be, and the interests that those funds serve is often far-flung from the concerns of everyday Montanans. These folks do not need to drink the water or breathe the air in Montana. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before the Committee. I am available for any questions you might have.  PREPARED STATEMENT OF DERF JOHNSON  Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson. I will begin our questions today. I will ask about 5 minutes of question, and then we will alternate between the parties. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for the purpose of asking our witnesses questions. Let me get this straight, because I think this is really important to the American people. Do all of you agree that there is foreign influence in U.S. elections? You agree, yes? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Mr. Johnson. Yes. Mr. Bowman. Yes. Mr. O'Neill. Yes. Chairman Steil. The record will reflect all four agree that there are. And, Mr. Bowman, you recognize that, in particular, there are certain countries that are uniquely interested in interfering in U.S. elections--in particular, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Is that accurate? Mr. Bowman. That is accurate, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Steil. Also China. Mr. Bowman. Yes. Yes. Chairman Steil. If we think about this, we should be looking at, what are the ways that foreign interference could take place in the United States? One is through breaking current U.S. law. The other is through legal loopholes that exist under current law. First, on the illegal side, this Committee was working to make sure there was only U.S. citizens voting in U.S. elections. Under current law, that is required, but we were putting forward the SAVE Act to make sure that we are ensuring that is the case. As we look to online giving, we have seen significant vulnerabilities in online giving platforms and, in particular, ActBlue. Mr. O'Neill, would you agree that we should be working to close online vulnerabilities in an online giving platform, such as requiring a CVV number, banning the use of prepaid foreign gift cards? Are those logical steps that should be taken? Mr. O'Neill. Yes. Chairman Steil. Then, I think what really is surprising to the American people--because when I talk to people about this, they do not recognize that we have massive legal loopholes. And, Ms. Sutherland, you laid that out very clearly, as to how this can take place. Mr. Johnson recognized how it is impacting him in the State of Montana. Let us dive into this loophole. To confirm here, under current U.S. law, a foreign national can transfer money into a 501(c) organization in the United States. That 501(c) organization can then transfer 40 percent of that money into another 501(c) that can operate as a super-PAC or directly engage in U.S. elections. Is that accurate? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Chairman Steil. You think that that loophole should be closed? Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely. Chairman Steil. I 100 percent agree. Then we also look at another loophole that exists which allows foreign nationals to transfer funds directly into ballot initiatives. I think this is missed by a lot of people, because what we saw in the last election is very important ballot initiatives in States like Ohio, we saw an important ballot initiative in States like Florida, and we saw foreign funds coming into those elections. Is that accurate? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Chairman Steil. How much went into the State of Ohio for the ballot initiative from foreign sources, in your estimates? Ms. Sutherland. We have been able to trace into Ohio millions coming from foreign-backed cash into Ohio. Ohio recognized the threat of that, and that is why they stepped up and they actually voted this year to ban foreign funding of other State ballot initiatives. Chairman Steil. To ban it going forward, but not to ban it historically. This money came into the State of Ohio, under your research. Is that accurate? Ms. Sutherland. Yes, that is accurate. Chairman Steil. Did this money come into the State of Florida? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Chairman Steil. Is there any reason that Congress should not ban foreign money from coming into ballot initiatives in States across the country? Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely no reason not to ban it. Chairman Steil. Does anyone have an argument that we should not ban foreign funds from coming into ballot initiatives? Any of our witnesses? The record will reflect all of them agree that we should work to ban this. We have legislation to ban this at the Federal level, and we continue to get caught up in the gobbledygook. When you look at the impact that these foreign funds are having directly in U.S. elections, I think most Americans would be shocked. Because we know, on the books, a foreign national is not allowed to directly contribute into a U.S. candidate. Is that accurate, Ms. Sutherland? Ms. Sutherland. That is correct. Chairman Steil. All they have to do is simply use the workaround and implement their funds and channel it through a loophole that allows those funds to come in and directly impact U.S. elections, correct? Ms. Sutherland. Correct. Chairman Steil. As we look at the impact that this has in our elections, how much money have you identified just one foreign individual spending in the past handful of years? Ms. Sutherland. Yes, so Hansjorg Wyss, who is a Swiss billionaire and not a U.S. citizen, has contributed around a quarter of a billion dollars into the Sixteen Thirty Fund. Then the Sixteen Thirty Fund turns around and spends it on a whole host of activities. Chairman Steil. I think when the American people realize that this vulnerability exists in our U.S. elections system-- and, as Mr. Bowman pointed out, not only may there be rich billionaires across the globe but there could be state actors that could engage in this. We could completely envision this same technique being utilized by a Chinese national, a North Korean national, a Russian national who has a direct interest in U.S. policy. We go back and we look at the array of groups that were interested in killing the Keystone XL Pipeline, and we have seen Russian action as it relates to energy production across the globe. Is that accurate, Ms. Sutherland? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Chairman Steil. Now--we could look at a whole host of reasons. I think it is imperative of this Committee as we move forward to not only continue to work on the enforcement of our current law--which is including making sure that there are proper security procedures in place in ActBlue, that online giving platforms are blocking foreign funds from coming in. I think one of the real missed pieces of this is the proven millions of dollars that are coming in from foreign nationals directly impacting U.S. campaigns. We have an opportunity to close it. We have legislation to close it, and I think it is imperative that we actually pass this and it becomes law, as the State of Ohio did. I will now yield back. I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for 5 minutes. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I do note, again, that it was the Republican members of the FEC who created the ballot-initiative loophole. They are now recommending we fix it. I agree. I think it was wrong when they made that decision in 2015, and I think it remains wrong today. Indeed, you will get our support as we work through this in the months ahead. I do want to--as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we all agree, again, foreign interests should have no say over the administration or outcome of American elections, that American elections--the decisions we make about our Government, how we organize our society, are the sole province of American citizens. The newfound attention that we are paying to foreign funding of ballot initiatives is late to the game, as I mentioned. What I just want to do is ask you, Mr. Johnson--because this does have a real-life impact, as you can see from photos taken from Montana. You know this far better than I do. If I could ask you--you know, obviously, I have enormous admiration and respect for not only your State but the land, which so many people hike, camp, hunt, fish, work. Can you tell us a little bit more about the risks that foreign corporations like Sandfire pose to the health of the people and the land of Montana? Mr. Johnson. Representative, as I mentioned both in my written and my oral testimony, Montana is not just a place where Montanans themselves can sort of enjoy the land and the place but we have 12 million visitors a year from all across the world. The land is basically an essential piece of our economy as well. Millions of dollars in GDP are generated every year in Montana from visitors. And, as I mentioned, we have had a lot of issues with hard rock mining. This ``perpetual pollution'' issue is not going away. The Federal Government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try and figure out how to address acid mine drainage, without being able to figure out how to accomplish that. It is still an issue in Montana and has caused a lot of pollution. That is why Montanans took it upon ourselves to try and address this issue. The photo that you see there is the Zortman-Landusky mine. That particular mine is a poster child for bad mining practices, something that we would have hoped to help address and to never permit again in Montana, this acid mine drainage problem, where we have spent approximately $80 million in taxpayer funds and $2 million every year, annually, in treating that water, which is flowing directly into the Fort Belknap Indian Community, impacting their teepee grounds and fouling what would otherwise be a good source of water quality for drinking water. Mr. Morelle. I-186 would have had a profound impact on this? Mr. Johnson. That is correct. For the way that it was written, it would have prevented any new mining permits from being permitted if there was evidence that there would be acid mine drainage, or require an associated management of that acid mine drainage. Because once acid mine drainage starts, it does not stop. There are, you know, mines from the Roman Empire that are still spilling out acid mine drainage at this point. You have to basically lock it up, button it up, and treat it forever. These are ongoing liabilities for thousands of years. I-186 would have prevented those from occurring again in Montana. Mr. Morelle. I think you said in your testimony, and I just want to make sure I understood, that the company, Sandfire, which was contributing nearly $300,000 to stop the ballot initiative, they did not have any interests in Montana at the time but were looking to get permits in the State? Is that--to continue this practice? Mr. Johnson. That is correct. They did not have any interest in North America, and my understanding is that they still do not. Mr. Morelle. Gotcha. Thank you for that testimony. Just one quick question. Mr. Bowman, I appreciate your testimony very much. I was surprised, I guess--I expected to see North Korea in the list. Do they not participate in these activities as well? Or it just was not the focus of the report? Mr. Bowman. Thank you, Ranking Member, for the question. North Korea does engage in some of these activities, but the research of my colleagues at FDD that focus on this really highlight that Russia, China, Iran are the ones that engage in it the most and are the most effective. Mr. Morelle. Then, it is not an exclusive list; it is just the ones you identified---- Mr. Bowman. Not at all. We just focused on the three foreign adversaries we found most problematic. Mr. Morelle. Yes, no, I very much appreciate that. Thank you. Before I yield back, I would like to ask unanimous consent for the following items to be added to the record: a Business Insider article titled ``This Montana Man Spends His Day Shooting at Birds that Land on a Toxic Lake to Save Them from Burning Inside Out''; the Montana Supreme Court decision Western Tradition Partnership, Inc., versus the Attorney General of Montana, which includes an extensive discussion of Montana's history with well-financed corruption in the mining industry; a March 18, 2015, vote certification in MUR 6678, in which three Republican FEC Commissioners created the foreign- money ballot-initiative loophole; the FEC enforcement complaint in MUR 7523 filed by Yes for Responsible Mining; and Commissioner Ellen Weintraub's statement of reasons lamenting the FEC's dismissal of the complaint in MUR 7523, without objection. Chairman Steil. Without objection, so ordered.   Mr. Morelle. I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Griffith is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Griffith. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you so much for calling this important hearing. A couple of comments in response to my friend and colleague, the Ranking Member, in his opening. If WinRed is doing something to make it easier for foreign actors to donate by having massive numbers of small donations sent in, more than happy to look into that; as well as ActBlue. Have no problem with that. Further, I would point out that, while you mentioned Elon Musk, who is a U.S. citizen, you did not mention George Soros, who also is a U.S. citizen, but both of those have given money, and each side gets one. Sometimes you all get more than we do. You know, when it is U.S. money, that is not the focus of this hearing. Ms. Sutherland, I was interested in your comments about the U.K. Labour Party recruiting and trying to send folks--or sending folks over here to work in the Harris campaign. Because it is interesting; in today's online version of The London Times, there is an article about how they are worried that we are going to return the favor and send money over to the Reform Party, and so now they are looking at tightening up their laws related to foreign activities in the U.K. I do not have personal knowledge, but that is according to my reading of this morning's London Times online edition. Speaking of your work, Ms. Sutherland, I would like to ask unanimous consent for Ms. Sutherland's report, Americans for Public Trust, ``Foreign Influence in State Ballot Issues: How Sixteen Thirty Fund's Pipeline of Foreign Cash Impacts State Politics,'' April 2024, be entered into the record. Chairman Steil. Without objection.   Mr. Griffith. All right. That being said, Mr. O'Neill, the Virginia attorney general, Jason Miyares, is looking into ActBlue and whether online fundraising entities are following Federal law and preventing foreign actors and other prohibited donations from entering the U.S. elections process. Miyares is also looking into whether U.S. citizens' identities are being fraudulently used to make donations in their name without their approval to various candidates. This touches on something else that Mr. Morelle was talking about, if somebody really knows that their money is being given in their name. Miyares's team informed my office that, while the attorney general is receiving a number of tips about potential fraudulent donations, the only way they have to identify or to verify that people listed as donors are actually the donors whose name appears on the donation is to send a staffer to the home of the person in question and knock on the door to verify their identity. There has got to be a better system, a better way of verifying that the donations are legitimate. I ask you, in your experience with asset forfeiture, are there easier ways to verify identities than spending the man- hours to knock on the door of every name you are investigating? And, of course, asset forfeiture does not have quite as strict of rules as when you are trying to set up a potential criminal case and, thus, have to apply--you have to apply criminal evidence standards. You got an easier way we can do that? Mr. O'Neill. I wish I could say that there was a straightforward way to verify digital identities currently. What I will say is, the system for identifying individuals is really quite broken. Since at least 1999, every single one of ours, if we are old enough--name, DOB, Social, address, previous address, mother's maiden name, bank account information, email address, email password--has been available online for sale for probably less than 2 cents apiece. That makes it very easy for bad actors to steal other people's identities. Because when you look at what cyber criminals are doing, which is taking advantage of the elderly, the incarcerated, and children to take over identities, it makes it fertile ground in order to---- Mr. Griffith. Certainly, people would want to do that in elections too. I hate to cut you off---- Mr. O'Neill. Sure. Mr. Griffith . but I am trying to get another question in before my time runs out. Mr. Bowman, Spamouflage is one of China's, apparently, propaganda operations, and they have taken a special interest in Senator and current Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio. Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub reported that, on the morning of his most recent election, X exploded with around 20,000 messages, spanning 6,500 different accounts, with strange messages about Mr. Rubio. Further, they found anti- Rubio articles posted on places such as Medium and Reddit. All these posts were traced back to China and Spamouflage, their network of accounts. This is concerning and a clear example of foreign interference in our elections. How do we maintain free speech while also ensuring that foreign adversaries are not spreading propaganda on our public forums with the intent to either sway elections or, as you previously testified, to divide Americans? Mr. Bowman. Thank you, Congressman, for the question. As my colleagues highlighted in a research memo published this morning at FDD.org---- Mr. Griffith. I have not read that one yet. Mr. Bowman . Spamouflage--yes, yes. No, I know you are busy, but, yes, just flagging it for you, you and your staff--Spamouflage is a big deal. It involves a vast network of fake accounts on social media. They typically have pushed out low-quality content that, with a few exceptions, garnered little--I am happy to report-- little organic engagement on social media. A notable trend with Spamouflage this election cycle was that it leveraged antisemitic tropes to criticize both the American political system and specific candidates. To your broader question, eyeing the clock here, I think it is important to distinguish between foreign adversaries trying to influence our democracy and undermine our democracy in an opaque manner and what American citizens are doing in--I know you understand that, sir, but I just think it is a very important distinction that we should highlight. Mr. Griffith. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield back. I apologize. I find this to be a very interesting hearing. I appreciate the witnesses. I still have about 300 pages to go in the CR, and they are now saying they might vote this afternoon, so I have got to go back to read that. Chairman Steil. It is a busy day. Mr. Griffith. I yield back and apologize for leaving. Chairman Steil. Busy day. Appreciate your time here. The gentleman yields back. Mrs. Torres is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Chairman. I think that all of us in this room agree that more needs to be done to ensure that our elections are free of foreign interference. I am just sad that this is our last hearing of the year, talking about such an important topic that has impacted--I am not sure about all the Members here, but it certainly has had a personal impact on me, including members of MS-13 being sent to my home while having a swim--or hosting a swim party for toddlers--toddlers--as a way to intimidate a Member of Congress. We should never tolerate that, no matter what side of the aisle that you sit on. Mr. O'Neill, in your testimony, you said that, as technology advances, there must be spaces for sharing security information with our foreign counterparts. I absolutely agree with you. The U.S. is facing an information war. We cannot continue to allow countries--and we mentioned in China, very loosely Russia, very loosely Iran. We forget about countries in Latin America. We must not forget that Latin America is also very involved in our elections. Congress must ensure the safety of our country by securing the global information environment to uphold the integrity of information. That is why I introduced the International Artificial Intelligence Research Partnership Act. This bill would build partnerships between cities in the U.S. and our allies across the world to ensure that the next generation of AI tools enhance security and protect freedom. I am greatly concerned that the incoming administration does not prioritize efforts to protect our core freedoms and may work to weaken the Federal agencies combating foreign influence. On page 155 of ``Project 2025,'' Republicans want to exterminate the very organizations protecting us from foreign interference, like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which assists election officials with election security threats. Mr. O'Neill, based on your experience with the U.S. Secret Service, do you believe that foreign governments are targeting our elections and our democracy through information integrity warfare? What could be the impact if Republicans continue on this process of defunding or completely eradicating Government entities that help us combat malign influence? Mr. O'Neill. When I was with the U.S. Secret Service, we investigated several cases. One, in particular, was a Russian individual that was leveraging fake identities to create infrastructure in the United States, specifically servers, in order to launch misinformation campaigns through social media platforms. We leveraged the wire fraud statutes, bank fraud statutes, identity theft statutes in order to charge him. That was--he was part of Project Latva, or something like that, from 2018 to 2020. We saw many other cases that were similar to that. One of the challenges that I fear is that the United States is still, as a country and as small, midsize businesses and large businesses, unprepared to handle cyber attacks. Mrs. Torres. In 2002, Congress strengthened a ban on foreign interference, specifically to prevent foreign actors from influencing the outcomes of our elections. I am troubled by the lack of meaningful enforcement of this provision by Federal law by the FEC. This past year, the FEC acted on less than half of the cases involving potentially illegal foreign interference. This inaction appears to be driven by partisanship. Almost every matter the FEC has not pursued is associated with a former President. This is where we need to be Americans-first, not party--not relegate our duties to our parties. I want to include for the record here, Mr. Chairman--I request unanimous consent to submit the statement on behalf of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr. Chairman? Chairman Steil. Without objection.   Mrs. Torres. Thank you. And, last, my question to you is: Do you agree that the FEC should be investigating credible allegations of foreign interference in our elections? Ms. Sutherland? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Mrs. Torres. Thank you. Mr. Bowman? Mr. Bowman. Not my area of focus, but that makes sense, Congresswoman. Thank you. Mrs. Torres. Of course, this is a common sense that we all agree on. When the agency is tasked with protecting our campaign finance system--is broken--creating loopholes, and failing to investigate credible allegations, we not just fail ourselves, we fail our electorate. With that, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentlelady yields back. Mrs. Bice is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, and thank the witnesses for being here this morning. First, let me start out by saying, the Ranking Member mentioned issues with large donations coming from individuals that may or may not be able to afford that. The reality is that, oftentimes, these folks are setting up a reoccurring donation and do not realize it, because they may not be familiar with that, but they also have the option to ask for a refund, and oftentimes they do. If you look at many of our FEC reports, those individuals are getting their dollars back. I want to first start out by addressing Mr. Johnson's opening statement. You talked about this very serious issue that you have in Montana with mining, but the reality is that is a State issue, and the State legislature--me having been a former State senator--they should be addressing that. I do not think that that is something that necessarily Congress needs to engage itself in if it is a State prerogative. I also want to, you know, recognize that fair and transparent elections are crucial, and that is on every--in every avenue. I am glad to see that my friend from Ohio, Rep. Carey's legislation was signed into law, that congressional election observers will be protected by Federal statute, and I also want to thank the staff who volunteered their time this last election to be part of that process. I want to start with Ms. Sutherland. You talked a little bit in your opening statement about Hansjorg Wyss. Can you describe a little bit more about the 501(c)(4) organizations that he participates in? And, particularly, you caught my attention because you mentioned Oklahoma Voice and their engagement with that. I wonder if there are other ballot initiatives that they may be engaging in in the State of Oklahoma, but I would love to know a little bit more about the organizations. Ms. Sutherland. Absolutely. Hansjorg Wyss, as I said, is a reclusive Swiss billionaire, so reclusive he is probably very bothered that we are having this hearing and exposing his pattern of giving because it is difficult and complicated to track. Most of his foreign money comes through a group called the Berger Action Fund, which the Associated Press described as a nondescript name for a group with a rather specific purpose: Steering the wealth of a foreign billionaire into the world of politics and policy. And, yes, we have seen his foreign money, you know, pop up in many things, including giving to States Newsroom through the Wyss Foundation which operates the Oklahoma Voice in your State. Also, his foreign money has been traced to all these ballot initiatives. Through the Sixteen Thirty Fund, we have seen over a $130 million in 25 States over the last several election cycles. Mrs. Bice. Can you talk about what specifically some of those ballot initiatives are? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Just this year, in 2024, we were able to trace 37 million in foreign-backed funds coming into eight competitive ballot issues, focusing on issues like abortion, minimum wage, and election policy, like what happened in Ohio. Mrs. Bice. Perfect. Mr. Bowman, if I can pivot to you. What are the most concerning tactics that our foreign adversaries are using to influence U.S. elections? Mr. Bowman. Thank you, Congresswoman, for the question. Russia's most significant operations in this election cycle involved a series of hoax videos published in the weeks before the election, several of which went viral. Fortunately, I would say, the U.S. Government promptly responded in many cases, as some of my colleagues noted. In one instance, a fake video depicting someone burning ballots in Pennsylvania was debunked by local election officials on the same day the video was posted, and the Federal Government released an official statement 2 days later attributing to Russia. Iran's most significant activity involved, as was mentioned, the hack-and-leak operation targeting the Trump campaign. While Iran successfully compromised sensitive materials from the Trump campaign, mainstream media outlets did not publish this information. Iran also targeted swing States and minority groups through a series of fake websites, but those do not appear to have gained significant traction, for the most part. Finally, China, as we mentioned already earlier, focused on its flagship influence operations with Spamouflage. If I may, the main point here, I think, is that we are all under attack, right? We should remember that, right? If I may, they want us to make this a partisan fight because then we will be divided and distracted and weak. We are all under attack. It is like when your family's attacked, right? All that matters is your family's attacked. The family comes together. You work together to solve it. This is absolutely, in my view, a national security issue, and we make it a--it would be a mistake to make it a partisan one. Mrs. Bice. Perfect segue into a quick last question, and that is to Mr. O'Neill. What do you think legislatively we could be doing to actually make sure that our elections are more secure moving forward? Mr. O'Neill. I think, primarily, it is bringing more of the tech--the new fintech and payment systems into the AML regime in order to have more KYC so we can understand how money flows and so, therefore, we can take enforcement action. Mrs. Bice. Great. Thank you. With that, I yield. Chairman Steil. Congresswoman Bice yields back. Congressman Carey from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Carey. I want to thank the Chairman and I want to thank the Ranking Member for this important--for this important hearing, and also thank all the witnesses for being here. Ms. Sutherland, I want to touch briefly on a couple things because we are going to talk mining, but if you could just talk to me a little bit about, on the same day that Governor DeWine called for a special election in Ohio earlier this year, and the Sixteen Thirty Fund, literally that day, wired $6 million to the proponents of Issue One. Can you just talk a little bit about that? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. As you said, on the same day that Governor DeWine called that special session to tackle two things--getting then-President Biden on the ballot in Ohio and, two, banning foreign money--Sixteen Thirty Fund, clearly sensing that this, you know, ban on foreign money was going to pass, sent $6 million into an Ohio ballot issue committee, seemingly front-loading the cash before it became illegal in Ohio. Mr. Carey. That is right. Is it true that after the Ohio Legislature passed a ban on the foreign national contributions to the ballot issues in Ohio, that there was an attorney--I believe Marc Elias--who sued Ohio to block the law so that foreign nationals could still contribute to the ballot issue? Ms. Sutherland. That is absolutely correct. Marc Elias, he has been very busy this election year denying the results in the Pennsylvania Senate race, as well as defending that foreign money should be allowed to come into Ohio. Just weeks after the Ohio Legislature passed that ban, he turned around and sued the State of Ohio, arguing that foreign nationals should be able to contribute to ballot issues. Fortunately, the Sixth Circuit recently upheld that decision and said that the law can go into effect. Mr. Carey. I want to thank you. All right. Mr. Johnson, we are going to go to you. Does your organization take any foreign money, whether directly or indirectly? Mr. Johnson. Representative, I do not believe so. I checked in with our business manager, and for the past---- Mr. Carey. You do not know whether you take it directly or indirectly? You do not know? Mr. Johnson. We do not receive any foreign money. Mr. Carey. Let me ask you this. Are you aware of the Surface Mining Control Act that was passed in 1977? Mr. Johnson. I am. Mr. Carey. Tell me the laws as it relates to bonding in the State of Montana. Mr. Johnson. The laws in Montana require bonding for coal mining, which is different from what I am here to talk about today, which is hardrock mining. Mr. Carey. You are saying the acid mine drainage from the tunnel--the tunnel in your testimony, the tunnel mine was not from coal mining? Mr. Johnson. No, that was not, and the--so we do not typically have, in my experience in Montana, acid mine drainage associated with coal mining as you might in the East Coast. This is more of a hardrock mining issue. Mr. Carey. I would really like to know whether you can actually--and if you could get back with our teams on this-- whether you indirectly or directly take foreign money at all. Because I do not know whether you are aware of this, but on December 3d, China announced that they were going to ban several very important hardrock minerals and critical materials that are necessary for manufacturing in this country, and there is nobody that wants to make sure that we do not explore our natural resources more than the country of China or any other foreign entity. If you could get back to my team, just to make sure that we do not have, you know, any issues with that, because we do have a very good bonding system in this country as it relates to mining. And, you know, my dear friend, Mr. Morelle, was showing those pictures. I would like to take you to some of these mines across the country that I have been in in many, many cases. They are bonded, they are clean, they are reclaimed. That is what we need to be doing. We need to be exploring our natural resources. I just wanted to point that out. I am going to go real quickly, though--because I have got very limited time. Mr. Bowman, we had a tough weekend in sports. You know, Navy beat us, right? Mr. Bowman. That is right. That is right. Mr. Carey. We are seeing foreign adversaries single- handedly trying to influence our election outcomes. To what extent are foreign adversaries coordinating with each other to influence these U.S. elections? Mr. Bowman. Thank you for the question. I will try to be quick. I think one of the most significant--as someone who focuses, frankly, on foreign defense policy, I think one of the most significant geostrategic developments we are confronting right now is the growing axis of aggressors, where we have China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea working together in ways we have not seen before. I do not think we have encountered anything quite like this in modern American history, and I think this has ramifications for our defense budget and our foreign policies here at home. What we have been describing about what China and Russia have been doing, they are going to be sharing those tactics, techniques, and procedures with Iran and North Korea, and they are all going to be more effective together in the future. I think we need to see that collaboration for what it is, and that is going to make these challenges more daunting in the future. Mr. Carey. I want to thank you again. I want to thank all the witnesses. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. Before we recognize Mr. D'Esposito, I would like to just recognize Mr. D'Esposito's hard work on this Committee. You are spectacular. You brought in a background from a time as a New York police officer and detective in a particular period of time when we had work to do with U.S. Capitol Police, with crime in D.C., and this hearing on foreign interference and election law. You have been a spectacular Member of this Committee, and your time here will not be unnoticed in the fu-- as we look at the history of this Committee. Just want to thank you for all your hard work on this Committee and your time in Congress. Now I will recognize Mr. D'Esposito for 5 minutes. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It has been an absolute honor to serve on this Committee with all of you, and I hope my time on this dais is not over. Before I continue, I would like to submit for the record a letter from People United For Privacy in support of H.R. 8399, which is the Donor Privacy Protections in Foreign Influence Act, which is a piece of legislation by Chairman Steil. Chairman Steil. Without objection.   Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you. Mr. Bowman, in your opening statement, I think that you said some things that are critically important. I think that very often we have these hearings and they are talked about on Capitol Hill and in our offices, but this is a hearing that I hope the American people are listening to at home, in their living rooms, around their kitchen table because it is that critically important. You mentioned in your opening statement the idea that this country is already under attack. You mentioned countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. I mean, these are our biggest adversaries. These are our greatest threat to our homeland. There is no question that we are under attack. There is no question that we are already at war. I think that a lot of the things that we talked about this morning are very important, but I think what I want to focus on is how this affects the people back home. Because very often people say, well, it is not happening in my backyard, it is not happening in my county. My vote is the one that counts. And, you know, we have heard--when President Trump has said that we are under attack, when President Trump has said that there is foreign influence in our elections, we have been told very often by the other side of the aisle that that is not really the case. Can you talk to us about specific evidence and tactics? I know that there was a hoax that was mentioned, but I am sure you have many more. I want us to deliver to our neighbors back home exactly how their vote is threatened by these adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran. Mr. Bowman. Thank you, Congressman, for the question. And, you know, this will start vague, but I will try to be more specific. I think we need to fully appreciate that our adversaries understand the battle for other beliefs and ideas, right, because they--China, Russia, and Iran in particular and also North Korea, they have a problem with us, I would say, because of our existence and our power. By ``existence,'' I mean our representative democracy presents a threat to autocrats who want to retain their self-serving grip on power, and it conveys to the Russian, Chinese, and Iranian people that there is a more appealing governance model. Just by being ourselves, our--small D--democratic selves, we threaten their autocratic grip on power. Our power, the fact that we have the most capable military in the history of the world, presents a problem for aggressors like China, Russia, and Iran who want to conquer our partners. If they can deceive Americans into saying that we have no principles and interest in standing with Taiwan, Ukraine, or Israel, they can sideline our American power. They want to decide who represents us in Washington. They want to decide what our policies. I say they should butt out and that Americans should decide, and the first step to having them butt out is realizing that they are trying to manipulate what Americans think and determine who represents us in Washington and what our policies be, and that is wrong, and we need to wake up to it. Mr. D'Esposito. Based on evidence and the investigations that you have done, is there one party that has been more influenced by foreign adversaries in our elections than the other? Mr. Bowman. You know, I am not prepared to answer that. I want to emphasize that both parties have been attacked. And, honestly, I do not think we are going to come up with durable solutions that will last, that will be effective if it is not a bipartisan approach. I really think we should not make this a partisan issue. Mr. D'Esposito. Mr. O'Neill, thank you for your service. You mentioned in your opening statement the need for collaboration amongst public and the private sector. And, obviously, as members of law enforcement, we know that that collaboration works within law enforcement entities as well. Does the FBI work alongside the FEC in investigating foreign entities or adversaries that influence United States elections? Mr. O'Neill. Honestly, I do not know because that was not an area of focus for the Secret Service. We were focused specifically on financial crimes. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. All right. With that, I only have about 30 seconds. Can you just briefly talk about how we see the illicit and illegal money moved through these online platforms? Mr. O'Neill. Money mules, as Mr. Bowman talked about, are the center of gravity that enable cybercrime and money laundering to flourish. Whether it is a witting or unwitting money mule, they are primarily how the bad actors are moving money throughout. Whether it is financial crimes or whether it is any sort of illicit malign activity, it starts with money mules, and also understanding the weaknesses in our current AML regime and focusing on platforms that do not meaningfully do any know-your-customer activities. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. Mr. Chairman, once again, it has been an absolute honor. I yield back. Chairman Steil. It is an honor to have you here. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Lee is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing and to our witnesses for appearing before us today. As chair of the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections, promoting American confidence in the integrity and security of our elections is a key priority, and identifying the ways in which foreign actors may be influencing and involved in our election system is of paramount importance to the American people. Thank you for being here. I also am so pleased to say that the House unanimously passed the SHIELD Act earlier this week, which I was proud to support, which includes commonsense measures to strengthen donor verification standards. I commend our Chairman, Congressman Steil, on his leadership on this critical legislation. I would like to go back, Ms. Sutherland, to you to begin. The testimony that you have given today about your organization and the report that tracks the Sixteen Thirty Fund is so important in helping understand the ways in which these loopholes exist and allow foreign governments to influence our elections, including voter turnout. As you know, in my home State of Florida, this past election cycle, we had two very contentious ballot initiatives that were considered. Did you see any instances of this type of foreign interference occurring in Florida's elections this cycle? Ms. Sutherland. Thank you for that question. Yes, we actually did see it on the issue related to codifying abortion rights in Florida's State Constitution. Again, we were able to trace that over $14 million in foreign- backed funds came into Florida to influence your State's constitution. The fact that a foreign national can give directly or indirectly to influence a ballot issue is a loophole that needs to be closed, and I commend everyone's efforts here to close it. Ms. Lee. Are there any particular steps that you would recommend that State legislatures or Congress take to close those loopholes? Ms. Sutherland. Yes. Implementing a ban like Ohio did--it can also be done on the Federal level--to reject the issue that foreign nationals can give to ballot issue campaigns. I would also like to point out that it was not the FEC that created the loophole. The FEC interprets law. Ballot issues are inherently not elections, so therefore the prohibition on foreign nationals influencing elections does not apply. It is not that Republican commissioners created this loophole. It is that they interpret the law. And, currently, there is no law on the Federal level and in most States that say foreign nationals cannot give to ballot issue campaigns. It is a simple commonsense measure to implement, and I really look forward to tackling this issue again next Congress. Ms. Lee. Thank you. Mr. O'Neill, I would like to go back to your testimony. Thank you for sharing with us some of the tactics that foreign actors may use to commit financial fraud and cybercrime. From your experience in Federal service, I am interested in what actions you think that agencies might take to identify and disrupt this type of illicit financial activity, in particular, how we might leverage new technologies, including artificial intelligence, to make forward progress. Mr. O'Neill. Law enforcement can leverage current SARs and CTRs that are submitted from financial institutions. It would be ideal if more payment processors and other fintech companies were also required to submit suspicious activity reports because those do help law enforcement. There are millions of SARs that are filed every single year, so leveraging artificial intelligence to mine for those specific suspicious activity reports or a heightened surveillance report--whatever is provided--would be of value. Also, the ability to leverage 314(a), which enables law enforcement to query financial institutions around the world, is very slow. Sometimes it takes up to 28 days and it involves manual batch processing. If there is a way to speed up that process because, as we know, money is moving at a much faster pace than it did when the 314(a) and 314(b) were created 20- some years ago. That is another area where new technology exists that did not several years ago, and we have not been able to keep up with the technology. Ms. Lee. And, Mr. Bowman, you just gave some testimony that related to efforts from China, Russia, Iran to disrupt and exploit vulnerabilities that we may have. I am particularly concerned about threats from cyber actors in this way. We know China very recently committed a very serious hack of some of our infrastructure and telecommunications providers. I am interested in your perspective on whether this is simply an intelligence gathering operation. Do you perceive a risk to our elections infrastructure? Then what do you recommend that we be looking at in order to enhance and strengthen our cyber elections infrastructure? Mr. Bowman. Thank you. Not only do I believe our adversaries are currently waging an information war against us--and we have presented some evidence here today--they are also waging an ongoing, daily, hour-by-hour cyber war against us. That has many, many facets to it. There is an election component to it. I explained why our elections are a center of gravity. Certainly, they are using cyber warfare to attack it as we sit here today, and they are also doing the same thing in the military domain and in the civilian infrastructure that supports the United States military's power projection capability. We are the most capable cyber country in the world and we are also one of the most vulnerable, and I think time is well spent trying to shore up our cyber defenses. Just like in this context, until we start to go more on the offensive and start to shift the cost-benefit calculation of our adversaries, these attacks will continue until we start to impose some consequences on them. Sooner or later, all defenses, no matter how strong, fail. That is why we need to go more on the offensive. Ms. Lee. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Steil. Representative Lee yields back. I will now recognize the Ranking Member for closing comments. Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, thank you to the witnesses for being here, particularly during the holiday season. I wish them all a Merry Christmas to everyone. Happy Hanukkah. Whatever your faith, tradition is, I hope everyone enjoys a wonderful holiday season and gets a chance to relax a little bit. I want to join in thanking my colleague, Mr. D'Esposito, for his service here, and certainly wish him only the very best as he moves on. Thank you for your contributions. I also want to--I am not sure they say--you know, there is always debate about whether a tree in the forest falls and no one is there to hear it, whether it makes a sound. With Mr. Kilmer not here--well, there he goes. Like I said, he will hear me say what an amazing Member Derek Kilmer has been not only for this Committee but for the Congress. I rarely have found as I have come across my travels someone who is so genuine, so committed to this whole enterprise of American democracy and particularly loves the Congress as much as Derek Kilmer does, an institution that he has worked very hard to modernize and to make as good as it can be, as good as the American people deserves. I am delighted to thank him for his extraordinary service. He is going to up me now, as he should, by hopefully getting a chance to say a few words on his own, but I am grateful that you are here. I am grateful that you have served this institution with dedication and fidelity, and I am grateful to call you a friend. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, as well as all the Members, for their great cooperation, and the staff who does an outstanding job--both sides of the aisle--and who continue to serve this--I think this institution and the country with distinction. Thanks for everything. To the staff, to all the Members, Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Happy New Year, everyone. God bless. I yield. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. I would echo the Chairman's remarks in particular as it relates to Mr. Kilmer who just joined us. Spectacular work as co-chair of the Modernization Committee, which then continued on as the Modernization Subcommittee of the Committee on House Administration. Your leadership, along with Mrs. Bice, went a long way. We got some real work done this year, and we appreciate your leadership. You will be missed, but your work will live on as a legacy here. I would be happy to recognize Mr. Kilmer for 5 minutes to comment or question the witnesses as you see fit. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. Thanks. I will give a rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I actually just want to acknowledge and thank you, Mr. Chair, for--the last recommendation of the Modernization Committee was a recognition that the work of improving this institution should not happen every 20 or 30 years but should happen as a matter of course going forward. The creation of the Modernization Subcommittee was in keeping with that. My hope is, regardless of which party holds the gavels, that that Subcommittee continues, because the work of institutional improvement needs to continue. When I was asked to lead that Committee, someone gave me a graduation speech that John Gardner had delivered at Cornell University in 1968. He had been Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. He talked about the importance of institutional stewardship. When he gave the speech, he talked about two perils that face institutions. He said institutions suffer from uncritical lovers who deny an institution the sort of life-giving eye toward improvement that is necessary for organizations to get better. Second, he said institutions suffer from uncritical--from unloving critics, people who treat institutions like the pinata at the party and have an eye toward demolition rather than toward improvement and construction. We see that in this institution quite a bit. I think the thing that--and what John Gardner suggested is if we really care about institutions, then we have to be loving critics of them. That we have to view our institutions through the lens of loving criticism. That has been the work undertaken by the Modernization Committee, and it has been the work undertaken by the Modernization Subcommittee, and it has been the work of a whole boatload of stakeholders who care about this institution and want to see it get better for the American people. My gratitude to Chairwoman Bice and to you, Mr. Chairman, and to Ranking Member Morelle, is that you are loving critics of the institution, and that matters. My hope and my plea to you is that the work of the Subcommittee is allowed to continue with that eye toward loving criticism and institutional improvement. It has been an honor to get to serve with you. Thank you, and I yield back. Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back. It has been an honor to serve with you as well. We appreciate your work. I think there is a need to continue to work to modernize this Committee well. Sometimes we have good, strong policy disagreements on important topics. I think we have also shown an ability to work together on really key policies, and today's hearing I think is a true example of that. We identified a number of areas and legislation that is essential for the country to make sure, in this case, that we are ensuring U.S. elections are for U.S. citizens and not allowing foreign interference in our elections. Appreciate your work, Mr. Kilmer, your work, Ranking Member Morelle. The work of this Committee will continue but in the new Congress. I thank all the Members. And, in particular, as it relates to this hearing, as we come back, I thank all of our witnesses for sharing their expertise today. There may be additional questions from some Members of this Committee, and we would ask you to respond to those questions in writing. Without objection, each Member may have 5 legislative days to insert additional material into the record or to revise and extend their remarks. If there is no further business, I thank the Members for their participation. Without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
