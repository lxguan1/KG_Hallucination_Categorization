The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Mark Green  presiding. Present: Representatives Green, McCaul, Higgins, Guest, Bishop, Gimenez, Pfluger, Garbarino, Greene, Gonzales, Ezell, D'Esposito, Lee, Luttrell, Strong, Brecheen, Crane, Thompson, Jackson Lee, Payne, Swalwell, Correa, Thanedar, Magaziner, Ivey, Goldman, Garcia, Ramirez, Menendez, Clarke, and Titus. Chairman Green. The Committee on Homeland Security will come to order. Without objection, the Chair may declare the committee in recess at any point. The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony on President Biden's and Secretary Mayorkas' open border policies and how these failed policies have had profound and devastating impacts throughout the country. This is the first hearing in this committee's impeachment proceedings regarding Secretary Mayorkas. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Good morning. Today is a solemn occasion as this committee begins official impeachment proceedings in the matter of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and his handling of America's borders since taking office in February 2021. I wish we weren't sitting here today. I wish these proceedings were not necessary. I wish our Southwest Border was secure. I wish that our Government was enforcing the laws passed by the Congress and doing its job to keep the American people safe. Unfortunately, Secretary Mayorkas has done none of these things. For almost a year, the House Committee on Homeland Security has conducted a comprehensive investigation into the causes, costs, and consequences of the unprecedented crisis at our Southwest Border. Our evidence makes it clear Secretary Mayorkas is the architect of the devastation that we have witnessed for nearly 3 years. The findings of our investigation, available to the public at Homeland.House.gov, coupled with the Secretary's refusal to change course on the reckless decisions facilitating this crisis, have left us with no reasonable alternative than to pursue the possibility of impeachment. The Secretary's actions have brought us here today, not ours. Since early 2021, we have watched in disbelief as historic numbers of inadmissible aliens have poured across our borders, both at official ports of entry and illegally crossing the thousands of miles of our borders. On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 8.1 million encounters at America's borders, including more than 6.7 million at our Southwest Border alone. For comparison, CBP recorded just over 3 million encounters Nation-wide from fiscal year 2017 to 2020. Jeh Johnson, President Obama's former DHS Secretary, previously said that 1,000 encounters a day ``overwhelms the system.'' On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, encounters have never averaged less than 3,000 per day, even going as high as 10- to 12,000 per day. Just a few days ago, internal CBP numbers leaked to the media showed another 302,000 encounters at the Southwest Border alone in December, by far an all-time record. That is nearly enough people to fill the Rose Bowl 3 times in just 1 month. In addition to these catastrophic numbers of the record 1.8 million known gotaways who have entered the country on Secretary Mayorkas' watch, individuals that Border Patrol agents know slip across our border but are not apprehended, in large part because the cartels overwhelm the agents with large groups of coyote-paid and -escorted migrants, the agents see them and they count them, but they cannot apprehend them. But the numbers are most certainly far worse. As agents are moved to crossing sites to process migrants and the border is completely unmanned, there are no agents present to count the known gotaways. The number of unknown gotaways is no doubt enormous. Thousands of agents have been pulled off the front lines to process and release into our country record numbers of illegal aliens who know they will be released into the country and given a free bus or plane ticket to the city of their choice. I ask you to watch this video.  Chairman Green. What Americans must understand today is that these historic numbers, the chaos you just saw on the screen, are the result of a much deeper problem. That problem is not instability in other countries. It is not poverty, it is not climate change. It is not supposedly broken immigration system. All of these excuses have long predated Secretary Mayorkas' tenure, and yet we have never experienced a crisis like this. As even the New York Times admits, and I quote, ``Push factors don't explain the entire surge, and maybe not even most of it. There have been no recent wars in Latin America, and the region's poverty rate has been flat,'' the New York Times. I will also note that 2 of the 16 cities in the world with the highest murder rates are right here in the United States. Now, this crisis has been intentional. Secretary Mayorkas was made aware of testimony given by President Biden's Attorney General, Merrick Garland, where the AG admitted the current policies are being exploited by the cartels. Yet Secretary Mayorkas turns around and implements additional policies to expand the catch-and-release measures empowering the cartels and killing Americans. After nearly 3 years of watching this unfold, what other conclusion is there but this is an intentional crisis? Secretary Mayorkas has brazenly refused to enforce the laws passed by Congress as enacted policies that knowingly make our country less safe. What we are seeing here is a willful violation of his oath of office taken by Secretary Mayorkas. Let me repeat that, a willful violation. Secretary Mayorkas has used mass parole to release more than 1.5 million inadmissible aliens into the country, despite the Immigration and Nationality Act stating that parole is to be used only as an, and I quote, ``case-by-case'' and ``temporary basis'' for a ``significant benefit or urgent humanitarian reason.'' The chief patrol agent of the Border Patrol's Laredo sector told us last June that, historically, parole, and I quote, ``was used only in extreme humanitarian instances. If a child was sick, had to go to the hospital, we'd parole the parent in or something like that. But that was very rare. It wasn't an everyday thing.'' This porter chief is right. The scale of Secretary Mayorkas' mass use and abuse of parole is unprecedented and has been declared inconsistent with the laws passed by Congress by multiple Federal judges, but remains a central component of the Secretary's agenda. The Immigration and Nationality Act also requires that illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border be detained pending their removal proceedings. Secretary Mayorkas has ignored this law. In fiscal year 2013, according to DHS's own numbers, the Obama administration detained 82 percent of illegal aliens from the moment they were encountered until their case was decided, and another 9 percent were held for at least some portion of time after that. That is a pretty good track record, and under a Democrat administration. In Secretary Mayorkas' first year on the job, that 82 percent number dropped to just 10 percent. Illegal aliens not detained at all jumped from 9 percent to 64 percent in fiscal year 2021. In a court opinion earlier this year, Federal Judge Kent Weatherell wrote, and I quote, ``The evidence establishes that in late January or early February 2021, DHS made a discrete change in detention policy from release only if there is a compelling reason to release unless there is a compelling reason not to.'' The deputy chief of the Border Patrol's Yuma sector told our committee in September, ``The belief that they are going to be released with no consequences is certainly something that many migrants tell our agents.'' On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, that's a pretty good bet. Under his leadership, individuals guilty of violent crimes and even some of the on the terrorist watch list have been released into this country. Just Monday, multiple sources confirmed Secretary Mayorkas admitted that released rates of illegal aliens are currently around 85 percent. All told, DHS numbers indicate that well over 3 million inadmissible aliens have been released into our country on Secretary Mayorkas' watch. Factor in the 1.8 million known gotaways, the unqualifiable, unknown gotaways, that is roughly the population of the State of South Carolina. Not only has Secretary Mayorkas refused to detain these individuals in accordance with the law, but he has also made it nearly impossible for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to remove them. His policies have largely restricted the ability of ICE to detain and remove the population of illegal aliens. ICE removals dropped from more than 267,000 in fiscal year 2019 to less than 60,000 in fiscal year 2021 and 70,000 in 2022. The fiscal year 2023 numbers were better, but were still more than 40,000 fewer than the lowest year of the last administration, which largely occurred in the midst of the COVID pandemic. Criminals as a percentage of all ICE arrests went from around 90 percent in fiscal year 2020 to just 43 percent in fiscal year 2023. The Secretary is not even living up to his own flawed standards that supposedly prioritize threats to public safety. The former sector chief in San Diego told us in May 2023 that he didn't think the consequences of being removed from the country was being utilized enough to deter illegal immigration. Even Texas Democrat Mr. Cuellar has said, and I quote, ``If you don't detain people, if you don't send people back, then the border becomes a speedbump.'' On top of all this, upon entering office, Secretary Mayorkas immediately began dismantling effective policies that had secured the Southwest Border despite being warned by experienced border security personnel of the consequences that would result. That, coupled with his consistent decision to double down on his own unlawful policies, indicates an intentionality to this crisis. I must note with great emphasis, these are not simple policy differences. This is a years-long pattern of refusing to enforce the laws passed by Congress. Our investigation also uncovered the fact that Secretary Mayorkas has violated the authority of his office. Secretary Mayorkas has directed the Department to create numerous new unlawful mass-parole programs that have allowed an unprecedented number of individuals to enter our country who otherwise would have no lawful basis to be here and to incentivize migrants to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly travel to our Southern Border. He has also effectively told ICE officers not to do their job in enforcing America's immigration laws. According to his own guidance to ICE, and I quote, ``The fact an individual is removable should not alone be the basis of an enforcement action against them.'' And, ``Our personnel should not rely on the fact of conviction'' for a flatly deportable crime, but must consider, ``mitigating factors that militate in favor of declining enforcement action.'' He has even overseen the reckless and irresponsible use of Federal law enforcement personnel to sweep under the rug the mess he has made at the Southwest Border. Border Patrol agents from the Northern Border have been deployed to the Southwest Border to assist in processing and releasing illegal aliens into the interior. Hundreds of law enforcement professionals from Homeland Security Investigations have been pulled from serious investigations like sex crimes, child exploitation, and other atrocities to perform administrative functions at the border. One whistleblower claimed that his team was told to shut down its investigations and were then sent to the border to make sandwiches. The Secretary has abused his authority and put Americans at risk. Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly lied to the American people and to the U.S. Congress. Our investigation uncovered more than 100 instances where Secretary Mayorkas misled the public. Notably, he claimed in an April 2022 hearing to have operational control of the Southwest Border as defined by Federal statute. This was false. He then told another lie by claiming in subsequent hearings that he does not use the statutory definition of operational control, despite doing so in that 2022 hearing. Watch for yourself.  Chairman Green. Secretary Mayorkas told this very committee in September 2021, and I quote, ``The border is no less secure than it was previously.'' CBP recorded more than 192,000 encounters at our border that month alone, compared to around 58,000 the prior September. It was clear the border was not secure, so why did he mislead Congress? Another video, please.  Chairman Green. He even stood at the White House podium in September 21 and falsely accused mounted Border Patrol agents in the Del Rio sector of whipping illegal aliens crossing the border. Earlier that same day, DHS emails showed that his staff had informed him that an eyewitness said no whipping occurred, yet he advanced the narrative at the highest levels anyway. One sector chief told us, and I quote, ``We never whipped anybody. It was never really cleared up, and that takes a toll on our agents.'' Please play the video.  Chairman Green. This is just a taste of Secretary Mayorkas' misconduct. However, I want to close by reminding everyone that we are here today not only because House Republicans are determined to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable, but because more than 200 House Democrats voted on November the 13th to refer Articles of Impeachment to our committee. We are now acting in a bipartisan way, I suppose, in taking up those very articles. I briefly want to make it clear to the American people: Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to follow the law is sufficient grounds for impeachment proceedings. The Constitutional history is overwhelmingly clear on this subject. The Founders designed impeachment not just to remove officials engaged in criminal behavior, but those guilty of such gross incompetence that their conduct had endangered their fellow Americans, betrayed the public trust, or represented a neglect of duty. According to one scholar, there is, and I quote, ``a settled understanding beyond dispute that impeachable offenses are not limited to prosecutable crimes. Rather, the Framers of the Constitution understood, and the House of Representatives has consistently concluded, that the impeachment power reaches all manner of gross misconduct in office that does serious harm to the U.S. political system, the U.S. Constitutional order, or the people of the country. The actions, policies, and statements of Secretary Mayorkas easily meet the standards.'' Over the next few hours, you might hear a lot about process and procedure. After a thorough year-long investigation, this committee is following the Constitution and procedure as directed by the House's vote this past November. Make no mistake, attacks on the integrity of the process are meant to distract you from the deadly consequences of our open border. Unprecedented cartel control of our Southwest Border, with record amounts of fentanyl flooding across between ports of entry and into our communities, killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. Over 300 individuals on the terrorist watch list apprehended illegally crossing the Southwest Border since fiscal year 2021, compared to just 14 from Fiscal Year 2017 to 2020. Families devastated by violent criminal aliens who have committed murder, rape, and assault, to say nothing of the vehicular crimes committed. CBP and ICE personnel losing faith in their mission, they and their families bearing the brunt of this onslaught at the border. The human costs of this crisis are very real. The dollar costs of this crisis have been astronomical as well. New York City alone projects that it will have to spend $12 billion dealing with the flow of illegal aliens into the city by 2025, and it is even cutting the police force to pay for it. One county in Texas had to cut salaries to afford burials and cremations of illegal aliens found dead in their jurisdiction. These costs will be felt for years to come. As I stated when we started this investigation almost a year ago, we will follow the facts. We have done just that, and the facts have led us here. I look forward to the testimonies of these distinguished attorneys general who have watched this crisis play out unabated in their States. For the sake of our homeland security and the well-being of the people of the United States, Secretary Mayorkas must be held accountable. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Thompson, for his opening statement.  Statement of Chairman Mark Green January 10, 2024 Today is a solemn occasion, as this committee begins official impeachment proceedings in the matter of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and his handling of America's borders since taking office in February 2021. I wish we were not sitting here today. I wish these proceedings were not necessary. I wish our Southwest Border was secure. I wish that our Government was enforcing the laws passed by Congress and doing its job to keep the American people safe. Unfortunately, Secretary Mayorkas has done none of those things. For almost a year, the House Committee on Homeland Security has conducted a comprehensive investigation into the causes, costs, and consequences of the unprecedented crisis at our Southwest Border. Our evidence makes clear: Secretary Mayorkas is the architect of the devastation we have witnessed for nearly 3 years. The findings of our investigation--available to the public at homeland.house.gov--coupled with the Secretary's refusal to change course on the reckless decisions facilitating this crisis, have left us with no reasonable alternative than to pursue the possibility of impeachment. The Secretary's actions have brought us here today, not ours. Since early 2021, we have watched in disbelief as historic numbers of inadmissible aliens have poured across our borders, both at official ports of entry and illegally across the thousands of miles of our borders. On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has recorded more than 8.1 million encounters at America's borders, including more than 6.7 million at the Southwest Border alone. For comparison, CBP recorded just over 3 million encounters Nation-wide from fiscal year 2017-2020 combined. Jeh Johnson, President Obama's former DHS Secretary, previously said that 1,000 encounters a day ``overwhelms the system''--on Secretary Mayorkas' watch, encounters have never averaged fewer than 3,000 per day, even going as high as 10- 12,000 per day. Just a few days ago, internal CBP numbers leaked to the media showed another 302,000 encounters at the Southwest Border alone in December--by far an all-time record. That's nearly enough people to fill 3 Rose Bowls--in just 1 month. In addition to these catastrophic numbers are the record 1.8 million known gotaways who have entered the country on Secretary Mayorkas' watch--individuals that Border Patrol agents know slip across our border, but are not apprehended in large part because cartels overwhelm the agents with large groups of coyote-paid and -escorted migrants. The agents see them, and count them, but cannot apprehend them. But the numbers are most certainly far worse. As agents are moved to crossing sites to process migrants, and the border is unmanned, there are no agents present to count the known gotaways. The number of unknown gotaways is no doubt enormous. Thousands of agents have been pulled off the front lines to process and release into our country record numbers of illegal aliens who know they will be released into the country and given a free bus or plane ticket to their city of choice. What Americans must understand today is that these historic numbers--the chaos you just saw on the screen--are the result of a much deeper problem, and that problem is not instability in other countries. It is not poverty. It is not climate change. It is not a supposedly ``broken immigration system.'' All of these excuses have long predated Secretary Mayorkas' tenure, and yet, we have never experienced a crisis like this. As even the New York Times admits, and I quote, ``push factors don't explain the entire surge--and maybe not even most of it. There have been no recent wars in Latin America, and the region's poverty rate has been flat.'' I'll also note that 2 of the 16 cities in the world with the highest murder rates are right here in the United States. No, this crisis has been intentional. Secretary Mayorkas was made aware of testimony given by President Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland where the AG admitted the current policies are being exploited by the cartels. Yet Secretary Mayorkas turns around and implements additional policies to expand the catch-and-release measures empowering the cartels and killing Americans. After nearly 3 years of watching this unfold, what other conclusion is there but that this is an intentional crisis? Secretary Mayorkas has brazenly refused to enforce the laws passed by Congress and has enacted policies that knowingly make our country less safe. What we're seeing here is a willful violation of the oath of office taken by Secretary Mayorkas. Let me repeat that, ``a willful violation.'' Secretary Mayorkas has used mass parole to release more than 1.5 million inadmissible aliens into this country, despite the Immigration and Nationality Act stating that parole is to be used only on a ``case- by-case'' and ``temporary'' basis, for a ``significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reason.''

The scale of Secretary Mayorkas' mass use--and abuse--of parole is unprecedented and has been declared inconsistent with the laws passed by Congress by multiple Federal judges, but remains a central component of this Secretary's agenda. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) also requires that illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border be detained pending their removal proceedings. Secretary Mayorkas has ignored this law. In fiscal year 2013, according to DHS's own numbers, the Obama administration detained 82 percent of illegal aliens from the moment they were encountered until their case was decided, and another 9 percent were held for at least some portion of that time. That's a pretty good track record--and under a Democrat administration. In Secretary Mayorkas' first year on the job, that 82 percent number dropped to just 10 PERCENT. Illegal aliens not detained at all jumped from 9 percent in fiscal year 2013 to 64 PERCENT in fiscal year 2021. In a court opinion earlier this year, Federal judge Kent Wetherell wrote,``The evidence establishes that in late January or early February 2021, DHS made a discrete change in detention policy from release only if there is a compelling reason to, to release unless there is a compelling reason not to.''

Just Monday, multiple sources confirmed Secretary Mayorkas admitted that release rates of illegal aliens are currently around 85 percent. All told, DHS numbers indicate that well over 3 million inadmissible aliens have been released into our country on Secretary Mayorkas' watch. Factor in the 1.8 million known gotaways, and that's roughly the population of the State of South Carolina. Not only has Secretary Mayorkas refused to detain these individuals, but he has also made it nearly impossible for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to remove them. His policies have largely restricted the ability of ICE to detain and remove the population of illegal aliens. ICE removals dropped from more than 267,000 in fiscal year 2019 to less than 60,000 in fiscal year 2021, and 70,000 in fiscal year 2022. Fiscal year 2023 numbers were better but were still more than 40,000 fewer than the lowest year of the Trump administration--which largely occurred in the midst of the COVID pandemic! Criminals, as a percentage of all ICE arrests, went from around 90 percent in fiscal year 2020 to just 43 percent in fiscal year 2023. The Secretary is not even living up to his own flawed standards that supposedly prioritize ``threats to public safety.'' The former sector chief in San Diego told us in May 2023 that he didn't think the consequence of being removed from the country was being utilized enough to deter illegal immigration.

He has also effectively told ICE officers not to do their job in enforcing America's immigration laws. According to his own guidance to ICE, ``the fact an individual is a removable  . . . should not alone be the basis of an enforcement action against them.'' And, ``ur personnel should not rely on the fact of conviction,'' for a flatly deportable crime, but must consider ``mitigating factors that militate in favor of declining enforcement action.''

For the sake of our homeland security, and the well-being of our people, Secretary Mayorkas must be held accountable. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, in April, before this committee even began its so-called impeachment inquiry, Chairman Green promised donors at a campaign event that he would bring an impeachment case against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. According to a recording of his comments obtained by the media, the Chairman went on to tell those deep pocket contributors to, ``Get the popcorn'' and ``it's going to be fun.'' The Chairman may have thought that only those in the campaign event would hear his remarks, but the truth has a way of coming out. His promise to a room full of donors tell the American people all they need to know about why Republicans are hell-bent on impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. The promise of impeachment was made at a campaign event, and shortly afterwards, Republicans began their so-called investigation into Secretary Mayorkas. It is now campaign season, and Republicans recently rolled out their impeachment proceedings against the Secretary like a preplanned, predetermined political stunt it is. This is not a legitimate impeachment. Republicans want to throw political red meat to their base and keep that campaign cash coming. They know their already razor-thin majority is slipping away and think impeaching Secretary Mayorkas, even though there is absolutely no basis for it, will keep them in control of the House. Republicans certainly aren't going to win votes based on their abysmal legislative record. This has been the most unproductive, dysfunctional Congress in memory. They kicked their own Speaker out and then couldn't agree on a new one. They paralyzed the House for weeks while they fought among themselves. They have struggled to keep the Government funding, and are continually on the verge of shutting it down. A Member of their party was expelled for lying about practically everything in his life. Extreme MAGA Republicans have created this impeachment circus sideshow, in part to try to distract from their own failures. They took their sideshow on the road recently, traveling to the border to stand behind a podium, making canned speeches and posing for photo ops. But for all their border security bluster, Republicans opposed funding necessary to secure the border. They tried to cut money from Customs and Border Protection personnel and have refused to take up the President's supplemental funding request. Chairman Green himself recently penned an op-ed saying, and I quote, ``Not another dime to DHS,'' until the Republican border bill is signed into law, even though he knows full well that disastrous bill has absolutely zero chance of being enacted. It should be unthinkable that a Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security would threaten to defund DHS, but that is exactly what happened. This is funding our front-line border and immigration agencies need to better secure the border. Republicans have tried to excuse their opposition to border funding by claiming that Border Patrol doesn't want more funding, but that is blatantly false. In interviews with the committee, Border Patrol chiefs unequivocally supported more resources. Republicans know that; they were in the room and they have the transcripts. But let me refresh their memory. Jason Owens, currently the chief of the Border Patrol, said, ``We always need more agents.'' Chief Modlin in Tucson, an agency, ``We need a lot more, a lot more people.'' From Chief Heitke in San Diego, `We always need resources and technology.'' From Chief Bovino in El Centro, ``The additional resources is the correct technology assist with control of the border.'' Finally from Chief Chavez in El Paso, ``Providing support for critical positions and resources by Congress really does impact positively the deployment of agents to the front line.'' Every one of these chiefs told the committee that having more resources would help them better secure the border. Republicans go to the border in dress pants and polo shirts to pose for pictures, but then leave the hardworking agents in uniform and work boots behind without the resources they asked for. Democrats want to give border agents what they need to secure the border and Republicans do not. The truth is, securing the border isn't really the Republicans' top concern. If it was, they would provide the people with boots on the ground at the border what they need to get the job done. Republicans would rather exploit a challenging policy issue for their own perceived political gain. Republicans disagree with the Biden administration's border and immigration policies. They are angry that this administration won't take babies from their moms or put kids in cages like the last administration. You cannot impeach a Cabinet Secretary because you don't like the President's policies. Let me say that again. You cannot impeach a Cabinet Secretary because you don't like a President's policies. That is not what impeachment is for. That is not what the Constitution says. Republicans are willing to do grave damage to the Constitution they claim to hold dear because they think it will benefit them politically. In doing so, they are targeting Secretary Mayorkas, a public servant who spent his distinguished 30-year career serving our country as a Federal prosecutor and in leadership positions across the Department of Homeland Security. The facts show Secretary Mayorkas is doing his job across the Department's many critical homeland security missions, including border security and immigration enforcement. Despite what Republicans would have Americans believe, Secretary Mayorkas is enforcing immigration law. According to a recent analysis by the Cato Institute, someone who crosses the border under the current administration is more likely to be removed from the United States than someone who crossed under former President Trump. Republicans don't care about that. This impeachment sham clearly isn't about facts. It is not about the law. It is about pure and simple politics. Just look at those whose impeachment resolutions have been referred to this committee. Consider what kind of backroom deals Republican leadership must have made with the most extreme MAGA members. Or as one Republican Member recently put it, and I quote, ``We are simply accommodating our least sensible conference Members.'' I certainly agree. Democrats are doing everything they can to hold the line against Republican chaos. Democrats want to strengthen border security. We want to keep fentanyl off the streets. We want to keep communities safe. This circus sideshow impeachment does none of that. Mr. Chairman, let's drop this baseless impeachment and start doing the real work of securing the homeland for the American people.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson January 10, 2024 In April, before this committee even began its so-called ``impeachment inquiry,'' Chairman Green promised donors at a campaign event that he would bring an impeachment case against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. According to a recording of his comments obtained by the media, the Chairman went on to tell these deep-pocketed contributors to ``get the popcorn'' and ``it's going to be fun.'' The Chairman may have thought that only those at the campaign event would hear his remarks, but the truth has a way of coming out. His promise to a room full of donors tells the American people all they need to know about why Republicans are hell-bent on impeaching Secretary Mayorkas.

Democrats are doing everything we can to hold the line against Republican chaos. Democrats want to strengthen border security. We want to keep fentanyl off our streets. We want to keep communities safe. This circus sideshow impeachment does none of that. Mr. Chairman, let's drop this baseless impeachment and start doing the real work of securing the homeland for the American people. Mr. Thompson. Before I yield back, however, Mr. Chairman, I have some parliamentary inquiries. Chairman Green. You are recognized. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman, isn't it true that there is no language in either rule X or rule XI that grants the Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over the impeachment of any Federal officer? Chairman Green. That is not a valid parliamentary inquiry. You need to state the rule and how it relates to this proceeding. Mr. Thompson. That is why it is an inquiry because I am referencing either rule X or rule XI that grants the Committee of Homeland Security jurisdiction over impeachment of any officer. Chairman Green. There was a vote on the House floor, actually, the motion made by the Democrats to move impeachment articles to this committee. That trumps the rules, and it passed the House floor and we are proceeding in accordance with the demands of the U.S. House of Representatives by vote of the Members. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentlemen is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Is the Chair aware that of the five resolutions impeaching Secretary Mayorkas introduced in the House so far this Congress, just one, House Resolution 863, has been referred to the Committee of Homeland Security and that four others have been referred by the Speaker to the Committee on Judiciary? Chairman Green. Again, I need to know the rule that you think this is in violation of, so it is not a correct parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Thompson. I didn't understand your ruling. Chairman Green. Not a valid parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. The gentlemen is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Would the Chair inform the committee of which rule or precedent supports the idea that the motion to refer overrides House rules on committee jurisdiction, particularly over a Constitutional matter that should have been referred to the Committee on Judiciary? Chairman Green. That is not a valid parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Has the full House authorized this impeachment inquiry such as it did on January 14, 1876, for the investigation of then-Secretary of War William W. Belknap, or such as the House did on December 13, 2023, for the investigation of President Biden? Chairman Green. Again, not a valid parliamentary inquiry. The House of Representatives voted to send this to this committee. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentlemen is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Is the Chair aware that the Committee on the Judiciary adopted internal rules of procedure for the conduct of its impeachment inquiry of ex-President Trump in 2019? Does the Chair intend to follow suit and adopt additional committee rules to ensure due process for Secretary Mayorkas in this as- yet unauthorized inquiry? Chairman Green. Again, not a valid parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Thompson. In reference to the Secretary's right to due process, I have the following parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. Does the committee intend to follow the Secretary to be represented by counsel during these impeachment proceedings? Chairman Green. The committee will follow the rules of the House on that measure. Mr. Thompson. So, do I understand that Secretary Mayorkas will be allowed counsel? Chairman Green. The committee will follow the rules of the House on that. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Does the committee intend to allow the Secretary's counsel to be present at all hearings and deposition? Chairman Green. The committee will follow the rules of the House. Mr. Thompson. Additional inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Does the committee intend to allow the Secretary's counsel to present evidence and object to the admission of evidence? Chairman Green. The committee will follow the rules of the House. Mr. Thompson. Is that a no? Chairman Green. The committee will follow the rules of the House. Mr. Thompson. So do the rules allow it? That is my point. Chairman Green. We will follow the rules of the House as they are written. The question isn't pertinent to this committee hearing today. Mr. Thompson. Well, I think we will get to that at some point, Mr. Chairman. But I just want to go on the record in pursuit of this, is that when former President Trump had impeachment matters brought before, Senator Lindsey Graham made sure that he was afforded counsel and questions and everything. I am just trying to make sure that we follow some kind of order in that. Chairman Green. As I stated, Mr. Ranking Member, we will follow the rules of the House. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Further parliamentary inquiry. Does the committee intend to allow the Secretary's counsel to call and cross-examine witnesses? Chairman Green. Again, the committee will follow the rules of the House. Mr. Thompson. Further parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Green. The gentlemen is recognized. Mr. Thompson. Does the committee intend to give the Secretary's counsel access to and the ability to respond to the evidence added by the committee? Chairman Green. The committee will follow all of the rules of the House. Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. Thank you, Ranking Member. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee January 10, 2024 Chairman Green, and Ranking Member Thompson, it is a sad day that the committee has been convened to hold an impeachment hearing targeting the current Secretary of Homeland Security without merit or consideration of the consequences to the agency or how this action may undermine the current challenges the Nation is facing. There is no basis for impeaching Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who is carrying out his duties faithfully. Secretary Mayorkas has not committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--the United States Constitution's standard--for an impeachment. Secretary Mayorkas is carrying out his duties faithfully. House Republicans may not approve of the Biden administration's policies, but policy differences are not grounds for impeachment under the Constitution. House Republicans are trying to distract from their inability to govern and score political points with their extreme MAGA political base by impeaching the Secretary. Rather than abusing their power as the Majority in the House of Representatives with an unjustified impeachment process, they should focus on keeping the Government open and join with Democrats to provide border personnel the funding they need to do their job. I regret that today's witnesses have been summoned to participate in an impeachment process hearing. If they were made aware of the true purpose for being present today, that will be made clear during the questions phase of the hearing. The committee has been well-served over my tenure when it has taken the time to listen to local and State governments on homeland security issues, it is my hope that today's hearing does not detract from this history. As State Attorneys General and a legal scholar, these witnesses know that agencies do not make law, they implement or enforce laws that are made by legislatures, enacted by Executive actions, or mandated by court decisions. I look forward to their testimony: The Hon. Austin Knudsen, attorney general, State of Montana; The Hon. Gentner Drummond, attorney general, State of Oklahoma; The Hon. Andrew Bailey, attorney general, State of Missouri; and Frank O. Bowman, III, professor emeritus, University of Missouri School of Law (*Democratic Witness*). In 1776 the Framers declared the self-evident and later the universal truth that all persons are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As important, the Framers declared that ``to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent of the governed.'' This genius of self-government is the Framers' gift to us and America's gift to the world, and for nearly 250 years the world has looked upon the United States with wonder, awe, and envy not just for its awesome powers and achievements, but for being the exemplar to which most freedom-loving nations aspire. But as President Lincoln reminded us at Gettysburg, the proposition that a people can govern themselves is not to be taken for granted; it is a proposition that will be tested time and again and it for us, the living, to highly resolve to commit ourselves to the great task always before us, that government of the people, by the people, and for the people not perish from the earth. As Thomas Paine said in his time, the past 14 years were times that tried one's soul. The Nation was tested, severely so, by what can only be described as the modern-day Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: a deadly pandemic, economic devastation unseen since the Great Depression, social justice unrest, and the very real threat of authoritarianism. While the threat posed by these challenges are still with us to varying extent, we can all rejoice that the Nation withstood the challenge, e pluribus unum, by standing together as ``We The People.'' President Lincoln reminded us that in times of testing and challenge that ``the fiery trial through which we pass will mark us down in honor or dishonor until the latest generation'' but that so long as the people ``retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of 4 years.'' And Lincoln was right, for on Election Day 2020, Americans by a substantial majority, voted to withhold consent to govern from an incumbent administration and confer it upon another. That act of self-government and sovereign expression was solemnized on January 20, 2021, at noon when Joseph R. Biden and Kamala D. Harris took the oath of office as the 46th President and 59th Vice-President of the United States. The Philadelphia Miracle of 1789 endures but only because we Americans resolve that it does and work to make it so. The President takes the oath of office pledging to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. As does every one of my Congressional colleagues, I have sacredly pledged true faith and allegiance in defending the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic and to well and faithfully execute the duties of the office I hold. I do this ever mindful that the purpose of our form of government is ``to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, to insure domestic tranquility, to provide for the common defense, to promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty for posterity.'' But we all have a responsibility to preserve and strengthen this Constitutional republic and pass it on to the next generation by engaging in robust, lawful, and peaceful civic activity to hold our Government to account and to peaceably assemble when necessary to petition for a redress of grievances as shown by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, following the example of Mahatma Gandhi; by John Lewis and the Civil Rights foot soldiers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama; by Elizabeth Cady Staton and Lucretia Mott at Seneca Falls; by Cesar Chavez leading the fight for human dignity of farmworkers, and by Black Lives Matter demonstrators protesting inequalities in the criminal justice system. For the work of democracy is never complete, our union is always in the process of being made more perfect. The ingredients for good policy are competence, capability, and willingness to put aside partisanship and place national interest first. At this moment in our Nation's history Republicans are attempting to impeach Secretary Mayorkas not for any malfeasance or wrongdoing-- but because they disagree with his actions carrying out the Biden administration's border and immigration policies. Using policy differences as grounds for impeachment is an abusive political action that the Founders rejected as antithetical to the U.S. Constitution. Republicans have not alleged that the Secretary has committed an impeachable offense, so their ``reports'' attempting to legitimize their unfounded case for impeachment effort contain blatant misinformation and politically-motivated rhetoric, such as criticizing the termination of harmful but barely utilized Trump-era immigration and border policies, which were not laws--a fact they either do not understand or willfully ignore. Such a political theater has no basis in the history of American Constitutional law, as Article II of the U.S. Constitution sets the standard for impeachment of ``civil officers'' as ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The Biden administration's departure from the failed, cruel, and sometimes unlawful border and immigration policies of the previous administration is certainly not an impeachable offense. Impeachment under these circumstances is not a Constitutional remedy for political and policy differences. Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy reserved for the most egregious political offenses, not policy differences. Indeed, Madison objected to the term ``maladministration'' being added to the list of impeachable offenses during the Constitutional Convention because it would upset the separation of powers. The first and only impeachment of a Cabinet official occurred in 1876 following extensive evidence of corruption. Republican Congressman Tom McClintock, the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, described Rep. Greene's attempt to impeach Secretary Mayorkas over policy disagreements as a ``perilous path'' for future governance. Chairman McClintock went on to argue that the redefinition of impeachment found in H. Res. 863 ``would utterly destroy the separation of powers at the heart of our Constitution. While these are the basis for this committee not moving forward in the process, there are compelling reasons why the committee should be actively engaged in Immigration Reform. unaccompanied children at the border? Under the direction and behest of the previous administration's Secretaries of Homeland Security the saddest, most tragic situation regarding immigration policy occurred when tens of thousands of unaccompanied children were taken from their parents or removed from the care of responsible adults. The image of children in cages will haunt our Nation for decades to come, but when this was occurring too many of my friends on the other side of the aisle found no fault with the past administration's crisis- generating border policies that caused so much suffering for children and their parents. The same border challenges are part of our mission as a committee, and we are as much to blame as any administration that we under- resource or allow to pursue policies that cause injury and harm to asylum seekers or refugees needing assistance. As a former Ranking Member of the Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Border Security, my commitment to securing our Nation's borders and protecting the homeland from terrorist attacks remains unwavering. The United States has a Federal policy supported by laws that govern how non-citizens are to be treated, and the rights and well- being of the most vulnerable are to be met when in U.S. custody? During the Obama administration, I visited CBP facilities when tens of thousands of unaccompanied children were arriving at the border weekly during the previous administration and observed how DHS met the challenge of receiving them, feeding them, and placing them safely in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services was routinely met. I was shocked to learn in December 2018, that two children died in separate incidents while in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol, which were the first deaths of children in Border Patrol custody in more than a decade. CBP issued a final directive regarding enhanced medical screening procedures in December 2019. At the committee's request, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed CBP's compliance with its new procedures. GAO will issue its findings in a report to be released to the public the day of the committee's hearing. In January 2019, this committee requested documents related to these deaths. After the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to produce all requested documents, the committee issued a subpoena for the documents in November 2019. DHS did not produce all the documents demanded by the subpoena, and documents that have been produced had extensive and improper redactions. The committee under Chairman Thompson identified significant deficiencies with both reviews. The committee also found that the Inspector General omitted key information from the public summary of one of its reviews, rendering the summary inaccurate and potentially misleading. Because of the deficiencies of the Inspector General's investigations of the children's deaths and the failure of DHS under secretaries appointed by Trump not complying with committee document requests, the committee lacked full and complete information regarding the circumstances in which these deaths occurred. Unfortunately, the deaths of children in U.S. custody did not end with those two precious lives being lost. During an 8-month period from 2018 to 2019, 6 children are known to have died in U.S. custody. It was not until March 2021, when President Biden signed a memorandum creating a task force to reunite families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Trump administration's ``zero tolerance'' policy did the Department of Homeland Security start the process of reuniting families. previous administration's border failures The Trump administration wasted critical resources on an ineffective border wall and encouraged irregular migration by cutting off lawful pathways and abandoning efforts to improve conditions in the region that drive migration. Increased migration in the hemisphere, which began in 2018, is a result of on-going political upheaval, economic crises, and criminal violence that went unaddressed by the prior administration. In March 2020, border restrictions were put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a Title 42 public emergency health authority. This controversial Trump-era policy allowed U.S. officials to swiftly turn away migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Under Title 42, officials turned away migrants more than 2.8 million times since March 2020. This did not stop people from coming to our border, which resulted in tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers languishing just on the other side of the border. When President Biden took office, he inherited a broken immigration system that the prior administration had gutted. president biden and secretary mayorkas' successes Title 42 Had To End President Biden has called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform since his first day in office. As law makers we must take responsibility for the gaps in policy that allow States to shoulder the burden of a broken immigration system. As the House Committee responsible for border security policy making, Congress have failed to act even when bipartisan efforts at serious reform were undertaken. As a result of lack of Congressional action, the Biden administration is using the tools it has available to secure the border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. Secretary Mayorkas as head of DHS began a whole-of-Government approach in Fall 2021 to prepare for the end of Title 42. In May 2022, Secretary Mayorkas issued the six-pillar plan that outlined preparations to prepare for surges in migration and the lifting of Title 42. The plan showed measurable success. The power of immigration reform to reduce unlawful entry is proven through the Biden administration method of promoting the largest expansion of legal pathways for safe, orderly, and humane migration in decades, and put in new rules to encourage people to use those lawful pathways instead of making the dangerous journey to try to enter unlawfully. The success of the lifting of Title 42 was not sustainable without resources and changes being made to immigration laws. Instead, Republican Governors have become the poster children for increased irregular migration because of their work to send people from the Southern Border to New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, which sent a message that unlawful border crossings were welcomed. Once again families are coming by the tens of thousands at the invitation of Texas Governor Abbott and Florida Governor Desantis because word of them providing buses and flights to U.S. cities is reaching communities and this encourages people to come to our border for the promise that they are going to be welcomed. As a result migrant encounters with Border Patrol increase over the summers, with public reporting indicating that encounters between ports of entry are slightly higher than such encounters in April 2023 before Title 42 was terminated. Notably, the rollout of the CBP One App in January 2023 that allowed undocumented individuals to schedule appointments at ports of entry has resulted in a shift in encounters toward the ports of entry. power of diplomacy Diplomacy is also an important component of the success we are seeing on the border because the administration has secured agreements with our regional partners, including Mexico and Colombia, to quickly remove people and crack down on criminal networks operating in the Darien. In June 2022, the President mobilized 21 leaders to adopt the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection representing a collective commitment and a coordinated approach to reducing irregular migration and expanding legal pathways throughout the region. Under the L.A. Declaration, countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Costa Rica have stepped up to better integrate millions of Venezuelan and Nicaraguan migrants they host--many of whom would otherwise make the dangerous overland journey to the U.S. border. The new border enforcement measures build on prior actions taken by the administration to streamline the immigration process and make it more effective. The final ingredient is legislative action by Congress to address increasing the capacity of immigration courts to prioritize the orderly and fair processing of asylum claims of certain recent arrivals, while ensuring those not seeking protection or who don't qualify are promptly returned to their country of origin. The administration is continuing to aggressively increase legal pathways, enforce our immigration laws, target smugglers who prey and profit on vulnerable migrants and seek to traffic drugs into our country, and work collaboratively with cities and States that are impacted. Republicans who have used immigration as a wedge issue attempted to derail the President's efforts. It is time to focus on the places and communities receiving new residents and families to make sure the transition a win-win for new immigrants and communities. providing resources to larger urban areas and rural areas Democrats have proposed legislation, such as the Dream Act and the American Dream and Promise Act, that would provide a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers. Democrats are focused on providing resources to communities receiving migrants, implementing policies to ensure an orderly, humane border, and keeping the Government funded. Democrats also recognize that while there are near-term costs to receiving migrants, immigrants contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, fuel our growth, and provide a net benefit to our country's finances by paying billions in taxes annually. Democrats also support comprehensive immigration reform that would create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and improve border security measures while respecting the rights and dignity of all individuals. In July 2021, the House passed a bill that would create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented farmworkers and their families, called the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. This would protect workers from exploitation and abuse and would provide stability for the agricultural industry. Democrats have advocated for a comprehensive immigration reform package that would address the root causes of migration, improve border security, and create legal pathways for people to enter the U.S. lawfully. The Biden-Harris administration, under the direction of Secretary Mayorkas, are showing Congress, the Nation, and the world what is indeed possible when immigration is not treated like an offense to the Nation instead of the fuel that drives our economy and injects vitality into our communities. Because of joint Congressional and White House support since early 2021, DHS and CBP increased their border-holding capacity by over a third through the construction of new facilities. CBP has increased the efficiency of migrant processing and reduced the time noncitizens spend in temporary holding by 30 percent. Over the years, I worked with my fellow Democrats and Republican Members of this committee to made sure that these unaccompanied children stay safe and have a legal documentation in the United States, while the Republican party sadly has steadfastly opposed all the legislations that benefits these children. I ask my colleagues to come together and move past the discord and to stand true to our ideals as Americans and protect our most vulnerable--by continued support for the needs of unaccompanied children who come to us in need. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Green. I am pleased to have a distinguished panel of witnesses before us today, and I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise their right hand.  Chairman Green. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. Please be seated. I would now like to formally introduce our witnesses. Mr. Knudsen, Austin Knudsen was sworn in as Montana's 25th attorney general on January the 4th, 2021. Prior to that, he was elected to the Montana House of Representatives in 2010. From 2015 to 2019, he served as the speaker of the Montana House of Representatives. Gentner Drummond was sworn in as Oklahoma's 19th attorney general on January the 9th, 2023. Mr. Drummond's law experience spans nearly 30 years and includes service as an assistant district attorney in Pawnee and, how do you pronounce it, Osage counties, and as an attorney in private practice. Andrew Bailey was sworn in as the 44th attorney general of the State of Missouri on January the 3rd, 2023. Mr. Bailey is a veteran of the United States Army in which he served in combat as a commissioned officer following the terrorist attacks of September 11. Mr. Frank Bowman is the University of Missouri's curators distinguished professor emeritus and Floyd R. Gibson Missouri endowed professor of law emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law. He has also taught at Georgetown University Law Center, Washington and Lee University, Gonzaga University, Indiana University's McKinney School of Law, Wake Forest University, and the University of Denver. In spring of 2023, was visiting fellow at Oxford University's Rothermere American Institute. I thank all the witnesses for being here today, and I now recognize Mr. Knudsen for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF AUSTIN KNUDSEN, ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF MONTANA Mr. Knudsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the committee. Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, Members of the distinguished committee, my name is Austin Knudsen, Montana attorney general. As the attorney general and chief law enforcement officer for the State of Montana, I'm grateful for this committee's attention to how Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' failed leadership has impacted States like Montana. The Southern Border certainly presents a difficult challenge for any administration, but Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have absolutely poured gasoline on this fire. The Southern Border and the drugs flowing across it into communities large and small across our Nation are ultimately the reason that I am the attorney general of Montana today. I'm from rural Montana, where I was a private practice attorney until two drug dealers sped past my kids' school, one shooting at the other out of his vehicle window in broad daylight. After that incident, I became our elected county prosecutor, where I saw what I thought were the absolute worst things possible. Babies born addicted to drugs, kids thrown into foster care because their parents would rather buy drugs than take care of them. Young girls sexually assaulted by family members on drugs. People murdered over $20 drug deals gone wrong. So to say that I was encouraged by the previous administration's progress in securing our Nation's border is an understatement. It's also an understatement to say that I was horrified to see this administration under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership begin to erase that progress and systematically dismantle policies and programs meant to secure our borders. The most devastating impact of the open border on Montana has been the massive quantities of Mexican cartel fentanyl and methamphetamine. In 2020, drug task forces in Montana seized 6,663 dosage units of fentanyl. In 2021, the first year of Secretary Mayorkas' watch at the border, that quantity exploded tenfold to 61,000 dosage units of fentanyl. In 2022, Montana tripled that, seizing nearly 190,000 dosage units of cartel fentanyl. The numbers aren't finalized yet for 2023, but I can tell you that as of the third quarter of 2023, Montana is on track to have seized nearly a half million dosage units of fentanyl and another 200 pounds of meth. The cartels trafficked 100 percent of that fentanyl and meth across the Southern Border. In just 1 week during March 2022, 17 people on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation overdosed on fentanyl. Four of them died. I spoke with a woman later that year from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, which is where I'm from. She was raising her grandkids because both of her sons were killed in two separate fentanyl overdose incidents. Nation-wide, indigenous people suffer the highest rate of fentanyl overdoses. In Montana, the opioid overdose death rate among Native Americans is twice that of white people. The devastation of Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to faithfully execute the laws goes beyond the deaths it causes and the anguished families left to pick up pieces. These drugs cause people to do absolutely unspeakable things. A suspect in a current drug case in Montana was taking delivery of drugs that were being supplied directly from the cartels in Mexico. She kept her minor daughter living in a yard shed and allowed the man delivering those drugs to sexually assault her daughter as part of that drug deal. In another case last year, a young mother who was homeless was able to finally find a bedroom in a house, not knowing that that room had been recently occupied by a fentanyl user. Shortly after taking residence, that mother found her 11-month- old child not breathing. Fortunately, medical and law enforcement personnel responded quickly enough to administer naloxone before the fentanyl from the prior occupant killed that infant child. The Trump administration overcame fierce opposition at every turn and was able to gain control of our Southern Border as no previous administration could. But all of that progress has been destroyed. Secretary Mayorkas is the architect of that destruction. The American people are watching. They know that our border was secure just a few years ago. They see the devastation metastasizing in our communities from drugs and human trafficking. The conclusion is clear. Secretary Mayorkas has violated his oath, and I urge this body to impeach. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Prepared Statement of Austin Knudsen January 10, 2024 Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, Members of the committee: As the attorney general and chief law enforcement officer for the State of Montana, I am grateful for your committee's attention to how Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' failed leadership has impacted States like mine. The crisis at the border is a self-inflicted injury the policies of Secretary Mayorkas have brought upon our Nation. The Southern Border presents a difficult challenge for any administration. But Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have poured gasoline on the fire. He has violated his oath to defend the homeland and uphold the Constitution by repeatedly disregarding the laws passed by Congress. To that end, he has instructed the men and women of his Department to violate Congressional mandates and circumvent court orders issued after States like Montana have taken the drastic measure of filing suit against the Federal Government to stop the madness at the Southern Border. His actions as Secretary have turned the border into an effectively meaningless 2,000-mile line in the sand, ceding operational control to Mexican drug cartels--some of the most savage and depraved organizations in world history. In turn, the cartels have seized on Secretary Mayorkas' weakness, driving addiction and death in our country, expanding their enterprises into human trafficking and smuggling, and engaging in a reign of terror in communities on both sides of the border while the Secretary forces Customs and Border Patrol agents watch in horror. The Southern Border and the drugs flowing across it into communities large and small across our Nation are ultimately the reason I am the Montana attorney general today. I am from rural Montana--about as rural as you can get--where I was a private practice attorney until two drug dealers drove by my kids' school firing guns at each other out their windows in broad daylight. Not long after that incident, I became our county prosecutor. And there, my eyes truly opened to the devastation that the drug epidemic was hoisting onto our community. I saw what I thought were the worst things possible: babies born addicted to drugs, kids thrown into foster care because their parents would rather buy drugs than take care of them, young girls and women sexually assaulted by family members on drugs, people murdered over $20 drug deals gone wrong. I had to commit a high school classmate to a psychiatric hospital because drugs had essentially fried his brain. So, to say that I was encouraged by the previous administration's progress in securing our Nation's border is an understatement. It's also an understatement to say that I was horrified to see this administration, under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, begin to erase that progress and systematically dismantle policies and programs meant to secure the border. Since then, it has been like watching a train wreck in slow motion as our citizens fall victim to violent crime, become addicted to drugs, and, in hundreds of thousands of cases, die because Secretary Mayorkas is derelict in his duty to secure the border.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Once it crosses, it can be in Montana within 24 hours and it has a deadly effect on our communities, especially reservations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Gibson, Kylie.

These drugs cause people to do unthinkable things. A suspect in a current drug case was taking delivery of drugs that were being supplied directly from Mexico. She had a minor daughter living in a shed who was sexually assaulted by the man delivering the drugs. In another case last year, a young mother who was homeless was able to find a bedroom in a house, not knowing that the room had been recently occupied by a fentanyl user. Shortly after taking residence, that mother found her 11-month-old child not breathing. Fortunately, medical and law enforcement personnel responded quickly enough to administer naloxone before the fentanyl killed the child. Nor does the impact of Secretary Mayorkas' policies end with the proliferation of drugs into Montana communities. In a human trafficking operation this summer, our agents arrested three men from Central America. All three were in the country illegally but on deferred action. One had been deported once before and was again apprehended after crossing the border but had been allowed to stay. These men were all here and able to engage in this criminal activity because of the policies Secretary Mayorkas has implemented at the Department of Homeland Security. While the crisis at the Southern Border is often the focus of attention, the Northern Border is also a grave concern to me. The border between Montana and Canada is 545 miles long. Recent reports indicate the fentanyl super labs have been proliferating in that country, including in British Columbia, a province directly adjacent to Montana. In one November bust, authorities there seized approximately 55 pounds of fentanyl and 6.5 pounds of fentanyl diluted for distribution, along with 10 industrial-sized barrels worth of chemical precursors. In all, the seizure represents over 2.5 million street doses of the drug.\6\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ Fentanyl equal to 2.5 million street doses seized at rural property in Mission, B.C.: police, CBC NEWS (November 2, 2023), https:/ /www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/fentanyl-drug-lab-police- seizure-mission-bc-1.7016534. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is particularly alarming because under Secretary Mayorkas, DHS has made it a common practice to redeploy Border Patrol personnel from States like Montana to the Southern Border. As this committee has revealed, thousands of Border Patrol agents and officers were relocated between October 2020 and April 2023, with a substantial increase in Federal fiscal year 2023.\7\ I have first-hand knowledge that this includes agents from Montana. Adding insult to injury, the redeployed personnel were not there to help secure the border, but to process and more quickly release illegal aliens into the interior of our country. The redeployments forced stations at the Northern Border cut back on patrols, and curtail participation in joint law enforcement operations, ultimately lessening their effectiveness to disrupt cross-border smuggling. The specter of Canadian fentanyl super labs with a production capacity that far exceeds demand in their Nation and a Northern Border that could again be left unguarded by the whims of a Homeland Security Secretary who prioritizes political points over safety is terrifying for every law enforcement officer in Montana. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\ U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security. Phase 2 Interim Report: DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has Emboldened Cartels, Criminals, and America's Enemies (September 7, 2023). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As I said in my opening, the tragedy is that this crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Trump administration overcame fierce opposition at every turn and was able to gain control of our Southern Border as no other previous administration could. But all that progress has been destroyed. Secretary Mayorkas is the architect of that destruction. He took an oath to ``well and faithfully discharge the duties'' of his office and support and defend our Constitution. By any objective measure, he has failed to keep his oath. At the direction of Secretary Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security has wreaked havoc at our Southern Border, exacerbated the fentanyl epidemic, and emboldened the drug cartels. I've heard some claim that this is merely a resource issue--that if Congress would simply appropriate funds for more Border Patrol agents or immigration judges, we could solve the border crisis. As a prosecutor, I'm always in favor of giving law enforcement the tools they need to succeed. But the reality is that no amount of funding or resources will change the status quo as long as Secretary Mayorkas is in charge. It's not negligence and it's not incompetence. It's ideology and intransigence. By willfully and intentionally failing to enforce our Nation's immigration laws, Secretary Mayorkas has violated his oath of office and breached the trust placed in him by the American people.\8\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ See generally Hans A. von Spakovsky, Lora Ries, & Steven G.

Over and over, the Department of Homeland Security has argued in court filings that its refusal to enforce the laws passed by Congress is not subject to judicial review.\9\ Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly hidden behind the concept of ``prosecutorial discretion.'' In some instances, the courts have halted this illegal behavior and prevented further damage.\10\ In others, however, the courts have deferred to the Secretary's discretion.\11\ Meanwhile, the Biden administration has gone to court to stop States from defending the border.\12\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\ See, e.g., Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205 (5th Cir. 2022). \10\ See, e.g., Florida v. United States, Nos. 23-11528, 23-11644, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 13863, at *1 (11th Cir. June 5, 2023); Florida v.

The courts may not be able to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable for violating his oath of office, but this body can and should. Impeachment is a serious and solemn process. It isn't to be taken lightly or used to settle mere policy disagreements. But the Framers understood that impeachment is an appropriate response if members of the Executive branch abdicate their duties or statutory responsibilities.\13\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ See, e.g., FEDERALIST 65 (Hamilton); Joseph Story, 2 COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WITH A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE COLONIES AND STATES, BEFORE THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION 221 (Boston, MA: Hilliard Gray & Co.; Cambridge, MA: Brown, Shattuck and Co., 1833); Jared P.

I now recognize Mr. Drummond for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF GENTNER DRUMMOND, ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF OKLAHOMA Mr. Drummond. Good morning, Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to participate today in this hearing on this critical issue. I am Gentner Drummond and I was elected Oklahoma's attorney general in 2022. As the chief law enforcement officer of Oklahoma, it is my duty to protect the people of my State. I'm here to testify about the dangers my citizens face due to a porous border and the failure of our Federal Government to enforce its laws. In the early evening of November 20, 2022, law enforcement responded to a quadruple homicide after a Chinese national allegedly entered a garage on a 10-acre marijuana farm in rural Oklahoma. According to investigators, the assailant killed three men execution-style with gunshots to the back of their head and one woman with two shots to her abdomen. The carnage of that day is but one tragic example of a failed system plagued by failing leadership. Throughout Oklahoma, law enforcement comes into contact daily with foreign nationals who have entered our country illegally or who remain here illegally, or both. This is all too common in Oklahoma's illegal marijuana grow operations. The voters of Oklahoma legalized medical marijuana in 2018. While that legalization led to the legitimate cannabis business-related businesses throughout our State, organized criminals have overtaken the industry. Our law enforcement partners report that the foreign nationals most often involved in these illegal enterprises come from China and Mexico. The one thing these criminals have in common is that they have no regard for our laws or public safety. Criminal illegal immigrants are not content with growing only black-market marijuana. They also produce and distribute fentanyl, and they engage in sex trafficking and labor trafficking. Oklahoma's law enforcement community fights a constant battle against these evils. The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and scores of local law enforcement agencies deserve much praise for their great and heroic efforts. While there have been many great successes, the on-going border crisis ensures a never-ending flood of illegal foreign nationals who continue to perpetrate crimes that endanger our people. When I was sworn in as attorney general, I pledged to the people of my State that I would do everything in my power to protect them from these dangerous criminals. I petitioned our legislature for greater resources and broader authority to combat the threat. They responded with millions of dollars for equipment and personnel, and they granted my office more power to fight this criminal epidemic being fueled by our border crisis. In response, I established the Organized Crime Task Force, the first of its kind for Oklahoma, and it is needed primarily because Federal officials have failed to enforce the laws and to secure our border. In the short 7 months since its creation, the Organized Crime Task Force has investigated and is prosecuting more than 50 complex, multijurisdictional criminal cases. The vast majority of these cases involve Mexican or Chinese drug syndicates. These illegal foreign actors burden my State with additional costs that cannot be fully quantified. For instance, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections reports that it is currently housing more than 500 illegal immigrants convicted of various violent crimes. Before those criminal aliens were sent to the Department of Corrections, they were in custody of our local jails, which have their own costs for housing. Likewise, there is a significant cost for law enforcement in the investigating of these crimes and for the prosecutors who prosecute them. The unsecured border contributes to costs beyond the criminal justice system as well. While it is not possible to ascertain the exact amount of the costs, it is easy to understand the magnitude. Illegal immigration cost Oklahoma taxpayers more than $750 million each year with a minimal offset return. Mr. Chairman, Members of the committee, I believe it is time for accountability. The people of Oklahoma don't deserve to live under constant threat from criminal foreign nationals. We don't deserve to have our communities flooded with illegal drugs that were smuggled across an unsecure border. We don't deserve to have our loved ones ripped away by those same drugs. I ask you to remember the people of Oklahoma as you did deliberate. Remember the murder victims. Remember the drug overdose victims and the families who mourn them. Of course, please remember the law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect us from it all. Thank you.  Prepared Statement of Gentner Drummond Good morning, Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to participate in today's hearing on this critical issue. I am Gentner Drummond, and I was elected as Oklahoma's Attorney General in 2022. As the chief law enforcement officer of Oklahoma, it is my duty to protect the people of my State. I am here to testify about the dangers my citizens face due to a porous border and the failure of the Federal Government to enforce the law. In the early evening of November 20, 2022, law enforcement responded to a quadruple homicide after a Chinese national allegedly entered a garage on a 10-acre marijuana farm in Kingfisher County, about an hour's drive west of Oklahoma City. According to investigators, the man then pulled out a handgun and kept it trained on a group of people--also Chinese nationals--who were inside. He said they owed him $300,000 that he had invested in the grow operation, and that they had exactly 30 minutes to pay up or he would kill them all. According to investigators, the assailant killed 3 men, execution- style, with gunshots to the back of the head, and one woman with two shots to the abdomen. Another man sustained a gunshot wound but survived after being medi-flighted for emergency surgery. It took personnel from 6 law enforcement agencies to process the gruesome scene. Much to the credit of law enforcement, police arrested the suspect in Florida 2 days later. The carnage of that day is but one tragic example of a failed system plagued by failing leadership. Throughout Oklahoma, law enforcement comes into daily contact with foreign nationals who entered our country illegally or who remain here illegally--or both. This is tragic and common in Oklahoma's illegal marijuana grow operations. The voters of Oklahoma legalized medical marijuana in 2018. While that legalization led to some legitimate cannabis-related businesses, organized criminals have overtaken the industry. Our law enforcement partners report that the foreign nationals most often involved in these illegal enterprises come from China and Mexico. We have identified individuals from many other countries, to include Cuba, Bulgaria, and Russia. The one thing these criminals have in common is that they have no regard for our laws or public safety. Criminal illegal immigrants are not content with only growing black-market marijuana. They also produce and distribute fentanyl, and they engage in sex trafficking and labor trafficking. Oklahoma's law enforcement community fights a constant battle against these evils. The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and scores of municipal and county law enforcement agencies deserve much praise for their heroic efforts. Thanks to the leadership of Director Donnie Anderson, the director of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics, his agents and law enforcement partners have seized countless tons of dangerous drugs and arrested untold numbers of traffickers. It should be no surprise to this committee that many of these criminals are foreign nationals who entered this country illegally through our unsecured Southern Border. Even the State agency that was created to regulate the legal marijuana market has been forced to combat the explosion of illegal grows. My office has a strong partnership with the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority, led by Director Adria Berry, which provides critical information to our agents and other law enforcement. Thanks to this collaboration, we are able to identify and investigate criminal enterprises that all too often are operated by foreign nationals. While there have been great successes, the on-going border crisis ensures a never-ending flood of illegal foreign nationals who continue to perpetrate criminal activities that endanger our people. You may wonder how these foreign nationals have infiltrated the medical marijuana industry in Oklahoma. The pattern is a common one. Foreign operatives conduct a ``straw'' purchase of rural property just outside city limits. Sometimes they have a front man lease the real estate. Either way, they take steps to conceal their activities. It is common to see that they have pushed up a berm to prevent visibility from the roads. They often will post armed personnel to stand watch and imply threat. Members, you can imagine the impact these kinds of actions have in communities throughout rural Oklahoma. Families are scared. They feel unsafe. Smaller law enforcement departments are literally out-manned and out-gunned, and they feel ill-equipped to address the threat. When I was sworn in as Attorney General, I pledged to the people of Oklahoma that I would do everything in my power to protect them from these dangerous criminals. I petitioned our legislature for greater resources and broader authority to combat this threat. They responded with millions of dollars for equipment and personnel, and they granted my office more power to fight this criminal epidemic being fueled by the border crisis. In response, I established the Organized Crime Task Force. It is the first of its kind for Oklahoma. And, of course, it is needed because Federal officials have failed to enforce the law and secure the border. In the short 7 months since its creation, the Organized Crime Task Force has investigated and is prosecuting more than 50 complex, multi-jurisdictional criminal cases. The vast majority of these cases involve Mexican or Chinese drug syndicates. Because these foreign actors have no vested interest in the well- being of our communities, law enforcement officials have discovered rampant building-code violations that, in turn, have led to fires and explosions. In one case alone, fire at an illegal marijuana grow destroyed more than 10,000 acres and necessitated deploying the National Guard and other agencies across Oklahoma and Texas. In the wake of such incidents, my office demanded strict enforcement of building codes against these illegal foreign operators. As a result, approximately one-half of the marijuana grows in the State were found to be out of compliance. That translates to thousands of unsafe operations across Oklahoma, putting lives and communities at risk. These foreign actors are creating additional costs that cannot fully be quantified. For instance, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections reports that it currently houses nearly 500 illegal immigrants convicted of State crimes. At an average cost of $63.53 per inmate per day, the State of Oklahoma pays roughly $11 million per year to incarcerate criminal illegals. Before those criminal aliens were sent to the Department of Corrections, they were in the custody of a local jail, who have their own costs for housing. Likewise, there is a significant cost for law enforcement to investigate these crimes and for prosecutors to prosecute them. The unsecure border contributes to costs beyond the criminal justice system as well. Oklahoma's water resource authority reports of strain on the utility grid when these operations--which employ no one legally and give nothing back to the community--demand commercial levels of water consumption. We have seen instances where a lone farmhouse is purchased by a foreign entity and a line that once consumed 3,000 to 4,000 gallons a month began consuming tens or hundreds of thousands of gallons monthly. This can equal the consumption of the entire local grid. Other bad actors drill un- permitted wells and draw down from the subterranean water of legitimate farmers, sometimes eliminating the source supply completely. Once these operations have run their course, the criminals simply pull up stakes overnight, leaving behind dilapidated, unsafe structures that are an environmental blight and a threat to public safety. Additionally, it is widely understood that Oklahoma, like every other State, bears a significant financial burden related to the routine services that must be provided to those who are here illegally. While it is not possible to ascertain the exact amount of that cost to Oklahoma, it is easy to understand the magnitude of that cost. The State bears the burden for the education, health, and welfare of a robust and growing illegal population. It is estimated that well over 100,000 live among us, costing Oklahoma taxpayers more than $750 million each year--with minimal offsetting return. (FYI SOURCE: Federation for American Immigration Reform) It is important to note that the illegal immigrant population in Oklahoma is vulnerable to exploitation. My office has observed many instances where members of this population become victims of horrific crimes. Every case being investigated by my Organized Crime Task Force--every single case--involves some level of undocumented labor trafficking. Law enforcement is seeing this particularly in operations run by Chinese nationals. Officers see tell-tale signs such as abandoned and substandard living conditions for workers and a complete disregard for human welfare, not to mention countless Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations. We have examples of illegal workers being fed from dog-food bowls, and our agents plan to begin using so-called ``cadaver'' dogs to find potential unknown victims of these wretched conditions. During an investigation into illegal drug activities by Chinese nationals, our agents recently coordinated with other law enforcement to serve simultaneous warrants on multiple addresses. At one location, agents found two female Chinese nationals, who spoke no English. Mattresses on the floor of their bedroom were littered with condoms, lotion, and other unsavory supplies. The women had been in the country for months, but they could not say where they were and they had not been out of the house since their arrival. They simply awoke every day, worked, and went back to sleep. This living horror, which was merely incidental to the initial investigation, further illustrates the human cost of allowing persons to remain unsafe and undocumented. These foreign actors are blatant and cavalier in their efforts. Our investigators are finding job advertisements on international websites targeting and recruiting poor and rural Chinese. These ads, in Mandarin, are thinly-veiled offerings to engage in criminal activity. One particularly distasteful ad recruits ``girls under 50'' for ``purely formal bed'' and ``four days off a month.'' Another offers jobs for a ``massage spa'' to people who are ``able to endure hardships'' and who have ``good hygiene.'' Illegal aliens forced into this clandestine world have nowhere to turn. On the occasions that Oklahoma law enforcement does find people at these operations, agents resort to Google Translate attempting to communicate with Mandarin-speaking workers. The agents contact HSI, but invariably they are told that the system is too overloaded for the Federal Government to assist. In the end, our officers know it doesn't really matter whether HSI responds. We confirm that anyone brought in to HSI will simply be released. Without appropriate recourse, officers typically are forced to leave the victimized illegal aliens where they were found. The upshot is this: If an immigrant claims he or she has entered the country before November 1, 2020, to be deported they must have incurred at least two DUIs or a DUI plus a more egregious crime. This situation puts the criminal in control. The local field office director of HSI has been disempowered from removing persons without convictions, even if they are repeatedly implicated in criminal reports. Illegal immigrants are also taking advantage of VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) programs or DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) participation. And it is important to remember that the crimes of these foreign actors range from prostitution to money-laundering to underground casinos. Among the Mexican drug cartels, the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Federal authorities have seen increased activity from cartels such as La Familia, the New Generation Jalisco Cartel and the notorious Sinaloa Cartel. With the cartels harvesting so much marijuana in Oklahoma, the issue is no longer about smuggled marijuana from Mexico. Rather, the contraband of choice is now fentanyl, a narcotic as addictive as it is deadly. In this regard, the director of the Houston High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Mike McDaniels, reports that we are seeing unprecedented levels of partnership between Chinese nationals and the Mexican cartels operating along the Southwest Border. Chinese and Mexican nationals work alongside the cartels to produce the opioid in labs in Mexico before transporting it across the border. Director McDaniel indicates the cooperation extends to organized distribution schemes to the United States. The illicit fentanyl industry is incredibly lucrative. One gram, roughly the weight of a single Sweet & Low packet, can produce 500 pills at an expense of about 10 cents. On the street, each pill sells for between $10 and $20. When Oklahoma law enforcement first interdicted large quantities, we were not seeing an equivalent amount on the street, which led us to believe that the supply was supporting drug habits of insular communities such as foreign-run marijuana grow operations. Tragically, that threat has now invaded our own communities. In 2017, Oklahoma recorded 54 fentanyl overdoses. Only 5 years later, that number grew to 474. While final figures for this past year are not yet known, we do know there were 317 fentanyl deaths in the first 5 months of 2023 alone. The situation has become so dire, in fact, Oklahoma's Department of Mental Health now operates vending machines for Naloxone, which is used to treat people who are overdosing on an opioid. The opioid user is not the only one put in harm's way. In August of last year, law enforcement officers in northern Oklahoma responded to a local residence for a welfare check. An officer checking out the premises unknowingly was exposed to fentanyl. He collapsed to the ground, unconscious. The officer's partner was able to administer a triple dose of Naloxone to bring him back from the brink of death. Mr. Chairman, Members of the committee, I believe it is time for accountability. The people of Oklahoma don't deserve to live under constant threat from criminal foreign nationals. The people of Oklahoma don't deserve to have their communities flooded with illegal drugs that were smuggled across our unsecure border. Oklahoma families don't deserve to have their loved ones ripped away by those same drugs. Members, once the hearing process is concluded, you will have a very weighty decision to make. I trust that each of you has great respect for that solemn duty, and that you will make your decision with great care and deliberation. As I conclude my testimony here today, I want to ask you to remember the people of Oklahoma as you deliberate. Remember the murder victims, and the drug overdose victims, and the families who mourn them. And of course, please remember the law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect us from it all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Members of the committee. Chairman Green. Thank you, Mr. Drummond. I now recognize Mr. Bailey for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF ANDREW BAILEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF MISSOURI Mr. Bailey. Distinguished Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you this morning. My understanding of border security comes from direct, hands-on experience securing a nation's border. It was earned on a barren desert battlefield half a world away from the turret of an M-2 Bradley fighting vehicle. In 2005, as a newly-minted second lieutenant in the United States Army, my platoon deployed to the Nineveh Province, Iraq, under the command of then-Colonel H.R. McMaster, was tasked with securing the border between Iraq and Syria. Our mission was simple: close the border. That's exactly what we did. We did not capture people and release them into the interior of the country. We did not hand out citations and ask individuals to report back in 10 years. No. We closed the border to ensure the country was safe. Since 2021, more than 8 million illegal immigrants have entered the United States, and that is more than the population of my home State of Missouri. These numbers are not an accident. There is only one reason 8 million people illegally cross a sovereign nation's border. Because they know that they can get away with it. Why wouldn't they? In the last 3 years of Secretary Mayorkas' reign, there has been an orchestrated lack of enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws. He has failed to do that which is most fundamental to his mission: protect our border. That failure has not only led to today's impeachment proceeding, it has given rise to an unprecedented level of State actions necessary to fill the vacuum created by the Secretary's refusal to do his job. I'd like to highlight for you a few of the actions my office has taken as we fight to secure the Southern Border. One of those is our fight to force him to finish President Trump's border wall. In an interview last Wednesday on CNN, Secretary Mayorkas stated, we need additional resources and we need them now. Our lawsuit proves he already has funding, he just refuses to use it. In fiscal year 2020, Congress appropriated funds explicitly for the purpose of constructing barrier systems at our Southern Border to keep unauthorized individuals out of our country. In the appropriation, Congress explicitly stated the money shall only be available for the construction of barrier systems along the Southwest Border. Secretary Mayorkas and his administration refused to comply with Congress's command. Missouri immediately filed suit. DHS attempted to argue we did not have standing to challenge its refusal to use the funds, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that States can indeed bring such a challenge. That ruling cleared the way for our lawsuit against the Secretary's refusal to finish President Trump's border wall, and it allowed the lawsuit to move forward. So while we battle in court over Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to use taxpayer dollars in the manner Congress explicitly prescribed, we have little sympathy for his pleas for more resources. Rather than find ways to secure our border, Secretary Mayorkas has been busy enacting policies to make it easier to enter our country illegally. We filed suit again against Secretary Mayorkas for allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to be paroled into the United States every year. Parole allows non-citizens to physically enter and remain in the United State for up to 2 years, or even longer, while their application is reviewed without lawful status. We also filed suit to halt Secretary Mayorkas' attempt to implement a rule that redefined what had previously been considered an illegal border crossing as a lawful pathway. Rather than acknowledge the root cause of the influx of illegal immigrants pouring over our border, the Secretary tried to define the problem away by simply making something that was once illegal, something legal without Congressional authorization. Mayorkas' process would allow vast numbers of illegal immigrants to enter the country and receive instant work authorization under bogus asylum claims. Secretary Mayorkas has enacted illegal policies that are akin to posting a ``Come In, We're Open'' sign along the Southern Border. Without taking responsibility for the consequences of his actions, States are then forced to bear the enormous cost of Secretary Mayorkas' failure. The States should not need to do the Federal Government's job for them. Secretary Mayorkas swore an oath to faithfully execute the laws of our land. In Missouri, we remove officials who do not do their jobs because we have seen first-hand the catastrophic toll it takes on entire communities. My office was forced to take action to remove a Soros-backed prosecuting attorney from office for her refusal to do her job that resulted in the killing and maiming of countless Missourians. Since we took action, order has been restored to the city of St. Louis. It is rightful for Congress to consider removing a Government official who refuses to do his job for the same reason, to restore order. We have reached a point of no return. We're doing everything we can at the State level to rectify this disaster, but Congress has a role to play for accountability. While we battle in the Nation's courts, Congress must use every tool at its disposal to obtain accountability for the American people. I thank the committee for its time and welcome its questions.  Prepared Statement of Andrew Bailey January 10, 2024 ``A nation without borders is not a nation.''--President Donald J. Trump. i. introduction Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and distinguished Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you this morning. Our borders define us geographically, culturally, and militarily. Secure borders are the bedrock upon which safe and prosperous societies are built. That ubiquitous truth has been self-evident for millennia, and it remains true today regardless of whether or not the current administration and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas choose to believe it. My understanding of border security comes from direct, hands-on experiencing securing a Nation's border. It was earned on a barren desert battlefield half a world away from the turret of an M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle. In 2005, as a newly-minted 2nd Lieutenant, my platoon deployed to Nineveh Province, Iraq, under the command of General H.R. McMaster and was tasked with securing the northwest border between Iraq and Syria. Our mission was simple and clear: close the border. And that's exactly what we did. We did not capture people and release them into the interior of the country. We did not hand out citations and ask folks to report back in 10 years. And we certainly did not send a ``border czar'' on fruitless missions to identify the ``root causes'' of regional migration. No, we closed the border to ensure the country was safe from those who wanted to cross the border to undermine the sovereignty and safety of the Nation. I learned many lessons about leadership and security during my two deployments to Iraq, but chief among them is this: mission success is a function of competent command. Where the leader leads, the troops will go. When the leader has a clear vision, a strong work ethic and a sense of mission integrity, success and security will follow. Conversely, when a leader is indecisive and evasive, chaos will reign--and crisis is inevitable. Make no mistake, a crisis is exactly what we have. Since 2021, more than 8 million illegal immigrants have entered the Unites States. That is more than the population of Missouri. The illegal immigration rate is so high that in 2023, more illegal immigrants entered our country than there were babies born in the United States. A recent Gallup poll shows that 72 percent of Americans consider the situation at our Southern Border a ``crisis'' or a ``major problem.'' And 82 percent of Americans say they worry about illegal immigration. Those numbers are alarming, and they have been getting worse nearly every month for the past 3 years. These numbers are not an accident; they happened by design. There is only one reason 8 million people illegally cross a sovereign nation's border: because they know they can get away with it. And why wouldn't they? In the last 3 years of Secretary Mayorkas' reign, there has been an orchestrated lack of enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws. Our border has become a rudderless ship of chaos. Secretary Mayorkas, either at the direction of his superiors or of his own volition, has abdicated his responsibilities. He has failed to uphold his oath of office. He has failed to enforce our Nation's immigration laws. And he has failed to do that which is most fundamental to his mission: protect our border. That failure has not only led to today's impeachment proceeding; it has given rise to an unprecedented level of State actions necessary to fill the vacuum created by the Secretary's ineptitude. State attorneys general like me and my colleagues here today have become the vanguard in the fight for border security. I'd like to highlight for you a few of the actions my office has taken as we fight to secure the border and keep Missourians, and all Americans, safe. ii. secretary mayorkas is already in possession of resources needed to secure the border In an interview last Wednesday on CNN, Secretary Mayorkas stated, ``we need additional resources. We need them now and that is why we submitted a supplemental funding package quite some time ago.'' In reality, we all know he already has funding. He just refuses to use it. In fiscal year 2020, Congress appropriated funds explicitly for the purpose of constructing barrier systems at the Southern Border to keep unauthorized individuals out of our country. In the appropriation, Congress explicitly stated the money ``shall only be available for construction of barrier systems along the Southwest Border,'' and provided specific criteria on their use and where the barrier systems may be constructed. Secretary Mayorkas and his administration refused to comply with Congress' command. When asked why the current administration ``did not build a barrier, such as a wall, to keep migrants out,'' Secretary Mayorkas replied that ``t is not the policy of this administration'' because ``e do not agree with the building of a wall.'' DHS expressed its intention to ``end wall expansion.'' The administration even ``call on Congress to cancel remaining border wall funding'' because they knew that without Congressional action, they would need to use the appropriated funds for their specified purpose: finish the construction of President Trump's border wall. Yet when Congress did not capitulate to his demands, the Secretary ignored his Constitutional obligations to abide by Congress's appropriations laws and opted not to use the funding for the purpose Congress directed. Missouri, alongside Texas, immediately filed suit. DHS attempted to argue we did not have standing to challenge its refusal to use the funds, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that States can indeed bring a challenge. That ruling cleared the way for our lawsuit against the Secretary's refusal to finish President Trump's border wall to move forward. We anticipate a ruling from the district court any day now. So while we battle in court over Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to use taxpayer dollars in the manner Congress intended, we have little sympathy for his pleas for more resources. Congress gave him resources. He simply refuses to use them. iii. secretary mayorkas is not even attempting to faithfully execute the laws; rather, he is working to loosen them Rather than find ways to secure our border, Secretary Mayorkas has been busy enacting policies to make it easier to enter our country illegally. In January, Missouri filed suit against Secretary Mayorkas over a new DHS program that unlawfully creates a de facto pathway to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. Despite the fact that an Executive agency cannot create immigration programs without the express permission of Congress, DHS instituted a new visa system that would allow for up to 360,000 illegal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to be ``paroled'' into the United States every year. Parole allows noncitizens to physically enter and remain in the United States even though they do not have a legal basis for being admitted. Although Congress authorized a limited parole power for illegal immigrants who meet very specific and stringent standards, Secretary Mayorkas' program does not meet these standards. Contrary to existing law, the program creates a pathway for program participants to apply from their home country and gain lawful status to enter and stay in the United States for up to 2 years, or even longer, while their application is reviewed. Even worse, Secretary Mayorkas instituted the program without engaging in the notice and comment rulemaking process required by law. This program is another instance of Mayorkas abusing his Executive authority to further his dangerous open borders agenda at the expense of the States and their taxpayers. A mere 3 months later, Missouri again filed suit against Secretary Mayorkas, this time for his attempt to implement a rule that would make it even easier for persons to illegally immigrate into the United States. His new ``Circumvention of Lawful Pathways'' rule redefined what had previously been considered illegal border crossings as ``lawful pathways.'' The Circumvention Rule references a new ``process'' that would allow vast numbers of illegal immigrants to enter the country and receive instant work authorization and quick access under bogus asylum claims. These migrants, who previously would have had to cross the border illegally, will still lack lawful status in the United States (though with a false imprimatur of legality, thanks to the Secretary's unlawful procedures), and the States will be forced to bear the cost of their presence. Rather than acknowledge the root cause of the influx of illegal immigrants pouring over our border, the Secretary tried to define the problem away by simply making something that was once illegal into something legal. Missouri has not only filed suit against Secretary Mayorkas--we have given him advice on how to fix these problems. In the wake of the October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, we called on DHS to make regulatory changes that close the catch-and-release loophole that DHS is currently exploiting to implement its mass release policy at the Southwest Border. In the Petition for Rulemaking we submitted directly to the Secretary, we asked DHS to end the blatantly unlawful catch-and- release policies because of the horrendous effects on the security of our country. DHS is releasing illegal immigrants at a rate of over 1 million per year, and that does not include the ones being released on parole under Sec. 1182(d)(5). Even worse, in addition to unlawfully releasing inadmissible immigrants into the United States, DHS is giving the ``parolees'' a court date many years in the future. DHS's unlawful decisions are allowing millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States for 15 years or longer before ever approaching a judge's bench. Secretary Mayorkas does not care. His refusal to secure the border has resulted in an unprecedented flood of unvetted migrants into the interior of our Nation. We have no idea who Mayorkas has allowed into Missouri communities. After what happened in Israel, it is more vital than ever that we secure our border and keep Americans safe. My office is doing everything in its power to hold Mayorkas accountable and end the border crisis that he created. iv. the cost to the states Secretary Mayorkas has enacted illegal policies that are akin to posting a ``Come In, We're Open'' sign along the Southern Border, later refusing to take any responsibility for the consequences of his actions. States are then forced to bear the enormous cost of Secretary Mayorkas' failure. Despite it not being in the States' job descriptions to fight cartels, catch illegal immigrants, or subsidize illegal immigrants' driver's licenses and educations, State leaders are forced to make an impossible choice: leave the Federal Government to its reckless policy choices, which inherently leaves our communities to be ravaged, or face the wrath of a Federal Government who wants us to sit down and shut up. The choice for me is clear: I will not sit idly by while Missouri communities continue to be decimated by the weight of unchecked illegal immigration under Secretary Mayorkas' watch. The Secretary may be pushing his open border agenda in the name of compassion, but the facts tell a different story. It is not compassionate to the women and children being trafficked by cartels at the Southern Border. It is not compassionate to the Americans losing their loved ones in the streets to fentanyl. And it is not compassionate to Americans who do not know who has been let loose in their communities. Members of the Committee, here are some key figures: More than 8 million illegal immigrants have entered America from Mexico since 2021, not including `got-aways'. Estimates indicate there have been as many as 1.8 million `got-aways'. Roughly 3 million people were encountered illegally entering the United States in fiscal year 2023. On Mayorkas' watch, we have set the record for the highest number of yearly illegal alien encounters in U.S. history. December broke a record for monthly encounters with more than 302,000. A November report by the House Committee on Homeland Security indicates annual Federal and State tax dollar support for illegal immigrants exceeds the annual GDP of 15 States. Only a small fraction is ever recouped from the taxes paid by illegal immigrants, according to the report. Medicaid is the biggest expense, at $12.4 billion dollars in the past 2 years. In fiscal year 2022, taxpayers provided millions of illegal immigrants with nearly 6 billion in food stamps. Let's talk about fentanyl. Nearly 12,500 grams fentanyl were seized by the Missouri Highway Patrol in 2023. It takes only 2 milligrams of fentanyl to cause an overdose death. With a population of more than 6 million in the State of Missouri, 12,500 grams of fentanyl could kill Missouri's entire population twice over. There has also been: a 500 percent surge in child fentanyl exposure deaths, a nearly 75 percent increase in fentanyl overdoses in Missouri between 2019 and 2023, and a total of 43 Missouri children died from unintentional fentanyl poisonings in 2022. Let's turn to human trafficking. Missouri ranks fourth on the list of the States with the highest human trafficking rate in the United States, with 4.30 per 100,000 citizens. This makes sense with two interstates flowing through our major cities directly from the Southern Border. In 2021, the National Human Trafficking Hotline Database recorded 1,100 human trafficking tips in our State. Missouri law enforcement was able to rescue 327 victims from those tips. Most cases revolved around sex trafficking, with the NHTH recording 210 sex trafficking cases, and 15 labor trafficking-related. And yet while these statistics shed light on a nauseating reality, some of the costs to Missourians cannot be quantified. The loved ones lost to fentanyl or human trafficking can never be replaced, much less properly described in this hearing today. And yet, Secretary Mayorkas' failure does not discriminate. Red States are not the only ones facing this problem. Blue States are also begging the Federal Government to course correct, as they too are forced to bear the unspeakable burden of tens of thousands of unauthorized migrants entering their communities. Only weeks ago, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs deployed the National Guard to the border to protect her State against the influx of unauthorized migrants flooding into their cities. Prior to that, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker sent a letter to DHS begging for Federal aid to assist in managing the massive cost from illegal immigrants residing in his State. Before that, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency to handle what she dubbed a ``crisis.'' v. congress must bring accountability The fact of the matter is that every State is a border State. Every State and its citizens are forced to bear the brunt of Secretary Mayorkas' ineptitude. My call to Congress today is simple: remove that burden from the shoulders of everyday Americans and put it back where it belongs--on the shoulders of those sworn to protect us. The States should not need to take steps to do the Federal Government's job for them. Secretary Mayorkas swore an oath to faithfully execute the laws of our land, including those intended to protect Americans. Congress has even given DHS ample tools to do its job. But let's be clear: this hearing today is not about resources. It's about Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to use the resources given to him in good faith. That is important. So often, we are told that Congress has the power of the purse and can use it to check failures by the Executive branch. But the power of the purse means little if Executive officials are going to ignore the appropriations laws this body creates. In Missouri, we remove officials who do not do their jobs because we have seen first-hand the catastrophic toll it takes on entire communities. It is rightful for Congress to consider removing a Government official who refuses to do his job. We have reached a point of ``no-return.'' The attorneys general sitting before you today are doing everything we can at the State level to rectify this appalling situation, but Congress has a role to play for accountability. While we battle in the Nation's courts, Congress must use every tool at its disposal to obtain accountability for the American people. I welcome the committee's questions. Chairman Green. Thank you, Mr. Bailey. I now recognize Mr. Bowman for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF FRANK O. BOWMAN, III, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SCHOOL OF LAW Mr. Bowman. Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, Members of the committee, I'm honored to address this committee, and I'm also pleased to share the witness table with three distinguished elected officials, one of whom immediately to my right, Mr. Bailey, I last remember seeing around 2011, as a second-year law student in my evidence class at Mizzou. As attorney general of Missouri, he has surely come up in the world. Congratulations to you from an old professor. I, on the other hand, remain simply an old professor. I understand this to be the first in a series of hearings on whether Constitutional grounds exist to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The testimony so far has focused on the performance of Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration relating to immigration policy and enforcement. I'm not an expert on immigration policy. I will not comment on it here. I have, however, been studying Constitutional standards for impeachment for over 25 years. I've written numerous articles and a book on the history of impeachment, from its origins in England in 1376 through the two impeachments of President Trump. My subject, therefore, will be the Constitutional standard for impeaching a Cabinet officer. The key point about impeachment in our Constitution is that it is not supposed to be a routine tool to resolve ordinary public policy debates, even very passionate ones, debates between political parties or between one house of Congress and the Executive branch. It is, instead, a measure of last resort, reserved, as one Framer put it, for great and dangerous offenses. In other words, for official misconduct which is extraordinarily serious in degree and critically of a type that corrupts or subverts Governmental processes or the Constitutional order itself. That the Framers intended impeachment to be rare is obvious from their decision that conviction requires two-thirds of the Senate. That they intended to rule it out as a weapon of ordinary political debate is plain from how they defined impeachable conduct. The Constitution provides that the President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. A Cabinet Secretary is a civil officer subject to impeachment. But a Cabinet Secretary, like the President, is not impeachable unless he's proven to have committed treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. There's no suggestion that I'm aware of that Secretary Mayorkas has committed either treason or bribery. Hence, any Article of Impeachment against him must establish that he committed high crimes and misdemeanors. The Framers chose the English parliamentary term of art, high crimes and misdemeanors, rather than other possible terms, like maladministration, because they wanted a flexible term that could reach unanticipated new forms of grave official misconduct, but equally and critically, because they did not want an impeachment that would be the equivalent of a vote of no confidence in modern parliamentary systems, a vote that could remove the President or other Executive branch officials between elections whenever the legislature disapproves of administration policy. For over two centuries, students of the Constitution have universally agreed, in the words of the great impeachment scholar Charles Black, that whatever may be the grounds for impeachment and removal, dislike of a President's policy is certainly not one of them. To be properly impeachable, official conduct must meet a very high threshold of seriousness. It must also be of a type that corrupts and subverts the political and Governmental process, and it ought to be plainly wrong regardless of legal technicalities. The most commonly encountered categories of impeachable conduct are official corruption, abuse of power, betrayal of the Nation's foreign policy interests, and subversion of the Constitution. There is no serious allegation of which I'm aware that the Secretary has done any of those things. Now, some might mischaracterize the Secretary's implementation of the President's policy priorities as an abuse of power. But impeachable abuse of power involves employing the powers of office for illegal or illegitimate ends, particularly to gain personal, political, or financial advantage; to benefit personal or political allies; or to injure political or personal enemies, and especially when the abusive exercise of official power undermines Constitutional values. Following the policy directives of one's elected superior in pursuit of that superior's policy aims is simply not an impeachable abuse of power. Finally, impeachment of a Cabinet Secretary over policy agreements is not only contrary to long-established Constitutional understanding, but useless as a practical matter. If the official actions of the officer are in accord with the directives of his elected superior, the President, removing the Secretary changes nothing. If Members of this committee disapprove of the Biden administration's immigration and border policies, the Constitution gives this Congress a wealth of legislative powers to change them. Impeachment is not one of those powers.  Prepared Statement of Frank O. Bowman, III* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Academic titles provided for identification purposes only.

Although the Committee's previously-issued reports, the title of this hearing, and the identity of my distinguished fellow witnesses suggest that much of its focus will be on the performance of Secretary Mayorkas, his department, and the Biden administration generally in relation to immigration policy and enforcement and other issues concerning control of the United States' Southern Border, I am not an expert on those topics. I will not comment on them here. I have, however, been studying and writing about the Constitutional standards for impeachment for over 25 years. I submitted testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on the meaning of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' during the Clinton matter \1\ and since then have written fairly copiously on a wide range of topics relating to impeachment.

Rather, I am appearing to offer the committee such advice as I can based on a quarter-century of study of impeachment under the American Constitution. constitutional standards for impeachment Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that, ``The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\4\ A Cabinet Secretary is a ``civil officer'' subject to impeachment.

Hence, any article of impeachment against him must establish that he committed ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' ``High Crimes & Misdemeanors'' and Policy Disputes At the Constitutional convention in 1787, once the delegates decided that Presidents and others should be impeachable, they proposed various definitions of impeachable conduct. In the last exchange, George Mason first suggested ``treason, bribery, or maladministration.'' James Madison recoiled at ``maladministration,'' saying, ``So vague a term will be equivalent to tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.'' Whereupon Mason withdrew ``maladministration'' and proposed instead ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' This suggestion was adopted with no dissent or further discussion.\5\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ 2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787 550-52 (Max Farrand, ed. 1911). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The key point about the exchange between Mason and Madison is that, although Madison was a consistent supporter of a strong impeachment power as a check on Presidential authority, he rejected any formula that would subordinate the President to Congress. Mason had made the same point earlier in the convention when he coupled his endorsement of impeachment with the admonition that the President should not, by virtue of impeachment, become ``the mere creature of the Legislature.''\6\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ 2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787 86 (Max Farrand, ed. 1911). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Both Mason and Madison wanted to avoid creating an impeachment mechanism that was the equivalent of the ``vote of no confidence'' common in modern parliamentary systems, a vote that could remove the President or other Executive branch officials between elections whenever the legislature disapproves of the official's behavior or the administration's policy choices.\7\ As the great Professor Charles Black put the matter in his seminal Nixon-era survey of impeachment: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\ BOWMAN, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, supra note 3, at 92. See also, CHARLES L. BLACK, JR. AND PHILIP BOBBITT, IMPEACHMENT: A HANDBOOK 28 (2d ed. 2018); Keith Whittington, Impeachment in a System of Checks and Balances, 87 MO. L. REV. 844 (2022) (the adoption of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' by the convention ``seemed to capture the range of potential dangers that concerned Madison and others, without leaving the President vulnerable to impeachment over routine political and policy disagreements''). ``Madison's reason for objecting to `maladministration' as a ground was that the inclusion of this phrase would result in the President's holding his office `during pleasure of the Senate.' In other words, if mere inefficient administration, or administration that did not accord with Congress's view of good policy, were enough for impeachment and removal, without any flavor of criminality or distinct wrongdoing, impeachment and removal would take on the character of a British parliamentary vote of `no confidence.' The September 8 colloquy  makes it very plain that this was not wanted, and certainly the phrase `high Crimes and Misdemeanors,' whatever its vagueness at the edges, seems absolutely to forbid the removal of a President on the grounds that Congress does not on the whole think his administration of public affairs is good. *** hatever may be the grounds for impeachment and removal, dislike of a President's policy is definitely not one of them, and ought to play no part in the decision on impeachment. There is every reason to think that most congressmen and senators are aware of this.'\8\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ CHARLES L. BLACK, JR. AND PHILIP BOBBITT, IMPEACHMENT: A HANDBOOK (2d ed. 2018) (emphasis added). Since at least 1805, there has been consensus among students of impeachment that it should not be attempted based on simple policy disagreements between Congress and the Executive branch,\9\ and that impeachment must not be employed to subordinate the Executive to Congress.\10\ In recent years, that consensus has become, if anything, more settled. For example, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in his 1992 history of the impeachments of Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew Johnson that Johnson's acquittal was beneficial insofar that conviction might have made impeachment merely a means to ``frustrate the President in his effort to carry out his program.''\11\ In 1999, preeminent impeachment scholar Michael Gerhardt reviewed all the Senate impeachment decisions to that point and observed that the Senate has ``concluded that impeachable offenses do not include errors of judgment or policy differences.''\12\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\ The principle that impeachment should not be a weapon of partisan political warfare was established in the 1805 case of Justice Samuel Chase. Chase, an ardent Federalist, did and said a number of probably intemperate things on the bench, but was impeached primarily because President Jefferson and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives disliked his politics and wanted to remove him and replace him with one of their own. The Senate acquitted Chase, a result said to establish that impeachment should not be employed as a partisan weapon, particularly against the judiciary.

L.J. 905, 921 (1999). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moreover, the principle that the limitation of impeachment to ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' was intended to preclude Congress from seeking to control Executive policy through removal or its threat extends beyond the President to his principal Cabinet officers. As Raoul Berger, the other great impeachment scholar of the 1970's, concluded: ``In setting up an independent President who was to serve for a term, and in making Cabinet officers a part of the Executive branch, the Framers surely were aware that a mere vote of no confidence could not, as in England, topple a Secretary. *** It was because the separation of powers left no room for removal by a vote of no confidence that impeachment was adopted as a safety valve, a security against an oppressive or corrupt President and his sheltered ministers.''\13\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ RAOUL BERGER, IMPEACHMENT: THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS 98 (1973). During the first impeachment of President Donald Trump, his defenders vehemently endorsed the ancient principle that impeachment ought not be based on ordinary policy disagreements between a Presidential administration and Congress. As John Malcom of the --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Heritage Foundation wrote: ``The impeachment process is not intended to serve as a partisan political weapon. It is to apply to those who are unfit for office, not those who are merely incompetent or disagreeable. Its purpose is to address serious misconduct, not to settle policy disputes.''\14\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \14\ John Malcolm, Impeaching Donald Trump: A Game of Political High Stakes Poker, The Heritage Foundation (Oct. 8, 2019), https:// www.heritage.org/political-process/commentary/impeaching-donald-trump- game-political-high-stakes-poker. See also, Andrew C McCarthy, Trump vs. the `Policy Community': We resolve policy disputes by elections, not impeachments, NATIONAL REVIEW (November 12, 2019), https:// www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/trump-vs-the-policy-community/; Jordan Sekulow, Impeachment 101: Policy Disagreements & ``Whistleblowers,'' ACLJ (November 26, 2019), https://aclj.org/public-policy/impeachment- 101-policy-disagreements-whistleblowers (``Policy disagreements are not a case for impeachment.''). The President's defenders got the principle exactly right. Indeed, that principle rests not merely on the text of the Constitution, the original understanding of that document's text, and lengthy American precedent, but on important considerations relating to the proper and efficacious conduct of public business in our tripartite national Government. The Framers adopted impeachment because they recognized that some mechanism other than elections might be needed to remove officials in extraordinary cases of egregious misconduct amounting to, in George Mason's phrase, ``great and dangerous offenses.'' But because they wanted none of the three co-equal branches to exercise undue influence over the other, they were, as noted, equally determined to avoid making impeachment a means by which Congress could subordinate the Presidency to its will. Impeachment, conviction, and removal of the President over policy disagreements, however heated, would produce just such subordination. Impeachment of a subordinate Executive branch official over policy differences is even less desirable. The purpose of impeachment is to remove an official whose continuance in office would pose an on-going risk of really serious harm to the Governmental body in which he or she serves, to the Nation's vital interests, or to the Constitutional order itself. Implicit in that purpose is the limitation that impeachment should not be considered if removal of the particular officer would effect no material change. For example, removal of a corrupt judge stops further corrupt acts by that judge, and removal of a law-breaking autocratic President can prevent incipient tyranny. By contrast, removing a Cabinet Secretary because one disapproves of the policy he is pursuing at the behest of his Constitutional superior, the President, changes nothing (other than the personal fortunes of the Secretary) because the President remains in office and in charge of policy.\15\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ Moreover, when, as is now the case, the Senate is controlled by the President's party, there is no practical obstacle to replacement of the impeached official with a successor equally committed to the President's policy priorities and approaches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Put simply, on one hand, even if successfully impeaching and removing a Cabinet officer could change the policy of a Presidential administration, using impeachment for that purpose would be contrary to America's Constitutional design. On the other hand, given that removing a Cabinet Secretary is profoundly unlikely to change policy, such an impeachment would almost certainly be futile. Adding to the essential futility of a policy-based impeachment, the Framers made successful impeachment very difficult. Not only did they adopt language that, properly construed, limits impeachable offenses to extreme cases and great offenses, but they required a two-thirds majority for conviction in the Senate. If there is no serious prospect that the Senate will convict an official whose impeachment is in contemplation, the House ought to have the most compelling justification for embarking on an impeachment inquiry. Otherwise, the scarce legislative resources of the House will be expended on an inevitably contentious battle that cannot produce any practical result and will serve no public end. Other Grounds for Impeachment? It may be that Secretary Mayorkas's critics will disavow any intention of impeaching him because they disagree with the policies of the Biden administration. But if so, on what proper Constitutional ground might the Secretary's impeachment be based? ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is a specialized Constitutional term of art that does not mean what it seems to mean. During President Trump's first impeachment proceeding, his defenders insisted that crime or perhaps ``crime-like'' conduct was necessary, or at the least that there must be a violation of ``established law.''\16\ As a Constitutional matter, they were incorrect. No indictable criminal offense is necessary.\17\ Nor indeed must there be a statutory violation or transgression of a specific judge-made rule.\18\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \16\ Trial Memorandum of Pres. Donald J. Trump 81-84 (Jan. 20, 2020), Proceedings of the U.S. Senate in Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump, Part. III. \17\ Frank O. Bowman, III, Constitutional Crabgrass: President Trump's Defenders Distort the Impeachment Clause, Just Security (Jan. 24, 2020), https://www.justsecurity.org/68240/constitutional-crabgrass- president-trump-defenders-distort-the-impeachment-clauses-frank-bowman- high-crimes-misdemeanors/. \18\ As Justice Joseph Story observed in Section 797 of his 1833 treatise Commentaries on the Constitution, ``no previous statute is necessary to authorize an impeachment for any official misconduct.'' See also, BOWMAN, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, supra note 3, at 352-53. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- However, President Trump's defenders were right at least in emphasizing that impeachable ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must be matters of grave public importance and involve misconduct of a magnitude akin to the commission of a very serious crime. Many commentators have concluded that impeachable offenses ought to be of the magnitude of a serious criminal offense by applying the interpretive maxim ejusdem generis to the whole phrase ``Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The fancy Latin means no more than that later words in a series should be read in relation to the early ones. In this case, impeachable ``other high crimes and misdemeanors'' should be similar in type and severity to treason and bribery. As Charles Black wrote: ``The catch in applying this ejusdem generis rule is the difficulty (sometimes) of correctly pinning down the `kind' to which the specific items belong. In the present case, however, the `kind' to which `treason' and `bribery' belong is rather readily identifiable. They are offenses (1) which are extremely serious, (2) which in some way corrupt or subvert the political and Governmental process, and (3) which are plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor, or to a good citizen, regardless of words on the statute books.''\19\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ BLACK AND BOBBITT, supra note 7, at 34. President Trump's defenders were also correct in observing that previous impeachments, particularly of Presidents, have tended to involve conduct that at least might be charged as a serious crime. The reason for that historical trend is plain enough. As Black put it, ``The fact that  act is also criminal helps, even if it is not essential, because a general societal view of wrongness, and sometimes of seriousness, is, in such a case, publicly and authoritatively recorded.''\20\ In short, a provable violation of law is useful in demonstrating the seriousness of alleged misconduct. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \20\ BLACK AND BOBBITT, supra note 7, at 38. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In sum, the foundational requirement for impeachable ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is that they must be of extraordinary seriousness and ought to be of a type that corrupts or subverts governmental processes or the Constitutional order. In the United States, the types of behavior most commonly found to meet this basic requirement have been official corruption; abuse of power; betrayal of the Nation's foreign policy interests; and subversion of the Constitution. There is no contention of which I am aware that Secretary Mayorkas has engaged in official corruption of any kind, betrayed the Nation's foreign policy interests, or subverted the Constitutional order. I can imagine that those who disagree with the Secretary's actions as head of the Department of Homeland Security implementing the policy priorities of President Biden, or with his exercise of the discretionary authority of his office in aid of implementing those priorities, might mischaracterize the Secretary's official conduct as an ``abuse of power.'' However, long precedent establishes that impeachable abuse of power involves employing the powers of one's office for illegal or illegitimate ends--particularly to gain personal political or financial advantage, to benefit one's political allies, friends, or relations, or to injure one's personal or political enemies--and especially when the abusive exercise of official power threatens to undermine Constitutional values such as electoral democracy, or in the present case, the separation of powers.\21\ Following the policy directives of one's elected superior in pursuit of that superior's policy aims is simply not an impeachable abuse of power. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ See generally, BOWMAN, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, supra note 3, at 38, 105-07, 192-94, 331-32, 342-46, 353-54, 405-08. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Impeachment for personal incapacity: It also has been argued, although there is less consensus on the point, that ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' can reach extraordinary instances of professional incapacity expressed in failures to perform one's official responsibilities through extreme incompetence, neglect of duty, or official malpractice. In principle, this must be so at least in extreme cases. As Charles Black famously observed 50 years ago, if the President were to move to Saudi Arabia so he could have 4 wives and proposed to perform his duties henceforth exclusively by phone and wireless communication, that would necessarily be impeachable (not because of the 4 wives, perhaps, but because he could not properly fulfill many of his Constitutional responsibilities). Despite the theoretical availability of impeachment based on allegations of extreme professional incapacity, the foundational requirement of extraordinary seriousness and corruption or subversion of Governmental processes or the Constitutional order remains. In part for that reason and in part because other and easier remedies exist, actual instances of impeachment in the United States for personal incapacity or extraordinarily bad professional performance are vanishingly rare. The only two cases that arguably fit this category are those of U.S. District Judges John Pickering of New Hampshire (1803) and Mark H. Delahay of Kansas (1873). Pickering was impeached, convicted, and removed essentially for being both alcoholic and insane. Delahay was impeached primarily because his ``personal habits''--being habitually drunk on the bench--made him unfit for office, and he resigned before formal impeachment proceedings against him could be concluded.\22\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ Id. at 132-135. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- No Executive branch official has ever been impeached for personal incapacity. The only Cabinet officer ever impeached was William Belknap, President Ulysses Grant's Secretary of War, charged in 1876 with corruptly selling the post of trader at Fort Sill, Oklahoma Territory. Belknap's singular case illustrates two important points. First, he was impeached for ordinary tawdry corruption. No Cabinet officer has ever been impeached for incapacity or radically poor official performance. The obvious reason is that any Cabinet officer whose performance is really so egregiously deficient as to border on the impeachable will simply be dismissed by the President. Indeed, that is exactly what happened to Belknap. As soon as the allegations surfaced, President Grant fired the Secretary. But the House, at that point controlled by Democrats for the first time since the Civil War, decided to impeach Belknap anyway to cause political trouble for Grant and his Republican Party.\23\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \23\ Id. at 118-19. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second, the very singularity of the Belknap case is revealing. Only once has the House employed impeachment against a Cabinet officer for the transparent purpose of gaining partisan political advantage. And in that case, the officer really had committed impeachable corruption. The House has never impeached a Cabinet officer because it thought the officer was personally incapable or was doing a terrible job. Nor has it ever sought to categorize a Cabinet officer's faithful pursuit of Presidential policy as an impeachable dereliction. To paraphrase Charles Black's observation quoted above, until today, ``There  every reason to think that most Congressmen and Senators are aware'' that ``whatever may be the grounds for impeachment and removal, dislike of a President's policy is definitely not one of them.'' In the case of Secretary Mayorkas, I am unaware of any information that would support an argument that he is personally incapable of performing his office. All public information of which I aware concerning his background, education, training, prior service, and record in his current office \24\ suggests that he is an experienced, diligent, competent administrator carrying out to the best of his ability directives of his elected superior. That one Congressional party disapproves, even disapproves vigorously, of President Biden's policies on immigration or other matters within the Secretary's purview does not make the Secretary impeachable, at least if Constitutional language, the original understanding of the founding generation, 230 years of precedent, and considerations of good government and the proper relations between the coordinate branches have any meaning. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \24\ Alejandro Mayorkas, Dept. of Homeland Security, https:// www.dhs.gov/person/alejandro-mayorkas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- alleged violations of immigration law as grounds for impeachment Perhaps in recognition of the Constitutional principles articulated above, the committee Majority seems to be attempting to cast its concerns about Secretary Mayorkas as allegations of violations of law. Most of the supposed legal violations involve debates over the extent and proper exercise of the Secretary's discretionary authority in the immigration field. Although there is pending litigation over some of the Secretary's actions,\25\ there has been, so far as I am aware, no final resolution of any of this litigation materially adverse to the positions taken by the Department of Homeland Security. The Department has both lost and won some cases in lower courts, and has in some cases succeeded in having lower court losses reversed on appeal. Critically, in the two cases that have reached the U.S. Supreme Court, the justices sided with the Department.\26\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \25\ Revealingly, the Department has been sued both by immigrant advocates who think its immigration rules and policies are too restrictive and by those, primarily Republican State attorneys general, who think the opposite. \26\ Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785 (2022) (reversing lower court decision and finding that immigration detention is not mandatory under  1225(b)(2)(A) because  1182(d)(5)(A) grants parole authority and that an administration is not obliged to adopt a return to Mexico policy if the Government lacks the capacity to detain all would-be migrants); United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (June 23, 2023) (reversing lower court decision voiding DHS guidelines for immigration enforcement and removal priorities, holding that plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge these guidelines, and emphasizing that the Secretary had long-recognized discretion over arrest and prosecution decisions as set forth in the guidelines). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As a Constitutional matter, the existence of active litigation challenging discretionary actions by a Cabinet Secretary (or indeed by a President) is no ground for impeachment. This may be even more true where, as in the present case, much of the litigation has been brought by State attorneys general of the opposite party to the President and his administration. This is particularly true when, at least to date, the positions taken by those attorneys general have not been accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court were to rule against the administration on significant questions, that is not a proper ground for impeachment.\27\ Legal disputes over the exercises of Executive authority are a commonplace in every administration. And every President wins some and loses others. If the mere existence of such disputes were impeachable, every President and every Cabinet officer would be impeachable many times over. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \27\ CASS R. SUNSTEIN, IMPEACHMENT: A CITIZEN'S GUIDE 124-25 (2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- there is, at least at present, no constitutional case for impeaching secretary mayorkas I recognize that today's hearing is only the first in a proposed series directed at determining whether grounds exist for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. However, all the arguments for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas of which I am currently aware boil down to expressions of disapproval of the Biden administration's alterations of Trump-era immigration policies coupled with claims that these alterations have produced various allegedly harmful consequences. If one believes that both legal and illegal immigration are bad for the country and ought to be dramatically constrained, then one can fairly oppose Biden's policy choices. If Members of Congress oppose this administration's policy choices, they have ample tools to express that opposition through legislation. But, at least if Congress seeks to remain true to established Constitutional law and precedent, that opposition cannot be transmuted into a case for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. Chairman Green. Thank you, Mr. Bowman. Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. This is for the three attorneys general. Do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas has failed to enforce or has subverted laws passed by the United States Congress? We will start and go left to right. Mr. Knudsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. Yes or no? Mr. Knudsen. Yes, sir. Mr. Drummond. He has failed to perform his duties and is culpably inefficient. Chairman Green. Has he failed to enforce laws passed by the U.S. Congress? Mr. Drummond. He has. Mr. Bailey. Yes, sir. He's--Secretary Mayorkas is acting in violation of the law and in violation of Constitutional order by negating Congress' appropriations authority and directives in the appropriations bill and undermining the rule of law by perverting the plain text of the statutes as it relates to the parole process and its promulgation of the circumvention rule. Chairman Green. Thank you. Do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas, again, we are going to hit the three of you, do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas has defied court orders issued by the United States courts, which I can cite if you want me to, but I am sure you are probably aware of them, do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas has defied court orders issued by the courts, Federal Courts? Mr. Knudsen. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Bailey. Yes. It should never come to having to go to court against Secretary Mayorkas because he should be following the laws enacted by this body. Chairman Green. Thank you. In testimony to Chip Roy before the House of Representatives, you saw some of the video there, the Secretary said yes to the question of whether DHS possessed operational control of the Southwest Border as defined by the Secure Fence Act. I might add, ``act'' meaning the Congress passed it. In subsequent testimony to the Senate, Secretary Mayorkas stated that no one has ever had operational control of the border and that he does not use that definition of operational control as defined by the Secure Offense act. Given these statements, do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas misled Congress while under oath in describing DHS's operational control of the border? Again, gentlemen, the three of you. Mr. Knudsen. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I do. Mr. Drummond. I believe he politicized his answer and failed to be authentic. Mr. Bailey. Yes, absolutely. Chairman Green. Attorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged in testimony to the U.S. Senate that drug cartels were exploiting the current Mayorkas policies in order to traffic humans and harmful drugs into the United States. Secretary Mayorkas on March 28, 2023, stated that he was unaware of this. Now, we, of course, informed him. Now armed with this knowledge, Mayorkas continues the same policies, in fact, doubling down with newer policies that even exacerbate the same horrible outcomes. Do you think Secretary Mayorkas is doing this with full knowledge that these cartels are exploiting his policies? Mr. Knudsen. Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt there's ample evidence out there for human trafficking and drug trafficking are increasing at an exponential level at the Southern Border. Yes. Mr. Drummond. Mr. Chairman, based on my testimony today and the facts that are well-known by the Secretary, there's a porous border that's feeding constantly illegal actors in Oklahoma. Chairman Green. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey. Yes. His unlawful behavior as it relates to the circumvention rule and subversion of the parole process exacerbate and encourage the cartels and cede control of the border to the cartels in ways unimaginable prior to these policy positions. Chairman Green. Thank you. Where impeachment is concerned, the scale is very important. How would you describe the scale or comparable size of this border crisis based on your law enforcement experience? We will start with Mr. Knudsen. Mr. Knudsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Based on my prior prosecuting experience, I can tell you since 2020, the fentanyl and human trafficking specifically--well, fentanyl and methamphetamine trafficking have increased in my State. There's no other word than meteoric. I can tell you about the first fentanyl case that I prosecuted in 2019. That was a relatively small amount by today's standards, but at the time, we thought that was a large bust, and, again, that was in 2019. Our seizure numbers from our various drug task forces, our various Federal partnerships bear that out categorically. Fentanyl in Montana is by far our largest public safety issue, and it is, it's just exploded under this administration. Our seizure numbers bear that out. Chairman Green. I am going to go ahead and sort-of interrupt my own question, because my time is running out. I know Mr. Bowman mentioned the term great and dangerous threat to the United States. I will ask the last two of you, do you feel that the hundreds of thousands who have died to fentanyl overdose, the crime that has exponentially increased, the increase in terrorist activity, you know, terrorists coming across the Southern Border, do you think it is great and dangerous, Mr. Drummond? Mr. Drummond. It is great and dangerous. We have collusion between Chinese and Mexican cartels. Chairman Green. Mr. Bailey, very quickly. Mr. Bailey. Yes, absolutely. The Missouri State Highway Patrol, a single law enforcement agency in the State of Missouri, last year seized 12,500 grams of fentanyl. That's enough to kill every Missourian. Chairman Green. Thank you and I yield. I now recognize the Ranking Member for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I have been on this committee since its inception and have served as a top Democrat since 2005. During that time, Democrats and Republicans have engaged in spirited debate over policy, both with each other and with various administrations. At the end of the day, however, we always came together to make the homeland more secure for the American people. This has been our committee's reputation and as a point of pride for me and all my Republican counterparts from Chairs and Ranking Member. Today marks a dramatic shift from the committee's record of sensible, bipartisan policy making. We used to come together to resolve policy disputes, but now Republicans are trying to use the awesome power of impeachment instead. The Constitution doesn't let us do that. The Constitution requires high crimes and misdemeanors. Professor Bowman, has Secretary Mayorkas, in your opinion, committed high crimes and misdemeanors to meet that requirement? Mr. Bowman. Based on all the information available to me, I have not found any indication that he's committed high crimes and misdemeanors, no. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Over the weekend, we observed the third anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, during which thousands of angry Trump supporters, who had whipped into a frenzy by Donald Trump, marched from the White House to the Capitol to obstruct the democratic process. Let's be clear, those individuals were acting on the orders of Donald Trump, who told them, ``We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're going to not have a country anymore.'' That night, most of us were unified in our disgust over the attack on the Capitol and the democratic process. Almost immediately, however, that unity eroded. In the end, only 10 Republicans voted to impeach Donald Trump for engaging in high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States. Professor Bowman, as a Constitutional expert, would you agree that inciting an insurrection to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power is an impeachable offense? Mr. Bowman. I do agree. I think it's notable that not only did 10 Members of this body vote to impeach Donald Trump, but when the case went to trial in the Senate, 7 Republican Members of the Senate voted for that precise proposition. There was indeed a majority for convicting Mr. Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors, albeit not the two-thirds majority that is required under the Constitution. Mr. Thompson. Yet only 10 Republicans voted to impeach Donald Trump for conduct that is clearly an impeachable offense. But today, Republicans are attempting to impeach Secretary Mayorkas where there are clearly no grounds. Mr. Chairman, this impeachment is a sham and the height of hypocrisy on the part of my colleagues across the aisle. I urge Republicans to put politics aside and get back to the work for the American people. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a solemn occasion, probably the most serious obligation we have in this committee, on this committee. The last time a Cabinet member was impeached was during the administration of Ulysses S. Grant many years ago. In my experience, though, as a deputy attorney general for criminal justice, State of Texas, as a Federal prosecutor charged with counterterrorism and national security, and as Chairman of this very committee, I have never seen this border more out of control. Mayorkas took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. In my judgment, he has violated that oath. Federal law provides the Government detain and remove aliens convicted of crimes and those who are issued removal orders by immigration courts. This is the very issue that my State took up on appeal to the Supreme Court. He has violated this. On Day 1, he rescinded Remain in Mexico Migrant Protection Protocol, direct cause and effect, opening the floodgates. I marked that provision up in my committee, Foreign Affairs. It's now part of H.R. 2. But he took that power away from his law enforcement officers. I have to quote, I don't quote former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan very often, but she said, ``For the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.'' Let's look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. Eight million encounters under this administration; 2.3 aliens in the interior of the United States with no legal status, enough to fill up 13 States. Just last month, we had over 300,000 trying to get into the United States. Over 300 on the terror watch list have gotten into the United States. When I chaired this committee, that was a big red flag and the FBI director said so when he testified as well. Over 200,000 Americans have died from fentanyl. I personally went to a funeral last Saturday. One of my children's friends died from Xanax laced with fentanyl. Two hundred thousand Americans. That is more than triple the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam War to put that into perspective. The Secretary has an emboldened a criminal enterprise and the biggest human trafficking scheme in my lifetime. He terminated MPP. Chief Ortiz noted that had a direct cause and effect. When Mayorkas went down to the border, they turned their backs on him because, ``Sir, you have turned your back on us.'' My State has spent almost $14 billion just this cycle. We have allocated $9.6 billion to Operation Lone Star. My Governor bussed illegals to sanctuary cities and States around the country to showcase what we are experiencing and you are as well in your States every single day. The damage was clear. The Supreme Court did note the damage, but said that this had to be resolved outside the courts. In other words, they said that Congress had to address this either through appropriations oversight and, in Sam Alito's decision, yes, through impeachment. This is the legal justification for these proceedings. The Founders believed impeachable offenses included corrupt administration, neglect of duty, and official misconduct. At the Constitutional Convention, they said this. Alexander Hamilton asserted abuse or violation of public trust was impeachable. Justice Story, Supreme Court, public office is a public trust, and a violation of public trust is sufficient. I find this to be a profound violation of public trust. Alexander Hamilton stated in Federalist Paper 65, ``The subjects of impeachment are a nature which may be denounced political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to society itself.'' My God, what about the injuries done to society that we have seen? To our three illustrious attorneys general, please tell me the injuries done to your societies back home, and do you think this Secretary merits and that impeachment is warranted in this case? Mr. Knudsen. Thank you, Representative. I think the most powerful statistic I can give you from my State is our confirmed State crime lab fentanyl overdose death rate. Since 2019, Montana's confirmed fentanyl overdose deaths have increased 1,700 percent. Congressman, I think that is the absolute strongest indicator. We know where these drugs are coming from. It's not a political statement of mine, it's not an opinion of mine to say that 100 percent of that fentanyl came from the Mexican drug cartels. We know that to be true. We get that from our Federal partners in the DEA. We get that from all of our drug task forces, all the law enforcement agencies that are under my purview. Mr. McCaul. Just real quickly, General Drummond and Bailey, just very quickly. Mr. Drummond. We have witnessed a mass collusion between Chinese nationals coming through the Southern Border in concert with Mexican cartels. Mr. Bailey. Fifteen hundred fentanyl deaths, 43 children dead from accidental poisoning from exposure to fentanyl, $114 million borne by taxpayers in increased health care costs. Mr. McCaul. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, the gentlelady from Texas, for her 5 minutes of questions. Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for yielding. I almost don't know where to start and certainly will find the 5 minutes to be underwhelming in terms of the time that I need. I do want to express my solemnity and humbleness and expression of appreciation for having the honor of serving on this committee even in the midst of the horrific 9/11. It seems that this committee always rises to the occasion to be the problem solvers. I clearly am someone who has lived the immigration story coming from Texas. I would certainly have a different view than my friend and colleague who has just spoken about the actions that have been taken as children and families have been manipulated as if they are inhuman. I do think that one of the highest callings of this committee is, in fact, to do the bidding of solving the Nation's immigration problems. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have, over the years, introduced comprehensive immigration reform legislation year after year after year. So I am certainly willing and able to be part of the solution for the three attorney generals, which I am a lawyer, certainly served in capacities to realize the important work that you do. But I must join in the sadness of this day; the sadness of this day because it is not Constitutionally grounded, it is not Constitutionally sound. It is not going to save any lives at all. There is nothing that you have put forward today that evidences in any way a impeachable offense by Secretary Mayorkas, the first immigrant to serve in this position. A dislike of the President's policy is not--is not--a basis for impeachment. A basis for impeachment is corruption, abuse of power, betrayal of the Nation, and that is, of course, allegations. You, as witnesses, I am sorry to say, Mr. Chairman, have borne no testimony that indicates that Secretary Mayorkas has done any of that. So I thank the Ranking Member for his earlier eloquent words on this shameful, fraudulent impeachment inquiry where we are not fixing the immigration issues that my constituents in Houston need. At the onset, I am reminded of the words of the Representative Barbara Jordan, complete difference from what I heard her quoted before. I know that she did an excellent job in trying to frame the immigration issues of years past. My predecessor represented Houston, like I do. She endorsed me; glad to say a mentor. Like her, my faith in the Constitution is whole. It is complete. It is total. I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator of the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution because the Constitution said to create a more perfect union, to instill justice. That is what this inquiry is, a diminution, a subversion, and a destruction of the Constitution of the United States. I cannot stand for that. Mr. Chairman, impeachment is one of the absolute powers Congress has to ensure against an executive who might, as James Madison explained at the Constitutional Convention, ``pervert his administration into a scheme of speculation or oppression.'' The men present in Philadelphia some 236 years ago were deliberate. They were intentional. They were exacting in their draft of the Constitution that has guided us forever. These are their words and the words of our Constitution, the legal standard by which we are solemnly consider whether to exercise this extraordinary power. Article II, section 4, guides, and I quote, ``The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for the conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' That is our standard: treason, bribery, high crimes, and misdemeanors. Professor Bowman, in your review of Congressman Green's impeachment resolution, which referred to this committee, and in your review of the various reports by committee Republicans, have you identified any actions by Secretary of Mayorkas that reached the Constitutional threshold of impeachment, treason, bribery, other high crimes and misdemeanors? Professor. Mr. Bowman. No. Ms. Jackson Lee. In all of the reports, have you seen any evidence of such, the reports you have been able to secure, or the reports that I brought your attention to? Mr. Bowman. I've seen lots of reports about arguments about policy. I've seen nothing that rises the level of an impeachable offense. Ms. Jackson Lee. So, Mr. Chairman, the Constitution is to be our guide. We must end this political stunt that seeks to impeach an officer of the United States because an extremist minority of the House of Representatives does not agree with the policies of this President or that he carries out. Let's work with these attorney generals to solve the real problems, to not incarcerate children, to separate them from their family. Treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors is our legal standard. It is clear that is the basis from which we must proceed. That is the Constitutional bar you have failed to reach. We created this book, as they say, to create a more perfect union and to establish justice. Gentlemen, you have law degrees and have taken an oath, as I have. You have taken an oath to procure the rights of your citizens. Please sit with us to establish justice for all of America, for the work you do, and for those who come to seek a better life, however they come, we may perceive in a different light, but let us do it in perceiving justice. You hurt me. You hurt my heart. You hurt what Barbara Jordan stood for. You diminished this book and these words by sitting here today to suggest that Secretary Mayorkas must be, in fact, impeached because of policies that we disagree with. May God continue to guide us in our work so that we can do what we have been assigned to do. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Higgins, the gentleman from Louisiana and the Chair of the subcommittee on the border. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My, my, my. Mr. Bowman, I wasn't even going to ask you any questions today, but I am going to give you an opportunity to clarify for the record. I do believe that according to your resume, you are a professor of Constitutional law, sir. Is that correct? Mr. Bowman. I am an emeritus professor at the Missouri School of Law. Mr. Higgins. OK. You are a smart guy. You got alphabet behind your name on your business card. So, is it your position that you are taking today as the Democrats' witness, that the Founders' intent with the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' was designed to restrict the power of impeachment to a violation of specific written statute? Is that your position? We're listening. Mr. Bowman. Yes, and---- Mr. Higgins. That is your position. OK. And you are---- Mr. Bowman. Excuse me. Excuse me, Congressman. Mr. Higgins. You said yes. It is a simple question. Mr. Bowman. No. Mr. Higgins. I am going to move on. Mr. Bowman. Excuse me, Congressman---- Mr. Higgins. It clearly was not. Mr. Bowman . The answer is no. Mr. Higgins. Reclaiming my time. It clearly was not the intention of the Founders to limit the power of Congressional impeachment over the Executive branch, to limit that to violation of written statutes. Mr. Bowman. That's quite correct, Congressman. I've written extensively on it. Mr. Higgins. Oh, well, thank you. But you just said something different, but that is all right. We appreciate you being here today, Mr. Bowman, and representing University of Missouri. I am sure it is a wonderful law school. On this committee we have carried out our investigation on Secretary Mayorkas. I sit here today to tell you we are going to impeach him. He is going to be impeached, and he should be. He is the executive in charge of the border policy for President Biden. Now, President Biden has a right as the chief executive to hire men that don't have the skill and then figure that out down the line and replace them. President Biden also has a right as a chief executive to have wild policy in mind. But the executive that sits on his Cabinet, that is in charge of actually enforcing those policies, that has the law enforcement experience to know when those policies are going to bring injury upon our country, that executive has a responsibility to advise the President that his policies are not only not working to secure the border, they are actually bringing injury upon our country. The United States Constitution is the law of the land that we swear our oath to. Secretary Mayorkas has brought generational trauma upon our country. Hundreds of thousands of American lives destroyed, hundreds of thousands dead. Millions and millions, wave upon wave of human misery coming across our Southern Border. We are losing our country down there. My God, my colleagues, you have got to recognize this. We have got to stop this arterial bleed. It is not about money. We spent less money in 2019 than we did in 2023, a lot less through DHS, and we had the border under control. It is policy that has changed. Who is driving that policy? Secretary Mayorkas. So who shall be impeached? Quite rightfully so, Secretary Mayorkas. Mr. Knudsen, from your position, sir, and I am sorry for what you and your people and your community and your State are going through. Sir, on behalf of this Congress that has been unable to take action as of yet, I am sorry for what you are going through. Do you concur with the things that I have spoken on and shared? Mr. Knudsen. I absolutely do concur, Congressman. I think this body is completely within its Constitutional and legal right to bring impeachment proceedings here. Mr. Higgins. Mr. Drummond. Mr. Drummond. I also concur. Mr. Higgins. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey. I concur. The Secretary has abdicated his official duties. He's in dereliction of duty and should be held accountable. Mr. Higgins. I appreciate all the panelists for being here today. I thank the Chairman for his leadership on this issue. He has been calm and patient and judicious in our procedure. We have laid out the case for the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas. We have promised the American people we would fulfill that somber duty, and we shall. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Payne, the gentleman from New Jersey, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, today's hearing would be a joke. Let me just put something out here in reference to fentanyl. It is something that is really damaging our country, our young people, obviously. But I remember in that 1980's when the crack epidemic was prevalent, the First Lady Nancy Reagan told folks, you know, just say no. So I think we need to incorporate that into this epidemic. Why is fentanyl killing so many of our folks? Because they are consuming it. We have to look at the demand for it as well. We know we have a problem in stopping it, and we are all hell- bent in doing that, but we also have to look at the demand. Or as Nancy Reagan said, just say no. But back to the topic at hand. As I stated, this would be a joke if the stakes weren't so high and serious for the reasons laid out by my friend Ms. Jackson Lee. I am embarrassed for my Republican colleagues. They pretend that their fraudulent impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas is about high crimes and misdemeanors. That is because they know well, as we do, that this so-called impeachment is nothing more than an extremist MAGA takeover of the committee in this Congress. Just look at who is in the driver's seat of this fraudulent impeachment. It is not the Chairman of the committee. It is not even the subcommittee Chair. It is an extreme MAGA-backed venture, who, proverbially speaking, shoved her leadership out of the driver's seat and now has the reins of the Congress and about ready to drive us all off the cliff. The Chairman can proclaim that he has led this year-long investigation into Secretary Mayorkas' leadership that led to today's proceedings, but we all know that this is false. We are here because a Member of Congress who believes the anti-Semitic conspiracy that Jewish space lasers coming down to Earth caused the deadly wildfires in California in 2018; someone who has called Black people like me slaves to the Democratic Party; a woman who believes serving this great country in the military is throwing your life away; someone who supports insurrectionists who tried to destroy American democracy; who wants to defund the FBI; and someone who mocked survivors of a tragic school shooting; a Member of Congress who believes all that has brought us here. It is not Chairman Green's impeachment resolution that was referred to. This is committing to this committee. Chairman Green has not even introduced an impeachment resolution. It is not Chairman Green's so-called investigation into Secretary Mayorkas that got us here. We had an impeachment resolution before us weeks before the Chairman's alleged investigation even concluded. Professor Bowman, do mere policy disputes between Members of Congress and a Cabinet Secretary constitute impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors? Mr. Bowman. Congressman, they do not. I think the conclusion is universal among those who have studied this question, has been so since the time of the founding that policy differences, no matter how severe, no matter how heated, are simply not grounds for impeachment. Mr. Payne. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request unanimous consent to submit an article from CBS News titled, ``Marjorie Taylor Greene backs off, forcing vote on second Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment resolution,'' dated November 30, 2023. Chairman Green. Without objection, so ordered.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene backs off forcing vote on second Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment resolution By Caitlin Yilek, Updated on: November 30, 2023/7:16 PM EST/CBS News Washington--GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia backed off plans to force a House vote on a second resolution targeting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas with impeachment, saying she received assurances from House leaders that an earlier effort will proceed at the committee level instead. House lawmakers blocked Greene's first effort to impeach Mayorkas earlier in November, instead voting to send the resolution to the Homeland Security Committee. Eight Republicans voted with all Democrats to send the motion to the panel, which is investigating Mayorkas for his handling of the situation at the border. Greene introduced her latest resolution to impeach Mayorkas on Wednesday as ``privileged,'' setting a 2-day deadline for the House to act on it. But plans to take up the resolution were shelved Thursday afternoon. Greene said she was assured by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green that the process would move forward in committee. ``There were members that were upset that we weren't going through the process. That was upsetting to them, but again, we need to be doing this, we need to move forward,'' she told reporters at the Capitol. ``And so I got guarantees, so we will move forward with impeachment.'' Greene declined to comment on the timeline for the committee to act but said, ``It's going to happen very soon.'' Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the committee, called the impeachment effort a ``political stunt.'' ``Apparently, their baseless, so-called `investigation' was just a shell game to justify a pre-determined, evidence-free impeachment over policy differences rather than any Constitutional grounds,'' he said in a statement. The Mayorkas impeachment push Greene's latest seven-page resolution accused Mayorkas of violating federal law and the Constitution by failing to ``maintain operational control of the border'' and prevent an ``invasion.'' Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who voted for the Democratic-led motion to refer the last resolution to committee, said Wednesday that Mayorkas is guilty of ``maladministration, malfeasance and neglect of duties on a truly cosmic scale.'' ``But these are not impeachable offenses,'' he said on the House floor. If Greene's impeachment push were to succeed, McClintock said he expected Democrats would move to impeach conservatives on the Supreme Court and Republican officials the next time they have the House majority. ``There will be nobody to stop them because Republicans will have now signed off on this new and unconstitutional abuse of power,'' he said. Reps. Darrell Issa of California, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina--who all voted to refer the last resolution--said earlier this month that an investigation into Mayorkas should be allowed to be completed before an impeachment vote. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said earlier this month that Greene's impeachment measure was a ``baseless attack'' that is ``completely without merit and a harmful distraction from our critical national security priorities.'' ``Every day, the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security work tirelessly to keep America safe. They need Congress to stop wasting time and do its job by funding the government, reforming our broken immigration system, reauthorizing vital tools for DHS, and passing the Administration's supplemental request to properly resource the Department's critical work to stop fentanyl and further secure our borders,'' the spokesperson said. Jaala Brown contributed reporting. Mr. Payne. In which Representative Greene is quoted as saying, ``We need to do this. We need to move forward. So I got guarantees so we will move forward with impeachment.'' With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bowman, it strikes me how much your opinion has changed in just a few years. I was--pointed out that in your 2019 book entitled High Crimes and Misdemeanors, A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump, you have this passage, ``No Congress since that time,'' referring to the impeachment of Belknap, the Cabinet person that Grant had dismissed before his impeachment, but you say, ``No Congress since that time has either moved fast enough or thought it worthwhile to actually impeach a subordinate Executive branch official. Nonetheless, the latent power to do so remains important.'' And here is the key sentence. ``Not only is it useful as a signal of legislative displeasure with administration personnel and policy, but the undoubted authority of Congress to impeach subordinate officials carries with it the associated powers of the House to investigate potentially impeachable conduct and of the Senate to try the allegations in Articles of Impeachment.'' Now, frankly, sir, I agree with you more today and not then. That is to say, I don't think pure policy differences is the basis for an impeachment. Neither is that what is happening here. It is exceedingly apt for that reason that the Majority witnesses are three State attorneys general. Gentlemen, I look forward to joining you in 2025. But let me point this out. A lot of people would say, well, American people aren't interested in hearing something about a legal case. I think they might be. Last June, two of your colleagues in Texas and in Louisiana had sued Secretary Mayorkas, saying that guidelines that he issued to his Department blatantly violated commands of Congress in statute to detain any criminal who had committed certain crimes and was released from State custody were required--the attorney general then, then the Secretary of Homeland Security later by amendment, required to detain such persons until they were deported. And persons subject to a permanent order--a final order of deportation required to be detained. Contrary to that order, Secretary Mayorkas dismantled the detainer process completely. He said that that was going to be subject to discretion. Only in cases where the Department or he deems it to imperil our national security or security from additional crime would it be done. Attorneys general sued. Here is what the Supreme Court said. You don't have standing. We can't hear from you. We can't settle this. Here is what Alito said in dissent, the Congress--to put the point simply, Congress enacted a law that requires the apprehension and detention of certain illegal aliens whose release it thought would endanger public safety. The Secretary of DHS does not agree with that categorical requirement. He prefers a more flexible policy. The Court's answer today is that the Executive's policy choice prevails unless Congress, by withholding funds, refusing to confirm Presidential nominees, threatening impeachment and removal, et cetera, can win a test of strength. In other words, Alito in defense went on and said, I don't think this is a wise decision for us to make, but that is the decision the Majority made, that if you want the law to be followed, you are going to have to impeach somebody. You are going to have to, as Justice Alito said, the Congress is going to have to go to war with the Executive. Mr. Knudsen, what about that? Isn't that right? Isn't that what the Congress is put to, to decide whether to do our duty? As the Supreme Court has said, we can't do it. It is up to the Congress. You guys have tried to do it. You have succeeded in other areas. You are continuing to sue and you are succeeding. Florida has enjoined some practices. I think the Supreme Court just granted an emergency relief from the DHS cutting Texas border barrier. What about that, Mr. Knudsen? I didn't leave you a lot of time, but I am sure you can add more wisdom in 30 seconds than I did in 2. Mr. Knudsen. I'll be brief, Congressman. Thank you for the question. Yes, I absolutely agree not only with Justice Alito's dissent, but I would point out, also, in that case that the Majority also pointed out, to your point, that Congress possesses an array of tools to analyze and influence those policies, and those are political checks for the political process. That's exactly what you're dealing with here. You folks have got an Executive versus Legislative branch war here. Mr. Bishop. So much of this, Mr. Chairman, isn't about even policy discretion that is granted to the administration. It is about square violations of law, and they cannot be remedied in court. They will either be dealt with by this Congress to vindicate the rule of law or we will surrender rule of law to a rule of man. I yield. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize---- Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman, point of order. Chairman Green. The point of order, you are recognized. Mr. Thompson. I think we all heard the colleague say he is running for another office, but that violates the rule XXIII, and I won't ask that it be taken down. I just ask that if he is going to run, just go run. Just don't run when the committee is in session. Chairman Green. The gentleman has made his point of order. I now recognize Mr. Swalwell, the gentleman from California and our Ranking Member on cybersecurity subcommittee, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Swalwell. I want to thank the attorneys general for participating today. Thank you for your service to your States. I was a prosecutor before coming to Congress. I missed that job. My father was a cop. My brothers are cops. It seems like we have got a pretty educated group of attorneys general here. Mr. Knudsen, you went to Montana Law School, right? Mr. Knudsen. Yes, Representative. Mr. Swalwell. Pretty good law school. Mr. Bailey, University of Missouri, is that right? Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. You served our country after September 11, as well. Thank you for doing that. Mr. Drummond, you went to Georgetown, is that right? Mr. Drummond. I did. Mr. Swalwell. That is a good school. I was rejected there twice for law school and then as a transfer. That is a very good school. I just want to level set where we all are on what is a crime, what is not a crime, because the three of you have offered testimony to my Republican colleagues about what is an impeachable offense, and I just want to go down the list here of some of the potential impeachable offenses that we have seen in the history of the Congress. Bribery, Mr. Knutsen, would you agree that is an impeachable offense? Mr. Knudsen. I would, Congressman. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Drummond, would you agree bribery is an impeachable offense? Mr. Drummond. I would. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bailey, would you agree bribery is an impeachable offense? Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. Same as extortion, Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Drummond, extortion? Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. How about obstruction of justice? Would you agree that is an impeachable offense, Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen. If there was a conviction, yes. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Drummond. Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. How about inciting violence against police officers? What would you say, Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen. Again, if there was a conviction of a criminal offense, I think that would certainly rise to the level. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Drummond, how about incitement of violence? Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bailey, incitement of violence? Mr. Bailey. Would need more facts to make that legal determination. I think that's a bereft of sufficient facts. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Knudsen, I just want to drill down a little bit, because you said if there was a conviction. So are you saying that Mr. Mayorkas should be convicted criminally before he could be impeached? Mr. Knudsen. Congressman, no, I'm simply speaking to your example of would inciting violence against a police officer rise to the level of an impeachable offense? My testimony was, if there was a conviction for that crime, then yes. Mr. Swalwell. OK. And obstruction of justice, you said the same thing, right? Mr. Knudsen. Correct. Mr. Swalwell. But you think for Mr. Mayorkas, he does not need a conviction to be impeached? Mr. Knudsen. Well, as this body has done in its past, I think there's certainly precedent. No, I do not believe there has to be a criminal offense. High crimes and misdemeanors, as it was understood by the Founders, as it was understood in the English common law, does not necessarily mean there has to be an actual crime committed. Mr. Swalwell. In the summer of 2019, former President Donald Trump used $300 million of taxpayer dollars to ask President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to get dirt on his potential primary political opponent, Joe Biden. He was impeached in the House for that. Should he have been impeached for that, Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen. Mr. Chairman, I'm--excuse me, Mr. Chairman, Representative, I'm not a Member of this Congress. I'm not privy to all that information. I certainly haven't seen a lot of those reports. This body chose to go forward with those proceedings, as is its purview. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Drummond. Mr. Drummond. Yes, it's outside my lane. I'm just a simple attorney general from Oklahoma. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey. I believe President Trump was acquitted of all charges, and that's beyond the purview of my testimony today. Mr. Swalwell. On January 6th, he incited and aimed a violent mob at the Capitol and 6 police officers would later lose their lives. One lost a finger. One lost an eye. The President was impeached. Ten Republicans voted for that impeachment. Mr. Knudsen, should he have been impeached for that, yes or no? Mr. Knudsen. Mr. Chairman and Representative, he was. Mr. Swalwell. OK. Mr. Drummond. Mr. Drummond. He was impeached for that. Mr. Swalwell. But should he have been? Mr. Drummond. I don't have an opinion on that issue. Mr. Swalwell. OK. Mr. Bailey, what do you think about that? Mr. Bailey. He was acquitted of those charges. Mr. Swalwell. OK. So what is interesting to me, again, I respect that you all are here, is that when you have testified to Mr. Mayorkas' conduct, and you believe pretty clearly that he can be impeached for his conduct, but when we go through pretty egregious conduct of using taxpayer dollars, of inciting and aiming a mob, having the greatest attack ever on this Congress, this Capitol, our Constitution, you don't want to comment on it at all. I think what we are really seeing from the Majority in all of this is that they are not interested in finding any solution on the border. In fact, what we have seen is that there was a 2014 deal in the Senate, bipartisan. They walked away when they were in the Majority. Speaker Johnson has said that he will refuse any additional funding for the border. Now we have witnesses who, again, want to comment only on Mayorkas, but don't want to comment on President Trump. Mr. Chairman, respectfully, I just see a party that does not want to fix, but only wants the fiction. With that, I will yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gimenez, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Gimenez. Thank you. Thank you very much. I was fascinated by my colleagues' questioning--line of questioning. Somewhere I was going to go to, maybe not as quite as eloquently as him. I am not running for attorney general or anything. Mr. Bowman, you say in your testimony, written testimony, and some of the foundational requirements for impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors is that they must be ``extraordinarily serious and ought to be of the type that corrupts or subverts Governmental processes or the Constitutional order.'' I find that, you know, I underlined that specifically because I wanted to ask you, do you believe that the death of 200,000 Americans from fentanyl overdoses, is that extraordinarily serious? Mr. Bowman. It's certainly a serious matter and one that has to be addressed by this body by exercising its Constitutional legislative powers to work with the Executive branch to address the policy. The problem that you have that you're confronting here---- Mr. Gimenez. That is good. I am going to reclaim my time now. You have answered the question. Thank you very much. OK. That ``ought to be of the type that corrupts or subverts Governmental processes or the Constitutional order.'' Now, I am not a Constitutional scholar, et cetera, but I do believe that the Constitution was set up to have three distinct branches of government. You have Legislative, you have Judicial, and then you have the administrative branch. The Founding Fathers wanted a balance of power. Is that what you get from the Constitution and the Founding Fathers, what they wanted to do, the balance of power, Mr. Bowman? Mr. Bowman. Indeed. Mr. Gimenez. OK. So it is up to the Legislative branch to actually create the laws, and the will of Congress is supposed to be then carried out by the Administrative branch. Am I off on that or is that what the Founding Fathers thought should have happened? Mr. Bowman. In general, yes. Mr. Gimenez. OK. So we have this issue of policy versus law. If I get you right, you believe that this is a question of policy, but I don't believe it is a question of policy. I believe it is actually a question of violating the law. The law clearly states that people coming into the United States or people seeking asylum in the United States, two things happen to them: they are either detained here in country or they are detained in another country waiting the outcome of their asylum hearing. That is what the law says. The law also says that the Executive branch actually has the right to parole, but on a case-by-case basis, not mass parole. So the Mayorkas administration, the Biden-Mayorkas administration, is actually violating both. They are not detaining people coming in or they are not keeping them in a third country, and they are not detained in the United States, and they are also allowing mass parole, which violates the clear intent of Congress. Is it your opinion that this is a policy issue and that the Biden administration has the right to clearly subvert the will of Congress? Mr. Bowman. My opinion, Congressman, is that disputes over the exercise of discretion by the Secretary are difficult. They're being resolved in the courts. I must say that those disputes have not yet been finalized. Indeed, the only cases involving those disputes that have made up to the Supreme Court have resulted in rulings in favor of the Secretary and of the President. Essentially, this is an on-going legal and policy dispute. It is not, therefore, the kind of thing for which impeachment should be used. Mr. Gimenez. Well, I believe that, you know, we are at a crossroads here because I do believe that we, Congress, have given way too much leeway to the administrative branch, if that is the case. This is clearly, the intent of Congress was, people coming to the border need to either stay in another country or they need to be detained, and it clearly was that parole was to be done on a case-by-case basis. Now, I don't believe that there is an issue of policy. It is an issue of violating the law. That violation of the law has actually led to mass suffering in the United States, 200,000 Americans dying because of fentanyl overdose. I disagree with my colleague on the other side that says it is a question of voluntarily stopping using drugs. Actually, a lot of these deaths are caused by people they don't even know they are taking fentanyl. They are thinking they are taking something else and it is laced with fentanyl. So, you know, if we are down to that where every single time that the administration decides to violate the law that we have to impeach somebody, I guess then we need to impeach somebody. So with that, you know, I yield my time back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Correa. Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I kind-of agree with Mr. Gimenez and some of the comments he made. Before I get into my presentation, I would like to present an article submitted for the record titled, ``2023 Year in Review: Secretary Mayorkas Champions Departmentwide Efforts to Save Lives and Prepare for the 21st Century Security Challenges.'' Chairman Green. Without objection, so moved.  2023 Year in Review: Secretary Mayorkas Champions Department-Wide Efforts to Save Lives and Prepare for 21st Century Security Challenges Release Date: January 9, 2024 DHS priorities to include efforts to harness artificial intelligence technology, mitigate cybersecurity threats, and combat targeted violence and terrorism WASHINGTON.--Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reflect on the progress made in 2023 to improve cohesion, transparency, and innovation in the work of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the many and varied threats facing the homeland in 2023. The United States faced a range of challenges last year, including damaging natural disasters, strategic competition and aggression from nation-states, historic growth in global migration, the growing sophistication of transnational organized crime, large scale cyber intrusions, and an increased threat of targeted violence--all of which are expected to continue or intensify in the coming years. DHS's significant investments in its workforce, innovation, and partnerships throughout 2023 have laid the groundwork for taking on these challenges of the decades ahead. ``Our communities are safer and more resilient, our economy is more secure, and our Government is more prepared thanks to the unprecedented work of the DHS workforce,'' said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. ``From managing a historic level of global migration, to helping secure travel for a record number of Americans, rescuing children from on-line sexual exploitation, and leading operations that kept fentanyl off our streets, DHS took dramatic steps this past year to enhance the security and readiness of our Nation. That progress will continue into 2024 as we enhance collaboration with our partners in and outside of Government and utilize new strategies, including responsibly harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence, to strengthen our Nation's safety, security, and resilience.'' In 2023, the DHS workforce: Enhanced the speed and efficiency of vetting and processing noncitizens seeking to enter the United States with the same level of security and integrity of our processing and without additional resources from Congress. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was able to process 4 to 5 times as many individuals at select ports of entry in 2023 than we could a decade ago. Seized over 43,000 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 2023 and 5,500 pounds in the first 2 months of fiscal year 2024, enough to kill every American 33 times over. DHS stopped more fentanyl and arrested more drug traffickers in the last 2 years than the previous 5 years combined. Helped to identify or rescue over 1,170 child victims of on- line sexual exploitation or abuse. Responded to 25 natural disasters that have individually each accounted for over a billion dollars in damage, the most billion-dollar disasters in FEMA's (Federal Emergency Management Agency) history. Ensured the safety and security of nearly 850 million travelers amid a record-setting year of air travel and prevented more than 6,500 firearms from entering the secure areas of airports and onboard aircraft, more than any previous year. In his first State of Homeland Security address delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations in April 2023, Secretary Mayorkas spoke of emerging homeland security challenges: ``Revolutionizing technological innovations, growing political and economic instability, widening wealth inequality, a rapidly changing climate, increasingly aggressive nation-states, emerging infectious diseases, and other forces are transforming the global landscape, challenging and sometimes rendering moot a nation's borders, and bringing national and international threats to any community's doorstep.'' In 2023, the Department took steps to address these challenges, including enhancing efforts to prevent terrorism and targeted violence, preparing for new security challenges presented by emerging technologies like AI, and helping communities build resiliency to prepare for natural disasters and cybersecurity incidents. DHS led whole-of-Government efforts to combat fentanyl. DHS also took steps to modernize the application and enforcement of our immigration laws. All the while, the Department invested in its dedicated workforce to ensure they have the tools they need to deliver on our critical mission. protected americans from evolving threats of terrorism and targeted violence DHS continues to transform the way it addresses the most pressing security challenges facing Americans today and for years to come. The Department is agile and vigilant in addressing the threats of today and anticipating the challenges we may face in the days ahead. Released publicly for the first time the annual Homeland Threat Assessment. This public report on terrorism and targeted violence threats is giving our partners across State, local, Tribal, and Territorial governments, along with campuses and the private and non-profit sectors, important information to make better-informed decisions to prepare for security challenges. Going forward, the annual Homeland Threat Assessment will serve as a regular mechanism for describing the prevailing terrorism threat level. Distributed DHS resources and our latest threat assessments to enhance the security of faith-based organizations across the country through more than 100 direct engagements with faith leaders amidst the on-going Middle East conflict. DHS is regularly communicating with over 2,000 State, local, Tribal, Territorial, and campus law enforcement officials and with the leadership of all National-level law enforcement associations and, through the DHS Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, is amplifying security resources to over 65,000 faith partners. Enhanced security in local communities and at nonprofit organizations and places of worship through Federal grants. DHS provided $2 billion to help State, local, Tribal, Territorial, campus officials, and nonprofit organizations prepare for, prevent, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism. This includes 40 urban areas, including four additional cities for receiving grants for the first time: Austin, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Jacksonville, Florida; and Nashville, Tennessee. This also includes $305 million in Nonprofit Security Grants to more than 2,200 faith-based and other nonprofit organizations to support target hardening and other physical security enhancements. Helped law enforcement better understand, recognize, prepare for, prevent, and respond to terrorist activity by increasing law enforcement terrorism prevention funding within the Homeland Security Grant Program from 25 percent to 35 percent, a $103 million increase over the statutory minimum. Expanded access to Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) grants. The TVTP Grant Program provides resources to State, local, Tribal, and Territorial governments, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education to strengthen or enhance existing capabilities to prevent terrorism or targeted violence or establish them where they do not exist. In fiscal year 2023, DHS awarded $20 million to 34 entities. As a result of extensive outreach efforts, a larger percentage of applications devoted to underserved populations were accepted in 2023 (48 percent) versus 2022 (25 percent). Underserved populations represented in this cohort include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and nongovernmental organizations serving Native American, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and rural communities. Equipped over 28,000 State and local law enforcement and government officials, educators, mental health professionals, faith-based leaders, and workplace security managers across the country to more readily identify threats and strengthen public safety. This was achieved through over 280 trainings and briefings led by the United States Secret Service's (USSS) National Threat Assessment Center. Improved access to Federal resources by launching the Prevention Resource Finder in March 2023 in collaboration with more than a dozen Federal partners. The on-line guide is a comprehensive repository of Federal resources available to help community leaders understand, mitigate, and protect themselves from targeted violence and terrorism. Helped faith-based organizations and communities enhance their security by releasing the first-ever Physical Security Performance Goals for Faith-Based Communities. This collection of cost-effective actions specifically tailored for faith-based organizations and communities can be implemented to reduce risk without sacrificing accessibility. Responded to an increase in bomb threats impacting campuses and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, by providing information, trainings, and resources. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security's (CISA) Office for Bombing Prevention hosted 27 virtual courses, trained over 1,250 participants, and provided over 1,500 bomb threat planning and response products. The DHS Office for State and Local Law Enforcement also increased its efforts to share of resources and timely, relevant, and actionable information to campus law enforcement. Ensured the safety of millions of Americans at significant events like the Super Bowl and the Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix. This included 18 Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) events--including first-ever designations for the Chicago NASCAR Street Race, the NFL Draft, and the Boston Marathon--and three National Special Security Events (NSSE). The Federal Protective Service (FPS) and CBP also worked collaboratively with law enforcement partners at the Federal, State, and local level to provide Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) detection and deterrence at major U.S. events. There was a 22 percent increase in C-UAS coverage at SEAR events in 2023. Secured unprecedented Presidential visits for President Biden to Ukraine and Israel in 2023, the first trips a U.S. President has taken to active war zones not controlled by the U.S. military. U.S. Secret Service led the planning and coordination of these high-profile visits of enormous magnitude, with surgical precision and on a short time line. During both visits, the U.S. Secret Service along with our partners played a key role in allowing world leaders to meet face-to-face despite the dangerous conditions. Undertook several measures in 2023 to improve security effectiveness and efficiency as well as to enhance the passenger experience. Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) PreCheckTM experienced a record-breaking enrollment year enrolling almost 4 million Americans, bringing the total enrolled to 18 million or one-third of all U.S. travelers. The majority of TSA PreCheckTM applicants receive their Known Traveler Number in 3 to 5 days. Led a year-long investigation through Homeland Security Investigations' (HSI) Washington, DC Field Office and HSI's War Crimes Center--with the Department of Justice and FBI--that resulted in the Justice Department charging 4 Russian soldiers with war crimes--including torture, inhuman treatment, and unlawful confinement of a U.S. national in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. These charges were the first of their kind in U.S. history. Ensured the safety and security of more than 1 million Federal employees and visitors to thousands of Federal facilities across the Nation, including the protection of individuals participating in First Amendment-protected activities on or near Federal facilities. Convened a new Homeland Intelligence Experts Group, whose members support the Department's vital work to protect our country by independently providing advice and perspectives on intelligence and national security efforts to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Counterterrorism Coordinator. Members include former senior intelligence officials, journalists, and prominent human rights and civil liberties advocates. Expanded the Visa Waiver Program to include Israel, a step which further strengthens the security, economic, and people- to-people ties between the United States and Israel. All participants in the Visa Waiver Program meet strict requirements related to counterterrorism, law enforcement, immigration enforcement, document security, and border management. prepared the country for new security challenges presented by emerging technology The Department is committed to keeping Americans safe from the devastating effects of cyber crimes and protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure from attacks is a core Departmental mission. This past year, the Department took significant steps both to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Central to all this work is strengthening our partnerships with the private sector, nonprofits, and all levels of government to ensure they are prepared for the threats they face. Took steps to improve the cybersecurity of our infrastructure, leveraging our authorities and partnerships across the public and private sectors: Worked in collaboration with representatives from the cities of San Jose, New York City, Chattanooga, and Memphis, along with Colorado State University, to issue the first Connected Community Governance guide to help State, local, Tribal, and Territorial leaders set a clear vision for their connected community, define smart service areas, articulate metrics of performance, and address cybersecurity risk and privacy needs. Developed a ransomware notification pilot program that actively warns vulnerable entities of potential attacks. The program issued over 1,000 notifications this past year, including at least 187 to international entities across 24 countries. Streamlined and harmonized the reporting of cyber incidents to better protect the Nation's critical infrastructure and improve the private sector's ability to report incidents through the Cyber Incident Reporting Council. Enhanced transportation security by issuing new cybersecurity requirements for certain TSA-regulated airport, air carriers, and air cargo operators that are increasing the cybersecurity resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure. TSA also issued performance-based cybersecurity regulations to pipeline companies and railroad operators. Built resiliency across our cyber infrastructure: Strengthened cybersecurity controls and tools for State and local governments and civil society organizations following the Cyber Safety Review Board's review of vulnerabilities that threat actor groups such as Lapsus$ exploited to infiltrate dozens of well-resourced organizations. As a result of the CSRB's work, the Federal Communications Commission issued new rules to combat SIM swapping. Awarded nearly $375 million in grant funding to State, local, Tribal, and Territorial communities to improve their cyber resilience. DHS doubled funding for this program in fiscal year 2023. Launched the ``Shields Ready'' awareness campaign to encourage the critical infrastructure community to focus on strengthening resilience. State and local governments as well as critical infrastructure operators can also use CISA's new Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework to better identify critical infrastructure, assess related risks, and develop and implement resilience solutions. Enhanced information sharing and collaboration internationally to improve our cybersecurity: Ensured greater collaboration on cybersecurity trainings and vulnerability scans; workshops on topics such as cyber hygiene threat mitigation, and public-private partnerships; aviation and maritime port cybersecurity assessments; cyber crime and cyber law enforcement trainings; and the exploration of additional mechanisms for enhanced information sharing and collaboration across 21 Western Hemisphere nations. This is the first-ever agreement of its kind. Developed Guidelines for Secure AI System Development in close collaboration with the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre. This will help developers of any systems that use AI make informed cybersecurity decisions at every stage of the development process. The guidelines were formulated in cooperation with 21 other agencies and ministries from across the world--including all members of the Group of 7 (G7) major industrial economies--and are the first of their kind to be agreed to globally. Worked with the Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) signed on an updated Memorandum of Cooperation on Cybersecurity. Throughout 2023, DHS and METI engaged on areas identified within the agreement such as vulnerability management and public-private partnerships. Harnessed the opportunity of responsible AI use to protect the homeland: Established the Department's first AI Task Force and named its first chief AI officer. The Task Force is working across the DHS mission to identify areas where AI can improve its work. For instance, it is working to enhance the integrity of our supply chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to improve cargo screening, the identification of imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management. The Task Force is also charged with using AI to better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of precursor chemicals around the world, and disrupt key nodes in criminal networks. Last year alone, machine learning models that help CBP officers determine which suspicious vehicles and passengers to refer to secondary screening have led to 240 seizures, which include thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl. Supported law enforcement officers' use of AI to investigate heinous crimes. DHS successfully completed Operation Renewed Hope, which focused on protecting children from sexual abuse on-line. The use of new AI technology allowed DHS to identify more than 300 victims of sexual exploitation and also identify perpetrators. Ensured DHS can deliver on its mission by bolstering our workforce with the best cybersecurity talent. DHS onboarded more than 150 DHS Cybersecurity Service employees and will continue to expand the Cyber Talent Management System to additional components to improve recruitment and retention in the cybersecurity workforce. Protected our elections. CISA worked in close coordination with the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors to host ``Tabletop the Vote,'' the Nation's largest annual election security exercise, to prepare for a range of hypothetical scenarios affecting election operations. Over 1,300 people from 45 States, 12 Federal agencies, and 13 private-sector partners worked together to address the exercise scenario. Last year, CISA established Election Security Advisor positions in CISA's ten regions to work to strengthen front-line support to the election community. helped keep our nation competitive and grow our economy Securing our critical infrastructure is fundamental to staying competitive in a 21st Century economy. DHS is committed to supporting strong economic growth and meeting the labor demand in the United States, while strengthening worker protections for both American and foreign workers. Facilitated lawful international travel and trade at our Nation's airports, seaports, and land ports of entry. With the installation of 11 new Non-Intrusive Inspection systems at six ports of entry, CBP is increasing our ability to scan cargo in rail and trucks and prevent illicit drugs, unreported currency, guns and ammunition, and people from being smuggled into the country. Took steps to attract and retain talented researchers and professionals who work on AI and other critical emerging technologies by streamlining processing times of petitions and applications for noncitizens who seek to work, study, or conduct research in the United States. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published a notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the H-1B specialty occupation worker program and clarified guidance on evidence for EB-1 applications. Helped American businesses that rely on seasonal and temporary workers better plan for their workforce needs by providing early notice of doubling the number of H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas available in fiscal year 2024 from 66,000 to 130,000. American businesses in industries such as hospitality and tourism, landscaping, seafood processing, and more turn to seasonal or other temporary workers in the H-2B program to help them meet demand from consumers and allow our economy to continue to thrive. Supported communities receiving migrants by speeding Employment Authorization Document (EAD) processing times from an average of 90 to 30 days for applicants paroled through new processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans or after scheduling a CBP One appointment. USCIS also announced that certain categories of EADs would be valid for 5 years, a tremendous efficiency for individuals and the agency. USCIS provided intake and biometric collection at sites where States and cities are assisting certain noncitizens who had not yet filed a work permit application and sent more than 1.6 million texts and emails to noncitizens who are work-eligible but who have yet to apply for an EAD in a first-of-its-kind national campaign. Took steps toward eliminating the use of forced labor practices in the U.S. supply chain by ramping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). CBP stopped 4,033 shipments of goods in fiscal year 2023 valued at approximately $1.44 billion suspected to have been made wholly or in part by People's Republic of China (PRC)-based companies that use forced labor. Ten new PRC-based entities were added to the list of banned companies in 2023. Held unscrupulous employers accountable by creating a streamlined and expedited deferred action request process to better protect noncitizen workers who are victims of, or witnesses to, the violation of labor rights. This helps protect the American labor market, the conditions of the American worksite, and the dignity of the workers who power our economy. Over 2,000 case requests have been made since this policy was put in place. Took steps to ensure the security of the U.S. supply chain by establishing the Supply Chain Resilience Center (SCRC). The SCRC is starting to analyze vulnerabilities and conducting scenario planning with private-sector stakeholders to help mitigate supply chain disruptions, ensure reliable and efficient deliveries of goods and services, and lower costs for the American people. HSI also established the Government Supply Chain Investigations Unit, a dedicated unit to facilitate more comprehensive supply chain risk management with increased resources to identify, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations infiltrating our supply chain with counterfeit or substandard goods. Helped protect U.S. businesses by seizing over 19,000 shipments containing products that infringe on U.S. trademarks or copyrights, or other intellectual property rights violations. Those shipments accounted for a total of nearly 23 million counterfeit items. If the seized products were genuine, their total Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price would be valued at $2.4 billion. Improved security effectiveness and efficiency and enhanced the passenger experience by deploying new technology at airport security checkpoints. This includes more than 2,000 Credential Authentication Technology units to improve identity verification at over 200 locations and 243 Computed Tomography X-ray scanners that produce high-quality 3D images of carry-on baggage while also reducing the need to touch or manually check bags. continued to modernize our immigration system by enforcing our laws and respecting our values The Biden-Harris administration inherited a badly broken immigration system that Congress has not fixed in decades. Despite the challenges, DHS is executing a comprehensive strategy to secure our borders and manage irregular migration in a safe, orderly, and humane way, including the transition from the Title 42 public health order to full processing under Title 8. By expanding lawful pathways, strengthening enforcement of our immigration laws, and leveraging innovation and modernization, we are laying the groundwork for a 21st Century immigration system and providing unprecedented support for our workforce. We continue to call on Congress to provide the sustained resources and long-term modernization of the immigration and asylum system that is needed. Expanded lawful pathways to reduce irregular migration and ensure safe, orderly, and humane management of our borders and our immigration system: Interviewed over 100,000 refugee applicants in fiscal year 2023--more than double the previous fiscal year-- contributing to the resettlement of over 60,000 refugees from abroad. Implemented new humanitarian parole processes for Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians that helped reduce irregular migration, denying smugglers the opportunity to exploit over 300,000 individuals from these countries. Established new family reunification parole processes for Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia, with updated family reunification parole processes for Cuba and Haiti. Over 3,000 paroles have been granted under this policy. Mobilized our partners throughout the hemisphere to work together under the framework of the Los Angeles Declaration to expand lawful pathways and reduce irregular migration. In 2023, that work included expediting refugee processing times through the establishment of Safe Mobility Offices in key locations including Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala. These facilities implement the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and provide information and/or referrals to humanitarian parole, family reunification, and labor pathways in the United States, Canada, and Spain and provide an orderly alternative to irregular migration. Increased our ability to enforce consequences for those who enter unlawfully and do not qualify for relief: Expanded expedited removal to process noncitizens who do not enter the United States through lawful pathways more quickly and in greater numbers than ever before, including record numbers of noncitizens receiving credible fear interviews by USCIS asylum officers. Removed or returned over 470,000 individuals since May 12, the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border, including more than 78,000 individual family members. In 7 months, this nearly exceeds the number removed and returned in all of fiscal year 2019 and exceeds the number of removals and returns in each full fiscal year from 2015- 2018. Daily removals and enforcement returns are nearly double what they were compared to the pre-pandemic average (2014-2019). In addition, after the ending of Title 42 in May, through the end of fiscal year 2023, DHS removed or returned more noncitizens without a basis to remain in the United States than in any other 5-month period in the last 10 years. Expanded a first-of-its kind effort, unprecedented in scale, to disrupt and dismantle human smuggling networks that was launched in 2022. To date, this campaign has resulted in the arrest of over 18,000 smugglers, more than 10,000 disruption actions, and more than $60 million seized. The campaign has led to more than 2,000 indictments and more than 1,500 convictions in partnership with U.S. attorneys. U.S. Border Patrol has also referred close to 10,000 individuals for prosecution. Provided an unprecedented level of support for the CBP workforce, with more technology, personnel, and infrastructure deployed along our borders than ever before, and by securing the first increase in hiring of U.S. Border Patrol Agents in over a decade. That includes 300 additional Agents funded in the fiscal year 2023 budget, an additional 350 requested in the President's fiscal year 2024 budget, and a further 1,300 agents requested through the administration's supplemental budget request. By expanding digital innovation, including the use of electronic A-Files across the Southwest border, DHS has spared the equivalent of more than 200 CBP full-time personnel from paperwork processing so they can focus on operational duties. Reunited over 770 migrant children with their families who were separated at the Southwest Border. The Department also reached an agreement that provides for continued family reunifications, certain immigration relief, and certain support services for separated families, and sets forth standards to limit future separations during an 8-year period. Leveraged new technologies and other innovative tactics to increase efficiency and effectiveness of our law enforcement, including migrant vetting: Improved processing times and vetting of migrants at the Southwest Border by launching an appointment scheduling function on the CBP One mobile app. This enabled CBP to process 4 to 5 times as many individuals at select ports of entry than it could a decade ago, strengthening our ability to screen and vet those seeking to enter the United States. This orderly process with case-by-case determinations was utilized by over 360,000 individuals. Advanced compliance with immigration enforcement processes by making them more accessible, including through a newly- launched U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) Portal where noncitizens can schedule appointments, update their address, and check immigration court hearing information in a consolidated location. This portal is part of ICE's efforts to modernize, streamline, and encourage compliance with immigration enforcement processes. Built partnerships with foreign governments to strengthen our vetting capabilities. Under the International Biometric Information Sharing Program, for example, DHS has partnered with the U.S. Department of State to build the capacity of partners in the Western Hemisphere to collect and screen biometric information--including against DHS holdings--to more effectively manage irregular migration. CBP performed over 37,000 noncitizen rescues at our Southwest Border in fiscal year 2023 including of those in danger of drowning in the Rio Grande or abandoned by unscrupulous smugglers in harsh and remote terrain without adequate water or sustenance. Noncitizens rescued are still subject to U.S. immigration laws, including being placed into removal proceedings if they do not have a legal basis to remain. Provided nearly $800 million in funding for communities receiving migrants through the Emergency Food and Shelter Program-Humanitarian and the Shelter and Services Program established by Congress in December 2022. The Department has also increased coordination with State and local officials to share best practices and help connect communities to Federal resources to shelter migrants. Decreased the median processing time for naturalization applicants from 10.5 months to 6.1 months by the end of fiscal year 2023, achieving the agency's long-standing processing time goal for most individuals seeking the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. USCIS welcomed more than 883,000 new U.S. citizens, completed 964,500 naturalization applications, and administered the Oath of Allegiance to over 12,000 U.S. military service members. DHS redesignated and extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, South Sudan, Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela and extended TPS for certain nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. combatted the flow of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs into the homeland DHS stopped more fentanyl and arrested more drug traffickers in the last 2 years than in the previous 5 years combined and continues to optimize our intelligence and field operations to stop these deadly substances from hitting our streets. More than 90 percent of seized fentanyl is smuggled into the United States by transnational criminal organizations through ports of entry, primarily in vehicles driven by U.S. citizens. Our strategy is to disrupt the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals coming into the United States by improving our detection capabilities through personnel surges, advanced technology deployment, and increased information sharing. CBP and HSI developed new, comprehensive strategies to combat fentanyl trafficking. In fiscal year 2023 and the first 2 months of fiscal year 2024, their combined efforts stopped over 48,500 pounds of fentanyl from hitting our streets, seized over 5,400 pill presses and more than $16 million in currency, and concluded investigations that led to over 5,600 arrests. DHS also surged cross-government efforts to interdict fentanyl and precursor chemicals: Operation Blue Lotus surged CBP and HSI resources to Southwest Border ports of entry and worked with State, local, Tribal, and Territorial partners to expose networks, seizing more than 10,000 pounds of fentanyl and more than 10,000 pounds of narcotics like cocaine and methamphetamine. CBP's Operations Artemis targeted the fentanyl supply chain and interdicted items required in the production of fentanyl, supported by HSI. This operation leveraged multidisciplined interagency jump teams at strategic locations with an enhanced focus on disrupting the supply chain used in the development and movement of fentanyl. Operation Rolling Wave surged inbound inspections at Southwest Border checkpoints, covering every sector and leveraging predictive analysis and intelligence sharing. Operation Apollo, a new CBP counter-fentanyl joint operation launched in October 2023, is concentrating law enforcement efforts on disrupting drug and chemical supply, collecting and sharing intelligence, and leveraging valuable partnerships in Southern California. As of the end of last year, CBP is operating 16 Forward Operating Laboratories to provide on-site, rapid testing for fentanyl to front-line personnel. These labs accelerate processing on the front lines from weeks to seconds and provide real-time key results for quicker law enforcement intelligence, actions, and prosecutions. Tested new AI technology, including machine learning computer models, to help CBP officers determine which suspicious vehicles and passengers to refer to secondary screening, contributing to 240 seizures last year, including thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl. Expanded collaboration with partners in the Western Hemisphere and Asia through 16 Transnational Criminal Investigative Units. In Mexico, this work resulted in the seizure of 64,138 pounds of precursor chemicals and more than 59 criminal arrests. DHS participated in the development of a new Counter Narcotics Working Group with China to disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals, delivering on the commitments made during President Biden's meeting with President Xi in November 2023. Took down leaders of major transnational criminal organizations. This includes the arrest and extradition of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, part of the leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. His arrest is the result of a year-long investigation led by HSI and ICE and demonstrates the U.S. Government's commitment to bring justice to those who seek to profit from international drug trafficking. helped communities prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters DHS helped prepare for, prevent, or respond to 25 disasters that caused over $1 billion in damage each, more such disasters than any previous year. DHS is focused on providing our public and the private sector with the resources they need to reinforce our critical infrastructure, prepare response plans, and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. Led whole-of-Government responses to more than 90 natural disasters, including 25 that each caused over $1 billion in damages. In Maui, for example, more than 300 U.S. Coast Guard personnel responded to the crisis and led 22 search-and-rescue missions across nearly 800 square miles, saving at least 17 lives and assisting an additional 40 survivors. FEMA approved nearly $41 million in assistance for survivors, including over $19 million in housing assistance and over $19.6 million in Other Needs Assistance. Reduced vulnerability to floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, extreme heat, and other climate-fueled hazards: Awarded $3 billion in resilience grants. This includes $1.8 billion for critical projects funded by the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grants expanding the program to 23 new States and $642 million for Flood Mitigation Assistance community-scale flood mitigation projects. These efforts advance the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain covered Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. Created a first-of-its-kind resource guide to help State, local, Tribal, and Territorial officials prepare their communities to face extreme heat and cold. These practical guides help save lives and protect critical infrastructure at risk from increasingly intense weather events due to the climate crisis and help advance the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to protecting communities from extreme weather. Helped target resources where they are needed most by announcing the first 483 Community Disaster Resilience Zones in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. FEMA used the National Risk Index and other tools to identify the census tracts across the country at the highest risk from natural hazards and those most in need and increased the share of BRIC funding to those areas. Made grants and disaster relief more easily accessible to communities who need it most. FEMA launched a new on-line disaster assistance application designed to reduce the time it takes for survivors to register for assistance. It also took steps to more efficiently assess damage to homes, buildings, and other property after a disaster by using AI technology. Using machine learning, data from past incidents, and pre- disaster imagery, FEMA can classify different levels of damage, allowing FEMA's analysts to process images in days, as opposed to weeks, and provides assistance to survivors much faster. Deployed more than 200 prototype wildland fire sensors across the United States, Canada, Germany, and Peru. The sensors leverage artificial intelligence for early detection of particles and smoke and have had promising early results, including several wildfires identified within 30 to 60 minutes of ignition. FEMA and the Science and Technology Directorate prepared efforts to deploy new sensors across the island of Maui to enhance early warning capabilities and help prevent future wildfires. Supported America's 27,182 registered fire departments which continue to be impacted by the increasing severity and frequency of natural disasters. To help recruit and train personnel, DHS awarded over $320 million via the Assistance to Firefighters Grants through FEMA in fiscal year 2023. Additionally, in an effort to combat the increasing risk of wildfires spreading into communities, the National Fire Academy and the International Association of Fire Fighters collaborated on a training program for wildfire conflagration for structure firefighters. Joined the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). As the first new member of the interagency USGCRP body in nearly 2 decades, DHS joined as its 14th member. USGCRP's membership consists of agencies that conduct global change research and use it to carry out their mission, creating opportunities for decision makers to communicate information needs directly to scientists and for scientists to support informed decision making. FEMA will have the opportunity to influence and provide input on climate change research that will allow the agency to better fulfill its mission, including es  leading communities in climate resilience. led federal efforts to combat crimes of exploitation and abuse In 2023, the Department identified ``Combatting Crimes of Exploitation and Protecting Victims'' as a sixth mission area for the first time in its Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and is dedicating the full weight of its resources toward combatting these heinous crimes. Increasingly sophisticated transnational criminal organizations, the misuse of new technologies, economic instability, and other forces are fueling an alarming increase in human trafficking, child exploitation, and labor exploitation. In response, the Department is redoubling its efforts to combat these crimes, support victims, and stop perpetrators. Identified or rescued 1,170 child victims through investigations supported by the HSI Child Exploitation Investigations Unit. Used AI and machine learning models to increase the efficiency of investigations related to child exploitation, leading to 68 individuals rescued, 47 arrests, 8 life sentences, and 8 trafficking networks dismantled in just a few months. Issued 4,907 notifications to foreign nations regarding international travel by convicted child sex offenders, resulting in more than 1,132 denials of entry by foreign nations, more than fiscal year 2022. DHS also referred 3,624 U.S. passports to the U.S. Department of State for revocation and reissuance with a registered child sex offender endorsement through the Department's Angel Watch Program, a joint effort with CBP and the U.S. Marshals Service. Increased international collaboration to address these crimes by establishing a Joint Council on Combating Child Sexual Exploitation with the Australian government. This council is leading joint research and development efforts, shared operations to go after criminals,plementing policy and legislation, and collaborating on prevention, awareness, and outreach efforts. Educated over 74,000 kids, teens, parents, and teachers about internet safety and how to stay safe from sexual predators through a revamped iGuardian program. HSI trained over 390 special agents, and since October 2023, completed presentations across 22 States and 2 countries. Increased community education efforts on internet and personal safety in 27 different States through approximately 736 presentations and outreach events for children hosted by USSS Childhood Smart Ambassadors. This is a more than 77.7 percent increase over fiscal year 2022. Delivered 135 training and outreach events on human trafficking to more than 14,000 participants, including the second DHS-wide Human Trafficking Seminar and an Advanced Human Trafficking Training for HSI investigators. The DHS Blue Campaign, our national anti-human trafficking awareness campaign, delivered 194 human trafficking awareness presentations to nearly 20,000 Federal, non-governmental organizations, law enforcement, and Congressional partners and acquired 83 new partners. equipped the dhs workforce to better deliver on our critical missions DHS has the third-largest workforce of any Federal agency and is home to more than 80,000 sworn law enforcement officers, the greatest number of law enforcement officers of any Federal agency. DHS offices and agencies interact more frequently on a daily basis with the American public than any other Federal agency, from travelers moving through air, land, and sea ports of entry, to businesses importing goods into the country, to immigrants applying for services. Improved morale and job satisfaction of our 260,000 employees. DHS scores in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey increased from 2022, with those gains either matching or exceeding those of other departments across the Government. The DHS Employee Engagement Index is a set of questions focused on morale, and it increased by 3 percent, from 64 percent to 67 percent, compared to a 1 percent increase Government-wide. The Global Satisfaction Index measures job, organizational, and pay satisfaction, and it increased 6 percent, from 54 percent to 60 percent, compared to a 2 percent increase Government-wide. Our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Index increased from 63 percent to 65 percent. Made significant strides toward improving customer experience, including by establishing a Customer Experience office, the first-of-its-kind in the Federal Government, to better ensure DHS services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive. Examples of improved customer experience across the Department include: FEMA's redesign of the registration and intake process for disaster survivors applying for individual assistance on- line. ICE's launch of a new portal for noncitizens to have a central place for managing and tracking their responsibilities. TSA's facial recognition technology operational assessments on CAT-2 scanners for identity verification to enhance security effectiveness, operational efficiency, and the passenger experience, while protecting privacy and civil liberties, currently deployed at nearly 30 airports Nation-wide. AskTSA responded directly to 3 million traveler inquiries questions, typically within 2 minutes, over social media and via text message. Partnerships with Apple, Samsung, Google, and American Airlines are helping passengers use mobile driver's licenses and ID cards in 7 States (Maryland, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Utah, and California). DHS exceeded its Burden Reduction Initiative goal ahead of schedule and improved customer experience by reducing public burden by over 20 million hours annually. Exceeded our goal for new hires of women in the law enforcement field at 35 percent, an increase from 23 percent in early fiscal year 2022. The Department also created a new Women in Law Enforcement Task Force and hosted a major hiring event with nearly 2,500 attendees. DHS is committed to keeping these critical positions staffed by building a diverse, resilient, and skilled workforce of the highest quality that mirrors and represents the public that we serve. Reconstituted the Homeland Security Academic Partnership Council with 20 new members who are providing strategic and actionable recommendations to the Secretary on campus safety and security, improved coordination, research priorities, hiring, and more. Members represent higher education associations, campus law enforcement, 2- and 4-year colleges and universities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, and Asian American and Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions. Met with over 200 local officials to discuss ways DHS can support their cities. This increased outreach by the DHS Office of Intergovernmental Affairs allowed us to provide direct assistance and coordinate DHS component briefings to better serve these communities. The Homeland Security Advisory Council produced a record 8 reports in 2023 for the Council on critical topics ranging from Customer Service to AI. These recommendations led to the development of new initiatives, like the Supply Chain Resilience Center, customer experience improvements across component agencies, and critical AI policy. Ensured the TSA's workforce is paid comparably with their colleagues by implementing a new compensation plan in July, which, for the first time ever puts all TSA employees on the same pay level as their Federal counterparts on the General Schedule (GS) pay scale. The agency's attrition numbers have noticeably dropped, and numbers of applicants continue to increase. Championed the workforce through the Department's 20th Anniversary celebrations, which included 8 ceremonies across the country recognizing 20,000 employees who served in the Department since its creation. This included an event in Washington featuring remarks from President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., former President George W. Bush, and former Pennsylvania Governor and the first Secretary of Homeland Security Thomas J. Ridge. DHS also awarded more than 1,300 employees with Secretary's Awards, the Department's highest honor, for their extraordinary accomplishments last year. This was the highest number of annual award recipients in the Department's history. Strengthened the transparency of our work by launching the Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS) in November 2023 to advance the Department's statistical reporting and analysis capabilities. The OHSS conducts independent statistical reporting and analysis Department-wide, supports evidence-based policy making and data-driven decision making, and oversees the development of enterprise-wide data standards. Enhanced the Department's work with law enforcement partners by elevating the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to the Office of the Secretary. This ensures that law enforcement equities are represented throughout the Department during policy, program, and initiative development; that law enforcement and terrorism-focused grants are appropriately centered on terrorism prevention activities; and that DHS provides maximal information, resources, and operational support to its law enforcement partners. Strengthened Department-wide civil liberties protections: Established the Transparency and Oversight Program Office in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to consolidate oversight functions that were previously dispersed throughout the organization, creating a stronger voice for oversight and compliance in all decision making. Issued the first comprehensive facial recognition guidance in the Federal Government. The guidance ensures that all uses of facial recognition and face capture technologies will be thoroughly tested to ensure there is no bias or disparate impact in accordance with national standards and include the right to opt-out of face recognition for specific, non-law enforcement uses. Became the largest Federal agency to issue a comprehensive policy and training program governing the use of commercial generative AI tools for certain employees. This helps ensure our use of AI is responsible, advances equity, and appropriately safeguards privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Took steps to further consolidate DHS leadership and agencies to one main headquarters, increasing cohesion and cross-department collaboration needed to address the threats of today and tomorrow. DHS launched a new expansion of the DHS St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, DC that will provide additional office space for approximately 6,500 personnel, new offices for CISA and ICE, and a 1,500-space parking garage to support our employees. Implemented Executive Order (EO) 14074 on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety. To date, the Department has implemented 27 of 36 action items from the EO that included updates to the Department's law enforcement policies, trainings, and procedures. Mr. Correa. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. I am glad you are here talking about those things that are important. You spoke passionately about fentanyl, the damage that has caused to our communities. I am with you on that one. Back home on Main Street, a lot of deaths, a lot of pain because of fentanyl. My investigation of this issue, 90 percent of fentanyl, more like 95 percent, comes through our ports of entry, and 65 percent comes through one port of entry: the San Ysidro port of entry. Most of that, the majority, vast majority, is smuggled by American citizens and green card holders. That is why I support additional funding for our ports of entry. Technology, more personnel, more drug-sniffing dogs, more technology. Mr. Chair, again, I want to thank you for holding this hearing because homeland security is an important issue for all Americans, for this Nation. So let's look at the facts here today. Let's be clear about what we are looking at today on a world-wide basis. Some of the nations that are dealing with this what I would call world-wide refugee challenge: the United States; Europe; Germany; Italy; Greece; Colombia, Colombia is holding 3 million Venezuelan refugees right now; Costa Rica; Mexico. These are among some of the nations looking at this refugee challenge. Let's look at some of the causes of this migratory pattern. COVID-19 and Secretary Mayorkas did not bring up COVID-19. Secretary Mayorkas is also not responsible for the robberies, gang violence, extortions in Central America. Secretary Mayorkas is also not responsible for the government collapse and violence in Haiti. He is also not responsible for the challenges, the economic collapse in Venezuela. Secretary Mayorkas is also not responsible for the human rights violations, economic collapse in Cuba. He is also not responsible for the economic collapse, human rights violations in Nicaragua, Peru, Ecuador; the invasion of Russia of Ukraine; the economic collapse going on in China today. Secretary Mayorkas is not responsible for these things. To the contrary, he is working to manage the challenge and provide front-line officers with the resources that they need. Even Senate Republicans get it. Senate Republicans are working with Democrats right now and the White House to try to address these challenges. So in the last minute-and-a-half that I have, I am going to ask Professor Bowman, is Secretary Mayorkas executing the law to full extent of his abilities with the limited resources Congress has given him? Is this an impeachable offense, sir? Mr. Bowman. No, sir, it is not. I should point out also, in addition, it's critical to note that if we could impeach Cabinet officers, or Presidents for that matter, any time there are legal disputes about the application of the law or their exercise of discretion, then every President and every Cabinet officer would be impeachable. In the previous administration, that of Mr. Trump, there were repeated lawsuits against Mr. Trump's immigration policy, some of which he won, some of which he lost. If the mere presence of heated legal disagreements about the legitimacy of Presidential immigration policy were impeachable, Mr. Trump would have been impeached for a third time. To do such a thing would be profoundly anti- Constitutional and a profound disruption of the Constitutional separation of powers. Mr. Correa. So, sir, are we looking essentially at political public policy debate here as opposed to an impeachable offense? Mr. Bowman. That's certainly my interpretation, Congressman. Mr. Correa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous consent motion here. Chairman Green. Do you want to do it now or wait till your turn? Mr. Goldman. I will do it now if I could. Chairman Green. OK, go ahead. Mr. Goldman. I want to introduce January 10, 2024, Washington Post article where the Chairman is quoted as saying that our investigation made clear that this crisis finds its foundation in Secretary Mayorkas' decision making. Congressman Norman talks about needing to impeach Mayorkas because of, ``bad judgment''. Chairman Green. OK. With no disconsent or disagreement, we will admit it to the record.  House GOP pivots to impeach Mayorkas as talks over border security languish House Republicans say Homeland secretary failed to `enforce laws passed by Congress' and `fulfill his oath of office' By Jacqueline Alemany and Marianna Sotomayor, January 10, 2024 at 6 o'clock a.m. EST, The Washington Post As President Biden faces intensifying pressure over a record influx of migrants last month, House Republicans have ramped up the long- simmering effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas heading into the 2024 election. The renewed focus on the impeachment case against Mayorkas, the face of one of the country's most intractable issues, also comes as some far-right Republicans are pressuring House GOP leadership to force a government shutdown over proposed changes to immigration law. The first hearing in the impeachment effort, led by the House Homeland Security Committee, will be held Wednesday. It's unclear what formal charges will ultimately be brought against Mayorkas, but an extensive report completed by the GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security at the end of last year concluded that Mayorkas failed to ``enforce laws passed by Congress'' and ``fulfill his oath of office.'' ``Our investigation made clear that this crisis finds it foundation in Secretary Mayorkas' decision-marking.'' Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) said in a statement Monday. Mayorkas squarely disputed the allegation in remarks delivered in Eagle Pass, Tex., on Monday during a visit to the southern border, where he also made the case for additional funding to boost resources, reduce the immigration court backlog, combat drug smuggling and quicken the processing, detention and potential deportation of migrants. Democrats and legal experts have criticized the House GOP's move to impeach their way through what is largely viewed as a policy dispute. Immigration experts who testified before Congress over the past year have also poked holes in the GOP's thesis that Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors by failing to uphold the law, arguing that insufficient resources at DHS have historically prevented any administration from completely executing some laws pertaining to immigration and the border. U.S. agents recorded a record-breaking 250,000 illegal crossings along the southern border in December--the highest 1-month total ever--according to data released by Customs and Border Protection. In an op-ed published ahead of the hearing, Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University legal scholar who has previously appeared as a fact witness for Republicans during congressional hearings, argued that ``being bad at your job is not an impeachable offense'' and that ``there is also no current evidence that  is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense.'' ``He can be legitimately accused of effectuating an open border policy, but that is a disagreement on policy that is traced to the President,'' Turley argued. Even some Republicans who favor impeaching Mayorkas acknowledged that it would fail to resolve the broader issues that plague the U.S. immigration system. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said Tuesday that if Mayorkas is impeached, Biden is likely to ``put somebody else probably as worse'' in the job. But that shouldn't stop Republicans from trying to remove him because of what he said is Mayorkas's ``bad judgment.'' But unlike the parallel impeachment proceedings initiated against President Biden, even vulnerable Republican lawmakers view the push to impeach Mayorkas as more politically palatable and have quickly coalesced around the effort, according to lawmakers and staffers involved with the latest impeachment target. With a two-vote margin in the House, support from all factions to impeach Mayorkas suggests the push could be successful along party lines. Reps. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) and Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) have previously been critical of the Mayorkas impeachment attempt, though it's unclear where they currently stand on the matter. Senior House GOP staffers predict the proceedings against Mayorkas will move swiftly and face little resistance in the conference--a notable contrast with the effort to impeach Biden. While Republicans in December unanimously voted in favor of authorizing an impeachment inquiry into Biden, members have been reluctant to proceed with a formal impeachment vote as committee investigators have struggled to produce direct evidence that the president benefited financially from his son's foreign investment deals. House Republicans campaigned on impeaching Mayorkas during the 2022 midterm elections, with many operatives at the time saying it would be the lowest-hanging fruit--a surefire win for the GOP majority as management of the country's southern border remains a galvanizing issue for the base. That unity does not apply to the Biden impeachment effort, however, and some Republican lawmakers and aides have speculated that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has expedited the Mayorkas vote as the conference enters another consequential election year to appease a far- right base clamoring for accountability. But a person close to Johnson, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail internal discussions, noted that House Republicans have spent the past year working to build a case against Mayorkas--it's just received less media attention than other GOP-led investigations. Johnson last week led a visit with GOP lawmakers to the U.S.-Mexico border amid Senate negotiations over $14 billion in additional funding for border operations and the U.S. immigration court system as a part of a broader $110 billion package that includes funding for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. security priorities. But House Republicans have pushed for the Senate to take up a bill passed last May with only GOP support, called H.R. 2, that would resurrect Trump-era border policies, including restarting the building of the border wall and restricting the asylum process. It would also modify the parole system--a program the Biden administration unilaterally expanded in 2023 to allow migrants temporary residency in the United States for humanitarian or other urgent reasons. Hard-liners have suggested that it's worth shutting down the government in the coming weeks rather than continuing to fund existing policies that they say have contributed to the influx of migrants. But Biden officials and Democrats have largely rejected their proposed changes, instead pushing for increased funding for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges. Mayorkas on Monday argued that while additional funding is necessary to increase the United States' ability to quickly process and deport migrants who are ineligible to stay in the country, Congress must act quickly to reform a broken immigration system. ``We now need Congress to do their part and act,'' Mayorkas said. ``Our immigration system is outdated and broken and has been in need of reform for literally decades. On this, everyone agrees.'' As one side of the Capitol has moved to impeach Mayorkas, he's worked closely with a bipartisan group of negotiators in the Democratic-controlled Senate to hash out a deal that would narrow the pool of people who are eligible for asylum interviews, and essentially close the border on days it is overwhelmed with people by expelling migrants and expediting certain types of deportations. Mayorkas has become a key player in the negotiations, meeting with the group daily ahead of the Christmas recess. His close involvement in discussions has continued in the new year, and Republican senators involved with the negotiations have tacitly acknowledged that the issue is grounded in policy. If the House ultimately does impeach Mayorkas-- making him the first Cabinet member to be impeached in almost 150 years--he is unlikely to be convicted in a trial in the Senate. ``It's not dereliction of duty if Secretary Mayorkas is actually trying to negotiate legislation that would address the issues at the border--it's harder to impeach someone who's actively negotiating to try to solve the problem that they are trying to impeach him over,'' Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) told reporters on Tuesday. Several GOP State officials are scheduled to appear at the hearing on Wednesday and are expected to detail how cities across the country have been impacted by the surge of migrants entering the country through the U.S.-Mexico border. Professor Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law, is also expected to appear as a witness on behalf of Democrats on the committee. Leigh Ann Caldwell, Liz Goodwin and Maria Sacchetti contributed to this report. Chairman Green. Now I recognize Mr. Pfluger, the gentleman from Texas, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is sad that we are here. Sad that we are in this position. Earlier, it was said that this is not a legitimate impeachment. I guess that is something Democrats know a little bit about and our witness just talked about the impeachment of Mr. Trump. So I disagree with that, and I take no pleasure in the significance of this effort. I have wrestled with the appropriate Constitutional response to what has become a complete failure to enforce the law, to adhere to Congressional directives to secure the homeland. The failure to secure the homeland has been so significant, so catastrophic, that Congress must use its power to provide accountability. We must be the check and the balance against such an extremely egregious breach of public trust, and that is what this is. If not this effort, then I asked my Democrat colleagues, what effort? Where is your answer to accountability? Where is your Article I authorities to check the Executive branch? Mr. Goldman. Will the gentleman yield to answer the question? Mr. Pfluger. No, The answer from the other side simply cannot be that we are powerless. I asked rhetorically, if not this effort, then how do we hold this failure? You will have your chance to wax poetic on that. Let's just go through the numbers. Fiscal year 2023, 27,000 pounds of fentanyl was seized. That is what was seized. That is not all that entered this country. Mr. Chairman, the Speaker of the House has put together a document, and it goes step by step for the actions the administration has taken since January 20, 2021. President Biden terminated the national emergency at the Southwest Border. President Biden issued an Executive order further entrenching DACA program. Biden unveiled the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would provide amnesty. The administration issued an Executive order ending limitations and restrictions on immigration without certain countries associated with terrorism. Then Secretary Mayorkas delivered remarks, effectively explaining the border is open for illegal immigration by stating that DHS's focus would be on processing. On and on and on. Mayorkas issued a memorandum prohibiting enforcement of immigration laws in certain areas, including schools, health care, and facilities. Mayorkas terminated Migrant Protection Protocols. Mayorkas issued a memorandum that states the fact that an individual is a removable alien should not be the sole basis of an enforcement action. I want to enter this with the unanimous consent into the record, Mr. Chairman. I seek unanimous consent. Chairman Green. So ordered.  Mr. Goldman. Sorry, what is the document? Mr. Pfluger. As I mentioned, the document is from the Speaker of the House, a list of actions, if we can pause the time, please, because this is administrative. This is a list of actions that the administration has taken step by step since January 20, 2021. It goes in order chronologically of the actions that the administration has taken that have weakened us, including those that Secretary Mayorkas has taken. Mr. Goldman. But it is created by them. Chairman Green. The gentleman is not recognized right now. OK. It is his time. Mr. Goldman. Well, then I object. I object to the---- Chairman Green. It is his time. OK. You object? Overruled. Mr. Goldman. No, he is trying to enter it. That is why I am asking. I object to the entry of this document that was---- Chairman Green. So you dissent. OK. All right. We will vote on it, I suppose, then? OK. Are you asking for a vote? Unanimous consent was just disagreed to. Are we going to vote on this? Mr. Goldman. Yes. Chairman Green. OK. All right. We need to clear the witnesses, get the clerks in here, and we will vote on it. Mr. Pfluger. Stop the clock, also. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. OK. My apologies. It is just objected to and there is no vote, so my misunderstanding. Thank you. I am assuming that is what you were going to claim. Thank you, Ranking Member. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Pfluger. OK. Chairman Green. I will make up the time. Mr. Pfluger. Two minutes and 15 seconds or 2 minutes and 20 seconds. Chairman Green. You are recognized. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. Earlier this year, Director Wray sat here with Secretary Mayorkas and told this committee that there were still known and suspected terrorists at large in the United States, that we knew had matched the terror watch list that came into this country illegally, and that we didn't know where they were. Right next to him sat Secretary Mayorkas. I said, what is the policy of DHS when you know that somebody matches the terror watch list? This is the reason we are having this hearing because he could not explain to this committee that DHS actually has a policy to detain those people. He couldn't explain his policy. That is why we are here because there are people on the terror watch list. Mr. Drummond, or Attorney General Drummond, can you tell us the extent of the damages that are being done in Oklahoma as a result of the illegal immigration, the 8 million people who have entered this country illegally? Mr. Drummond. We shut down an illegal grow every day in the State of Oklahoma, where we detain and arrest upwards of dozens of people. They're refilled the next day with those who cross the border from either in a Mexican cartel or a Chinese syndicated crime organization. It is ceaseless. Mr. Pfluger. Do you believe that the Department of Homeland Security under the leadership of Secretary Mayorkas is upholding the laws that we currently have on the books to stop illegal immigration into this country? Mr. Drummond. I think that there is a failure to enforce the laws on parole, removal requirements, detention, and the like. Mr. Pfluger. I couldn't agree more. It was earlier said that we Republicans are going to the border in polo shirts and khaki pants, or something to that effect. Well, at least we are going to the border and at least we are asking the questions because when you talk to the Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that there are no consequences. The consequences do not exist. Deportation doesn't exist. The catch-and-release policies are allowing people to flood into my community, San Angelo, Texas, Midland, and Odessa. The fentanyl deaths alone that have been catastrophic to this country, over 100,000 people, should be the sole reason that this committee comes together. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when given your time, will examine the facts. The facts are that over 8 million people have come into this country illegally. The facts are that the Secretary of Homeland Security has not secured our country against terrorism, against fentanyl, against criminal gangs, against traffickers, against sex slavery, against any of it. He is complicit. In fact, he is willfully complicit, which is why he needs to be impeached. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Mr. Thanedar, the gentleman from Michigan, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Thanedar. Thank you, Chairman Green, and thank you to our witnesses for being here today. Professor Bowman, would you say that Secretary Mayorkas has done anything that rise to the level of high crime and misdemeanor? Mr. Bowman. No, Congressman. Mr. Thanedar. Now, we know our immigration system is broken. For decades there is not much work done to reform our immigration system. Secretary Mayorkas should not bear the blame for the inherent flaws within the system he has inherited. My appeal to my Republican colleagues here is that rather than getting bogged down in an impeachment process that seems needless and devoid of Constitutional authority, let's shift our focus, working together in fixing our broken immigration system. Our broken immigration system is causing our Nation a loss of billions and trillion dollars in economic growth. When I was 24 years old, living in India, having gotten admission into a Ph.D. program here, and I made many trips to the American embassy in Mumbai to get a student visa, and the embassy kept denying me my student visa. They denied my student visa for four times, and only on the fifth time I got my visa approved because the counselor who had denied my visa for the four times had gone to America for her vacation. I mean, there is no doubt the system is broken. We are losing. Businesses keep telling me that they can't find a qualified, skilled work force that they need to grow the businesses. Australia and Canada has taken advantage of our broken immigration system to attract highly-skilled workers that our businesses need to grow and stay on top of innovation. We know immigrants are 60 percent less likely to be incarcerated than their native counterparts. I just want to take this time to appeal across the aisle to let us spend our energies and our Constitutional authority to solve the problems, to fix the broken immigration system that we have not dealt with for decades. Let's not blame the Secretary for our broken immigration system, but let's fix it to help our economy, create jobs, and make things better for all. Thank you. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Garbarino, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to witnesses for being here today. You know, I have heard a lot of the statements coming from my colleagues, and they are acting like we have come here on a whim. We are not here on a whim. You know, we haven't come here lightly to this hearing today. There have been problems at the border for years, and now every State of the Nation--every State in the Nation--is seeing those effects negatively. I just look at my own State of New York and the costs of dealing with the crisis at the border, and we have been begging the administration to do something for years. Nothing has been done. We are not here on a whim. Something has to be done. So that is why we--here we are. If leadership can't follow the laws of the land--follow the laws of the land. It is not just policy. There are laws. They are written. There are laws on the books, and they are being ignored right now by the current administration and the current Secretary. If they can't follow the laws that are on the books, we need to find someone who will. So I think we have taken the time and necessary steps to arrive here in a proper manner. It has taken a while, and our country, there has been a disservice because of that, it has taken so long. But we are here today, and I appreciate you all being here. I am going to start with Mr. Attorney General Drummond. You have described Oklahoma's challenge with the explosion of unlicensed and illicit drug manufacturing in the State following the Secretary Mayorkas becoming the leader of Homeland Security. Can you describe more about the challenges of Oklahoma law enforcement--that Oklahoma law enforcement faces in confronting this illegal activity, especially for rural police and sheriff's departments who have limited resources? Mr. Drummond. Let me give you a tangible example, Representative. One recent drug bust at an illegal grow operation, our agents were processing those who had committed felonies and been detained and those that were simply being trafficked in labor and sex. One of those was identified as an individual on an HSI detainer for illegal entry. He was supposed to be in Flushing, New York. He was supposed to have on an ankle monitor. When we contacted the field representative in HSI, they said, you know, charge him with a felony, we'll come pick him up. But he, in fact, had not committed a felony. Then we were instructed to say, please direct him to turn himself into the nearest HSI field office. So we did that and let him go. That happens day-in and day-out across Oklahoma, where we don't have the resources afforded to detain those that we know are illegally in the State committing crimes or complicit in the committing of crimes. Mr. Garbarino. You would like--in New York, we have laws that actually direct that they automatically be released and we see crime after crime after crime be committed by the same person. In New York, big State like New York, you think we would have the ability--we do have the ability to keep people in prison and stop crimes from happening. Our laws direct us not to. But at least in Oklahoma, you would like to be able to make sure that these criminals are not released back out. Mr. Drummond. Now New York has one fewer. We have him. Mr. Garbarino. Good. Another crisis, Mr. Attorney General, that has resulted from the unprecedented chaos at the Southwest Southern Border is the explosion of fentanyl poisonings in this country. We have seen many, far too many, in New York. From 2018 to 2022, Oklahoma experienced a 735 percent increase in fentanyl deaths, according to the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. Oklahoma has a unique status, sitting just north of Texas and right along major routes, routes away from the Southwest Border for both drug and human smuggling. Can you talk about how the fentanyl crisis over the past few years has impacted your State? Mr. Drummond. So with the legalization of marijuana in Oklahoma, it's not become the drug of choice to cross the border. Fentanyl is now the drug of choice. I take exception with the representative who said it is just to say no. It is a crisis in which we find fentanyl laced in many drugs, such that we instruct our young children to test every pill. If you think you're taking a pain pill, it's probably laced with fentanyl. We can trace those back to the porous border through which the fentanyl product comes in concert with the Mexican cartels and the Chinese syndicated organizations. Mr. Garbarino. This is for any of the attorney generals. We get a lot of unaccompanied alien children in New York. Have you witnessed in your State these children being used for purposes of sex trafficking or other forms of exploitation? Anyone can jump in and grab it. Mr. Drummond. I will jump in quickly with an example. We busted a grow in northwest Oklahoma City and in which there were two minor young women from China that were being sex trafficked. We have intercepted communication in mainland China where they're effectively posting jobs to come to Oklahoma, ``as massage spa,'' ``able to endure hardships,'' ``good hygiene''. Yet these young women are being exploited, and we don't have a remedy to take care of them. Mr. Garbarino. Quickly. Mr. Bailey. I know Missouri now ranks fourth on the list of the States with the highest rates of human trafficking. In 2021, there were 1,100 reported cases, detected, cases of human trafficking in the State of Missouri; 327 victims identified. Mr. Knudsen. Congressman, human trafficking has increased in my State multiple hundred percent since 2019. I think that answers your question. Mr. Garbarino. Yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Magaziner. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. I have been listening to all of my Republican colleagues throughout this hearing, and I am still struggling to understand what high crime they believe the Secretary has committed. I have heard that he hasn't achieved operational control, defined as not a single person crossing the border illegally. No administration has met that standard. I have heard them say that he has failed to detain everyone who is undocumented, who has come across the border. No administration has. Under the Biden administration, Secretary Mayorkas has removed 3 million undocumented people from this country. So when I hear my colleagues say that deportation does not exist, I can think of 3 million people who would disagree with that. He has continued construction of a border wall that many of us question the effectiveness of. When the Secretary and the President were asked, do you think the wall works, they say, no, we don't think it works, but we are building it because the law requires us to do it. They are following the law. We face difficult challenges at the Southern Border. There is no question instability in other countries has driven people to come to the United States, and it has created a chaotic situation. But, unfortunately, rather than working with us and the President and the Secretary to address these challenges, too many of my Republican colleagues are focused more on partisan grandstanding and campaigning, including this impeachment theater. So here is the real truth. President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have taken steps to try to secure the borders, but House Republicans have tried to obstruct them every step of the way because they want a campaign issue more than they want to fix the problem. Here are the facts. In 2022, Democrats passed and the President signed $86 billion for enhanced border security: more personnel, more funding for ICE, additional technology. Two hundred House Republicans voted against that funding, including every single Republican Member of this committee who was in office at the time. This year, in 2023, House Republicans passed their so- called Limit, Save, Grow Act, which would have cut the Department of Homeland Security's budget by 22 percent, eliminating 2,400 CBP officers. Every Republican Member of the House voted for that bill, a 22 percent cut. The Republican Limit, Save, Grow Act, I guess, is to limit Border Patrol and grow chaos. This year, this past year, President Biden requested $84 million in his budget to help States and cities with the costs associated with incoming migrants. House Republicans proposed cutting that funding to zero. So to the State officials who are here, who are coming from States that are having challenges with the migrant crisis, I have got bad news for you. Our Republican colleagues are trying to zero out the line item in the budget to help States and cities. I am a former State treasurer myself, and that is deeply, deeply distressing. Of course, most recently, in October, President Biden requested $14 billion in supplemental funding for border enforcement. That would add 1,300 Border Patrol agents, 1,000 CBP officers. But House Republicans have not called a vote on this funding. They will say, well, there are other things in it that we don't like. You know, there is a growing pro-Putin wing in the House Republican Caucus that doesn't like Ukraine funding. They don't want more asylum judges, even though that is part of how we solve the problem at the border. Fine. Call a vote on the parts that you do like, the CBP agents, Border Patrol. You have been sitting on it for 3 months. If you really, truly cared about solving the problem, you would call a vote. Instead, they have been sitting on it for 3 months, then went on vacation for a month, while Secretary Mayorkas was meeting with Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats to try to come up with a border plan, and House Republicans were MIA. I know what my colleagues are going to say. They are going to say, well, we did H.R. 2. We are trying to do something. Don't forget what is in H.R. 2. All right. H.R. 2 would require nonprofit organizations to verify the citizenship of the people they were serving or else they would risk losing their Federal funding. It would request coffee shops all across the country, small businesses, to do citizenship checks of their employees. Zero out the funding for legal assistance for minors, so that once again, we would have 5-year-olds going into court and standing in front of judges with no lawyers. We tried to negotiate with them. We tried to put in amendments to make that bill better, but, of course, they wouldn't work with us. So let's not forget what is really going on here. The Secretary is trying to do his job. House Republicans have been obstructing him every step of the way and are now trying to impeach him. Because this is about politics for many of them, it is not about solving the problem at the border, which is what we should be doing. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. Greene, for her 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to bring up that nothing spells impeachment theater unlike the--or, you know, the last impeachment of our former President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. That was quite a political sham impeachment. But today we are talking about a real impeachment that needs to take place. There have been over 20 occasions that Secretary Mayorkas has claimed that the border is either closed or secure, starting even back in 2021, when he is on record stating the border is secure. The border is closed. Again, the border is closed. The border is secure. He stated to FOX News Peter Doocy, the border is closed. Then he stated again to Congressman Pfluger here on this committee. Congressman Pfluger asked him, he said the border is secure. We are executing our plan, as he stated to Congressman Pfluger. Secretary Mayorkas said, I have been very clear and unequivocal in that regard, Congressman. The border is no less secure than it was previously. He also stated to Congressman Michael Guest on our committee when he was asked by Congressman Guest, ``Do you maintain today, in light of the statements made by Chief Ortiz, that the border is secure?'' Secretary Mayorkas replied, ``Congressman, I stand by my prior assessment because, indeed, I define it as maximizing the resources we have to deliver the most effective results.'' His results have been quite effective. Here are some of Secretary Mayorkas' effective results. Approximately 10 million illegal border crossers from over 160 countries have invaded the United States since President Biden took office and Secretary Mayorkas started his job. This is a number combined with over 8 million encounters and over 1.8 million gotaways. In September 2023, over 341,000 illegal border crossers invaded our country, surpassing all national records. Secretary Mayorkas is bringing the results. In fiscal year 2023, there were over 3 million illegals who invaded the border, the highest number of yearly illegal alien encounters in U.S. history. That far surpasses those that were supposedly deported. There have been approximately 73,000 special interest aliens arrested at our border. Those are the ones that we know of, ladies and gentlemen. There is over 1.8 million gotaways, and we have no idea how many in that 1.8 million or more are terrorists are from terrorist nations. We don't know where they are, what they are doing, and what their plans are for the United States of America, including the States that you are working very hard to protect. These are some impressive results. Most impressive for American taxpayers is the total Federal expenditures, and this is just in 2023, stands at 66,449,136,000. But let's talk about total State and local expenditures, stands at 115,608,730,000. The total national expenditures for border crossers for 2023 stands at 182,057,865,000. That is an unbelievable expense for the American people and the American taxpayers. What are the results from Secretary Mayorkas' job performance? He has violated the Secure Fence Act of 2006 by not maintaining operational control of our border. He has violated the Immigration and Nationality Act. He has violated the INI by implementing catch-and-release policies when Federal law specifically mandates the detention and removal of inadmissible aliens. He has violated the INI. He has violated the guarantee clause set forth in Article IV, section 4 of the Constitution, which requires the Federal Government to protect States against invasion. I would like to just finish with asking each one of you, in your position and your experience and the problems that each of you were dealing with, do you believe that Secretary Mayorkas' actions and refusal to enforce the laws warrant impeachment? Mr. Knudsen. Absolutely, Congresswoman. Mr. Drummond. He has failed to perform and is culpably inefficient, yes. Mr. Bailey. The Secretary is acting in violation of the law and Constitutional order. Ms. Greene. Thank you very much. I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mrs. Ramirez from Illinois for her 5 minutes of questioning. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman. After a year in this room, after more than 15 hearings and approximately 45 hours of talking and talking and talking about the border, we come back to committee not to address 30 years of failed border policy and political inaction that has created humanitarian crisis on our borders, but to pursue a baseless impeachment. Today marks the 16th wasted hearing on the border. Mr. Bowman, give me a yes or no. Based on your knowledge and expertise on impeachments, do you agree that, historically, impeachments have been an important tool to ensure accountability in our democratic institutions? Yes or no? Mr. Bowman. Yes. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you. Mr. Bowman, if you could be concise with just one sentence, are you aware of any Federal offense Secretary Mayorkas has committed that could amount to an impeachable offense? Mr. Bowman. No. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you. For the record, because I think you have had to answer this a couple of times, yes or no, in your expert opinion, is there a legitimate basis for this impeachment? Mr. Bowman. No. Mrs. Ramirez. In your opinion, in today's hearing, is this an effective use of committee resources? Yes or no? Mr. Bowman. I don't know that's a question I'm an expert in answering. I think that's a question for the committee. Mrs. Ramirez. Well, let me answer that. I believe it is not the right use of our time here because I think that we should be here identifying ways to address solutions. So these impeachment proceedings demonstrate that some of my Republican colleagues take them seriously. They are willing to take impeachment, an important tool for accountability, and make a mockery of it for political gain. This is how I know that they are not taking the humanitarian crisis within our border seriously, because impeachment will not make our borders any safer for our communities or for asylum seekers. It will not address the conditions across Latin America that motivate families to migrate across jungles and deserts to our Southern Border. So if they were serious, they would be taking up any of the topics on this list of 16--16--possible policy solutions and 16 legislative actions that require us, Congresspeople, to advance, including today, we have wasted 16 hearings on political theater that could have been better served considering policies on 16 actions right here behind me. Let me read them for the record. We could be expanding work permits. We could be increasing border personnel to expand assistance to new arrivals. We could be modernizing legal pathways to citizenship. We could be granting immigration parole instead of fighting it. We could be addressing and preparing for climate migration. We could be investing in economic development of Latin American communities. We can end the Monroe Doctrine. We can allocate resettlement funding for displaced populations. We can lift and reform time-based immigration bars. We can modernize definitions, standards in our antiquated system. We can establish humanitarian standards. We can improve upon adjudicatory processing capacity. We can increase personnel to reduce USCIS backlogs. We can implement Federal coordination of resettlement to interior cities. Let me take a breath. Now let me go to the 15th. We can strengthen democracy and combat corruption in Latin America. We can pass H.R. 16, the American Dream and Promise Act. Because fentanyl is, in fact, an issue in this country, let me add a 17th one, since if we wanted to work, we can actually get things done. We could actually fund technological resources to prevent fentanyl from being smuggled through our ports of entry by U.S. Americans. So let me say to you, as a proud daughter of immigrants, the wife of a dreamer, and a Representative of Illinois 3, I am here to get things done. We have to get serious about addressing every policy opportunity listed behind me today. We could start by expediting work permits. Because let's just be honest. To me, Congress, this institution, this chamber represents a sacred responsibility to come together to realize the solutions and problems impacting our constituents. Let me tell you, the persecution of immigrants and Secretary Mayorkas is not going to change the price of milk in your district. It is not going to address the shrinking tax base in your district. It is not going to fill the vacant positions of industries in your local businesses. Action will. Action will address the historic labor shortage. It will increase our revenue through taxes. It will reduce supply and distribution chain challenges, and it will grow our GDP by 1.7 trillion over the next decade. So if we are serious to address this border issue, then let's actually get to do the work that addresses border policy, because policy in action speaks louder than the 16 hearings and the 48 hours of talk and talk and soundbites and photo ops at the border. I have been to the border. My mother crossed it. I was there with her. I am serious about the work we can do here. Are you? Thank you, Chairman. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the Vice Chair of the committee, the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Guest, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I begin my question, I have something I would like to submit for the record. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a post from January 15, 2019, titled, ``The Case for Impeachment of Donald Trump, Part 3,'' written by Mr. Bowman, one of our witnesses today, in which he takes a very highly--a view of impeachment in which he says that then-President Donald Trump could be impeached over foreign policy differences. I quote from that article. It said, ``Surely we can impeach a President for needless shattering a basket of good treaties and entire intricate web of foreign relations they support. Consider Mr. Trump's rolling destruction of America's foreign policy,'' and goes on to say, ``There is powerful evidence that the Framers included conducts damaging to the U.S. policy a category of impeachable behavior.'' I think that that contradicts the testimony that we have heard here today, Mr. Chairman, from Mr. Bowman. So I would like to submit this article for the record. Chairman Green. Without objection, so ordered.  Impeachable Offenses?--The Use & Abuse of Impeachment in the 21st Century the case for impeachment of donald trump, part 3 (foreign policy) 15 Tuesday--Jan 2019 POSTED BY IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES IN UNCATEGORIZED By Frank Bowman Among the most persistent misconceptions about impeachment under the United States constitution is that indictable criminal conduct is a prerequisite for impeachment. The prevalence of this error is easy to understand inasmuch as the textual standard for impeachable conduct is ``Treason, Bribery, or other other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--a phrase that sounds like it refers to crime of the customary sort. However, as has been repeatedly discussed on this blog and as virtually all serious students of impeachment recognize, the phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' was adopted by the Framers from British and early American impeachment practice and extended to a wide variety of non- criminal official ineptitude or misbehavior. There is powerful evidence that the Framers included conduct severely damaging to U.S. foreign policy interests in the category of impeachable behavior. During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the delegates decided that Presidents and other Federal officers could be impeached, but they wrestled over what conduct should be impeachable. Various formulations were advanced. As the convention rounded into the home stretch, the phrase that had taken hold was ``treason or bribery.'' George Mason objected because he thought ``treason and bribery'' far too narrow. Mason was a student of British impeachment and had authored the post-revolutionary impeachment provisions of the Virginia State constitution. He wanted a Federal impeachment remedy analogous to British practice at least in the conduct it covered, even if not in the sorts of brutal personal punishments Parliament could impose. ``Treason,'' Mason said, ``will not reach many great and dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of treason.'' He was referring to the impeachment trial of Warren Hastings, Governor General India, just about to start in England. Mason wanted American impeachments to reach beyond the two indictable crimes of treason and bribery to important breaches of public trust in both the domestic and foreign sphere, the kinds of offenses charged against Hastings. Mason's solution was to add the word ``maladministration'' after bribery. But James Madison rose to object, saying, ``So vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.'' Mason thought the matter over and came back with a compromise. Omit ``maladministration'' but add to treason and bribery ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The new language passed 8 States to 3. Mason's choice of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' was not whimsical. Rather, he lifted it from British practice where, beginning in the 1600's, Parliament increasingly (though not invariably) used this phrase to describe conduct it charged as impeachable. My study of British and American impeachments convinces me that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' does not limit Congressional impeachment power to the necessarily idiosyncratic and antique list of misdeeds Parliament had addressed by 1787. Both Parliament and the Framers were acutely conscious that the sorts of dangerous public misconduct for which impeachment is a necessary remedy could not easily be described in advance. However, the Framers' choice of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' does set the baseline minimum for the scope of American impeachments. In other words, American officials are properly impeachable for at least the range of conduct covered by British practice. A persistent theme in British impeachments was the charge that the impeached minister had pursued a policy at odds with the nation's basic foreign policy interests. Impeachments on this ground were a constant beginning with the charges against William de la Pole in 1450 for his role in arranging the marriage of Henry VI to Margaret of Anjou. The Duke of Buckingham was impeached in 1626 in part for loaning English ships to the French to employ against the Protestant Huguenots at Rochelle. In 1678, the Earl of Danby was impeached for assisting King Charles in negotiations with France for British neutrality in the Franco-Dutch War. Lords Oxford, Bolingbroke, and Strafford were impeached in 1715 for their advocacy of the Treaty of Utrecht, which was widely despised as selling out Britain's Dutch allies in favor of making accommodations with Britain's traditional enemy France. And Warren Hastings' 1787 impeachment, so central to George Mason's thinking, centered on fundamental disagreements about the proper relationship of Great Britain to its Indian possessions and the states that abutted them. Over and over again; Parliament employed impeachment to assert an authority independent of the royal executive to define the nation's true foreign policy interests. That Congress has believed itself to have similar authority is demonstrated by the first impeachment in American history, that of Senator William Blount, charged in 1797 with conspiring to assist the British in acquiring Spanish territory in Florida. Blount was acquitted, but only because there were doubts that senators are ``civil officers'' subject to impeachment and because he had already resigned. During the 1788 ratification debates on the Federal constitution, James Madison insisted that a President who made a treaty that ``violated the interest of the nation'' and convinced the Senate to ratify it could be impeached. 3 Jonathan Elliot, The Debates in Several State Conventions of the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 500 (1827). If, in the considered opinion of the architect of the American Constitution, a President can be impeached for inveigling the Senate into one bad treaty, we surely can impeach a President for heedlessly shattering a basket of good treaties and the entire intricate web of foreign relationships they support without so much as a by-your-leave. Consider Mr. Trump's rolling destruction of American foreign policy. (And assume that his actions flow merely from caprice or bad judgment, and are not, bizarre though it seems to say such a thing, the result of his having been compromised by Russia.) To summarize, in the seventy-odd years since the Second World War, generations of American Presidents, legislators, soldiers, and diplomats have labored to create a world order of multilateral institutions and agreements with the United States at its center. That order has averted nuclear annihilation, prevented conventional war between the major powers, secured a stable, democratic Europe and an increasingly prosperous and stable East Asia, managed the fall of Soviet communism, and overseen a fairly universal rise in human material welfare, all while maintaining the United States as the single indispensable world power. All has not been wine and roses for everybody, of course. Humanity is on the verge of destroying the world's ecosystem through climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. And global overpopulation and income inequality pose continuing threats to individual well-being and regional peace. However, the looming existential crises of the age can only be addressed (if they can be at all) through increased collaboration and cooperation across borders. Most importantly for present purposes, whatever else one may think about the post-World War II world order, it has been hugely advantageous for the United States, placing this country at the center of all important decisions about international trade, finance, technology, and security. Since his election, Mr. Trump has moved steadily in the direction of unilaterally dismantling the United States' foreign policy, trade, and security architecture by formally abandoning or denigrating every form of multilateral engagement from the Paris Climate Accords, to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to the Iran Nuclear Accord, to the World Trade Organization, to a nuclear weapons treaty with Russia, to the United Nations, not to speak of our most fundamental military alliance, NATO. . Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Ivey of Maryland for his 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of you all for coming today. Just briefly, I wanted to respond to the comment about legislation sitting on Senator Schumer's desk. You know, with respect to H.R. 2, I think it was clear before it was passed, frankly, as we came through the committee here, Democrats offered amendments, all of which were rejected. Republicans put in poison pill language, especially with respect to not only abortion on some of these bills, but cutting off Federal funding to agencies and, you know, social support groups, like Red Cross, Catholic Church, and the like. So, the fact that you sent it over there knowing it was DOA, I think, is not much to praise for the effort. But more importantly, although Speaker Johnson sent all of us home 3 weeks early, the Senate stayed, and the Democrats and Republicans were actually working on bipartisan legislation to try and address the border crisis, working with the White House and, yes, Secretary Mayorkas to try and find an agreement. Meanwhile, the House Republicans, instead of working with that group and joining in those negotiations, did a road trip to Texas for a photo op opportunity to talk about the issues at the border. So, if we want to get serious about it--oh, and by the way, President Biden sent supplemental legislation, and I think it was in September, for additional funding. No response from the Republican colleagues. So, you know, part of that, that is one of the minor things addressed in this article behind me, ``Worst Congress Ever.'' That goes to the ineffectiveness of this Congress under the House Republican leadership to get anything done that is critical. We have probably gone through the issues of pending legislation, Israel, Ukraine, FISA, all the things that haven't got done that need to get done. The border is another one. I hope my Republican colleagues will get busy on that. With respect to the actual issue of impeachment from a legal standpoint, I went through the testimony that the generals provided. I only saw two paragraphs in all three of your testimonies with respect to that, and none of it actually spoke to the language in the Constitution with respect to treason, bribery, high crimes, and misdemeanors. I thought that was interesting. You know, Professor Turley, who is not necessarily my favorite, but Republicans seem to like him, he testifies a lot. In fact, at the opening hearing for the impeachment hearings against Joseph Biden, the Oversight Committee leadership called three experts to testify. Turley was one of the three. One of the things Turley said, like he is saying here, is that there is no basis for impeachment. He has taken this position with respect to Secretary Mayorkas. You know, the fact that none of the witnesses that have been called today by the Republicans actually have that kind of experience with respect to impeachment and expertise in it, I thought was interesting. I will add this, too. You can put it down. We want to add to the record a couple of documents. One is the Turley letter, which I will offer in a moment. But the second is a letter, an op-ed that was written by Joshua Metz and Norm Eisen, who are Members--who were former Members of the House Judiciary Committee, who have actually worked on impeachment hearings before. They talked about the absence of evidence to support impeachment here on a couple of respects that I think are important that we go through. One is the issue of maladministration. So the Framers, when they put the provision in, and they went through different iterations of it, but they ended up with the language they have got but excluded a term like ``maladministration'' so that we wouldn't have impeachment hearings for policy differences. Because, and this is James Madison, if we did that, the Senate could be picking and choosing and throwing out people just on policy disagreements where really that we should leave that to the President. The President gets to make a selection, pick his Cabinet or her Cabinet, hopefully one day, and make the decisions on who should be ruling there. The issue here, and that is pointed out in the Eisen letter, and with respect to the group of professors led by Laurence Tribe and others who point this out, this is just a maladministration dispute. My colleagues over here talking about the border has run amok and all of that, and, you know, I hear that point, but that is just a policy difference. In the testimony that was given, points about bribery, treason, high crimes, and misdemeanors don't seem to have been made. There is no legal violation. There is no criminal act. There is no basis that the Framers were looking for to remove a Cabinet member from office. That is a very serious step. By the way, I got a printout of all of the impeachment legislation that my colleagues had put together. I think Ms. Taylor Greene alone just has 8 impeachment resolutions in this Congress. Eight. Three, I think, against Secretary Mayorkas. So if we are going to be serious about this, let's try and get to the issues with respect to the actual legal piece. I apologize, Mr. Chairman, but I will conclude there. I look forward to actually having a debate and experts who can speak to this from expertise or scholarship on the issue of the standards for impeachment. Mr. Brecheen. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. LaLota, for his 5 minutes of questions. Mr. LaLota. More than any other Cabinet Secretary in America's history, Secretary Mayorkas is failing America. But don't take my word for it. Sixty-eight percent of Americans disapprove of the Biden administration's handling of the Southern Border. Sixty-eight percent. Seventy-five percent of Americans see the border situation as either a crisis or a serious problem. Seventy-five percent. So while our country is divided on so many policy issues, there is overwhelming support from across America for Secretary Mayorkas to finally secure our Southern Border, 68 percent and 75 percent. Yet the administration and my colleagues from the other side of the aisle won't change their border policies. Secretary Mayorkas won't change his policies or approach. The administration won't reinstate Remain in Mexico and blue cities won't repeal their sanctuary city policies. Secretary Mayorkas won't change his border policies, all while tens of thousands of Americans are dying from the fentanyl being smuggled across his open border. Secretary Mayorkas won't and can't properly vet the tens of thousands of migrants he is paroling into our country from nations with whom America is adversarial. So here we are. So what do we in this Congress do when somewhere around 75 percent of our constituents, and, by the way, from blue districts and red districts and purple districts, want accountability? Seventy-five percent. What do we do when tens of thousands of Americans are dying? What do we do when potentially hundreds of terrorist sleeper cells are being hatched every day inside of America's borders? What do we do? Do we do nothing? Do we wrap ourselves in some sort of bureaucracy and find some sort of legal reasoning not to do anything or do we act? Let me state quite clearly that I do not take impeachment lightly. Impeachment is meant for the most serious, grave circumstances when there is a true failure and willful dereliction of duty has occurred. In this case, Secretary Mayorkas has committed three specific violations which warrant impeachment. He has neglected his duty to secure our border. He has abused his power to exercise proper discretion over America's immigration process. Secretary Mayorkas has breached America's public trust. No matter what the Secretary or the President say, the numbers speak for themselves. Since President Biden has been in office there have been 4.5 million migrant encounters at the Southwest Border, in addition to over 1.2 million gotaways who evaded U.S. Border Patrol agents in the last 2 years. Those numbers are larger than the population of Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the United States. Let me be abundantly clear, this is not the failure of the hardworking men and women who are out there every day in the front line of this crisis. This is a failure of leadership at the highest levels, right up to Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden. While there are at least three criteria which merit Secretary Mayorkas' impeachment and removal, today I would like to focus on just one of them: Secretary Mayorkas neglecting his duty to secure the border. Attorney General Knudsen, good to be with you here today, sir, and thanks for your hard work keeping your residents in Montana safe. In October, sir, you joined a coalition of 27 State attorneys general in a petition urging Secretary Mayorkas to end his policy of mass catch-and-release. I was hoping that you could define, sir, for Americans who may be watching from home today and maybe not so familiar with this topic, what catch-and-release means, sir. Mr. Knudsen. Thank you, Congressman. I can. So, generally speaking, Congressman, under 8 U.S.C. 1225, the law is very clear. The Secretary has a duty to detain every single alien that enters the country, period, hard stop. Shall be detained. There is one exception. There is a case-by-case exception listed under section 1182, which allows, on a case- by-case, individual temporary basis for either humanitarian or for public justice reasons, an exception. Under Secretary Mayorkas' direction that basically has been turned into not a case-by-case analysis, but rather a mass catch-and-release where those individuals are no longer given an individual investigation, an individual notice to appear in front of a judge. They were given a notice to report. That appears nowhere in the Federal Register, that appears nowhere in Federal law, and was basically used as a mass catch-and- release program. So that is what we are talking about. Mr. LaLota. So, would you agree that the mass catch-and- release that is not done on a case-by-case basis is inconsistent with the laws passed by Congress and signed into law by Presidents of both parties? Mr. Knudsen. Absolutely, Congressman. There is no legal authority anywhere in Federal code for mass release of immigrants into this country. Mr. LaLota. Thank you. I am out of time. I yield back. Mr. Brecheen. The gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, for his 5 minutes. Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am frustrated that Republicans on this committee have chosen to engage in this political exercise and are proceeding to willfully misinterpret the U.S. Constitution and every precedent from the past 250 years by impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. Last week, one of our Republican colleagues said he was not likely to support any compromised border bill because, ``I'm not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden's approval rating. I will not help the Democrats try to improve this man's dismal approval ratings. I'm not going to do it. Why would I?'' Why would he? Because we need to work together to address the critical issues that our committee has jurisdiction over, because we owe it to our constituents and our communities to meet this moment. But that is not what this hearing is about. Because when you talk about approval ratings and not wanting to help Democrats, not wanting to help this administration, not wanting to help our President, you undermine the seriousness of what is being discussed today, and you make clear what this has always been a political pursuit. Speaking of politics, I have a few yes or no questions for the three attorney generals here today. You are all elected officials, is that correct? Mr. Knudsen. Yes. Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Bailey. I was appointed to my office subject to election by the people. Mr. Menendez. Understood. You are all Republicans, is that correct? Mr. Knudsen. Yes, sir. Mr. Menendez. Last, in 2016 and 2020, President Trump won in the States that you serve as attorney general of? Mr. Knudsen. Yes. Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Menendez. So it is fair to conclude that it is politically beneficial for you to be supportive of the former President and his policies and oppose President Biden's policies, as is the case for all of our Republican colleagues here on this committee. But Constitutional law is clear on this point. Policy, political differences are not appropriate grounds for impeachment. Mr. Bowman, is that correct, yes or no? Mr. Bowman. It is. Mr. Menendez. Thank you. House Republicans have said they will not support ``another dime'' for DHS until the enactment of H.R. 2, their extreme anti-immigrant border bill that would severely restrict our legal immigration system, a bill that would endanger migrant lives by denying asylum seekers their legal right to seek protection in the United States, and reinstating dangerous policies that force migrants to remain in unsafe conditions, such as Remain in Mexico. But Republicans know that H.R. 2 is so cruel and unworkable that it will never become law. But that is what they use to say, we are doing something here. That is what we are doing on this committee in this Congress. Instead, Republicans could support President Biden's request for funding for more CBP officers and fentanyl detection technology to increase CBP's capacity to identify bad actors and drugs at our Southern Border. But no, they won't support this funding or any solution that would help this administration carry out border security efforts because it would weaken their political talking points. That has been their strategy this entire administration. In this committee, we have real opportunities to work on substantive issues together across the aisle. Instead my Republican colleagues are distorting this committee and its mandate to safeguard our Nation's homeland security into a vehicle for false narratives about migrants and the border. Professor Bowman, let me ask you a question. Is it appropriate to impeach Secretary Mayorkas because of policy disagreements? Mr. Bowman. No. Mr. Menendez. Is it appropriate to impeach Secretary Mayorkas because Republicans refuse to properly fund DHS and allow him to do his job? Mr. Bowman. Well, I don't want to characterize the actions of the Republicans, but certainly you don't impeach a person-- -- Mr. Menendez. We will take your first part of the answer. Mr. Bowman . Based on politics. Mr. Menendez. Professor Bowman, is it appropriate to impeach Secretary Mayorkas because Republicans would rather narrate a crisis to score political points than work with the administration to strengthen the security of our border? Mr. Bowman. It's certainly not appropriate to impeach a Cabinet officer over political or policy disagreements. Mr. Menendez. I agree. Attorney General Drummond, thank you for your testimony, your written testimony. I went through it. I appreciate it. In this day and age, we deal a lot with sourcing and citations. I noticed there was a single source in yours, and it was to the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Are you aware that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the Federation for American Immigration Reform as a hate group whose leaders have ties to White nationalists? Mr. Drummond. I am not. Mr. Menendez. Yes, completely understandable. I will just let you know that a lot of the sources that have been used in all these investigative materials and reports have been put forth by the Majority have relied on far-right anti-immigrant think tanks and groups that are not aligned with what I believe our country's morals and values are. That is a problem with a lot of the reports that this hearing, that this impeachment process and procedure has been based on. That is where this all falls apart for me. I really wish we were engaging in a thoughtful exercise. I really wish we were trying to solve some of the challenges that we are facing, but that is not what today is about. With that, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. Mr. Thompson. Yes. Mr. Goldman referenced two articles, Turley and Eisen, and the clerk has already collected them, but it was just a unanimous consent to implement the record. Actually, Mr. Ivey. Chairman Green. Yes, I think I was watching back there. I saw it was Mr. Ivey. Yes, so ordered.  Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas' Failures Are Not Impeachable January 9, 2024, Jonathan Turley, The Daily Beast https://www.thedailybeast.com/homeland-security-chief-alejandro- mayorkas-failures-are-not-impeachable He's bad at his job and is enforcing wrongheaded Biden administration border policies, but there is no current evidence he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has been denounced as dishonest, duplicitous, and derelict by his critics. In my view, all of those things are manifestly true. It is also true, in my opinion, that none of those things amount to high crimes and misdemeanors warranting his impeachment. The Republican push to impeach Mayorkas has been gaining steam as record numbers of undocumented migrants pour over our Southern border. Even many Democrats are now alarmed by the numbers and the threat that they pose to our national security and to our economy. Sanctuary cities from Chicago to New York are actively trying to prevent new migrants from seeking sanctuary within their own borders. At the center of all of this is Mayorkas, who has long been viewed as an enabling figure for illegal migrations. He is also accused of implementing Biden policy changes that removed barriers to migrants, including rescinding the ``Stay in Mexico'' rule. Some of us have also questioned his integrity, particularly in controversies like the false claims that border agents whipped migrants in Texas. Mayorkas knew the allegations against his own personnel were debunked, but showed little concern or compassion for agents, particularly after President Joe Biden promised they would be punished before any investigation had even begun. However, being a bad person is not impeachable--or many cabinets would be largely empty. Moreover, being bad at your job is not an impeachable offense. Even really bad. Even Mayorkas' level of bad; If that were the case, he would be only the latest in a long line of cabinet officers frog- marched into Congress for constitutional termination. In history, there has only been one cabinet member impeached. That was Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. That alone should concentrate the mind of members. Despite decades of controversial cabinet members accused of flaunting the law or abusing their positions, Congress has only crossed this Rubicon once. There has existed a certain detente between the parties; an understanding that policy-based impeachments could open up endless tit-for-tat impeachment politics. The charges against Belknap were serious, in that he had allegedly ``disregarded his duty as Secretary of War, and basely prostituted his high office to his lust for private gain.'' The alleged bribes in contracts in the Indian territories would have constituted impeachable offenses, but Belknap had already left office. His case raised the question of retroactive impeachments for former Federal officers. The jurisdictional concerns made the difference for Belknap. The final vote on the closest article was 37 to 25 in favor of impeachment--four votes short of the number needed for conviction. There is no jurisdictional question for Mayorkas, but there is also no current evidence that he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense. He can be legitimately accused of effectuating an open border policy, but that is a disagreement on policy that is traced to the President. In fairness to the GOP, they allege that Mayorkas is violating Federal law in releasing what he now reportedly admits is over 85 percent of illegal migrants into the country as well as alleged false statements to Congress. Such releases, however, occurred in prior administrations and the merits of these claims are still being argued in court. The courts have long recognized that presidents are allowed to establish priorities in the enforcement of Federal laws, even when those priorities tend to lower enforcement for certain groups or areas. It is a matter of discretion. Indeed, even under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) which holds the government liable for civil damages, there is a discretionary function exception codified under 28 U.S.C.  2680(a) for policy-based judgments. Immigration has long been an area of intense policy disagreements. Trump policies were denounced by critics as draconian or even racist. Biden's policies have been denounced as fueling illegal crossings and frustrating efforts to curtail the flow, particularly by border States. In my view, Biden has been dead wrong on immigration, but voters will soon have an opportunity to render a judgment on those policies in the election. Mayorkas has carried out those policies. What has not been known is conduct by the secretary that could be viewed as criminal or impeachable. If Mayorkas is violating Federal law, he can be brought to court to enjoin his actions. A prior case seeking to prevent the termination of the ``Stay in Mexico'' policy resulted in a win for the Biden administration in Biden v. Texas, when the Supreme Court ruled the president had the authority to revoke the Migrant Protection Protocols. During the Constitutional Convention, there was a debate over the grounds for impeachment with George Mason arguing for a broad scope of offenses that could ``subvert the Constitution.'' His view was rejected. Most notably, there was a rejection of ``maladministration'' as a basis for impeachment. An English trial of Warren Hastings weighed heavily on the forging of the impeachment standard. The former Governor of India was charged with various offenses including ``mismanagement and misgovernment . . . and mistreatment of various provinces.'' While figures like Mason saw the need for the adoption of a similarly broad definition, his suggestion of maladministration was rejected as too broad. What Mayorkas is guilty of is maladministration. He has failed to secure the Southern border and has long denied the gravity of this crisis, including refusing to call it a crisis even as daily and monthly crossings reached unprecedented levels. None of this means that a cabinet member cannot be impeached. However, not like this. Not for maladministration. I hold no brief for Alejandro Mayorkas. However, I hold the Constitution more dearly than I despise his tenure. Absent some new evidence, I cannot see the limiting principle that would allow the House to impeach Mayorkas without potentially making any policy disagreement with a cabinet member a high crime and misdemeanor. That is a slippery slope that we would be wise to avoid. Indeed, it is precisely the temptation that the Framers thought they had avoided by rejecting standards like maladministration. That is why the case has not been made to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas. ______ Opinion: Impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas would be unconstitutional washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/09/impeachment-alejandro-mayorkas- unconstitutional-border-security Joshua Matz, Norman Eisen, January 9, 2024 at 6:19 p.m. EST Joshua Matz, a partner at Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP, served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for both impeachments and trials of President Donald Trump. Norm Eisen was special counsel to President Barack Obama and special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for the first Trump impeachment and trial. opinion why impeaching mayorkas would violate the constitution House Republicans appear poised to rush through a partisan impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of Homeland Security. They do not allege corrupt, abusive or criminal conduct; they accuse him merely of poor judgment, believing he could better use his legal authority and enforcement discretion to safeguard the southern border. Whatever the wisdom of Mayorkas's policy decisions, the claim that he should be impeached is indefensible as a matter of constitutional law. In designing the U.S. Constitution, the framers adapted the impeachment power from England, but made several key changes. Parliament had historically impeached royal ministers for ``maladministration''--for bad policy or poor performance in office. The framers rejected that vision. For impeachments of ``the President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States,'' they instead required proof of egregious malfeasance: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' This decision was fundamental to the separation of powers. Congress has many tools it can use to shape public policy and express disagreement with the executive. Impeachment, however, is not one of them. To ensure that the president could govern--and that he could select a Cabinet to execute his vision--the framers forbade impeachment over policy disagreements, no matter how fierce or consequential. That understanding has endured throughout American history. Despite centuries of heated policy disagreements between Congress and the executive, there has been only a single impeachment of a Cabinet official. In 1876, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached for a corrupt kickback scheme; although he resigned minutes before the House vote, that did not deter House members from impeaching him anyway. Of course, not all executive branch officials are angels. But in practice, miscreant Cabinet officials are not corralled through congressional impeachment. They are fired by the president, or they simply resign. No official who maintained the president's support has ever been impeached for carrying out policy in ways the House found objectionable. Impeaching Mayorkas on that basis would offend the Constitution and unbalance the separation of powers. Future Cabinet officials would be unduly chilled in doing their job, and presidents would fear that heated policy disputes might engulf their most senior officials in an impeachment quagmire. This concern applies with full force in the homeland security setting. The rule that we do not impeach over policy disagreements has had its strongest expression in disputes over immigration enforcement. There are two illuminating precedents. The first occurred in 1920, when the House considered impeaching Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis Post. Over the previous year, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had carried out his infamous ``Palmer Raids,'' indiscriminately rounding up suspected radicals, anarchists and communists for deportation. When those deportation orders reached Post's desk (the Labor Department then oversaw immigration matters), he canceled more than 1,000 of them, citing the absence of evidence justifying removal. The response was explosive. A New York Times editorial claimed that Post ``let loose on the country these public enemies, some of them fugitives from justice.'' Rep. Homer Hoch, a Republican from Kansas, put forward an impeachment resolution, which was referred to the House Rules Committee. Post was outraged. He viewed an initial report accusing him of misconduct as ``mental dullness at high tension.'' As Post later wrote, ``I had offended by deporting such aliens as were proved guilty and releasing the others, instead of pitching all of them out of the country indiscriminately.'' Post's ensuing testimony before the Rules Committee was electric. As one observer remarked, the committee ``had very much the aspect of a group of gentlemen who had picked up a very hot poker and were looking for some place to cool it.'' The drive to impeach collapsed. A similar tale unfolded less than two decades later. In 1938, Martin Dies Jr., the chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee accused Labor Secretary Frances Perkins of wrongly failing to deport an accused communist. As Dies escalated his attacks against Perkins's immigration policies, she bitingly responded: ``It is not usual for the legislative branch which has so many duties to attempt to usurp the functions and duties of the administrative branch.'' Undeterred, another member of Dies's committee introduced an impeachment resolution. Among other things, and reminiscent of the latest attacks against Mayorkas, it accused Perkins of ``having failed, neglected, and refused to enforce the . . . immigration laws of the United States.'' Perkins was shaken. But she maintained support from President Franklin D. Roosevelt and vigorously defended her handling of immigration matters, including in closed-door testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Ultimately, the committee concluded that ``sufficient facts have not been presented or adduced to warrant the interposition of the constitutional powers of impeachment by the House.'' The decision was unanimous. With respect to Perkins's handling of a particularly controversial deportation decision, it found that her decision ``involved a question of judgment, and there is no evidence that it was not exercised in good faith.'' As these cases confirm, disagreement over a Cabinet official's good-faith exercise of enforcement discretion is not a valid basis for impeachment. In launching an impeachment attack against Mayorkas, House Republicans not only violate the Constitution but also defy long- standing precedents. They should step back from the brink. Chairman Green. I now recognize Mr. Ezell. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here today and providing this important testimony. Let's be clear about this. The Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas did not inherit the crisis at the border. They created it. Ignoring the desperate pleas from affected and scared families Nation-wide Secretary Mayorkas has intentionally disregarded the law, leaving the border open to an endless stream of migrants, drugs, and cartel members. My time as a sheriff, and if I was neglecting my duties to enforce the law, it would have cost me my job. The Secretary should be held to the same standard. Mr. Drummond, your story about the illegal Chinese national who executed the three men, that has really stuck with me. The reports are clear that terrorist organizations are exploiting the vulnerability of our Nation's border. It is simply irresponsible that Secretary Mayorkas continues to ignore the significant threat to our national security. Do you believe Secretary Mayorkas' actions have emboldened terrorists around the world? Is it fair to say he has intentionally ignoring our Nation's current laws that should make it harder to enter our country illegally? Mr. Drummond. I think that it is indisputable that we have terrorist organizations invading my State. We've identified numerous gangs, numerous syndicated crime organizations, and they only grow on a daily basis. Mr. Ezell. Mr. Knudsen and Mr. Bailey, would you care to comment on this as well? Mr. Bailey. I would point out that the two lawsuits that we have pending right now dealing with the parole process, the abuse of the parole process, Secretary Mayorkas' violation of the plain text of the statute as it relates to parole and his promulgation of the circumvention rule have been described as engaging in a child trafficking delivery service. So it's not just that he's emboldening the enemies of the United States, he's actually actively participating in some of the harms by using support networks to allow for illegal immigration that used to be considered unlawful through the stroke of his pen, without Congressional authority. Mr. Knudsen. Congressman, I wholeheartedly agree. I can tell you the increased gang activity in my State. I can tell you the increase in firearm crime in my State, increase in officer-involved shootings. We can tie this all directly to the cartel drug problems that is flooding my State. We've seen fentanyl seizures in my State rise, by some measurements, up from 11,000 percent in my State just since 2019. Those are numbers that we were not seeing prior to this administration change. I think that's pretty staggering. Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Mr. Drummond, in your State and many others, we have had taken steps to safeguard our communities because we cannot rely on this administration to protect us. For example, Mississippi, my home State, has set up a fentanyl strike force to tackle the influx of drugs. I noticed that the State of Oklahoma has also formed a similar task force. Can you elaborate on some of the findings of that task force? Mr. Drummond. Yes. We have created an organized crime task force with the explicit purpose of coordinating with other State agencies to tackle this endemic of illegal immigration in the State of Oklahoma and the drugs and the detriment that they drag into the State. It's come at an extremely high cost for the State. We've allocated an additional $3 million from my office just to staff that. The toll on human, it's just remarkable. Mr. Ezell. Are there any recommendations, the task force findings, that you could recommend to the Congress to consider implementing on a Federal level? Mr. Drummond. It would be very helpful if the terrorism category, if cartels would be listed as foreign terrorist organizations. Right now they fall outside that immigration inadmissibility definition, and if they were designated as such, it would give us strength in deportation. Mr. Ezell. Also, in your testimony you pointed out that smaller law enforcement departments are outmanned, outgunned, and ill-equipped to address the threats coming across our border, particularly the threats from the Mexican and Chinese drug syndicates. I can sympathize with this and certainly understand the stress that is placed on our rural law enforcement officers when dealing with such a rise in crime. As departments are forced and stressed their resources addressing pressing issues, can you talk a little bit about the ripple effects and the gaps it leaves in our critical areas of law enforcement and safety for our communities? Mr. Drummond. It has truly taken the attention of all law enforcement in the State of Oklahoma toward this issue, where we have, you know, a shell owner buying a piece of property, pushing up berms of dirt with bulldozers, manning those with semiautomatic weapons at the top, very intimidating for our local law enforcement. They're outgunned, outmanned, and our resources are stretched in the State. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Drummond, and to the other witnesses as well, for your input today. Once again, the committee has shown that Secretary Mayorkas bears direct responsibility for the chaos at the border. I will not tolerate the overlooking of real threats that are jeopardizing innocent lives. His failures demand swift accountability. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentlelady from Nevada, Ms. Titus, for her 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. Titus. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses. You know, often I see my colleagues across the aisle brandishing the Constitution like a sword. You love to quote it. You love to cite it. You love to talk about what the Founding Fathers intended, that original intent. But it is kind of like Shakespeare and the Bible. Those who talk about it the most have seldom read it and really may not understand what is in there. You know, if you talk about original intent, you are saying what the Founding Fathers intended. Now, that is a smaller country, smaller population, smaller budget. We had no AI. We had no drones. How do we know what they intended? Well, often we don't, but in this case, we know exactly what they intended. All you have to do is look at some of the notes from the convention of the Constitution by Madison, who did not want to include the maladministration because it was too broad and policy-oriented. Look at Federalist Paper 65 by Hamilton, a conservative at the time who did not want to include this broader interpretation of impeachment. Now, you have also heard Mr. Bowman's arguments, a respected scholar who you have demeaned his expertise by insinuating, oh, he is just a Democratic witness. But he is not alone in this position. Mr. Turley's letter was mentioned. There is an article in The Hill about another letter from legal scholars. This is a group of legal scholars who wrote a letter to our Chairman and the leadership of the House, Speaker Johnson, that says, ``Their proposed grounds for impeaching Mayorkas are the stuff of ordinary policy disagreement in the field of immigration enforcement.'' They go on to say that this is inappropriate. They admit they have varying views on the wisdom and success of Mayorkas' work on the immigration policy, but, they say, you cannot have impeachment based on this policy. It is a, and I quote, ``stark departure from the Constitution.'' Now, these legal scholars included in this letter are Donald Ayer, who served as U.S. deputy attorney general under George H.W. Bush; Stuart Gerson, who served as acting U.S. attorney general during Clinton and also served in the Justice Department under Bush. You have Mr. Turley also included in this. There is even a quote by Dershowitz, who says that this is inappropriate use of impeachment. So, Mr. Bowman, with his expertise, does not stand alone in condemning this use of impeachment for political reasons. Now, look at this resolution that we are supposed to be considering that was offered by Ms. Taylor Greene. Aside from the fact that it has got some punctuation and grammatical errors, it lists some ways that the Secretary has been effective in the amount of fentanyl that has been seized at the border, the number of people who were caught on the terrorist watch list before they came into the country, those are all evidence that he is carrying out his duty. What I don't see anywhere in this resolution, nor have I heard from any of my colleagues, nor any of our attorneys general, is how impeaching the Secretary is going to solve all these problems. How is it going to get rid of these illegal grow places in Oklahoma? How is it going to get rid of all the terrorists who are coming into Missouri? How is it going to solve the fentanyl problem in these other--whatever other State, oh, Montana, because we have gotten rid of Mr. Mayorkas? If anybody can add that and tell us how getting rid of him is going to make a difference, I would like to hear it. We hear over in the Senate, Mr. Lankford, Senator Lankford, who is a Republican, saying, well, you can just switch one Secretary for another. It is not going to make any difference. So perhaps we could talk about how getting rid of Mr. Mayorkas through this impeachment process is going to make a difference. I hear nothing. Chairman Green. Does the gentlelady yield? Ms. Titus. No, I am not going to yield. Chairman Green. OK. All right. Ms. Titus. So, since I---- Chairman Green. I would gladly answer the question. Ms. Titus. I gave you an opportunity. OK, I will yield. Chairman Green. OK. All right. Well, in my previous testimony, I have shared that the policies that he has implemented has allowed the cartel--Merrick Garland agreed with this, that they are flooding the crossing sites, tying up the Border Patrol, causing them to concentrate, and then the fentanyl and the other things are coming across the border outside. Now, I get that the argument that is often made about what is captured is mostly captured at the crossing site---- Ms. Titus. You are not answering. I can take my time back. Chairman Green. OK. All right. Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are not answering my question, how getting rid of Mayorkas is going to solve these problems. What you really want to do is get rid of President Biden. You want to get rid of President Biden, and then perhaps you can put your own Secretary in there that will come up with different policy. But just impeaching Mayorkas, we will have another appointment of another Secretary who follows the policy of the administration, and you won't like that either. So thank you, Mr. Bowman, for your expertise, and I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. D'Esposito, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is clear that the disapproval of the policies of Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas are not just specific to Republicans or conservatives. The numbers that were shared by my good friend from New York, Mr. LaLota, 75 percent of people have said that the border is the biggest issue facing this country. You talk about numbers. Fiscal year 2021--since fiscal year 2021, 8,542,000 people have come across our borders; over 3 million in fiscal year 2023; in November, 308,000 and change; 242,000 at our Southern Border; 312 terrorists who have come across on our terror watch list in fiscal year 2021; 1.8 million gotaways that we know about and many more that we don't. It has cost cities and States throughout this country $451 billion with a B. There has been over 70,000 Americans killed by fentanyl that have come across from cartels. We have been asked the question, is this about policy or is this about the things that Mayorkas has committed? Well, if you ask me, all those numbers is a complete betrayal to this country. We talk and has been mentioned by colleagues that, again, this is political theater. This is Republicans, conservatives using the border as a narrative as we go toward an election. This isn't a narrative. It is not one created by the Republicans. I will take us back to my home State of New York, where you have Democrats. Our Governor has said flat out, there is no room left in New York. There is no room at the inn. Don't send migrants here anymore. We have heard a Democrat city mayor, Mayor Adams, who I disagree with virtually everything about, but this I actually agree with, he has said that the migrant issue in New York City will destroy New York. So this doesn't seem like it is political theater. It doesn't seem like it is a narrative that has been created by Republicans and conservatives because you now have Democrats in these blue States and sanctuary States and cities who agree with us. Just last night, we had children told in New York City that they can no longer attend school in person. They have to do it virtually because their school is now being used to house migrants. Now just think about that for a second. We want to talk about the failed policies. This isn't just a policy. This is intent. Mayorkas has intentionally betrayed this country. People are claiming that they want to come here for a better way of life, for democracy, for a chance at that American dream, for a better education. Yet children who came here correctly, children who were born here, last night were told that they cannot go to school because there is no room for them because it is being used by migrants. That is the height of hypocrisy. If you ask me, it is a betrayal of this country. Mr. Gentner Drummond, in your testimony, you talked about how smaller law enforcement agencies feel that they are ill- equipped to handle the threats stemming from the border crisis. Can you talk about how the border crisis impacts the resources of smaller police agencies and what the officers in those departments are feeling? Mr. Drummond. Well, certainly. It strains the resources and it is wildly intimidating to our local law enforcement where they have maybe a police force of 3 or 4 in a community of 2,000, and yet they have 4 or 5 illegal grows that are populated by illegal immigrants, Mexican cartel members, Chinese syndicated crime organization members with semiautomatic rifles abundant, and they are unwilling to go in. Mr. D'Esposito. I know the answer to this, but I want to ask it so it is on the record because I think it is another clear indicator of Mayorkas' failure of his oath and the fact that he has betrayed this country. Do you know or have you experienced law enforcement agencies, to your knowledge, that have said that they have lacked notification and information and intelligence sharing from Federal partners when it comes to migrants? Mr. Drummond. I would say the cooperation with our Federal agencies is high in Oklahoma. We have an excellent working relationship. So I commend the Federal agencies working with Oklahoma. I think it goes at a higher level, and that's the implementation of the laws of the United States. Mr. D'Esposito. Right. Mr. Knudsen, you want to comment on that? Mr. Knudsen. Only to--I completely agree with my colleague here that the level of cooperation with Federal DEA, with our U.S. Attorney's Office in Montana has been very, very high and very excellent. Customs and Border Patrol, I might add. We're a northern-tier State and we work with them a lot. But certainly the message has come down from Secretary Mayorkas and from on high that we are going to just flagrantly ignore portions of Federal law. Mr. D'Esposito. That is really the point that I was trying to make. He has made it very clear that he wants to ignore Federal law. There are--you are lucky in your States to have great communications, but there has been, and there have been testimonies in this very committee of people who led local law enforcement agencies who have said, I mean, take for example, the airport and JFK, where they were housing migrants, where there was zero communications between law enforcement agencies because they just didn't want to share the information. With that, my time has expired. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Mr. Goldman, the gentleman from New York, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Goldman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I find it really difficult to sit here listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle slander personally a Cabinet Secretary who has committed much of his life to this Government and our public service. He was a U.S. attorney. He has worked multiple stints in the Department of Homeland Security. You are certainly welcome to disagree with how he executes his job. You are welcome to criticize him. You are welcome to make the case to the American people as to why Secretary Mayorkas, in executing President Joe Biden's immigration policy, should be removed from office at the ballot box. But to come in here over and over and over again and to personally attack and slander without any evidence a Cabinet Secretary who has committed so much of his life to this country, who himself comes from a Cuban family escaping difficult circumstances in his country, who is an immigrant and immigrant family himself, you should be ashamed of yourself. It is enough. You want to talk policy? Let's talk policy. I agree. We have problems at the border. Let's talk about how we can solve them. But instead of actually going over to the Senate, this committee, which has the committee of jurisdiction over border policy that is being negotiated right now by a bipartisan group in the Senate with Secretary Mayorkas, instead of actually engaging in those substantive negotiations to reach some sort of a bipartisan agreement to address the problems, we are sitting here with a charade of a sham impeachment hearing with expert impeachment witnesses who are Republican officials, political officials suing the Department of Homeland Security. Another hearing. It is the same hearing we have had 10, 12 times. Same pig, different lipstick, because we are now going to call it an impeachment hearing. So who do we have here? I am sure all three of you are excellent attorneys general, but I have never heard your names mentioned in the category of Mr. Bowman, who is a legal expert on impeachment. As far as I can tell, none of your States actually are on the border. So I don't understand why we are sitting here in a ``impeachment'' hearing with three attorneys general from different States who are Republican officials and have absolutely no expertise on impeachment. The reason is because the last time the Republicans did that and they brought in their so-called experts on impeachment for the first and only oversight public hearing, they were embarrassed because their own experts acknowledged that there is insufficient evidence to impeach President Biden. So who do we have here? We have attorneys general who are suing Secretary Mayorkas and the Government to stop him from implementing his policy to address the issues at the border. That is right. So one rule that the Department has implemented was the asylum processing rule, which would allow asylum officers, rather than immigration courts, to decide asylum applications for those placed in expedited removal to significantly expedite the process. That might reduce the backlog. That might create a disincentive to come. That is something that Secretary Mayorkas did to address the border. No, you sued him to stop him from doing that. How about the circumvention rule? That is the circumvention. Excuse me. How about the asylum circumvention rule, which says that you have to either appear at a port of entry or have first sought asylum from a neighboring country? That would reduce the people who could apply for asylum. No, you sued them. You sued them to stop them from doing that. How about trying to address the parole decisions to allow some people to come in and be able to actually have work authorizations so that they are not just sitting on the dole? No, you sued them. So this is what we have. We have Republicans suing Secretary Mayorkas to stop him from implementing his policy to address the issues at the border. Now we are going to impeach him because you say he is not addressing the issues at the border. Which do you want? I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Ms. Lee, the gentlelady from Florida, for 5 minutes of testimony. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Much has been said today by our colleagues across the aisle about this hearing and the purposes for it. It has been called a waste of time. It has been called a charade. It has been suggested that it is repetitive or unnecessary. To suggest that this hearing is any of those things or to suggest that this hearing is tantamount than nothing more than a discussion of policy differences is to fundamentally deny the seriousness, the scope, the scale of the catastrophe at our Southern Border, and the testimony of these witnesses who are here today and every witness that has come before them to testify in front of this committee about the seriousness of this crisis. We are here today because Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has intentionally gone around and subverted the immigration laws of the United States of America. We are here today because Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has repeatedly defied orders from courts directing him to cease and desist certain policies which he continues to utilize. We are here today because the Department of Homeland Security has defied inquiries from Congress trying to get to the bottom of the scope and the scale of this crisis. We are here today because Secretary Mayorkas has defied Congressional directives related to spending, Congressional directives as to how money was supposed to be spent. We are here because there is an unchecked flood of illegal immigration in our Southern Border that is destroying not just border communities, but communities around our country. Today alone, we have heard extraordinary and compelling testimony about the utter lawlessness that is occurring in this administration. Attorney General Knudsen shared with us that he perceives a refusal to faithfully execute the laws of the United States and shared stories from his State about human trafficking and fentanyl trafficking and the devastation that has occurred because of our wide-open Southern Border. Attorney General Drummond commented on the failure to enforce our laws and how that has affected his State. He also shared the extraordinary cost that it incurs at his State because we are not enforcing our laws in our border. Attorney General Bailey touched on the issue of parole, which has become an absolute farce and workaround for following our laws. He said, perverting the plain text of the law and, indeed, that is exactly what is happening. In my State, Florida, we, too, have been forced to sue the Department of Homeland Security to attempt to achieve any semblance of lawful behavior and policy. United States District Court Judge Kent Wetherall, in an order directing that Secretary Mayorkas vacate the parole program, said, ``Secretary Mayorkas has turned the Southern Border into a meaningless line in the sand and little more than a speed bump for aliens flooding into the country.'' With that backdrop, Attorney General Bailey, I would like to turn your attention specifically to the question of parole authority. On July 26, 2023, before the House Judiciary Committee, Secretary Mayorkas testified the Department of Homeland Security has used our parole authority consistent with the law and consistent with past practices of different administrations. He also claimed that his Department is using the parole authority consistent with the law. Still, in your opinion, is Secretary Mayorkas' implementation of the parole statute lawful, and is his implementation of this policy affecting the security of the United States? Mr. Bailey. His policy implementation is unlawful, in violation of the plain text of the statute, thereby forcing a lawsuit from several like-minded State attorneys general because of the drastic, terrible harm that's occurring on the streets in our communities. Ms. Lee. Attorney General Drummond, you shared some of the devastating effects that failure to secure our border is having on your State. In your opinion, are these policies affecting the security and safety of your State and of our country? Mr. Drummond. The laws of the Immigration and Nationality Act are clear and unequivocal, and they are not being upheld. Ms. Lee. Attorney General Knudsen, would you share your perspective on the harm to your State and our country that is being posed by failure to follow our laws? Mr. Knudsen. Seventeen hundred percent increase in fentanyl deaths, confirmed State crime lab fentanyl deaths since 2019, Congresswoman; 11,000 percent increase in fentanyl seizures; multiple-hundred percent increase in human trafficking investigations since 2019. Those numbers speak for themselves. Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Garcia. Are you ready or you want to go ahead with somebody else? OK. Recognize Mr. Garcia for his 5 minutes of testimony. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to just reiterate that, I think this has been said this very many times today by our colleagues here on the House side, on the Democratic side, that we all know that this impeachment inquiry, this effort to try to impeach the Secretary, is a complete political stunt and sham. I just want to reiterate that. We all know it is a political ploy that is not grounded in the facts, truth, and has been conjured up for just one simple purpose, and that is to score cheap political points against the Biden administration. We also know that we have had articles from the New York Times and other publications just really laying out that this is all about this pursuit of impeaching Mayorkas. It is about this kind-of effort that has been started, quite frankly, by even a Member of this committee for many, many, many months. That is all just really about hurting the President. Now, Professor Bowman, Republican leaders have been quoted promising donors that they would impeach Secretary Mayorkas in fundraisers back in April 2023. Do you believe this committee has uncovered any evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors since that time? Mr. Bowman. Not that I'm aware of. Mr. Garcia. Thank you. Let's be clear. What we are moving ahead with today is because extremists, including some folks that are in this committee, have demanded it over and over again. Now, I want to give a couple quotes from some Members of the House. Congressman Andy Biggs told Newsmax that Republicans ``have nothing to campaign on.'' Andy said that he was embarrassed by this. Now, Congressman Chip Roy has said, and I want to quote, ``I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing, one, that I can go to campaign on to say that we did. Just one.'' In fact, this last Monday, he went on TV to call the Republican conference, and I quote, ``a continued failure theater.'' So I understand that we are trying to throw red meat to an extremist base, but we are wasting the public's time and we know that the Senate will laugh off all of these charges. Let's remember the bigger picture. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle don't want to really govern. They are not serious about solutions that could actually become law, and they are obstructing $14 billion in emergency supplemental funding. They voted against hiring hundreds of additional Border Patrol agents and of our ports of entry, and they have opposed the incredible resources that we have been trying to send around technology, supporting organizations on the ground, support for Border Patrol agents, and many other types of funding. I also want to remind the committee and the public that President Biden, on his first day in office, sent a comprehensive immigration plan to Congress, which Republicans have refused to act on. I also want to note that Secretary Mayorkas has continued to try to negotiate a bipartisan, sensible, and humane approach to actually fixing our immigration system and trying to actually address the issues that remain along the border, because Democrats agree there are issues and challenges along the border, and we want to see those fixed. As an immigrant myself, I also have always believed this is a Nation of immigrants. We should never forget that this country was based on so much hard work and labor of immigrants that now live all across this country. Our immigration system won't be fixed by this impeachment process, and it certainly won't be fixed by their proposal, which is H.R. 2. Let's set the record straight about H.R. 2. The bill would end health and human services funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings. It would essentially send children to detention camps. The bill subjects all unaccompanied children to an accelerated removal process, as we know, in horrible conditions at these facilities that we have seen over the last few years. Quite frankly, we know this is not just not a solution, but it is inhumane and cruel to demonize some of the most vulnerable people that are coming to our country. We want to address the root causes of migration. We want to ensure that legal pathways are followed. We want to make sure that folks receive the support they need back in their home countries. We certainly don't want to defund organizations like Catholic Charities that would rip away aid to communities and to migrants across our country and along our border. The idea that our border problems, which have needed a bipartisan solution for decades, would be solved by H.R. 2 is just not true. It is an anti-immigrant policy, and we should reject it. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Luttrell, the gentleman from Texas, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Luttrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for coming here today. Mr. Bowman, I appreciate and respect your opening statements, or it is probably the most educated I have been on--when it comes Constitutional law and the process that we are in right now. So thank you for that education. My first question for you, sir, is, can you give me the definition of a high crime and misdemeanor? Mr. Bowman. I think no single definition is satisfactory in every case, but I think Charles Black's is a pretty good general statement. That is to say, high crimes and misdemeanors should be extremely serious offenses in the way that serious crimes, like treason and bribery, are. Mr. Luttrell. It is extremely serious. Mr. Bowman. Second, it should in some way---- Mr. Luttrell. From that--let me go up with that one, sir. That is a great point. Is the selling of fentanyl inside the United States causing hundreds of thousands of deaths over the past years considered a high crime, in your opinion? Mr. Bowman. I'm unaware that the Secretary has sold any fentanyl. Mr. Luttrell. No, no, I am not directing that to the Secretary. I am asking you, is the selling of fentanyl inside the United States, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans over the years, would that be considered a high crime? Mr. Bowman. If you could establish an officer---- Mr. Luttrell. Boy, that is a yes answer all day long. You don't say yes, that's bad. Mr. Bowman. If you could establish an officer actually did that, possibly. Mr. Luttrell. All right, so let me ask you this. Mr. Bowman. I'm aware of no evidence that that ever happened. Mr. Luttrell. There is no evidence that hundreds of thousands of people over the past few years have died from fentanyl overdose? Mr. Bowman. I'm unaware of any evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has ever sold---- Mr. Luttrell. I am not talking about Secretary Mayorkas. I am talking about fentanyl deaths. Mr. Bowman. That's what we're here to talk about, are we not, Congressman? Secretary Mayorkas. Mr. Luttrell. If you will allow me to finish, if you will answer my question, I am getting to my point. Chairman Green. It is your time, so you can with--you know. Mr. Luttrell. All right. So let me ask you this since we are unhinged on the fentanyl deaths, do you consider slavery a high crime? Mr. Bowman. Is there any evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has enslaved anyone? Mr. Luttrell. This is getting a little bit more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I want to know if I am supposed to go back to the folks in my district and tell them that the individual responsible for securing the American borders is falling short because the United States is one of the top countries on the planet for sex slaves. We lose 100,000 people a year to fentanyl overdoses. The individual responsible for protecting us is Mr. Mayorkas. That is where I am going with that. The fact that you didn't jump on top of and say that those things were absolutely involuntary, the worst things ever, is graphically disturbing to me. I pitched that one up as a softball, buddy, and you failed miserably. I am from Texas. I feel this every day. My colleagues and I, we have our disagreements. I went down to the border with the other Republicans. I didn't have a polo on. I didn't get behind the podium. I talked to everybody down there that works down there. I talked to the ranchers, the citizens, and they tell me every single day that we are overwhelmed. Ms. Titus brought up an amazing point. Yes, if we remove Mr. Mayorkas, Mr. Biden will put another Democratic member in that spot. We know that. I am here for this reason. I am sending a message that my people can no longer take it. We are dying by the droves. Every year, I have to look at the mothers. I look the mothers and fathers that lost their kids to fentanyl. I look at them every single day when I am out in the district, and it is all coming across our Southern Border through the ports of entry. Yes, I got it. But if you are responsible for securing our borders, then you better act like it. This individual is not. That is the problem, sir, period, end of discussion. These atrocities that we are seeing, you can't explain. Forty million people are enslaved on the planet. Forty million. America is leading up top with that problem. You ask where they come from. They come across our Southern Border and our Northern Border. That, sir, is the responsibility of the Secretary. Since he has failed to conduct his job for the past few years, we need somebody else now. Now, I am not--I met Mr. Mayorkas. I have chatted him up. He is a family man. He is a good man. I am going to be crucified going back home and saying that. I spoke to him face to face, and I bet he adamantly would disagree on the fact that, yes, slavery is horrible. The fentanyl deaths are horrible. But there was a mother sitting in front of this committee months ago last year that sat there and looked at every single one of us. She lost her mother and her daughter to a coyote running through town, killed them both. She had to stand there in the emergency room while her daughter died. She looked us all in the faces, said you guys are absolutely doing nothing. You are doing nothing. So when we go to Mr. Mayorkas to say, hey, we need to act on this, and nothing is happening, sir, that is an absolute problem. I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize Ms. Clarke from New York, the gentlelady from New York, for her 5 minutes of testimony. Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon. Let me first start by thanking our witnesses for joining us this afternoon, today. You know, it is clear that MAGA Republican attempts to impeach Secretary Mayorkas have nothing to do with his performance and everything to do with the loyalty oath most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have sworn to Donald Trump. After the House twice impeached Donald Trump, once for attempting to bribe an ally to investigate his political opponent and interfere in U.S. elections and again for inciting an insurrection against the Capitol to steal an election, some of my Republican colleagues want to settle the score by impeaching someone, anyone, in the Biden administration. Secretary Mayorkas was sworn in on February 2, 2022. Less than 6 weeks later, Senator Lindsey Graham floated the Secretary should resign during an appearance on FOX News. In May 2021, Congressman Biggs appeared on the 1st and said that Secretary Mayorkas has got to go, and introduced Articles of Impeachment of the Secretary in August of that year. The Secretary had not yet served 6 months. Other Republicans piled on that call in the months that followed. In April, Chairman Green fundraised off his planned impeachment efforts, telling his donors to, ``Get out the popcorn.'' But Secretary Mayorkas is hardly the only member of the Biden administration Republicans have disagreed with and then tried to impeach. Congressman Perry filed Articles of Impeachment against Attorney General Garland in October 2021. Congresswoman Taylor Greene filed articles to impeach the attorney general in August 2022, FBI Director Christopher Wray in May 2022, and filed multiple Articles of Impeachment against President Biden, sometimes more than one time in the same day. Congressman Norman filed Articles of Impeachment against Secretary Blinken in August 2021, and Congressman Mills filed Articles of Impeachment against Secretary Austin in August 2023. Meanwhile, Republicans have filed multiple resolutions to expunge the impeachments of Donald Trump. I am concerned that my Republican colleagues fail to understand the gravity of impeachment. So, Professor Bowman, the Founders engaged in robust debate when defining the criteria for impeachment. In your view, did the Founders intend for impeachment to be a frequently-used process to coerce the Executive branch into policy decisions, or a rarely used tool reserved for extraordinary behavior that meets the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors? Mr. Bowman. Certainly the second, Congresswoman. I mean, the key point here is not only that impeaching Secretary Mayorkas will affect absolutely no change in border policy or border legislation. But even if impeaching a Cabinet Secretary could really accomplish something consequential, it would be terrible for the country because it would overthrow the basic principle of separation of powers on which the Constitution and our system of government are actually based. Congress and the Executive are supposed to work together to solve the country's problems. They're often going to disagree about how to do that. But in our system, the solution is the hard work of legislation, of negotiation, of compromise, of coalition building. Impeachment is not and never has been the answer and it is quite clear that the Framers intended it not for that purpose whatsoever. They intended it for the most extraordinary circumstances, and simply to resolve, you know, a partisan political debate or to change policy, is not it. Ms. Clarke. Thank you for your response. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Strong. For the committee room, Mr. Strong will be the last. Then we will go vote and come back at 2:15. So, Mr. Strong, you are recognized. Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Attorney General Knudsen, I was glad to see you mention in your testimony that Secretary Mayorkas has regularly hidden behind the concept of prosecutorial discretion. I like how you said that, because that right there is one of the big issues. Today, specifically, we have talked about Secretary Mayorkas' abuse of prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement and removal of illegal aliens in the United States. I want to highlight again Secretary Mayorkas' 2021 memo in which he stated the fact that an individual is a removable alien, therefore, should not alone be the basis of an enforcement action against them. He went on to list factors that ICE agents should weigh when deciding whether to pursue enforcement and removal or not. Attorney General Knudsen, as a former prosecutor yourself, does it make any sense to give credence to mitigating factors when considering whether to prosecute someone that has already been proven to have broken the law when they crossed our border illegally? Mr. Knudsen. Congressman, certainly not, especially when there's specific directive in Federal law that requires that person be detained and be prosecuted. The idea that individual prosecutorial discretion suddenly means you have the right to blanket, en masse, pardon people or parole them into the heartland of the country that simply does not exist in statute. I agree with the concept generally of prosecutorial discretion on a case-by-case basis, and indeed, that's what the Federal law allows. But that's not what's being done here. It's being just implemented on a mass scale, wide open, en masse, and that is simply not justified anywhere in Federal code. Mr. Strong. Thank you. I must say I was disappointed to see that the factors in favor of removal didn't include this significant financial and human cost to American citizens. Our hospitals are inundated with illegals. Schools are overrun with non-English speaking, setting other students back, and now New York has sent teachers and American students home and turning public schools into bunker houses for illegal aliens. This is totally unacceptable. Attorney General Bailey and Knudsen, you both specifically mentioned in your testimony that you do not view the crisis at the Southern Border as a resource issue. In other words, you both--each explain to the committee why this is the case. Mr. Bailey. Certainly. That's what our lawsuit's about, his refusal to build the border wall, is all about. He is flaunting the commands of this body. He is nullifying your Constitutional authority over the power of the purse. When that authority is no longer effective, impeachment is the last option. I would point out that what we have here is not a policy disagreement. It's a willful violation to carry out an explicit directive of this body and an abdication of his official duties. Mr. Knudsen. Mr. Chairman, Congressman, I would add that, you know, resources are being moved down there regularly. I mentioned I'm a Northern Border State. We have nearly 600 miles of border with Canada in my State. There's a large Customs and Border Control contingent in Montana. Most of those individuals have told me they've been cycled down to the Southern Border. The problem is not the number of agents down there. The problem is they are being instructed by Secretary Mayorkas to stand down and to not follow Federal law. That's the issue here. Mr. Strong. Thank you. On September 6, 2023, the DHS Office of Inspector General released its report titled, ``DHS Does Not Have Assurance That All Migrants Can Be Located Once Released Into the United States.'' That title alone should concern every single person in America. This investigation reviewed nearly 1 million migrant records and found that addresses for more than 177,000 migrants were either missing, invalid for delivery, or not legitimate residential locations. That is nearly 20 percent if you look at this, and that right there is totally unacceptable. We talk about leadership by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Well, you think about this. The first thing that I saw at the Southern Border on one of my many visits is I noticed 20,288 border wall panels in storage. I came back to the District of Columbia and found out that those 20,288 panels being stored in 3 different States, costing the American taxpayer more than $300 million. This is how they solve or try to work to solve the problem at the Southern Border. This is totally unacceptable and this is another reason that we are here. Mr. Bowman, you are a Constitutional law expert. Should President Trump have been impeached for a Russian hoax where the Steele dossier was created and paid for by the Clinton campaign? What do you think about that? Should that have happened? What were you teaching in your classroom? Chairman Green. Go ahead and answer the question and then we will--that will---- Mr. Strong. Mr. Chairman, I will yield to you because I know he doesn't want to answer that question. Chairman Green. Do you not want the gentleman--OK. All right. The gentleman yields. We will recess now until 2:15. We have two votes. I need to chat real quick with the witnesses just to make sure that you guys can stay. We are in recess, 2:15.  Chairman Green. I now recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Brecheen, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Brecheen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the witnesses for being here, especially you have got somebody that traveled all the way from Oklahoma to be here. I just want to reiterate after the break, just for the American people to know, it is important that we follow the rule of law. I love, you know, commonly said now, to be the rule of law team. It requires discipline, it requires focus. It requires that, you know, we don't turn ourselves into a banana republic. Article II, section 4, says, ``The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The Constitution absolutely gives authority to impeach and remove the President, Vice President, and all civil officers for treason, bribery, high crimes, and misdemeanors. This tool was inherited from English practice in which Parliament impeached and convicted ministers in favorites of the Crown in a struggle to rein in abuse of power. That is the historical precedent on this. Let me back that up, OK. So it has been talked about this morning, Federalist 65 has some admonitions, has some warnings, and it says the subjects-- within the context of impeachment, in Federalist 65, written by Alexander Hamilton, it says, ``The subjects of its jurisdiction,'' talking about impeachment, ``are those offenses in which proceed from the misconduct of public men or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' It goes on to say that, ``The model from which the instrument impeachment,'' the idea of this institution has been borrowed, pointed out the course to be the convention in Great Britain, ``it is the province of the House of Commons to prefer the impeachment and the House of Lords to decide upon it.'' Two parts, just like we have employed in our Constitution. ``Several of the State constitutions have followed this example, as well as the latter, as the former seem to have regard the practice of impeachment as the bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of government.'' You know why I love that? I grew up in the performance horse industry, and I learned three stage stops from a father who trained cutting horses professionally. You sit down, they feel the pressure of that. Then you say, whoa. Then a well- trained, well-disciplined animal learns that when they feel the three-stage stop coming, they are going to park it without having to lift the 4 ounces of the reins of the bridle. The problem is we have got men and women who serve in positions of authority, and the definition, according to AQHA, of a reining horse, I love this is ``willfully guided, willfully controlled.'' The problem is when you have men and women in influence who aren't willfully guided and willfully controlled by the Constitution, the Constitution as stated by Alexander Hamilton, the job of the legislative body is to grab the reins and say, whoa. We have an out-of-place, out-of-their- floodplain bureaucracy within Homeland Security that is doing what they want to, not following the rule of law. So with that said, the question is before us, are there instances of fact where Mayorkas has flippantly disregarded the laws enacted by Congress? Point No. 1, parole, section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration Nationality Act says parole shall only be granted on a case-by-case basis, only for urgent humanitarian reasons, or significant public benefit. Mayorkas has not done that. He's created broad parole programs for 30,000 aliens per month, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, without evidence of humanitarian reasons or without significant public benefit. Point No. 2, resources in fiscal year 2020, Congress explicitly appropriated funds for constructions of barrier systems, as our AG has talked about from Missouri, part of your lawsuit was over this. Barrier systems along the Southwest Border, Mayorkas refused to comply with Congress' appropriation, refused to build barrier systems, as Congress said, as a will of the people. The power of the purse. Point No. 3, detention, section 235(b)(1) of Immigration and Nationality Act outlines the procedures by which aliens attempting to enter the United States without a visa or proper immigration papers are to be detained and removed. Mayorkas has not done this. His agency has released several million illegal aliens who should have been detained and deported. Question, Mr. Bowman, you have been invited by the Democrats to provide your advice as a professor, and you said that the impeachment of Mayorkas needs to be based on not policy differences, but it has to be, quote, ``has to be subversion of the Constitution,'' another quote from you, ``for illegal ends or serious offenses.'' Is that correct, yes or no? That you said those statements, ``has to be subversion of the Constitution for illegal ends or serious offenses.'' Yes or no? Mr. Bowman. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? You're speaking---- Mr. Brecheen. You said it. It is on record. I need to kind- of watch my time and move on through this. To the attorney generals in the room, is not administering the laws of the land a serious offense for illegal ends? Does it rise the level of high crimes and misdemeanors? Please, each of you, please answer that question. Mr. Knudsen. Absolutely, Congressman. Mr. Drummond. It does rise. Mr. Bailey. Unequivocally, yes. Mr. Brecheen. We have got three attorney generals who say that the violation of these laws is a violation of the enforcement of the law and is grounds of high crimes and misdemeanors, which the Constitution clearly lays out is high crimes and misdemeanors as a reason for impeachment. What we tolerate, we empower. Congress has to do its job and send a strong signal. If you don't follow the law, you are going to be out. Thank you. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Crane, for 5 minutes. Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, guys, for showing up. You guys aren't exactly attorney generals of Southern Border States, are you? But even you guys are feeling the effects of what is coming across that Southern Border. Is that true? Mr. Knudsen. Absolutely. Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Crane. Gentlemen, how long, roughly, did it take you to become attorney general? Go ahead, Mr. Knudsen. Mr. Knudsen. Well, roughly how long? I mean, I campaigned for the better part of a year. Mr. Crane. No, entire career. Just like 20 years, 15 years, how long did it---- Mr. Knudsen. Oh, roughly, 15 years. Mr. Crane. What about you, Mr. Drummond? Mr. Drummond. Forty. Mr. Crane. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey. Been practicing law for 10 years. Mr. Crane. Yes. So you guys just didn't wake up one day and say, I want to be attorney general, and snap, that happened, right? I noticed that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been trying to diminish, you know, your qualifications. What is the primary responsibility of the Federal Government, Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen. Primary responsibility of the Federal Government is to carry out and execute the laws of the Congress. Mr. Crane. Yes. Is it to protect our unalienable God-given rights, as well? Mr. Knudsen. Absolutely. Mr. Crane. What about, does our Government have a responsibility to protect its citizens, Mr. Bailey? Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Crane. Are any of you guys familiar with Article IV, section 4 of our Constitution, often called the invasion clause? Anybody? Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Crane. I am going to read it real quick. ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a Republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion.'' Now, there's arguments right now about whether or not this is an invasion, but it is tough to argue when you have the equivalent of a combat division size of illegals coming across our Southern Border. For those of you that don't know, that is 10,000 individuals every single day in invasion. We have talked about what comes with those individuals from crime, you know, the economic burdens on our citizens, the families being destroyed of fentanyl. You guys are all familiar with that. You guys see them every single day in your own States, is that correct? Mr. Knudsen. Yes. Mr. Crane. Thank you. Are you guys aware of the job title of Alejandro Mayorkas, Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen. His specific job title is Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Crane. Secretary of Homeland Security. Now, I am no Constitutional scholar, Mr. Drummond, but just from that job title alone, would you assess that maybe his job might be to secure and protect the homeland? Mr. Drummond. He has the duty to control and guard our homeland. Mr. Crane. Mr. Bailey, is Secretary Mayorkas doing that? Mr. Bailey. He has abdicated his official legal responsibilities and his moral and ethical responsibilities to this Nation. Mr. Crane. Mr. Knudsen, is he doing that? Mr. Knudsen. He absolutely is not. He is derelict in many of those duties. Mr. Crane. One of my colleagues talked about the difference between individuals crossing on the terror watch list between the Biden administration, Secretary Mayorkas, and the former administration. Those numbers were a stark contrast. Under the last administration, 14 individuals on the terror watch list came through, were encountered at that Southern Border. Under this administration, and we still have several months to go in this new year, already 300 individuals on the terror watch list. Are you gentlemen aware of how many individuals it took to pull off 9/11? Mr. Knudsen. Not 300. Mr. Crane. Yep. It was about 19. Does it concern you guys, as folks that are concerned with the security of citizens in your State, that something like that might happen in the United States of America or your State? Mr. Knudsen. Absolutely. Mr. Drummond. Yes. Mr. Bailey. Yes. Mr. Crane. You guys talked about it all day long, and I find it interesting that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle kept saying that we are grandstanding here or we are just campaigning, you know, or these are political differences. But you guys, all three of you, and we went over how long it took you to get in your positions, you guys are like the highest law enforcement officials in your State. You guys all went over not just the policy differences, but the different laws that this Secretary is in violation of. Mr. Knudsen, can you go over some of those really quick? Mr. Knudsen. I absolutely can. I think the Secretary is clearly in violation of U.S.C. 8, section 1225. He's clearly violated section 1182 by granting mass parole. The Immigration and Naturalization Act makes it very clear that that is not to be granted on a mass bass. That's to be granted on a case-by- case, individual basis. Mr. Crane. Yep. Thank you, sir. Ms. Jackson and Mr. Bowman both said that betrayal of a nation is one of the criteria necessary for impeachment. If allowing the equivalent of an army division of illegals coming across the Southern Border on a daily basis, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands due to fentanyl every single--about 100,000 every year, enabling the sex trade in this country, along with the importation of thousands of MS-13 gang members, causing the encounters of individuals on the terror watch list to go from 14 under the last administration to 300 on this administration, lying to Congress about having operational control, costing the American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars for housing and care for these illegals, and more than 24,000 people from the Republic of China coming across our Southern Border in this last year alone, if those aren't betrayal to a nation, I don't know what is. Thank you, gentlemen, for your time. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes for his closing arguments. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much. Let me thank our witnesses for being here today. This hearing has confirmed what we already know over 4 hours ago. This so-called impeachment is nothing more than a thinly-veiled political stunt. My Republican colleagues have failed to make a case for impeachment, failed to understand the Constitution, and failed to do anything to address challenges at the border. This hearing has been more Republican rehash. Attempting to impeach the Secretary over policy differences instead of working with Democrats on immigration and border policy reform demonstrates that Republicans are not only interested in using border security as a political talking point. This impeachment scheme is simply more distraction from a do-nothing Republican Congress. They talk about H.R. 2, a disastrous bill they wrote in secret without any opportunity for Democratic input, knowing very well that it was dead on arrival in the Senate. The so- called investigation that Chairman Green has launched has been conducted with a predetermined outcome from the start. Now our Republican colleagues are trying to pretend that this effort isn't political. Mr. Chairman, the American people will see through such an incredibly obvious sham. No matter how many times my Republican colleagues twist the facts to suit their narrative, there is absolutely no evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has committed an impeachable offense. No amount of yelling, finger-pointing, false righteousness, indignation can change that fact. We heard today from Professor Bowman the consensus from Constitutional scholars is clear: Republicans have not made a case for impeachment. Even Republicans' favorite Constitutional scholar, Jonathan Turley, has come out against this impeachment, not just because it is baseless, but because it is what a dangerous precedent it would set. As Professor Turley explained, impeaching Secretary Mayorkas ``is a slippery slope that we would be wise to avoid.'' Indeed, it is precisely the temptation the Framers thought that they had avoided by rejecting standards for maladministration. It is no accident that Democrats invited a legal scholar to this hearing, while Republicans invited three partisan politicians. The Republican witnesses have no expertise in impeachment. One of the witnesses is facing 41 ethics charges. Another witness, the State Supreme Court, unanimously found he failed to perform the plain, unequivocal, and ministerial duties of approving information for a ballot initiative. But again, no expertise on impeachment. All we learned today from the Majority witnesses is that some Republican politicians don't like a Democratic Cabinet Secretary. Republicans are pretending to provide accountability, just like they pretended to legislate these past months. In his opening, the Chairman said there was no reasonable alternative to pursuing impeachment. Let me suggest some alternatives. Republicans could have supported funding increases for border security operations instead of voting against them. Republicans could provide additional resources requested by CBP. They could engage with the administration on immigration. They have not. Republicans have failed to act at every turn. Instead of working with Democrats, they have wasted a year chasing a baseless impeachment to satisfy their most extreme right-wing members. But as what we have heard today, impeachment was never intended to be used that way. The Constitution's Framers expressly did not include mismanagement, misgovernment, or maladministration as a basis for impeaching a Cabinet Secretary. My Republican colleagues may disagree with this administration's border policy, and that is their right. But to use impeachment to settle such differences is unconstitutional. Mr. Chairman, I understand the last year has been a tough one for Republicans and that your party would like to deflect attention elsewhere. This is the very kind-of thing that the Framers worked to avoid when establishing grounds for impeachment. Three years ago, Mr. Chairman, you wrote, ``Unity can be only achieved by focusing on where we find common ground instead of drawing new battle lines, and that every one of us has a role in bridging the divide.'' When Chairman Green is ready to listen to his own words, I want to be clear, Democrats will be here waiting to work on responsible and effective policies to strengthen our border security using the levers of power that the Constitution actually gives Congress. But until then, we will continue calling this sham impeachment for what it is, a political stunt. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Green. The gentlemen yields. Before I start my closing statement, I just want to make an observation. It is very interesting that we point out that Mr. Bishop can't talk political stuff about running for election, but all the testimony from the left has been about politics, about running for office, and about--so I just find it fascinating. But anyway, I recognize myself for my closing statement. Today we have heard powerful testimonies from the attorneys general of three States who are dealing with the consequences of Secretary Mayorkas' border crisis. I want to thank you all for being here and for your testimony and, of course, I will thank Mr. Bowman for being here, as well. As our witnesses made it abundantly clear, every State is now a border State. Why are we here? We are here because Secretary Mayorkas' policies were exploited by the drug cartels and have done incredible damage to the United States. Those policies were in violation of the laws passed by this Congress. The Congress said the INA detain, parole is an exception based on extreme circumstances, not 85 percent, as the Secretary says, is now just being released into the country willy nilly. It is a violation of law. Interestingly enough, so he has disregarded the Congress. He has also disregarded the Judiciary branch. Four court rulings said cease and desist because you are breaking the law. I am sorry. I took the oath at age 17 to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The oath wasn't to the American people. It wasn't to defend the landmass or the flag. It was to defend the Constitution. This Secretary took the same oath to defend the Constitution. Well, I am sorry, but I think the Constitution of the United States says we write the laws and not him get to pick and choose whatever the heck he wants to when he is the Executive branch and gets to execute the laws. He is to execute the laws as written. That is the Constitution he took an oath to. Four court orders, cease and desist because you are breaking the law, and he disregards the Judiciary branch and continues his policy. In fact, he doubles down, creating more policies that do even more catch-and-release, which is why I think it is intentional. He is abusing his position to force his woke immigration policies on the United States of America, despite the fact that Congress is supposed to fix those immigration laws. On top of that, back on script now, on top of that, Secretary Mayorkas knows full well the consequences of these policies, but instead, he is reversing course, he is doubling down. It is worse. He has been to the border. He has seen the numbers. He has seen the fentanyl seizures. He has met with the grieving families. He knows about the cartels. He knows about the human trafficking and the child exploitation. Yet he doesn't change a thing. In fact, as I said, he admitted to the Border Patrol the other day in a closed meeting, 85 percent are being released. Despite the intentionality behind this open border, Secretary Mayorkas is attempting to skirt the consequences of his actions. He has continuously tried to deflect, blaming climate change, wars in Latin America, nonexistent DHS budget cuts. There have been no budget cuts. What is the cost of Secretary Mayorkas' border crisis? Fentanyl poisoning is killing thousands of young people every year. We learned from Attorney General Bailey that a total of 43 Missouri children died from unintentional--unintentional-- accidental, they didn't have a choice. We had testimony over here, if Americans would just stop using drugs. Those little babies didn't have a choice. That baby on a VRBO in Florida certainly didn't have a choice. She wasn't able to just say no. My heart breaks for this baby and her parents. Because of this border crisis, thousands of mothers won't get to see their kids graduate. Thousands of fathers won't be able to walk their daughters down the aisle at those weddings. As a parent myself, that breaks my heart. That is the human cost. Apparently I need to explain to my colleagues, while it is accurate that most of the fentanyl is seized at the CBP, you know, intercepted at the official points of entry, this is because those facilities are equipped for that purpose. Yet we also know that drugs are coming across between ports of entry. It simply isn't being caught. This is because Border Patrol agents are tied up processing people at the crossing sites. It is not like we can put the entire border as an X-ray machine or a CT scanner. While my Democrat colleagues may not believe me, I hope that they will believe those on the front lines. Border Patrol agents have told us that drugs coming between the ports of entry is a key driver of the rising fentanyl crisis. Why else has fentanyl gone on the street from 98 bucks a hit to 25 bucks a hit after this Secretary came into office? It is because of the simple supply and demand of coming across the Southern Border. We have also heard that Federal officials--from Federal officials that they believe they only apprehend roughly 5 to 10 percent of the fentanyl coming in. That is from the border. They are only catching 5 to 10 percent. What really matters here isn't how much fentanyl is caught, but how much fentanyl is flooding the neighborhoods. We got 3 guys here from 3 States just discredited by the Ranking Member, but they are here to testify what is happening in their States. You know what? Some of us heard you. Some of us heard you. People are dying because of this. Because of Secretary Mayorkas' border crisis, cities and States Nation-wide struggle to pay first responders while health care and education systems falter. In fact, medical care for undocumented aliens will cost $7 billion this year. We also heard from Attorney General Drummond about the organized criminal operations and that some illegal aliens run once they arrive. He shared that in Oklahoma alone, the AG office prosecuted 50 complex, multijurisdictional criminal cases, most of them involving Mexican and Chinese drug cartels coming across the Southern Border. Make no mistake, these human trafficking and drug trafficking rings are sophisticated, and they have taken a foothold in the United States because of our open border. Finally, we can't negate the credible threat this open border poses to our national security. With emboldened Islamic terrorist groups and an increasingly aggressive Communist Chinese Party, we have to wonder how many bad actors are in that 1.8 million known gotaways and how many are in the unknown gotaways? Well, we won't know until something tragic happens. When we embarked on this investigation almost a year ago, we knew there would be roadblocks and that it would be a formidable challenge. No matter how hard this process gets, Homeland Republicans will not back down. The American people deserve answers, accountability, and ultimately, an end to the border crisis. Look, if you have a Secretary, a Cabinet Secretary, who breaks the laws or refuses to obey the laws of Congress, refuses to adhere to the rulings of a judiciary, cease-and- desist orders from a judge, I mean, that is lawlessness on his own part. If it were me, a Republican, I would expect to be impeached. You can't have Cabinet Secretaries that just decide to do whatever the heck they want to do. The Committee on Homeland Security has made every effort to ensure that this investigation was thorough. We do not take this lightly. The Homeland Security Committee spent almost a year, countless hours. We held 10 hearings, we heard from two dozen witnesses, released 5 reports totaling 300 pages. We conducted numerous transcribed interviews, border chiefs, multiple visits to the border to see for ourselves. I don't hold any personal animosity toward Secretary Mayorkas, but I sure as hell don't want to see him continue as Secretary of Homeland Security, not after the pain and turmoil and chaos his policies have inflicted on the American people. When Congressional oversight demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that Executive branches are neglecting their duty, overstepping their authority, ignoring laws passed by Congress, it is our duty to act to defend this institution, to defend the Constitution. Also, just to be clear, this is the responsibility of Congress. The Supreme Court made it clear in United States v. Texas, according to the Court, and I quote, ``Even though the Federal Courts lack Article 3 jurisdiction over the suit, other forums remain open for examining the Executive branch's arrest policies. For example, Congress poses an array of tools to analyze and influence these policies. Those are political checks for a political process.'' So, no. So not only do these proceedings have the support of the House, the Supreme Court has pointed to impeachment as a source of relief for States suffering a border crisis put together, orchestrated by a Secretary who is violating the laws passed by Congress and disregarding the court's orders. Now, before I end, I would like to address a few things that--other things my Democrat colleagues have said. Let me start with saying I am very disappointed in the Ranking Member for misquoting me. He claimed that I wrote that I will not support another dime to DHS. This is inaccurate. What I wrote was, I will not support another dime to DHS until the policies of H.R. 2 are signed into law and enforced by the administration. We are talking about the supplemental. So we are not talking about the budget, which has already gone through and passed the House. We are talking about additional dollars in a supplemental. To suggest that I would defund the Department of Homeland Security is disingenuous at best. I can tell you there have been a lot of Democrats who have said defund ICE and defund the police. I never said defund Homeland Security. I would also like to address the claim that Secretary Mayorkas isn't at fault here, that he isn't to blame for the economic crisis in Latin America. I agree. But poverty in Latin America is nothing too new. Actually, poverty rates in Latin America have stayed flat from last administration to this one. Further, I would like to reiterate, the Democrats sent these Articles of Impeachment to our committee in November. They sent it to this committee. The Homeland Security Committee has the authority of the House to conduct these impeachment proceedings, and that is exactly what we are going to do. Democrats can bring up a New York Times popcorn story all they want to. They keep talking about MAGA Republicans and former President Trump this and that. But it is clear these are deflections because they have no answers for the piss-poor performance of Secretary Mayorkas and his policies. Let me just point out, my Democrat colleagues are quick to talk about kids in cages under Trump, but did a single one of them mention the 85,000 missing UACs under President Biden? Of course not. The hypocrisy in this room is palpable. Of course, our guide should always be the intent of the Framers of our Constitution, the Founding Fathers, regarding how the Constitution was intended to be understood. But too often in political debates, people can fall into inconsistency for possibly partisan reasons. I get that. For example, Professor Bowman wrote a book on impeachment in 2019 called ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump''. In it, he states, the power of the House to impeach Cabinet Secretaries, ``remains important as a signal of legislative displeasure with administrative personnel and policy.'' Yet today, he has testified on multiple occasions that policy alone isn't enough for an impeachment. That is what Professor Bowman wrote when Donald Trump was President. But now in his written testimony at page 3, he writes that impeachment, and I quote, ``should not be attempted based on simple policy disagreements between Congress and the Executive branch.'' I guess that was then and this is now. But let me be clear, no one is supporting impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas over policy differences. The impeachable offenses relate to violations of the law. Insisting on enforcing the law as written by Congress is not a policy difference. It is a fundamental requirement of the Constitution. Last, I got to tell you, I was appalled from someone on the left who said--suggested this has all been a waste of time. We are here today because it is our duty to provide oversight and hold the Executive branch accountable. Yes, this includes the option to impeach. We cannot allow a Cabinet Secretary to violate the laws, disregard the Constitutional structure, lie to Congress under oath, all to massive harm to the Americans, and do nothing about it. If a Republican were head of DHS and committing these same acts, I can assure you we wouldn't tolerate it from them either. It is the Homeland Security Committee's responsibility to provide oversight of DHS. This is what we were elected to do. This is what we were appointed to this committee for. Now, this might not be how you want to spend your time, but it certainly is how we must be spending our time. I ask the Members here today, is fighting to stop the needless death of children to fentanyl poisoning a waste of time? Is it a waste of time to try to protect those kids? Is trying to stop criminal cartels from wreaking havoc on the country a waste of time? It is not. The insinuation is appalling. What has been a waste of time? What has been a waste? The amount of taxpayer dollars this border crisis has cost. The amount of people who have died as a result of fentanyl flowing across our Southern Border, the amount of migrants who have lost their lives making the dangerous journey, the amount of money State and local governments have had to spend cleaning up Secretary Mayorkas' mess, this is where the real waste has been, not these official proceedings. As we continue these proceedings in the coming days, it is important that the American people remember the facts, that this body once again embraces our Constitutional responsibilities. When I took that oath as a young boy on the plane at West Point, it meant something to me. When I took it when the people of Tennessee sent me up here, it meant just as much, if not more. We will support the basic tenets of that document. That is Congress writes the laws, the President executes those laws, the Judiciary interprets those laws, and they have a responsibility to do their duty and we do, also. Without objection, that ends my closing statement. Without objection, the committee stands adjourned.  A P P E N D I X I ---------- Letter From Constitutional Law Experts Submitted For the Record by Hon. Glenn Ivey January 10, 2024. Speaker Mike Johnson, H-232, The Capitol, Washington, DC 20515. Chairman Mark Green, 2446 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515. Constitutional Law Experts on the Impeachment Proceedings Against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas Senior Republicans in the House of Representatives--including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Chairman Mark Green of the Committee on Homeland Security--have stated that they intend to pursue an impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. This proceeding will apparently occur in the Committee on Homeland Security on an accelerated timeframe. As scholars of the Constitution, considering the facts currently known and the charges publicly described, we hereby express our view that an impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas would be utterly unjustified as a matter of constitutional law. Although House Republicans have offered various justifications for an impeachment, the underlying basis appears to be their view that Secretary Mayorkas's policy decisions have degraded border security and involved objectionable uses of enforcement discretion. House Republicans have also publicly asserted that Secretary Mayorkas testified falsely in stating that he is enforcing existing Federal law and that the southern border is closed and secure. When the Framers designed the Constitution's impeachment provisions, they made a conscious choice not to allow impeachment for mere ``maladministration''--in other words, for incompetence, poor judgment, or bad policy. Instead, they provided that impeachment could be justified only by truly extraordinary misconduct: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' U.S. Const., art. II, 4. Thus, as Charles L. Black, Jr. noted in his influential handbook, impeachment is not permitted for ``mere inefficient administration, or administration that  not accord with Congress's view of good policy:'' Simply put, the Constitution forbids impeachment based on policy disagreements between the House and the executive branch, no matter how intense or high stakes those differences of opinion. Yet that is exactly what House Republicans appear poised to undertake. The charges they have publicly described come nowhere close to meeting the constitutional threshold for impeachment. Their proposed grounds for impeaching Secretary Mayorkas are the stuff of ordinary (albeit impassioned) policy disagreement in the field of immigration enforcement. If allegations like this were sufficient to justify impeachment, the separation of powers would be permanently destabilized. It is telling that there is absolutely no historical precedent for the impeachment charges that House Republicans have articulated. To the contrary, on the rare occasions that Members of the House have proposed impeaching executive officials for their handling of immigration matters, the House has properly retreated from that grave step. We hold a wide range of views on the wisdom and success of Secretary Mayorkas's approach to immigration policy. But we are in agreement that impeaching him based on the charges set forth by House Republicans would be a stark departure from the Constitution. Of course, our institutional affiliations are listed for identification purposes only, and our signatures reflect our personal capacity, not any position on behalf of our employers.

A P P E N D I X I I ---------- Questions From Hon. August Pfluger for Austin Knudsen Question 1. The Speaker of the House recently released a memorandum detailing the exact Biden administration actions that have undermined border security and encouraged illegal immigration. In January of 2021, the administration issued an Executive Action ending limitations and restrictions against immigration from certain countries associated with terrorism. This dangerous call served as an invitation to adversaries and foreign threats, nearly welcoming them to our backyards. Despite being so far from the Southern Border, do you believe suspected terrorists have successfully avoided Border Patrol and law enforcement, and may be residing in Montana? Answer. More than 280 people on the terrorist watch list have been identified at the Southwest Border by Border Patrol during the Biden administration, including 169 in fiscal year 2023.\1\ The horrific Hamas attacks on Israel shine even more light on the risks the open border has created. Last year, a leaked CBP document recognized that ``foreign fighters'' from terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah ``may attempt to travel to or from the area of hostilities in the Middle East via circuitous transit across the Southwest Border.''\2\ It is reasonable to assume that many ``foreign fighters'' who are enemies of the United States and people on the terrorist watch list have slipped through the cracks and may be residing in Montana. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics. \2\ https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cbp-memo-sounds-alarm-hamas- hezbollah-fighters-potentially-using-southern-border-enter-us. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Question 1b. How is State and local law enforcement preparing for this possibility? Answer. Montana law enforcement prepares for terrorism-related issues by strengthening collaboration and information sharing between all levels of law enforcement. Timely and relevant information on threats related to domestic violent extremism and terrorism issues is shared with partners through Montana's fusion center. Additionally, State law enforcement continues to build relationships with Canadian partners to strengthen information sharing related to border issues and threats of extremism. Question 1c. Has the crisis at our Southern Border pulled resources from our Northern Border, therefore creating vulnerabilities there as well? Answer. Yes, as noted in my written testimony, the Northern Border is also a grave concern to me. Border Patrol agents from Montana have rotated to assist with the crisis at the Southern Border, leaving 545 miles of border between Montana and Canada open to additional vulnerabilities with less staffing by the Federal Government. So far, during fiscal year 2024, CBP has reported 54 encounters at the Havre Sector of the Northern Border. During the same time during fiscal year 2023, there had been 18 encounters and 28 encounters in 2022.\3\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Questions From Hon. August Pfluger for Andrew Bailey Question 1a. The Speaker of the House recently released a memorandum detailing the exact Biden administration actions that have undermined border security and encouraged illegal immigration. In January of 2021, the administration issued an Executive Action ending limitations and restrictions against immigration from certain countries associated with terrorism. This dangerous call served as an invitation to adversaries and foreign threats, nearly welcoming them to our backyards. Mr. Bailey: First of all, thank you for your service. Having combatted terrorism overseas, how have you seen a shift in the demands and approaches to public safety in your own State since the threats of an open border have picked up? Question 1b. Do you believe your State is equipped to handle the increase in potential threats of terrorism or malign activity? Answer. Recently, the Daily Caller reported that Federal authorities caught an Al-Shabaab terrorist at the Southern Border and released him into the country, where he roamed freely for a year before being arrested in Minnesota. This was one of many on the terrorist watch list that Secretary Mayorkas failed to apprehend due to his neglect of his Constitutional and statutory mandates to secure the border. This does not include the 264 known individuals on the terrorist watch list who attempted to illegally enter our Nation because Secretary Mayorkas has effectively posted a ``Come In, We're Open'' sign at the Southern Border. I did not serve in the United States Army during the War on Terror just to sit idly by as known or suspected terrorists enter our Nation without issue because Secretary Mayorkas refuses to do his job. As an armored cavalry officer deployed to Iraq, my unit was tasked with the same duty as Secretary Mayorkas: secure a Nation's border to protect its inhabitants from bad actors. I am proud to say that, unlike the Secretary, my unit was successful in this mission. When suspected terrorists were placed in our custody, they stayed there. The same cannot be said under Mayorkas. Rather than working to diligently protect Americans within our Nation's sovereign borders, he has knowingly turned a blind eye to suspected terrorists illegally entering our country. Mayorkas' inaction has placed an undue burden on the States, especially Missouri given its location in both the geographic and population centers of the country. Outfitted with interstate systems like the I-35, I-70 and I-44 corridors, Missouri serves as the crossroads of America and contains the fifth-most interstate miles nationally, far more than comparably-sized States. Thus, as a flood of illegal immigrants, drugs, and traffickers enter our State, we see first-hand the catastrophic toll an unsecured, open border takes on entire communities. Much of the harm of Secretary Mayorkas' failure to protect our citizens must be measured in the human toll from dangerous illegal drugs flowing into our country. Nearly 12,500 grams fentanyl were seized by the Missouri State Highway Patrol in 2023. It takes only 2 milligrams of fentanyl to cause an overdose death. To put this in perspective, with a population of more than 6 million people, 12,500 grams of fentanyl could kill Missouri's entire population twice over. There has also been a 500 percent surge in child fentanyl exposure deaths, a nearly 75 percent increase in fentanyl overdoses in Missouri between 2019 and 2023, and a total of 43 Missouri children died from unintentional fentanyl poisonings in 2022. And let's not forget that a significant amount of the toxic fentanyl poisoning in our communities comes from our global adversaries in China who are increasingly taking advantage of our open border. Missouri ranks fourth on the list of the States with the highest human trafficking rate in the United States, with 4.30 per 100,000 citizens. In large part, this is due to the three key interstates flowing through our major cities directly from the Southern Border. In 2021, the National Human Trafficking Hotline Database recorded 1,100 human trafficking tips in our State. Missouri law enforcement was able to rescue 327 victims from those tips. Most cases revolved around sex trafficking, with the NHTH recording 210 sex trafficking cases. Fifteen were labor trafficking-related. Across Missouri, law enforcement has been forced to adapt their tactics to combat these threats. From hiring specific overdose investigators, to debating a change in the way our criminal code treats drug traffickers, to creating a State-wide anti-human trafficking task force, Missouri has stepped up to protect its citizens in the face of Secretary Mayorkas' failures. My office is doing everything we can within the court system to force Secretary Mayorkas and his administration to secure the border, including pushing the three separate and distinct lawsuits described in my earlier testimony. However, no single State is properly equipped to face the impacts of our open border. That is precisely why our Founders prescribed a duty on the Federal Government to protect Americans against foreign threats. While the States can act as a stop-gap--and that is what many of us are attempting to do through lawsuits and increased prosecution-- this functionality is hindered when faced with the administration's unlawful and orchestrated refusal to enforce Federal immigration law. Secretary Mayorkas has abdicated his official responsibilities under the law, and Missouri communities are being ravaged as a result. He must be held accountable. I applaud the House of Representatives for pursuing the impeachment and removal of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The Senate must follow suit. Questions From Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson for Frank O. Bowman, III Question 1. Republicans have portrayed your previous academic writing as confirming their position that mere policy differences may be a ground for impeachment. In particular, that ``displeasure with administration personnel and policy'' may be sufficient to warrant impeachment. Is that correct? Answer. I have never written that mere policy differences would be an adequate ground for impeachment. To the contrary, I join with the consensus view of Constitutional scholars that ordinary policy differences are not a proper ground for impeachment. Indeed, this general principle is particularly applicable to a disagreement on policy between a Presidential administration and a political party controlling only one house of Congress, and that by the very narrowest of margins. The quotation to which the question alludes, one mentioned by Chairman Green and Rep. Bishop, occurs in the final paragraph of Chapter 4 of the second edition of my book, High Crimes & Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump (Cambridge Univ. Press 2023). Both Congressmen take the snippet of text they quote entirely out of context. In the referenced section of Chapter 4, I discuss the only prior impeachment of a U.S. Cabinet officer, President Ulysses Grant's Secretary of War, William Belknap. Prior to the quoted passage, I explained why no Cabinet officer before or after Belknap has been impeached. The primary, and obvious, reason is that, as I wrote, any Cabinet officer ``whose behavior veered anywhere near an impeachable zone'' was simply removed by the President.\1\ Which is what happened to Belknap. He took a bribe. When President Grant found out, he fired Belknap. But the House, controlled by Democrats for the first time since the Civil War, impeached the Secretary anyway as a means of politically damaging President Grant and by extension the Republicans in the upcoming 1876 election. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ FRANK O. BOWMAN, III, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS: A HISTORY OF IMPEACHMENT FOR THE AGE OF TRUMP (2d ed.) 120 (Cambridge Univ. Press 2023). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the final paragraph of Chapter 4, I was, of course, not saying that mere ``displeasure'' with either a person or a policy is a Constitutionally-acceptable ground for impeachment. Rather, when a subordinate official has actually committed ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors'' (as Secretary of War Belknap incontestably did), Congress might elect to proceed with impeachment to signal its displeasure. Secretary Mayorkas has not committed any impeachable offense. Impeaching a Cabinet officer innocent of ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors'' to indicate displeasure with administration policy or the officer's administration of that policy would be a profoundly anti-Constitutional act. Question 2. In the past, you have written that impeachable ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' can be interpreted to include ``serious executive misconduct, including . . . betrayal of the Nation's foreign policy interests'' such as when a President subordinates the Nation's interests to foreign interests. Republican Rep. Guest suggested that you have written in the past about foreign policy differences as grounds for the first impeachment of President Trump--what you describe as Trump's ``rolling destruction of American foreign policy''--and that your past writing contradicts your testimony at the January 10, 2024, hearing. Are foreign policy differences an impeachable offense, and how do foreign policy differences differ from ordinary policy differences? Answer. I have written that one of the accepted historical categories of impeachable conduct, in both the pre-1787 United Kingdom and in the United States, has been ``betrayal of the nation's foreign policy interests.''\2\ However, in saying this, I was obviously not saying that ordinary policy differences between a Presidential administration and the opposing political party become impeachable simply because the subject matter of the disagreement is foreign, rather than domestic, policy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ BOWMAN, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, supra note 1, at 39, 102; Frank O. Bowman, III, The Constitutional Case for Impeaching Donald Trump (Again), JUST SECURITY (Jan. 9, 2021). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To the contrary, long precedent establishes that, in the U.S. impeachment context, ``betrayal of the Nation's foreign policy interests'' has had certain identifying features. First, for impeachment purposes, a nation's ``foreign policy interests'' are not merely the transient preferences of a political party or faction. Rather, they are enduring interests about which there is a broad societal consensus, ideally one embodied in statutes, treaties, the practice of multiple Presidential administrations, and (where applicable) the views of a nation's diplomats, foreign policy experts or professionals. Second, the word ``betrayal'' implies, not merely changing policy or adopting policy views contrary to one's political adversaries, but subverting the national interest for illegitimate, often personal, motives. British impeachments that illustrate these features include the following. In 1667, after an expensive and unnecessary war with the Dutch, the Earl of Clarendon was impeached in part for seeking payments from France to the British crown to evade parliamentary controls on royal finance. In 1678, the Earl of Danby was impeached for soliciting--on behalf of the English King Charles II--a bribe from Louis XIV of France in return for English neutrality in the Franco-Dutch War. Both Clarendon and Danby's solicitations not only undercut long- standing British foreign policy objectives and subjected the British monarch to undue foreign influence, but were a bald attempt to avoid a significant parliamentary constraint on royal overreach--the requirement that the Crown obtain ``supplies'' (i.e., funding in addition to the monarch's private wealth) through the legislature. More relevant to the present case are the American impeachments of Senator William Blount in 1797-98 and of President Donald Trump in 2020. Sen. William Blount: Blount, then a U.S. Senator, concocted a scheme to enrich himself by giving Great Britain control of the territories of Louisiana and Florida. Blount's scheme was obviously contrary to contemporary U.S. foreign policy interests inasmuch as the American government and populace wanted to expand into Louisiana and Florida, or at the very least to prevent Great Britain from assuming control over those territories. In addition, the articles of impeachment against Blount charged him with violations of the Neutrality Act of 1794, and also with violation of the Treaty of Friendship, Limits, and Navigation between the United States and Spain (because his scheme involved stirring up Native American tribes to attack Spanish officials and interests). Not only was Blount's scheme undeniably contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests, and to multiple treaty obligations,\3\ but it was a ``betrayal'' in the most obvious sense. Blount tried to sell out the interests of his country for personal financial gain. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ As I have written elsewhere: ``Blount's scheme violated national foreign policy objectives shared by the Executive and Legislative branches. President Adams, and Washington before him, favored U.S. neutrality in the on-going European wars. Before Adams' election, Congress had passed legislation mandating neutrality and specifically barring the sort of buccaneering adventure against foreign states Blount was planning. The friendship treaty with Spain, negotiated by the Executive and ratified by the Senate, imposed an obligation on both nations not to stir up hostility against each other among the Indian nations. Similarly, U.S. policy toward the Indian nations, embodied in legislation, was to maintain peaceful relations and to avoid friction by dealing with them only through Governmentally- authorized agents. Finally, unstated in any treaty or statute, but widely understood, was a general desire to weaken the hold of European powers on lands bordering the United States, particularly land around the vital Mississippi waterway, leaving those territories available for American expansion and annexation. *** Blount's adventure ran afoul of all these objectives.'' BOWMAN, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, supra note 1, at 117-18. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although Blount was acquitted by the Senate, the historical consensus is that the verdict turned on the decision that senators are not ``civil officers'' subject to the impeachment remedy under Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution.\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ Id. at 115-16. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- President Donald Trump: President Trump's first impeachment involved two articles, the first charging that Trump committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' in relation to his scheme to coerce the government of Ukraine into announcing investigations into Trump's likely Presidential opponent, Joe Biden, and the second charging obstruction of Congress. The first article was captioned ``Abuse of Power,'' but as I have written, it ``braided together three themes . . . corruption, damage to foreign policy interests, and injury to the democratic process.''\5\ As the first article of impeachment summarized the matter: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ Id. at 331. ``President Trump abused the powers of the Presidency by ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit. He has also betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.''\6\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ House Resolution 755, 116th Cong. (Dec. 18, 2019). The ``national security and other vital national interests'' alluded to in the article were the interest of the United States in supporting, militarily and diplomatically, a country threatened, and indeed physically invaded, by Russia, a long-standing geopolitical opponent of the United States, together with the interest of the United States in preventing Russian territorial expansion up to the borders of the countries of the NATO alliance. These objectives had been endorsed as national security interests of the United States over multiple Presidential administrations through repeated bipartisan approval of legislation authorizing military and security aid to Ukraine.\7\ They were also endorsed by the entire diplomatic and national security apparatus of the U.S. Government before and during the Trump administration itself.\8\ For example, when Trump's White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) placed a hold on Congressionally-mandated aid to Ukraine in the July 2019 as part of President Trump's scheme to coerce Ukraine, every relevant agency of Trump's own administration except OMB questioned the hold and supported military assistance to Ukraine as being in the national security interest of the United States.\9\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\ BOWMAN, HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, supra note 1, at 313. \8\ Id. \9\ Report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Pursuant to H. Res. 660 in Consultation with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs (Dec. 2019), at 72-74. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thus, Trump's first impeachment precisely matches the template for ``betrayal of the nation's foreign policy interests'' described above. First, the foreign policy interests of the United States in that case were enduring interests embraced by multiple Presidential administrations, endorsed by the foreign policy professionals of the Executive branch, and manifested in bipartisan legislation enacted by multiple U.S. Congresses. Second, and critically, the ``betrayal'' of U.S. interests consisted of subverting the national interest for illegitimate personal motives--securing a personal political advantage over a potential political rival. In Trump's case, the betrayal was doubly severe because it amounted to an effort to use Presidential power to corrupt the democratic electoral process. Secretary Mayorkas: Nothing alleged against Secretary Mayorkas meets the traditional criteria for impeachment based on ``betrayal of the nation's foreign policy interests.'' The most that can be said against him is that he has executed the policy preferences of President Joe Biden in relation to immigration and border control issues and that the political party in control of the House of Representatives disapproves of those policy preferences.\10\ The most that can be said is that there has been litigation challenging some decisions by Secretary Mayorkas, none of which has to date resulted in a final decision contrary to the Secretary. Moreover, as I indicated in my written testimony to the committee, ``As a Constitutional matter, the existence of active litigation challenging discretionary actions by a Cabinet Secretary (or indeed by a President) is no ground for impeachment.'' Bowman, Written Statement to House Committee on Homeland Security (Jan. 10, 2024), at 9. There is no indication that the Secretary's actions, or indeed the Biden administration's policy choices, are contrary to established national foreign policy interests. To the contrary, U.S. policy regarding immigration and border control has varied from administration to administration and Congress to Congress as the challenges, needs, and preferences of the country have varied. More importantly, there is absolutely no indication that Secretary Mayorkas has taken any official action for corrupt or illegitimate personal motives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ Republican Members of this committee have contended that Secretary Mayorkas is not merely executing Biden administration policy preferences but ``violating the law.'' However, as I have demonstrated elsewhere, that is not the case. See Frank O. Bowman, III, Republicans Are Calling to Impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Here's Why Their Case is Bunk, JUST SECURITY (March 13, 2023), https:// www.justsecurity.org/85427/republicans-are-calling-to-impeach-homeland- security-secretary-alejandro-mayorkas-heres-why-their-case-is-bunk/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To repeat the central point, ordinary policy differences between a Presidential administration and the opposing political party do not become impeachable simply because the subject matter of the disagreement is foreign, rather than domestic, policy. Question 3. Rep. Crane suggested that Secretary Mayorkas has betrayed the Nation, and that betrayal of the Nation would be sufficient to warrant impeachment. Are you aware of any evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has betrayed the United States? And Rep. Crane further suggested that you said ``betrayal of the Nation'' is a potential ground for impeachment, whereas you actually said ``betrayal of the Nation's foreign policy interests'' is a ground for impeachment. What precisely did you mean? Answer. I did not say in my testimony to the committee or elsewhere that that ``betrayal of the nation'' is a ground for impeachment. I have agreed with Charles Black that one decent definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that covers most cases is offenses ``which are extremely serious, which in some way corrupt or subvert the political and governmental process, and which are plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor, or to a good citizen, regardless of words on the statute books.'' Nothing alleged against Secretary Mayorkas meets this general definition of impeachable conduct. I have also written that one specific category of impeachable ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is ``betrayal of the Nation's foreign policy interests.'' In my previous answer, I explain what is meant by that phrase for purposes of impeachment and I demonstrate why Secretary Mayorkas' conduct does not fall within it. Finally, I am aware of no evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has betrayed the Nation. To the contrary, based on the facts of which I am aware, Secretary Mayorkas appears to be a capable, dedicated public servant trying as best he can to carry out the policy priorities of the President of the United States and to manage the perennial and intractable problems related to immigration and control of the U.S. Southern Border.
