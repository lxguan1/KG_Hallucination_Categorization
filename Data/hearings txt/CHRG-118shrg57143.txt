CYBERSPACE UNDER THREAT IN THE ERA
OF RISING AUTHORITARIANISM
AND GLOBAL COMPETITION
----------
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2024
U.S. Senate,
Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific,
and International Cybersecurity Policy,
Committee on Foreign Relations,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in
room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Chris Van
Hollen presiding.
Present: Senators Van Hollen , Helmy, Romney,
and Ricketts.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MARYLAND
Senator Van Hollen. This meeting of the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and
International Cybersecurity Policy will come to order.
I would like to begin by thanking Ranking Member Romney--
Senator Romney--for your partnership in convening this hearing
to discuss threats to cyberspace and internet freedom in an era
of rising authoritarianism and global competition.
We are grateful to be joined by an experienced panel,
including Laura Cunningham, the president of the Open
Technology Fund; David Kaye, a clinical professor of law at UC
Irvine; and Jamil Jaffer, the executive director of the
National Security Initiative, all of whom I will introduce a
little more fully in a moment.
At the beginning of this century there was optimism about
the democratizing power of the internet. Technologies that we
now take for granted such as the internet itself, social media,
and smart phones were revolutionary, helping connect humankind
in unprecedented ways and creating opportunities for people to
challenge authoritarian and repressive governments.
We saw these technologies used by the 2009 green movement
in Iran and then the Arab Spring as well as other digitally
organized demonstrations around the world, and these
technologies continue to hold that promise.
But the use of these technologies to enable protest
movements and dissent prompted a backlash from authoritarian
governments who recognize that digital connectivity in the
hands of their peoples could pose a threat to their grip on
power.
As a result, these regimes and repressive governments
quickly sought to develop methods to restrict the free flow of
information, to limit political discourse online, and to
suppress freedom of expression including, in many cases,
seeking to silence their expat and diaspora communities abroad.
To do so these governments turned to a host of technologies to
track and disrupt dissent.
Fast forward to today, and we have witnessed an explosion
of new technologies and practices such as internet shutdowns,
censorship techniques, mass surveillance, and facial
recognition technologies, commercial spyware, and other tools
that are used to suppress public dissent. And sadly, in many
ways repressive regimes are succeeding in this space.
According to Freedom House's 2023 ``Freedom on the Net''
report, global internet freedom has declined for the thirteenth
consecutive year in a row.
The commercial spyware marketplace where shady private
companies sell hack for hire technologies used against human
rights defenders is booming. Some estimates suggest it is a $12
billion industry.
The proliferation of AI enhanced mass surveillance
technologies spread by nations like the PRC and others is
accelerating as regimes seek to engage in the mass surveillance
of their citizens.
This alarming trend presents significant challenges not
only to individual privacy, but also to global security, to
democratic governance, and freedom of expression. The tools
designed to empower citizens are being weaponized against them,
and we must take decisive action to counter this trend.
Furthermore, countries like the People's Republic of China
are capitalizing on this trend by exporting mass surveillance
technologies globally, offering tools that enable oppressive
regimes to monitor and control their populations.
Meanwhile, according to a recent report from the Atlantic
Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, companies in India,
Israel, Italy, and other countries have been marketing their
spyware to oppressive governments.
This proliferation of surveillance capabilities in spyware
not only exacerbates human rights abuses but also sets a
dangerous precedent for how technology can be used to undermine
democratic movements worldwide.
These threats are already being keenly felt by civil
society organizations who seek greater transparency and
accountability from those in power, and if left unchecked they
will continue to have a chilling effect on dissent and
undermine privacy and democracy movements worldwide.
While predominantly used by authoritarian governments, the
last decade has seen aspects of digital authoritarianism creep
into democratic states, accelerating global trends of
democratic backsliding.
Democracies are not immune to the allure of these
technologies, and while there are legitimate law enforcement
uses for many of them, we should ensure that our democratic
partners and allies respect human rights and remain true to the
values that bind us together.
As authoritarian and repressive governments deploy
technologies to suppress dissent, we need to find ways to
counter their efforts so technologies can be used in a way that
sustain and support democratic values and norms rather than
undermine them.
This includes initiatives to strengthen internet freedom
and combat internet censorship; better protect activists,
journalists, and human rights defenders from cyber threats,
harassment, and abuse; sanctioning companies that sell spyware
to authoritarian regimes that use it to prey on their citizens;
and shaping emergency technologies like AI powered mass
surveillance technologies so they deliver services that are in
line with our values.
I want to applaud the Biden administration for taking a
series of actions in this space designed to stem the tide of
digital authoritarianism.
On internet freedom the Administration has worked closely
with the Open Technology Fund to provide tens of millions of
dollars to enable tens of millions of people living in
autocracies to use virtual private networks and other
technologies to circumvent government censorship. And on
commercial spyware the Administration has used many of the
tools in the executive branch's toolkit including executive
orders, sanctions, visa restrictions, export controls, and
diplomatic agreements to tackle an industry that is out of
control.
These efforts to protect the free flow of information are
crucial to keeping pace with the rapid advancement of
technologies designed to crack down on political dissent. We
must continually assess the effectiveness of government action
and adapt our strategies to combat these threats to democracy
and human rights.
Congress should also consider how we can best direct and
empower the executive branch to tackle these issues. Every year
the State Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds internet
freedom programs at the State Department as well as the Open
Technology Fund, but we must think creatively about what other
legislative tools we can deploy to counter these growing
threats.
As we navigate the challenges of digital authoritarianism,
we must remain vigilant, for the technologies designed to
connect us can easily become instruments of oppression.
If we do not act now we risk descending into an Orwellian
nightmare where surveillance and control overshadow our
fundamental freedoms.
I am glad that we have an excellent panel here today to
help us think through these issues and what Congress could
potentially do about it.
Before I turn it over to the panel let me turn it over to
Ranking Member Romney. I do want to take this opportunity to
again thank him for his partnership on this subcommittee. It
has been good to team up with him on a number of pieces of
legislation, some which have passed already, some which have
not yet.
But thank you, Senator Romney, for your leadership and your
service, and with that let me turn it over to you.
STATEMENT OF HON. MITT ROMNEY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH
Senator Romney. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen, and
witnesses for being here today. I likewise am disturbed by the
threat posed by technology and particularly in the area of
cyber intrusion warfare, oversight, spying, and so forth.
I guess it is no surprise that systems that are in
conflict--free nations versus authoritarian nations--would find
that the competition goes beyond air, land, and sea and is now
also in cyber.
You have to count me, however, as skeptical that there is
something we can do to prevent the bad guys from doing bad
things. It strikes me that they will use every tool available,
and now there is a whole host of new tools associated with
cyber and AI and quantum and so forth that they see as vehicles
to do what they want to do.
I do not know if there is any way we can prevent them from
doing that, other than by developing tools ourselves that are
superior to theirs and staying ahead.
Telling them, no, you cannot spy on your people is simply
going to be laughed at because they will spy on their people.
Telling them, no, they cannot spy on us, no, they will laugh at
that.
They will even use balloons to spy on us. But that is, of
course, an outmoded technology, but the modern technologies
they will use and abuse to the extent humanly possible, and I
do not think there is anything we can do that will keep the
authoritarians from doing awful things.
Look at Russia. They just invaded a sovereign nation and
are killing and maiming hundreds of thousands of people. So
sanctions by American businesses or by the American government
or our calling for freedom of the airwaves and prevention of
censorship strikes me as making us feel good that we are saying
things, but they are going to keep doing things that are
detrimental to the freedom and human rights that exist in our
nation and in other free nations.
So I am very interested in hearing what you all have to say
about what actions we can take to do a better job securing our
freedoms and preventing the authoritarians from taking
advantage of the technologies that are suddenly available to
them.
I would note that particularly with the advent of AI and
the leaps and bounds that it is predicted to take over the next
4 to 5 years, creating super intelligence, as we heard Sam
Altman say just yesterday, within the next thousand days, with
the advent of that technology and potentially quantum
computing, what do free nations do to secure the rights that we
hold so dear?
And again, it strikes me that the way that we secure those
rights is by being superior and having technology which is able
to combat theirs with its superiority, and doing what America
has always done, which is out innovate and out invest our
adversaries, and by holding aloft the flame of freedom.
With that, Mr. Chairman, we will turn to the panel and hear
what their thoughts might be.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Romney.
I am going to introduce each of you, and then we will have
you go in turn.
Ms. Laura Cunningham is the president of the Open
Technology Fund which is a congressionally authorized and
funded nonprofit that seeks to advance internet freedom in
repressive environments.
She has a decade of experience working on internet freedom,
and prior to her time at OTF she was at the State Department's
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor where she led the
department's internet freedom programs.
Welcome.
We also have with us Mr. David Kaye who is a professor of
law at the University of California Irvine. From 2014 to 2020
he served as the United Nations special rapporteur on the
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and
expression.
In this role he focused particularly on issues related to
freedom of expression and technology, and his book entitled
``Speech Police: The Global Struggle to Govern the Internet''
explores the ways in which companies, governments, and
activists struggle to define the rules for online expression.
We are also very pleased to be joined by Mr. Jamil Jaffer,
who is an alumni of this committee. He is now the founder and
the executive director of the National Security Institute at
the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, where
he also serves as an assistant professor of law.
He is also a venture partner with Paladin Capital Group,
and prior to his current work he was a staff member, as I said,
here on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and on the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
I thank all of you for being here. I respectfully ask that
you try to keep your opening statements to the 5 minutes, and
if you cannot cover something there, we will certainly get to
it in the questions.
With that, let me turn it over to you, Ms. Cunningham.
STATEMENT OF LAURA CUNNINGHAM, PRESIDENT,
OPEN TECHNOLOGY FUND, WASHINGTON, DC
Ms. Cunningham. Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Romney,
thank you for inviting me to testify today on the threat of
digital authoritarianism.
Today two-thirds of the world's population--nearly 5 \1/2\
billion people--live in a country where the global internet is
censored, and this number is only increasing as authoritarians
harness technological advances to increase the scale, scope,
and efficiency of digital repression.
But this is not merely a technical challenge. It is a
normative contest to determine whether governments use
technology to entrench authoritarian control or empower
democratic freedoms.
The Open Technology Fund was established over a decade ago
with bipartisan support from Congress to combat digital
authoritarianism. To do this we support open source tools that
provide secure and uncensored access to the internet.
Today, over 2 billion people globally use OTF funded
technology. OTF's primary focus is on the human rights abuses
that result from the application of repressive technologies.
However, the threat I want to focus on today is the digital
authoritarian model that information control technologies have
enabled and not merely the technologies themselves.
Worldwide, more governments are substituting repressive
technical shortcuts for the hard work of good governance to
control their populations in ways that were previously
unimaginable.
This is the greatest danger to democracy of our time with
profound implications for our democratic principles, national
security, and global economic competitiveness.
Online censorship has become the cornerstone of digital
authoritarianism, facilitating easy and effective information
control to eliminate government accountability and obfuscate
the truth.
We all know this is the case in China and Iran, but it is
being normalized in dozens of countries around the world. And
autocrats are forging ahead with even more blunt censorship
techniques including total internet shutdowns.
In fact, last year 39 governments shut down the internet
over 280 times. To further enhance their control authoritarians
are also leveraging AI to increase censorship's scale, speed,
and efficiency.
Leading digital authoritarians have also normalized the use
of sophisticated surveillance tools to intimidate, imprison,
and stifle domestic political opposition. In fact, research
supported by OTF found that over the last decade more than 110
countries received information control technologies from China
or Russia.
In addition, Huawei has built over 70 percent of Africa's
4G networks, and with such powerful tools few authoritarians
are willing to stop at their own borders.
Commercial spyware products, which have been acquired by
nearly 40 percent of all nations, have now made it possible to
surveil citizens anywhere in the world. This could convince
some that technology is inherently oppressive, but nothing
could be further from the truth.
The internet offers extraordinary potential for global
connection, inclusive democratic participation, and economic
growth at a speed and scale unprecedented in human history.
The reality is that a free and open internet meaningfully
improves the lives of billions of citizens around the world. It
is clear that the true appeal of the digital authoritarian
model is not its supposed benefits to citizens but its
simplicity. It is cheap and easy to be a digital authoritarian.
To counter the spread of this model effectively, we must
raise the cost while also offering a positive democratic vision
in exchange. Autocrats have purchased their hold on power by
spending billions of dollars to control what people can say,
share, and access online.
While the United States and our allies cannot match these
investments dollar for dollar, we must proportionally increase
our efforts to make digital authoritarianism more difficult,
more expensive, and less effective.
First, we need to increase our investments in internet
freedom technologies to reduce the efficacy of repressive
tools. People living under authoritarian regimes are our
greatest ally in this cause, and we must ensure they have the
tools to combat digital controls for themselves. This is why
OTF supports technologies that counter even the most advanced
forms of censorship and surveillance.
Second, we need to empower civil society coordination to
bring it in line with the speed of authoritarian information
sharing. In many countries civil society organizations are
working in isolation to identify and mitigate digital threats.
There is an urgent need for better coordination. Beyond the
tangible benefits to those under attack, this coordination
significantly increases the cost of authoritarian control.
And the private sector must engage as well. They are often
excluded from important markets unless they make unreasonable
accommodations that conflict with their stated values. It is in
all our best interest to keep global markets open and fair
without sacrificing our principles.
Members of the subcommittee, we must counter this challenge
where it originates--in China, Iran, and Russia. We must also
advocate for a better model where it is spreading.
The United States and its allies must advance a positive
vision for a global internet that reinforces our democratic
principles. We can show that it is possible to protect national
security without undermining human rights and our democratic
values.
The challenges posed by digital authoritarianism are
daunting, and the path to a competing model is hard, but it is
unquestionably worthwhile. If shown it is possible, most
countries will opt for forms of digital governance that protect
human rights.
But we need to lead the way. If we do not, China and Russia
certainly will.
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement of Ms. Laura Cunningham
Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Romney, and distinguished
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify today
on the threat of digital authoritarianism and how we can ensure the
global digital ecosystem reinforces our democratic principles.
Today two-thirds of the world's population--nearly 5.5 billion
people--live in a country where the global internet is censored.
And this number is only increasing as authoritarian governments
around the world are harnessing technological advances to increase the
scale, scope, and efficiency of digital repression. But this is not
merely a technical challenge. At its core, it is a normative contest to
determine whether governments use technology to entrench authoritarian
control or empower democratic freedoms.
about otf and internet freedom
The Open Technology Fund (OTF) was established over a decade ago--
with bipartisan support and funding from Congress--in recognition of
the dire consequences that unchecked digital authoritarianism poses to
democratic principles, our national security, and human rights
globally.
Today, OTF is a congressionally authorized non-profit funded
through a grant from the U.S. Agency for Global Media. OTF's mission is
to advance internet freedom in repressive environments by supporting
the research, development, implementation, and maintenance of open
source technologies that provide secure and uncensored access to the
internet and counter attempts by authoritarian governments to control
the internet and restrict freedom online.
OTF fulfills this mission by providing funding and support services
to individuals and organizations around the world that are addressing
threats to internet freedom with technical solutions. Broadly speaking,
we invest in technologies that provide uncensored access to the
internet to those living in information restrictive countries; and
tools that protect at-risk populations, like journalists and their
sources, from repressive authoritarian surveillance. For example:
We provide anti-censorship technologies--specifically
VPNs--to over 45 million people each month in countries where they
would otherwise be cut off from the global internet, including China
and Russia.
We also support critical digital security technologies
that enable journalists and human rights defenders working in
repressive environments, like Myanmar and Cuba, to communicate, report,
and share information safely.
In addition, we invest in peer-to-peer and decentralized
messaging tools that allow users to stay connected and access critical
information during internet shutdowns, like those implemented by the
Iranian government to suppress the anti-regime protests following the
death of Mahsa Amini.
In total, over two billion people globally use OTF-supported
technology daily, and more than two-thirds of all mobile users have
OTF-incubated technology on their devices.
OTF's primary focus is on the human rights abuses that result from
the application of repressive technologies. However, the threat I want
to focus the Subcommittee's attention on today is far broader. The core
challenge the United States must confront is a new authoritarian model
that information control technologies have enabled, and not merely the
technologies themselves.
Once considered politically extreme and technically implausible,
digital authoritarianism has now been adopted worldwide as more and
more governments are substituting repressive technical shortcuts for
the hard work of good governance in a bid to control their populations
in ways that were previously unimaginable.
Today, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between digital
authoritarianism and authoritarianism of any other kind as online
information control has become foundational to a newly possible form of
illiberal governance. This is the greatest danger to democracy of our
time, with profound implications for our democratic principles,
national security, and global economic competitiveness.
online censorship: blocking free expression & independent information
Online censorship has become a central component to digital
authoritarianism, facilitating easy and effective information control,
which stifles dissent, eliminates government accountability, and
obfuscates the truth. As a result, online censorship has become
commonplace around the world.
According to Freedom House's Freedom on the Net Report, online
censorship is at a historic high, with more governments censoring the
internet than ever before. While many are familiar with the long
history of internet censorship in the most extreme authoritarian
contexts, like Russia and Iran, the reality is that online censorship
is now normalized in dozens of countries around the world, including
Belarus, Egypt, Ethiopia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nicaragua,
Pakistan, Turkey, Uganda, Venezuela, Vietnam, and many more.
As online censorship has become more and more pervasive, autocrats
are emboldened to utilize far more aggressive and blunt censorship
techniques, including total internet shutdowns. Rather than narrowly
blocking specific content and websites that a regime deems undesirable,
authoritarians now regularly sever their citizens' connection to the
internet entirely. For example, following the military coup in Myanmar,
the junta implemented an internet shutdown, cutting millions of people
off from the global internet in order to solidify political control. In
fact, in 2023, 39 governments shut down the internet 283 times--a new
record.
To further enhance their control, authoritarian regimes are
leveraging AI to augment their censorship efforts to increase the
scale, speed, and efficiency of online censorship. For example, the
Russian government launched their own internet censorship and
surveillance system called Oculus in February 2023. The new AI system
automatically detects and blocks content the government considers
``undesirable.'' And many other countries are following suit: at least
22 other countries now mandate or incentivize digital platforms to
deploy machine learning to remove disfavored political, social, and
religious speech at a rate and magnitude that was previously impossible
for human censors to achieve.
With truthful information broadly blocked, digital authoritarians
are able to perpetuate disinformation unchallenged. For example,
Chinese media regularly reports that COVID originated from a U.S. lab;
while in Russian media, the full-scale war in Ukraine is righteous and
legitimate; and there are countless other examples. These narratives
follow classic propaganda patterns designed to project domestic
strength and unity, vilify perceived enemies; and establish a new,
widely accepted ``truth'' that further cements political control.
Ultimately, online censorship erodes democracy by obscuring the
truth, disempowering citizens, and creating extreme national echo
chambers that create a more fractured and dangerous world.
mass real-time surveillance: silencing dissent at home
Once only available to a small number of well-resourced autocrats,
authoritarian governments are now pairing online censorship
technologies with highly advanced surveillance tools. Distinct from
more narrow forms of technical surveillance conducted within strictly
prescribed limits and specific legal frameworks, leading digital
authoritarians have normalized the unencumbered use of the world's most
sophisticated surveillance tools to harass, intimidate, imprison, and
stifle political opposition.
In the past 2 years, authoritarian governments--led by China and
Russia--have taken extraordinary steps to expand their domestic
surveillance capabilities. They have asserted authority to digitally
collect personal information; engaged in widespread location tracking,
tracing individuals' every movements; and pursued aggressive offline
punishments for online activities.
Nowhere is the evolution in sophistication and scale of mass
surveillance more evident than in China. The Uyghur community in
Xinjiang experiences perhaps the most extreme version of surveillance
imaginable. They are subject to constant monitoring from facial
recognition-equipped cameras, mandatory use of surveillance software,
police checkpoints, and informants. Police in Xinjiang use an app to
collect massive amounts of personal information, which the app then
uses to flag activities considered to be suspicious. The use of these
tactics, and others like them, led directly to the imprisonment of as
many as one million mostly ethnic Uyghur and Kazakh people.
Similarly in Russia, authorities are harnessing the power of
biometric surveillance to target anyone critical of Vladimir Putin's
regime and the full-scale war in Ukraine. More than 60 regions in the
country have installed half a million cameras with facial recognition
technology. A 2023 report revealed this technology played an important
role in the arrests of hundreds of protesters in Russia.
As if these technical advancements and the resulting domestic
repression were not alarming enough, research supported by OTF found
that over the last decade, more than 110 countries purchased, imitated,
or received training on information controls from China or Russia. For
example, the Chinese telecom company ZTE is helping Venezuela develop a
smart ID card that many fear will be used by the government as a
powerful surveillance tool. The Serbian government also turned to a
Chinese telecom company, acquiring a 1,000-camera-strong surveillance
system from Huawei. And Huawei has built over 70 percent of the 4G
networks on the African continent, raising concerns around surveillance
and user privacy. Validating these fears, the Wall Street Journal
revealed that Huawei technicians had helped the governments of Uganda
and Zambia spy on political dissidents.
The near-universal reach of mass, domestic surveillance effectively
contains and constrains billions of people worldwide. One of the more
pernicious aspects is the extent to which the specter of surveillance,
and very real fear of real world consequences, incentivizes a culture
of self-censorship, further perpetuating unchecked authoritarian
control.
With such powerful tools at their disposal, few authoritarians are
willing to stop at their own national borders. Increasingly autocrats
are attempting to extend their reach, and impose globally the same
level of absolute control that they wield within their national
boundaries.
commercial spyware: powering transnational repression
The impunity with which authoritarians are able to surveil their
citizens at home and abroad has been supercharged by the ready
availability of commercial spyware products. These technologies have
been used disproportionately to intimidate and harass journalists,
human rights defenders, and political opposition figures. In the last
decade, at least 75 countries--nearly 40 percent of all nations--have
acquired commercial spyware, giving rise to a lucrative mercenary
industry, now worth billions, that is flourishing despite U.S. import
restrictions and sanctions against some of the known actors in this
space.
Today, any government with an interest in surveilling its citizens
at home and abroad can easily acquire the tools necessary to conduct
near real-time mass surveillance as a result of off-the-shelf,
enterprise solutions to any malicious surveillance need.
Perhaps the most highly publicized of these tools is Pegasus, the
chief product sold by the NSO Group, which has been used largely by
governments to target thousands of human rights activists, journalists,
politicians, and government officials across 50 countries. Public
reporting has found that from 2016 to 2021, at least 180 journalists
were selected for potential targeting in 20 countries, including those
with limited or declining media freedom. Our colleagues at Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty in Azerbaijan and Armenia are among these.
Infamously, family members of Jamal Khashoggi were targeted before and
after his murder by Saudi operatives; and separately, as were members
of the UK Prime Minister's Office.
The NSO Group is only one actor in the surveillance industry
ecosystem, yet has caused tremendous, specific harm. And there are
others, multiplying at a rapid pace, whose products are wielded to
silence and control. The Russian Federal Security Service is reported
to have used COLDRIVER in an extensive campaign against Russian and
Belarusian non-profit organizations active abroad, Russian independent
media in exile, and at least one former U.S. Ambassador. Similarly, the
government of Egypt deployed Intellexa's Predator spyware to surveil a
former political opposition figure living in Turkey and an exiled
journalist. Predator is also known to have targeted, although not
necessarily infected, members of the U.S. Congress including
Congressman Michael McCaul, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
What is particularly striking about each of these examples is the
audacity with which governments targeted individuals outside their
borders regardless of victims' nationality. This element is the true
autocratic innovation inherent in commercial spyware, which has
accelerated transnational repression, making it too straightforward and
mainstream.
recommendations
Authoritarian use of technology could convince some that these
tools are inherently oppressive, but nothing could be farther from the
truth. It is crucial to remember--as this Subcommittee knows well--that
the internet offers extraordinary potential for global connection,
inclusive democratic participation, and economic growth at a speed and
on a scale unprecedented in human history. Digital technologies fuel
learning, improve healthcare, drive scientific and economic
development, and enhance government services. While authoritarians
would like us to believe otherwise, the reality is that a free and open
internet meaningfully improves the lives of billions of citizens
worldwide.
It is clear that the true appeal of the digital authoritarian model
is not its supposed benefits to citizens, but its simplicity: it boasts
a novel tech stack; provides compelling solutions to short-term
governance problems; and is increasingly accepted as legitimate. In
short, it is cheap and easy to become a digital authoritarian.
To counter its spread effectively, we must raise the costs of
digital authoritarianism while offering a positive, democratic vision
in exchange. This will require action by multiple stakeholders.
raise the cost of digital authoritarianism
Digital authoritarians have functionally purchased their hold on
power by spending billions of dollars to control what billions of
people can say, share, and access online. And for the most part, they
have gotten their money's worth. While the United States and its allies
cannot match autocratic investment dollar for dollar, we must
proportionally increase our efforts to make digital authoritarianism
more difficult, more expensive, and less effective.
First, we need to increase our investments in internet freedom
technologies to reduce the efficacy of repressive tools. People living
under digital authoritarian regimes are our greatest ally in this
cause, and we must ensure they have tools and technologies to counter
the worst effects of authoritarian digital controls for themselves.
This is why OTF supports tools that mitigate the effects of even the
most advanced control technologies. When Iran cuts off access to the
internet to stifle protests and silence critics, we provide shutdown
resistant communications tools to keep people connected. When Belarus
attempts to surveil journalists, we can keep their communications with
their sources safe. When Russia censors objective reporting on the war
in Ukraine, we can unblock independent news sites for tens of millions
of people.
Second, we need to empower civil society coordination to bring it
in line with the speed of authoritarian information sharing in order to
increase the cost of digital authoritarianism.
Digital repression is now ``plug and play,'' and even comes with
great customer service. Through both authoritarian information sharing
and a robust market for commercial surveillance tools, governments
looking for easier answers find them in this model. And the effects on
those they govern are tragic.
In many countries, civil society organizations are working
individually in isolation to identify and counter digital threats to
their organizations and communities. Few have the resources or
expertise to keep up with the pace or sophistication of new
surveillance threats emerging from globally connected authoritarians.
There is an urgent need for coordination among civil society
organizations to collect, analyze, and ultimately mitigate digital
threats and attacks. OTF is already investing in such coordination.
Beyond the tangible benefits to those under attack, this
coordination makes more costly digital authoritarians' means of
control. When an authoritarian purchases an expensive digital exploit
it will prove effective for only a matter of days rather than for years
on end.
strengthen the democratic model
While we must counter digital authoritarianism where it
originates--in China, Iran, Russia--we must also advocate for a better
model where it is spreading, in many cases to weakly institutionalized
states whose populations will be materially affected by their
governments' choice of governance technologies.
The United States and its allies should advance a positive vision
of a global internet that reinforces our democratic principles. In
order to be successful in this endeavor, we must show that it is
possible to protect national security and combat crime without
undermining human rights and our democratic values.
While technologies themselves are generally value neutral, their
design, deployment, and application rarely are. In many cases, states
are confronted with legitimate governance challenges that digital
authoritarian models solve for leaders who are unconcerned with the
human rights cost. We must demonstrate that there is a better way to
solve these problems that harnesses the positive power of newly
emergent technologies within a rights-preserving framework.
The private sector will also be vital to realizing this new model.
As U.S. companies have been collateral damage in authoritarians' quest
for control, they share common cause. Digital authoritarianism excludes
the U.S. private technology sector from important markets unless they
are willing to make unreasonable accommodations to authoritarian
demands that conflict with many of these companies' stated values. The
private sector is often left with the choice between their bottom line
and respect for democratic values and human rights. We must strive to
keep global markets open and fair without sacrificing principles.
This is a shared challenge, and we need shared solutions. The
public sector, private sector, and civil society benefit from a free
and open global internet. We must collectively defend it.
conclusion
The challenges posed by digital authoritarianism are daunting and
the path to a competing model is hard. But it is unquestionably
worthwhile. Given a choice, many countries will opt for free, human
rights-respecting digital governance approaches--if they are shown that
this is possible. But we need to lead the way. If we don't, China and
Russia certainly will.
Thank you and I look forward to your questions.
Senator Van Hollen. Mr. Kaye.
STATEMENT OF DAVID KAYE, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW, UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE, IRVINE, CALIFORNIA
Mr. Kaye. Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Romney,
distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the
invitation to speak before you today.
My written testimony explores how authoritarianism and
global competition over cyberspace are putting extraordinary
strains on human rights, democracy, and U.S. national security,
focusing on commercial mercenary spyware.
Here I will limit myself to the following summary points.
First, the commercial spyware threat is real and deeply
intrusive. With sophisticated exploits of device
vulnerabilities, governments can buy a service that gives them
access to text messages and calls, photos and files, contacts
and locations--everything on your device and in real time.
Proponents pitch spyware as necessary to control terrorism
and crime. Yet, report after report has demonstrated that
spyware is used to target the pillars of democratic society--
journalists, opposition figures, human rights activists, even
government officials and embassy personnel.
Israel's NSO Group may be most known for its widely
reported Pegasus spyware, but a shadowy industry is
manufacturing, marketing, selling, and servicing mercenary
spyware. Members of Congress and U.S. Government personnel have
been in spyware's crosshairs. We are careening toward a highly
destabilized world where no one is safe from cheap,
sophisticated spyware.
So what is to be done about it? In 2019, in a report to the
U.N. Human Rights Council, I argued for limits on the uses of
such surveillance technologies to manifestly lawful ones only,
subjected to the strictest sorts of oversight and authorization
with private sector participation in the spyware market
conditioned on human rights due diligence and a track record of
compliance with human rights norms.
At the time I urged a moratorium on the industry pending
the imposition of enforceable regulations and tighter export
controls. Since then Congress has enacted laws with a clear
understanding that foreign commercial spyware poses national
security and human rights threats.
U.S. agencies have sanctioned spyware companies for, quote,
``activities that are contrary to the national security or
foreign policy interests of the United States,'' end quote.
President Biden promulgated Executive Order 14093
constraining spyware's use and condemning its interference with
fundamental rights and U.S. national security. And the United
States has led a growing coalition of 21 governments to pursue
domestic and international controls on spyware. These and other
efforts may in fact be having an impact with emerging evidence
that the cost of undermining human rights and U.S. national
security is, indeed, high.
Still, the threat persists. The demand remains. AI will
indeed infuse the industry with an ever deepening power to
interfere with democratic life. This subcommittee should thus
encourage the development of global norms to counter it.
Congress could, for example, codify the rules of Executive
Order 14093, and it could go further. It could explore ways to
limit the foreign sovereign immunity barrier in state hacking
cases and enable remedies to spyware victims in U.S. courts.
It could explore conditioning U.S. cooperation with other
governments pending implementation of their commitments to
prevent the export of spyware to end users likely to use it for
malicious activity.
It could even condition assistance to governments on their
commitment to demonstrate that rule of law and human rights
standards apply to their use of commercial spyware.
Congress could also have a near term impact in a related
area. The U.N. General Assembly will consider adoption of a new
cybercrime convention this fall. The convention and initiative
pressed originally by Russia sends a contrary message on
targeted surveillance at the very moment that the United States
is pushing for constraint.
The Freedom Online Coalition Advisory Network has said it
would enable and legitimize serious human rights violations due
to multiple flaws and lack of safeguards and fundamental rights
protections.
Senate expressions of concern could focus attention on the
harm the convention would do and urge abstention or a no vote.
In short, democracies need not be sitting ducks. They have the
tools to counter the rise of global authoritarian in
cyberspace.
The U.S. has begun to deploy those tools and to counter
spyware's lawlessness, and I urge the subcommittee to continue
its critical support in the legal fight for freedom online.
Thank you very much.

Prepared Statement of Mr. David Kaye
Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Romney, Members of the
Subcommittee:
Thank you very much for the invitation to appear before you today.
My name is David Kaye. I am a law professor at the University of
California, Irvine, School of Law, where I conduct research and teach
courses in public international law, international human rights and
humanitarian law, freedom of expression, and law and technology, and I
direct the Law School's International Justice Clinic. I also serve as
the U.S. Member of the European Commission for Democracy Through Law,
the Venice Commission. From 2014 to 2020 I served as the United Nations
(UN) Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion of opinion and
expression, and from 2020 to earlier this year I was the independent
chair of the Board of the Global Network Initiative.
The Subcommittee has an opportunity to help develop national and
global standards to control, counter and sanction abuse of the most
intrusive technologies of the digital age, and I thank you for taking
on this essential task for human rights and democracies worldwide.
overview: authoritarianism and the threat to ``cyberspace''
Authoritarianism and global competition over the future of
``cyberspace'' are putting extraordinary strains on human rights,
democracy and U.S. national security. Several states, led by China and
Russia, are seeking to undermine the international human rights
framework that is at the foundation of global democracy. They seek to
redefine the very norms that have been at the center of the global
value system since Eleanor Roosevelt led the negotiation of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights over seventy-five years ago. They
aim to impose the state's authority over the internet in ways that are
fundamentally at odds with the idea that digital space should
strengthen civil society and promote freedom of expression, access to
information and public participation in the life and politics of one's
nation. They wage this effort in the major global forums of the day,
including but not limited to the U.N. Human Rights Council and the
negotiations for a Global Digital Compact and U.N. Cybercrime
Convention.
As grave as the normative challenge in cyberspace is, it admittedly
has an abstract quality to it. Not so on the technical and operational
side, where the threats are tangible and the victims suffer serious
harms. The old tactics, of course, have not disappeared. Contemporary
authoritarian governments censor and criminalize criticism and dissent;
intimidate, harass, jail and sometimes torture and kill journalists,
human rights activists, and opposition figures; repress civil society
organizations and weaponize the law and the concept of sovereignty to
limit NGO activity.
The digital age has enabled states to turbocharge these tactics--
and to do so at an ever decreasing cost. Why censor a mere newspaper or
jam a radio transmission when you can order the internet to be shut
down, or block a website or an app? Why engage in transparent public
diplomacy when you can use disinformation and propaganda on social
media? Why pursue the tedious work of physical surveillance or
wiretapping when you can buy off-the-shelf technology to sweep up all
of a person's digital footprint without their knowledge?
In my testimony, I will focus on one of these representative
digital threats, commercial mercenary spyware, in part because it poses
such severe and demonstrated risks not only to human rights and
democracy but to national security. Congress and the Biden
administration have taken world-leading steps to address the threat of
commercial spyware, but there is much more to do, and that is why this
hearing is so important. Therefore, I will first provide an overview of
the nature of the threats posed by spyware to democracy, human rights
and national security. I will then review steps that the United States
and some within the international community are taking to address these
grave threats. I will conclude with some broader remarks about the
global threats and highlight steps the Senate should take to push an
online rights-and-security agenda forward.
i. spyware's threats to human rights and national security
In 2019, as U.N. Special Rapporteur, I reported on what seemed then
to be a rapidly emerging threat of targeted digital surveillance. \1\
At the time, I noted a range of digital attacks perpetrated by
governments, often using tools supplied from a largely unregulated
private industry. The report identified a range of serious attacks
against human rights defenders, journalists and those simply in
dissent, including by use of computer interference, commercial spyware
and other forms of mobile device hacking, social engineering and
phishing operations, network surveillance, abusive uses of facial and
affect recognition, cell phone interception through tools known as IMSI
catchers, and deep packet inspection.

Expression: Surveillance and Human Rights, A/HRC/41/35, May 28, 2019,
available at https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/thematic-reports/
ahrc4135-surveillance-and-human-rights-report-special-rapporteur.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even then, it had become clear that commercial spyware was emerging
as one of the gravest of all of these digital threats. Practically at
the very moment that our lives had become persistently online, centered
on devices that we all carry with us and that eventually lead back to
the most personal details of our lives, careers, connections and
opinions, an industry had arisen to intrude into our private spaces. It
is an industry that develops exploits that take advantage of
vulnerabilities in our devices, in turn providing governments with
advanced capabilities allowing them to discretely, sometimes without
even the requirement that a target click on a link or answer a call or
message, install spyware on a mobile device, typically a smartphone. We
can all imagine ourselves in the position of a victim: Spyware would
give the attacker access to your text messages and phone calls, your
photos and files, your contacts--indeed, everything on your device
would be available to the attacker. Not only that, the possibility of
microphone and camera access converts a device into ``a bug in your
pocket,'' as one analyst memorably put it. \2\ The potential for abuse
is obvious when made available without constraint to client governments
unbound by the kinds of fundamental rules of law expressed in
international human rights law or the U.S. Constitution's Fourth
Amendment.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given commercial spyware's extraordinary level of intrusiveness,
the risks to fundamental rights are correspondingly severe. Human
rights law--such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, which the United States ratified in 1992--protects individual
rights to privacy, religious belief and conscience, opinion and
expression. These rights are foundational to democratic societies, and
spyware directly interferes with them. It causes individuals to doubt
the privacy of their communications and opinions, strategically
designed to cause people to question their intentions to engage in
private and public discourse. Just days ago, one victim put the feeling
this way:
``The devastation I felt after discovering that the security agents
who had tortured me in Bahrain had successfully hacked my phone and
violated my privacy on British soil was overwhelming. I spent countless
sleepless nights fearing the potential harm to those who had entrusted
me with their sensitive information.'' \6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mere potential that spyware could be used against them causes
victims--and would-be victims who do not know if they have been
subjected to spyware--to question the safety of speaking their mind,
risking a spiral of intimidation and self-censorship that eats at the
foundations of democratic debate. I hardly need say this to
legislators, but for democratic societies, that withdrawal can be
fatal, particularly when the targets of such intrusions are those we
depend upon to inform our public life and debate, such as human rights
defenders, journalists and their sources, civil servants, and elected
leaders like you.
As harmful as spyware is to human rights and democracy, evidence
shows that spyware is also a national security threat. The Pegasus
Project, a multinational journalistic reporting endeavor, suggested
potential targets at the highest levels of democratic governments. \9\
One investigative project reported that Vietnamese government agents
sought to infect the phones of Members of Congress with Predator
spyware, produced by the Intellexa Group, a group on the U.S.
sanctioned entity list. \10\ At the time that the Biden Administration
announced its Executive Order addressing the spyware threat last year,
it noted that ``U.S. Government personnel overseas have been targeted
by commercial spyware.'' \11\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reporting from NGO's and journalists around the world indicated
that one company, the Israel-based NSO Group, was responsible for many
of the most egregious instances of spyware's abuse that have come to
light. The NSO Group is part of a broader, opaque industry
manufacturing, marketing, selling, transferring, and servicing
mercenary spyware. The industry pitches its products as necessary for
the control of terrorism and crime. Yet the industry has offered little
proof of this claim of necessity, while the widespread exposure that
commercial spyware has been used for state-on-state espionage belies
the claims of necessity. On top of this lack of proof, there are
troublingly few controls on the global proliferation and use of
spyware. Even as the world became aware of the extraordinary abuses
carried out using mercenary spyware, regulation and control, at
national and international levels, lagged far behind.
In my 2019 U.N. report, I argued that it was imperative that
governments limit the uses of spyware technologies to lawful ones only,
subjected to the strictest sorts of oversight and authorization, and
that they condition private sector participation in the spyware
market--from research and development to marketing, sale, transfer and
maintenance--on human rights due diligence and a track-record of
compliance with human rights norms. I argued then that members of the
industry should adopt and implement the U.N. Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights, which establish a framework for companies to
prevent or mitigate the human rights harms they cause, \12\ but that
responsibility, particularly in the context of such severe human rights
impacts, must be overseen by public authorities and enforced by
domestic and international law. At the time, I urged a moratorium on
the industry, pending the imposition of enforceable rules, and while
other U.N. rapporteurs and NGO's joined that call, civil society
experts have developed a range of legal responses to spyware that
include arguments for regulation and tighter export controls, while
some even argue for a ban given the severity of the harms caused by
spyware.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ United Nations, GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN
RIGHTS (2011), available at https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/
documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is most remarkable, perhaps, apart from the persistent
evidence of human rights and national security harms, is how quickly
the industry rose and how rapidly its tools have been used against so
many types of targets. Spyware's relative cheapness has enabled it to
proliferate, destabilizing not only civil society but diplomatic and
security sectors. It is easy to see how spyware's impact undermines
fundamental democratic practice. But at the same time we are not safer
when any government with access to spyware can hack, for instance, U.S.
or NATO officials' phones. And yet this is the world to which we seem
to be careening.
One last point connects the spyware industry and the global threat
landscape. The companies that make mercenary spyware often emphasize
how much control they have over the technology when asked about
proliferation risk. Yet recent work by Google's Threat Analysis Group
has shown that Russian hackers obtained and used exploits, the building
block of the spyware trade, previously used by NSO Group and Intellexa.
\13\ In this sense, the spyware industry is directly helping to fuel
the capabilities of U.S. adversaries. The threats are that
sophisticated, matching the persistence and intrusiveness typically
only seen from states like Russia and China. This concerning nexus
suggests that, at minimum, there is cross pollination between these
industries, and that the mercenary spyware industry may be helping to
buoy the exploit marketplace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. u.s. actions to address the spyware threat
The commercial spyware industry's intersecting threats to human
rights and democracy and U.S. national security led the U.S. Government
to act. In 2021, in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2022,
Congress required the Secretary of State to prepare a list of
contractors that have ``knowingly assisted or facilitated a cyberattack
or conducted surveillance'' against the United States or against:
`` . . . ndividuals, including activists, journalists,
opposition politicians, or other individuals for the purposes of
suppressing dissent or intimidating critics, on behalf of a country
included in the annual country reports on human rights practices of the
Department for systematic acts of political repression, including
arbitrary arrest or detention, torture, extrajudicial or politically
motivated killing, or other gross violations of human rights.'' 22 USC
Sec. 2679e(a)(2).
In 2022, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for
2023, Congress required U.S. intelligence agencies to provide annual
reports assessing counter-intelligence threats ``and other risks to
national security'' that ``foreign commercial spyware'' poses to the
United States. \14\ It further authorized the Director of National
Intelligence to prohibit intelligence agencies from ``entering into any
contract or other agreement for any purpose with a company that has
acquired, in whole or in part, any foreign commercial spyware.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Public Law 117-263 (50 USC Sec. 3232a) (2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Biden administration, for its part, has taken steps to address
the spyware problem consistent with U.S. law. In 2021, the Bureau of
Industry and Security (BIS) of the Commerce Department added several
companies, including the spyware companies NSO Group and Candiru, to
the list of entities ``engaging in activities that are contrary to the
national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.''
\15\ Specifically it noted,

Foreign Companies to Entity List for Malicious Cyber Activities,''

releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-
entity-list.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
``NSO Group and Candiru (Israel) were added to the Entity List
based on evidence that these entities developed and supplied spyware to
foreign governments that used these tools to maliciously target
government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists,
academics, and embassy workers. These tools have also enabled foreign
governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice
of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and
activists outside of their sovereign borders to silence dissent. Such
practices threaten the rules-based international order.'' \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In February of this year, BIS added Sandvine, a Canadian-
incorporated company whose ``technology has been misused to inject
commercial spyware into the devices of perceived critics and
dissidents.'' \17\ In July of this year, BIS added four other entities
to the Entity List for ``trafficking in cyber exploits used to gain
access to information systems, threatening the privacy and security of
individuals and organizations worldwide.'' \18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) has identified several commercial spyware entities and persons
associated with them as Specially Designated Nationals. As a result of
such designations, all property and interests in property of such
individuals or entities in the United States are blocked. Such spyware
vendors as NSO Group and Intellexa have been designated under the
program. For example, just this March, OFAC designated Intellexa and
its key personnel ``for their role in developing, operating, and
distributing commercial spyware technology used to target Americans,
including U.S. Government officials, journalists, and policy experts.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In perhaps the most important example of the administration's
recognition of the spyware threat to national security and foreign
policy interests, in 2023 President Biden promulgated Executive Order
14093. \20\ EO 14093 identifies a number of U.S. national interests,
including the protection of ``democracy, civil rights, and civil
liberties.'' It condemns the use of commercial spyware to interfere
with fundamental human rights, the rule of law and U.S. national
security. As such, the order prohibits any Federal agency or department
from making operational use of commercial spyware when they determine
inter alia ``that the commercial spyware poses significant risks of
improper use by a foreign government or foreign person.'' \21\ The
order further articulates the bases upon which an agency could make
such a determination, including uses in violation of international
human rights law. \22\

\22\ Id., Section 2(a)(ii)(A)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a demonstration of the emerging whole-of-government approach to
spyware, moreover, acting under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration
and Nationalization Act, the Department of State established a program
in February 2024 to restrict the issuance of visas to persons:
``elieved to have been involved in the misuse of commercial
spyware, to target, arbitrarily or unlawfully surveil, harass,
suppress, or intimidate individuals including journalists, activists,
other persons perceived to be dissidents for their work, members of
marginalized communities or vulnerable populations, or the family
members of these targeted individuals''. \23\

Announcement of a Visa Restriction Policy to Promote Accountability for
the Misuse of Commercial Spyware,'' February 5, 2024, available at
https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-a-visa-restriction-policy-to-
promote-accountability-for-the-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importantly, the restrictions also apply to:
``individuals believed to facilitate or derive financial benefit
from the misuse of commercial spyware . . . including but not limited
to developing, directing, or operationally controlling companies that
furnish technologies such as commercial spyware to governments, or
those acting on behalf of governments, that engage in [the misuse of
commercial spyware].''
In addition to official steps by Congress and the Biden
administration, individual litigants are seeking to use U.S. law in
order to hold accountable spyware vendors and states that use spyware
transnationally. A pending lawsuit brought by Meta (WhatsApp) against
the NSO Group in U.S. courts may provide guidance as to the strength of
various existing legal bases for remedy. \24\ Yet barriers to
accountability are real. In a case involving the Ethiopian government's
hacking of an Ethiopian-American activist's computer in Maryland, a
Federal court ruled that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA)
barred the action, an indication that changes to the FSIA may be
required to provide a further measure of action against those
governments that use spyware as a tool of transnational repression.
\25\ Yet while these lawsuits are important examples of how cases may
be brought, the global nature of the issue and jurisdictional hurdles
make it hard for victims to hold companies accountable. This was the
case, for instance, when the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware was used to
hack journalists in El Salvador \26\ (at least one of whom is a U.S.
citizen \27\). Victims are seeking to hold NSO Group accountable in
U.S. court. \28\

The United States is not alone among governments in having grave
concerns about the commercial spyware threat. Poland has launched a
major investigation into the previous government's use of Pegasus
spyware against journalists and opposition figures, among others. \29\
The European Parliament established a committee that, following
extensive hearings, published a major report on the spyware threat in
Europe, and the Parliament followed with several recommendations to
European states. \30\ Recognizing the global nature of the threat, and
the resultant need for global solutions, the Biden administration has
led a multilateral effort to counter spyware. In a Joint Statement
issued on 30 March 2023, the United States and ten other states pledged
to pursue ``domestic and international controls'' on spyware. \31\ On
the eve of this week's U.N. General Assembly, the State Department
announced that additional states had joined the pledge, bringing to
twenty-one the number of states signing up to counter spyware. That
list now includes Australia, Austria, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The State
Department is also setting aside funds to help low and middle income
countries to develop better policies and oversight around spyware. \32\

These efforts may be having an impact on the spyware industry.
Recently, the aforementioned Sandvine announced what appears to be a
major transformation in its business, noting that, ``In response to
concerns regarding the misuse of our technology by foreign governments,
we made a commitment to new ownership, leadership, and business
strategy.'' \33\ It has been suggested that, in light of the pressure
from the United States and others, and the recognition of investors
that association with threats to democracy and national security are
bad for business, the spyware industry faces serious threat. \34\

iii. a congressional agenda to counter spyware
The spyware threat is potentially at an inflection point. The
United States has taken firm action against the commercial spyware
industry, and twenty-one governments have committed to taking robust
actions to address the threat, but the evidence of continuing threat
persists. The demand for spyware products remains, especially by
governments that lack any kind of commitment to rule of law and the
protection of fundamental human rights. AI tools are likely to infuse
the spyware industry with an ever-deepening power to interfere with the
foundations of democratic life and to expose U.S. and allied government
officials and employees to the serious risks causes by targeted
surveillance. All of this is happening at a time when U.S. adversaries
like Russia and China are seeking to redefine what human rights in
cyberspace even means--to eliminate the well-established principle that
human rights offline apply online just the same.
This Subcommittee has the power to encourage the development of
global norms to counter the spyware threat, to promote human rights and
democracy and to protect U.S. interests and national security. The
Joint Statement on countering commercial spyware, mentioned above,
contains a set of global commitments which Congress should support. A
congressional agenda should include the following:
1. Congress could ensure that the rules of Executive Order 14093
are codified as statutory obligations of U.S. agencies. But it could
also go beyond EO 14093. For instance, as noted above, victims face
serious barriers when they seek to hold foreign states accountable for
hacking that implicates them in the United States. Federal courts, for
one thing, have adopted a narrow reading of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act. Congress could explore ways to make remedies available
to such victims in U.S. courts. \35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\35\ See Spencer Levitt and Andrea Cervantes, The Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act in the Age of Transnational Surveillance: Judicial
Interpretation and Legislative Solutions, Report of the UC Irvine
School of Law International Justice Clinic, August 21, 2023, available
at https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/2/4290/files/2023/
08/The-Foreign-Sovereign-Immunities-Act-in-the-Age-of-Transnational-
Surveillance.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Congress could encourage other governments to join the global
effort to constrain commercial spyware. Congressional support for EO
14093 would go a long way in this direction. But in the face of the
increasing threat of spyware's proliferation, Congress could also adopt
appropriate conditions on U.S. assistance to or cooperation with other
governments on their commitments to prevent, consistent with the 2023
Joint Statement, the export of software, technology, and equipment to
end-users likely to use them for malicious cyber activity; it could
condition assistance to other governments on their commitment to adopt,
implement and demonstrate, at a minimum, that rule of law and human
rights standards apply to their use of commercial spyware technologies.
3. In keeping with the 2023 Joint Statement, Congress could also
ensure that civil society groups have a place at the table in the
national and global efforts to counter commercial spyware. It has been
civil society organizations, after all, that have led the way in
exposing the global threat of the commercial spyware industry. Further
hearings like this one should bring the voices of security researchers,
victims and their advocates to public awareness.
4. Congress could reinforce administration efforts to engage
additional partner governments around the world to mitigate the misuse
of commercial spyware and drive reform in this industry, including by
encouraging industry and investment firms to implement the United
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. A range of
regulatory measures are available, drawing on experiences in other
areas of international law, and Congress could play a meaningful role
in pressing forward these ideas. \36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\36\ See, e.g., David Kaye and Sarah McKune, ``The Scourge of
Commercial Spyware--and How to Stop It,'' LAWFARE, August 25, 2023,
available at https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-scourge-of-
commercial-spyware-and-how-to-stop-it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to spyware-specific steps, the congressional voice
could have near-term impact in a related area. This Fall, the U.N.
General Assembly is considering adoption of a new Cybercrime
Convention. The draft Convention, originally an initiative pressed by
the Russian Federation, may on its face appear to be a salutary effort
to promote international cooperation. But its loose language and broad
framing of ``serious crimes'' opens the door to a confusing
international legal landscape that will almost certainly work to the
detriment of human rights. The Freedom Online Coalition Advisory
Network has called the draft ``a far-reaching global criminal justice
treaty that would enable and legitimize serious human rights violations
due to multiple flaws and lack of safeguards and fundamental rights
protections.'' \37\ It has the potential to, at the very minimum, send
a contrary message on government targeted surveillance at the very
moment that the United States is pushing for constraint. \38\ In
advance of the U.N. General Assembly vote on the draft, Senate
expressions of concern could focus U.S. Government and allied attention
on the potential harm the convention could do and urge them to reject
it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this way, my testimony returns to the beginning. Commercial
mercenary spyware poses serious threats to cyberspace--but more
specifically, to human rights and national security. It has become one
of the key vectors for the furtherance of authoritarianism and
repression in the digital age. But democracies need not be sitting
ducks; they have the tools to counter the rise of global
authoritarianism in cyberspace. The United States has begun to deploy
rule of law in the face of spyware's lawlessness, and I urge the
Subcommittee to continue its critical support of the legal fight for
freedom online.
Senator Van Hollen. And thank you.
Mr. Jaffer.
STATEMENT OF JAMIL N. JAFFER, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,
NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA
Mr. Jaffer. Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Romney,
thank you for holding this hearing.
It is particularly important at a time, given the
increasing drumbeat of threats that our Nation and our allies
face from countries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
These countries are global repressors. They repress their
own people at home, then they export that repression abroad,
not just in their own regions but across the globe.
They engage in this export through a variety of activities,
whether it is the sales of surveillance technology, their
influence on online platforms, their cyber attacks and hacks
against our nation and its allies, and the like.
They are engaged in a constant day in, day out attack on
America, our allies, and free and open societies around the
globe, and we must respond.
Chairman Van Hollen, you have led on some of these efforts
with the BRINK Act and your efforts to speak out against the
CCP and suppressive activities in Hong Kong and abroad.
Ranking Member Romney, you for decades have talked about
the threat these countries pose to our nation and our allies.
You spoke about Russia long before it was popular to speak
about Russia and its repressive activities and long before they
invaded in Ukraine not once, but twice. You have also talked
about Iran and China's activities as well.
So the members of this committee and the leadership of this
committee knows all too well the threats these countries pose.
But their threats are not just obvious on the surface. They are
surreptitious.
These countries spend hundreds of millions of dollars and
billions of dollars investing in technology to embed that
technology at the heart of our societies. Companies like Huawei
and ZTE, supported by low and no interest loans from the
Chinese government and grants from the Chinese government,
embed their core network capabilities in networks around the
globe.
By one measure, in Africa 70 percent of 4G networks are
controlled by Huawei. Huawei sits at the heart of British
telecom. It at the heart of telecommunications networks inside
of our country in state and local networks.
Congress has taken action to combat this by providing funds
to rip and replace some of this technology. More needs to be
done and faster. Our allies are slowly getting on the board
with this program, but are slow rolling it. Germany just this
month announced it will slowly be removing Huawei technology
from its networks but not till 2026.
And it is not just telecommunications capabilities. It is
social media. Today, TikTok has 170 million Americans on its
platform. It is the primary news source for Americans under the
age of 30. A Chinese influenced platform is the primary news
source for Americans under the age of 30.
And it is not that we do not know that TikTok uses its
capabilities to message to Americans. We know that a variety
ways. No. 1, we saw them push the Osama bin Laden narrative in
the aftermath of the October 7 attacks.
We saw them suppress talk about their suppression of Muslim
Uighurs and the genocide against Muslim Uighurs. We saw them
suppress discussion about Tibet, and we saw them press this
Congress to have American young people call Senate and House
offices to lobby against the TikTok legislation that was passed
in the House and the Senate and eventually signed into law.
So we know that this platform is used for illicit
activities by the CCP and its allies, and so it is so critical
that we take action.
But it is not just cat videos and dancing videos on TikTok.
It is also election messaging, and it is also the fact that the
data that is collected on Americans using TikTok--the location
of individuals, their voiceprints, who they communicate with--
when combined with the mass amounts of data that we know China
and other nations have stolen from Americans, including
healthcare data, financial data, and the like, and all of that
enhanced with AI technology to create targeting packages not
just for intelligence collection but for covert messaging.
The same way that AI enhances the ability of our candidates
to speak to the American electorate, it enhances the ability of
China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea to speak to Americans as
well.
And that is a very real danger, and so that is why it is so
critical that we have this hearing today, that we hear about
the capabilities that the Open Technology Fund is putting to
work using congressionally appropriated funds to bring freedom
to these nations.
But it is also important why we hear about commercial
spyware and the like and what our adversaries are using as
well, because it is important that we factor in that American
investors are investing in these technologies and capabilities.
That is why it is important that Congress and the
Administration partner with American investors who are willing
to speak out against this and are willing to commit to not
investing in adversary technology and to investing in American
allied technology. We brought together a group of 20 investors.
There are other groups as well in NATO and the Quad that are
bringing these groups together as well.
And so I welcome the opportunity to be here today. Thank
you for your time, and I look forward to any questions from the
committee.

introduction
Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Romney, and Members of the
Subcommittee: thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the
threats our nation and our allies and partners face in the cyber
domain, particularly from authoritarian regimes across the globe that
seek to replace the United States as a key international leader.
I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this
hearing, given the increasing drumbeat of threats that our nation and
other free and open societies face from nations like China, Russia,
Iran, and North Korea in the cyber domain. The regimes that control
these nations form the core of a growing group of global repressors,
nations that repress their own people at home, and then seek to extend
that repression abroad, oftentimes not only within their own region but
increasingly across the globe as well. Both of you have exhibited
strong leadership on the issues at the core of this hearing, including
ensuring that America leans forward and leads in the international
realm, serving as the strongest ally to our friends and the fiercest
foe to our adversaries. As you both well know, the promotion and
protection of our national interests, including the protection of our
citizens and the critical infrastructure they rely upon could not be
more important in this era of expanding authoritarianism and rapidly
evolving technologies. It is likewise critically important that, as a
global leader, we also defend the democratic principles that undergird
free and open societies globally, including the core concepts of free
speech, economic liberty, and the rule of law. We must also guard
vigilantly against repressive efforts by these regimes as they seek to
undermine these democratic principles by depriving their own people
and, increasingly, others around the globe, of access to economic
freedom and the kind of basic rights that characterize free and open
societies. \2\

\2\ Significant portions of this testimony have also been drawn in
whole or in part from prior testimony provided by Mr. Jaffer to the

excellent research and editing assistance with NSI Decision Memo which

national-security-threat-of-chinese-technological-innovation-2/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chairman Van Hollen, you are well known for your work in this
space, including your bipartisan BRINK Act, which requires the
imposition of sanctions on the foreign banks and companies that
facilitate illegal financial transactions with North Korea, your
advocacy to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which controls the
People's Republic of China (PRC) with an iron fist, accountable for its
attacks on freedom and democracy in Hong Kong and elsewhere, and your
efforts to hold other authoritarian regimes accountable as they seek to
expand their repression globally, including by targeting American
elections. You also recognize the critical importance of ensuring that
American remains competitive and that our critical edge is America's
ability to rapidly innovate and that we must protect that innovation
with a strong intellectual property system, so thank you for your
leadership in those areas as well.
And Ranking Member Romney, you've long been a leading voice on
American foreign policy, advocating for policies that promote our
economic and national security and that of our allies and partners. You
have been one of the primary leaders in our nation--whether during your
time as Governor, as a candidate for President, and now in the Senate--
that has always been clear-eyed and direct with the American people
about the very real threat that we face from nations like Russia,
China, Iran, and North Korea. Even when it was unpopular to do so, you
have called out these nations for their bad behavior and highlighted
the threat they pose to our Nation. Whether it was your successful
effort to impose a diplomatic boycott during the 2022 Winter Olympics
in Beijing or your calling out of Russia from the debate stage over a
decade ago--presaging Russia's multiple invasions of Ukraine--no one
can doubt where you stand on these issues and the critical importance
of your leadership.
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, your bipartisan leadership and
continued work together on this Subcommittee is critical to
highlighting the many ways that these global repressors have sought to
take advantage of our nation's free and open society--particularly in
the cyber domain and with respect to emerging technologies--in order to
gain political, economic, technological, and military advantage,
including in the context of the larger strategic competition taking
place across the globe.
And as the members of the Subcommittee know all too well, China is
the key economic and national security challenge facing our nation
going forward, and its ongoing and expanding collaboration with other
global repressors, including in the cyber domain and with respect to
emerging technologies, is at the heart of these matters. I hope this
hearing will offer us the opportunity to have a candid and frank
discussion on these important matters.
i. the overall threat posed by a rising china and its collaboration
with other global repressors in the cyber domain and on emerging
technologies
As I testified last week before the House Select Committee on the
Chinese Communist Party and earlier this year before the Senate Banking
Committee, the threat of a rising China, under the leadership of the
CCP, is the defining national security challenge facing the United
States and our allies today. \3\ Like other global repressors, the PRC,
under the direction and control of the CCP, is a nation that not only
oppresses its own people, but pushes that repression well beyond its
borders, not just in the Indo-Pacific region, but across the globe as
well. The genocide and crimes against humanity currently underway
against Muslim Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region are but one example of
the type of repressive activities that take place within the borders of
CCP-controlled China, activities that also include the brutal
repression of dissent and political, economic, and religious freedom in
Hong Kong and Tibet. \4\

The global scale of the CCP's repression is vast, as can be seen in
the PRC's near-constant drumbeat of military and economic threats
against Taiwan, \5\ its hostile actions and active threats toward other
U.S. allies and partners globally, \6\ its export of surveillance
technologies and other repressive capabilities to authoritarian-leaning
regimes worldwide, \7\ its ongoing efforts to consolidate control over
and withhold access to key critical minerals and strategic metals, \8\
its extortion of dozens of countries under the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), \9\ and its growing political, economic, and military
relationships with other global repressors like Russia, Iran, and North
Korea. \10\

But this litany of activities is only the beginning of the CCP's
larger and more hidden effort to undermine our nation's security. The
CCP has also long engaged in the broad-based theft of intellectual
property from American and allied private sector companies to benefit
its own economic base, \11\ and the PRC's deep and expanding cyber
infiltration of U.S. and allied critical infrastructure, \12\ as well
as its active installation of capabilities to hold such critical
infrastructure at risk, \13\ together pose a clear and present danger
to our economic and national security. Likewise, the CCP has actively
sought to recruit American and allied academics and intellectuals
through its Thousand Talents Program \14\ and has sought to shape minds
of students through its establishment of hundreds of Confucius
Institutes across the globe. \15\

For the purposes of today's hearing, I'd like to focus on three
area where the CCP seeks in particular to undermine U.S. interests in
the cyber and emerging technologies domain: (1) the effort by China to
embed its technologies around the globe in an effort to collect
intelligence and influence political, economic, and military
conditions; (2) the way the CCP is likely to exploit emerging
technologies, like artificial intelligence, steal intellectual
property, and use extortive efforts to undermine U.S. and allied
leadership globally; and (3) the CCP's holding at risk of American and
allied critical infrastructure in the cyber domain and to influence
American and allied views. And I'd also like to highlight how China and
other global repressors, like Russia, use international institutions,
like the U.N. and various advisory committees and boards to also
achieve their own ends. Finally, I'd like to focus on how we might
usefully address some of these issues.
ii. china's effort to embed its technologies around the globe in an
effort to collect intelligence and influence political, economic, and
military conditions
China's ongoing and widespread effort to embed its technologies
around the globe can be seen in numerous places across the globe. For
example, the effort to embed Huawei and ZTE gear in the
telecommunications networks of Western countries, including successful
efforts in a number of U.S. States as well as at the heart of the
British Telecom and other allied networks, and has been well-understood
for over a decade. \16\ Indeed, as far back as March 2015, as part of
its Belt-and-Road Initiative, China announced a Digital Silk Road
effort--ostensibly to provide aid to other nations to improve their
telecom networks, AI capabilities, cloud computing, and surveillance
technology, among other things--that puts Chinese national champions,
like Huawei, deep in those networks. \17\ Capabilities like these--
which provide direct access into the core of the telecommunications
networks--can be hugely valuable to our adversaries as a tool to
collect massive amounts of information and intelligence, as well as to
conduct actual offensive cyber attacks that can delete, destroy, or
modify information and even take down entire networks. \18\ Yet many
nation-states have taken a while to understand the very real threat
these capabilities pose to their national security and some continue to
install these systems at the heart of their networks. \19\ Indeed,
according to one source, as of 2 years ago, ``Huawei and its components
comprise almost 70 percent of the total 4G networks across the
 continent.'' \20\

Report, supra n. 16 at 3 (``The ability to deny service or disrupt

is dependent. The capacity to maliciously modify or steal information
from government and corporate entities provides China access to
expensive and time-consuming research and development that advances
China's economic place in the world. Access to U.S. telecommunications
infrastructure also allows China to engage in undetected espionage
against the United States government and private sector interests . . .
. Inserting malicious hardware or software implants into Chinese-
manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for U.S.
customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national
security systems in a time of crisis or war. Malicious implants in the
components of critical infrastructure, such as power grids or financial
networks, would also be a tremendous weapon in China's arsenal.'').

Likewise, Congress and two successive Administrations have
highlighted the very real threat that social media applications, like
TikTok, pose to our national security. \21\ This national security
threat is described in extensive detail in an amicus brief that was
filed on my behalf and that of well over a dozen other former U.S.
Government national security officials--including two former U.S.
Attorneys General and a former U.S. National Cyber Director--in
litigation brought by TikTok in the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit. \22\ That brief, which supported the
U.S. government's position defending legislation signed into law
earlier this year, is attached as an appendix to this testimony. The
brief argues, in relevant part, that TikTok's extensive collection on
data on Americans and our allies, its close ties to the CCP and the PRC
government, and the CCP's influence over TikTok's algorithm, which has
previously pushed pro-Chinese and anti-American content as well as
actively suppressed anti-CCP content, means that TikTok, ``presents a
serious and unique national security threat to the United States.''

And while many Americans view TikTok as a tool for kid's dance
videos and short-form entertainment, the sad reality is that over the
course of the last decade, this Chinese-government influenced tool has
become the primary source of news for Americans under the age of 30,
\24\ a fact that should deeply trouble all of us. Even more concerning,
given the massive amount of data that TikTok collects on its users,
when combined with other data stolen by Chinese government hackers
targeting the U.S. Federal Government, including the security clearance
files thousands of current and former U.S. Government officials holding
Top Secret-Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearances, and
TikTok collects on its users, when combined with other data stolen by
Chinese government hackers targeting private companies holding
sensitive financial, health, and travel data of millions of Americans,
it is clear that TikTok's data--when fed into modern artificial
intelligence algorithms--can help drive future sophisticated
intelligence collection and disinformation campaigns targeting American
citizens and our allies. \25\ Indeed, the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence (ONDI) recently indicated that ``China is
demonstrating a higher degree of sophistication in its influence
activity, including experimenting with generative AI,'' and noted that
``TikTok accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted
candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election
cycle in 2022.'' \26\

iii. china's exploitation of emerging technologies, theft of
intellectual property, and use of extortive efforts to undermine u.s.
and allied leadership globally
Likewise, at the core of the national security threat that the PRC
poses to the United States, as well as our global competition with
China for supremacy--whether in the economic, political, military, or
social spheres--is technological innovation, including access to and
control over critical emerging technologies, particularly in the
artificial intelligence domain. \27\ In recent decades, the PRC has
made aggressive moves to build its own technological innovation base
and now seeks to expand those capabilities. \28\ Much of this effort by
the PRC initially began by actively seeking to dominate the
manufacturing market for technology goods, producing equipment at costs
well below those achievable in most other economies. \29\ This was
achieved, in significant part, by exploiting the PRC's theft of U.S.
intellectual property at industrial scale--referred to as the greatest
transfer of wealth in modern human history \30\--which was then
leveraged to create an entire industry of state-owned and state-
influenced enterprises that, when combined today, generate a tremendous
amount of the technology products and capabilities sold around the
globe, including producing goods on behalf of a number of highly
innovative American companies, competing with others, and replacing or
coopting yet others in the global market. \31\ Worse still, the PRC is
now going well beyond manufacturing-at-scale and is creating innovation
on top of this stolen IP and securing its access to data, as it
recognizes that whichever nation dominates the technology revolution--
particularly in emerging technology areas like quantum computing,
biotechnology, and artificial intelligence (the latter of which is
particularly data reliant)--will likely also win the larger
geopolitical competition. \32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\27\ See, e.g., The White House, National Security Strategy (Oct.
2022), at 23, available online at (``The PRC is the only competitor with both the
intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the
economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it . . .
It is using its technological capacity and increasing influence over
international institutions to create more permissive conditions for its
own authoritarian model, and to mold global technology use and norms to
privilege its interests and values.''); Xi Jingping, Speech to Members
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
and the National Congress of China Association for Science and
Technology (May 28, 2021) (translated by Zichen Wang), available online

competition around the commanding heights of science and technology is
unprecedentedly fierce.'').

geopolitical competition . . . .While the U.S. has maintained its
position as the technologically dominant power for decades, China has
made enormous investments and implemented policies that have
contributed significantly to its economic growth, military capability,

verge of eclipsing, the United States--particularly in the rapid
deployment of certain technologies.''); Bloomberg News, How China Aims

Challenges, and Implications for the United States, Congressional
Research Service (June 25, 2019), at 23, available online at (``China's abundance of

cost, labor-intensive manufactures. As a result, manufactured products
constitute a significant share of China's trade. A substantial amount
of China's imports is comprised of parts and components that are
assembled into finished products, such as consumer electronic products
and computers, and then exported.'')

A key aspect of the PRC's effort to lead in the technology domain
is its centralized planning efforts that have been in place for well
over a decade, including its Made in China 2025 line of effort (``PRC
2025''), a ``broad set of industrial plans that aim to boost
competitiveness by advancing China's position in the global
manufacturing value chain, `leapfrogging' into emerging technologies,
and reducing reliance on foreign firms.'' \33\ This effort aims to
enable China to ``make major technology breakthroughs, lead innovation
in specific industries, and set global standards'' by 2035 and ``ead
global manufacturing and innovation with a competitive position in
advanced technology and industrial systems'' by 2049, with key areas of
focus including next generation IT and telecommunications capabilities,
high performance computing, advanced robotics, and artificial
intelligence. \34\ And in the critically important AI domain, China
released a plan back in 2017--long before the public advent of highly
capable generative AI in 2022 and even well prior to the enactment of
the U.S. National AI Initiative Act of 2020--to ``lead the world in AI
by 2030.'' \35\ While ostensibly emphasizing domestic development in
these national plans, it is clear that the PRC plans to continue to
rely on the ``acquisition, absorption, and adaptation of foreign
technology by PRC entities that recast these capabilities as their
own,'' \36\ and then build upon these stolen technologies to create
additional innovation.

And in February of this year, the Director of National Intelligence
released her Annual Threat Assessment, which she describes China's
efforts to ``become a world  superpower and to
use this technological superiority for economic, political, and
military gain.'' \37\ According to ODNI, ``Beijing is trying to fast-
track its S&T development through investments, intellectual property
(IP) acquisition and theft, cyber operations, talent recruitment,
scientific and academic collaboration, and illicit procurements,'' and
noted specifically that ``n 2023, a key PRC state-owned enterprise
has signaled its intention to channel at least $13.7 billion into
emerging industries such as AI, advanced semiconductors, biotechnology,
and new materials.'' \38\

As noted above, China's acquisition of U.S. and allied emerging
technology takes place through a range of vectors: (1) outright theft
of intellectual property; \39\ (2) forced technology transfer from
companies seeking to enter the Chinese market; \40\ (3) requiring new
market entrants to establish joint ventures with PRC companies; \41\
(4) requiring sensitive IP to be kept in China; \42\ (5) tax incentives
to get production and R&D moved to China; \43\ (6) acquisition of
American and allied companies with sensitive technologies directly or
through bankruptcy proceedings; \44\ (7) corporate and government
partnerships with U.S. companies, universities, and individual experts
or academics, including through PRC talent programs and educational
pipeline work; \45\ and (8) joining and setting the agenda for
international standards setting bodies. \46\ And China has doubled down
on these efforts, making clear that it will continue to exploit its
foreign research connections, use domestic regulatory measures and
influence abroad in areas like antitrust, IP, and international
standards, \47\ as well as make massive investments into key emerging
technology areas, including quantum computing, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and cybersecurity, \48\ both directly and by offering
low-interest and no-interest loans and massive state-driven subsidies--
totaling well-over a trillion dollars--to enable its companies to
compete more favorably in global markets, \49\ while also using board
seats to influence corporate decisionmaking. \50\

We know also that China continues to build out its STEM workforce,
proactively recruiting leading STEM players from around the world, \51\
and, having already passed the U.S. in the number of annual Ph.Ds
awarded many years back, some estimate that the PRC may annually
graduate nearly double the number of STEM Ph.Ds as the U.S. in the near
future. \52\ All of these efforts are also buttressed by China's
longer-term efforts to secure its access to critical minerals,
strategic metals, and energy resources, from production to processing,

access to such resources, all of which are critical to our

iv. china's effort to hold american and allied critical infrastructure
at risk and influence american and allied views
According to ODNI, ``China remains the most active and persistent
cyber threat to U.S. Government, private-sector, and critical
infrastructure networks.'' \55\ ODNI noted that ``PRC operations
discovered by the U.S. private sector probably were intended to pre-
position cyber attacks against infrastructure in Guam and to enable
disrupting communications between the United States and Asia'' and it
assesses that ``f Beijing believed that a major conflict with the
United States were imminent, it would consider aggressive cyber
operations against U.S. critical infrastructure and military assets . .
.  a strike  would be designed to deter U.S. military action
by impeding U.S. decisionmaking, inducing societal panic, and
interfering with the deployment of U.S. forces.'' \56\

And just a few days earlier, the FBI Director had gone perhaps
further saying, ``here has been far too little public focus on the
fact that PRC hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure--our
water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas
pipelines, our transportation systems--and the risk that poses to every
American . . . .China's hackers are positioning on American
infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm
to American citizens and communities.'' \57\ Providing a bit more
detail on the targeting of American infrastructure, the FBI Director
explained that the FBI and ``our partners identified hundreds of
routers that had been taken over by the PRC state-sponsored hacking
group known as Volt Typhoon,'' which contained ``malware  enabled
China to hide, among other things, pre-operational reconnaissance and
network exploitation against critical infrastructure like our
communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors.'' According
to the FBI Director, these efforts represented ``teps China was
taking . . . to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian
critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous . . .
represent real-world threats to our physical safety.'' \58\

And the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in
a document jointly released by CISA, FBI, NSA, and a number of other
Federal and foreign intelligence agencies from Australia and New
Zealand, indicated that this new posture--installing capabilities that
could have a clear potential disruptive effect--said, ``Typhoon's
choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with
traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and
the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt
Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable
lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions.'' \59\

And just a few days ago, the FBI announced that it had taken down a
widespread Chinese botnet, associated with a threat actor named Flax
Typhoon which had infected over a quarter-million devices across North
America, South America, Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia
with malware. \60\ This botnet, which was ostensibly focused on
espionage, not disruption, nonetheless demonstrated the scale and
access of Chinese hacking, with over half the devices, made up of
``home routers, firewalls, storage devices, and Internet of Things
devices like cameras and video recorders,'' being located in the U.S.
And, perhaps more troublingly, the FBI noted that the Flax Typhoon
actors ``shared some of the infrastructure for its attacks'' with the
Volt Typhoon actors. \61\

Moreover, it's not just hacking or disruptive attacks that are in
play; we also increasingly see the CCP actively taking a page out of
the Russian covert influence playbook by seeking to, in the words of
ODNI, ``sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and
extend Beijing's influence.'' \62\ According to ODNI, ``Beijing's
information operations primarily focus on promoting pro-China
narratives, refuting U.S.-promoted narratives, and countering U.S. and
other countries' policies that threaten Beijing's interests, including
China's international image, access to markets, and technological
expertise'' and that it is now also seeking to ``actively exploit
perceived U.S. societal divisions using its online personas'' and
``mold U.S. public discourse--particularly on core sovereignty issues,
such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang,'' while also
potentially seeking to ``influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some
level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify
U.S. societal divisions.'' \63\

All of these efforts demonstrate a commitment on the part of the
CCP to get significantly more aggressive in the cyber domain, even as
we recall that back in 2019, ODNI assessed that ``China has the ability
to launch cyber attacks that cause localized, temporary disruptive
effects on critical infrastructure--such as disruption of a natural gas
pipeline for days to weeks--in the United States'' and that Russia
could do much of the same with respect to electrical distribution
networks, while Iran could also do much the same to a large company's
corporate network. \64\

v. china and russia's efforts to use the international system to
achieve their goals
Finally, it may also be worth noting the efforts of China and
Russia to use the international system, including the U.N. and various
international standards setting bodies to achieve their own goals.
China, for its part, has engaged in an effort to obtain additional
influence in global organizations technical standard-setting bodies
``by increasing the number of Chinese officials, technocrats, and
private sector leaders for key leadership positions in major working
groups and technical committees of international technical standard-
setting bodies'' \65\ which it reportedly has used to ``push for the
acceptance of Chinese businesses' standards as the de facto
international technical standards in several crucial sectors,'' and its
`` `Standards 2035' project also aims for the country to go global with
its technical standards, especially by strategically employing its
high-level officials and leaders of domestic technology enterprises at
the organizations responsible for determining global technical
standards.'' \66\ And more recently, according ODNI, ``China also
announced  Global AI Governance Initiative to bolster international
support for its vision of AI governance.'' \67\

Russia and China also recently got a significant win in the
international realm with respect to a major cyber policy initiative,
the U.N. Convention Against Cybercrime, with the Russian-led text--with
some compromise language, to be fair--being adopted by consensus action
of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Cybercrime last month. \68\ For years, the
United States pushed back against the Russian-proposed language and
process, which it historically viewed as being overly aggressive and
subject to manipulation and abuse by authoritarian regimes. \69\ While
the U.S. supported certain provisions of the treaty as being an
appropriate exercise of law enforcement authority for nation-states, as
at larger level, the U.S. did not support the treaty because it lacked
the type of rule-of-law safeguards that American laws typically
contain. \70\ More recently, however, the U.S. backed off this position
and allowed the Ad-Hoc Committee to push the Russian-led language out
by consensus. \71\ As the convention heads to the General Assembly for
approval and, if approved, ratification by just over three dozen
countries for entry into force, there has been a significant backlash
from both industry and non-governmental organizations, and there is
some possibility that the convention may get further delayed or halted,
particularly if the United States returns to its prior position of
objecting to the convention writ large. \72\

vi. potential responses to consider in addressing the threats posed by
global repressors in the cyber and emerging technologies domains
Given all this, one might ask what ought be done to address these
very real challenges. Below are a few initial thoughts.
1. Provide Appropriations for Basic Science Research and Workforce
Development. The U.S. Government has long been one of the key seed
funders of critical basic science research in American universities and
industry, and this has led to major breakthroughs in areas where
countries like China now seek to compete including in biotechnology,
high-performance computing, quantum computing, and artificial
intelligence. \73\ Ensuring that some of the key provisions in the
CHIPS and Science Act and other such legislation, including funding for
next generation communications technologies and artificial
intelligence, continues to be provided is critical. \74\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\73\ See James Manyika et al., Innovation and National Security--
Keeping Our Edge, Council on Foreign Relations (Sep. 2019), at 2, 19,
available online at (``federally supported R&D had a dramatic
impact on U.S. competitiveness and national security. According to a
2019 study, starting in the 2010's nearly one-third of patented U.S.
inventions relied on federally funded science . Touch screens, the
Global Positioning System (GPS), and internet technologies central to
the smartphone are all products of Defense Department research . . .
Between 1988 and 2010, $3.8 billion of Federal investment in genomic
research generated an economic impact of $796 billion and created
310,000 jobs. A new wave of support for basic research could have
similar economic and military benefits.''); see also Jamie Gaida et
al., ASPI's Critical Technology Tracker: The Global Race for Future
Power, Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Feb. 2023), at 1,
available online at (noting that
``China's global lead extends to 37 out of 44 technologies that ASPI is
now tracking, covering a range of crucial technology fields spanning
defence, space, robotics, energy, the environment, biotechnology,
artificial intelligence (AI), advanced materials and key quantum
technology areas'').
\74\ See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 117-167, Sec. Sec. 10101-114 (basic
science); Sec. Sec. 10221-235 (basic science); Sec. Sec. 10311-321
(STEM education & workforce) & Sec. Sec. 10501-526 (STEM education &
workforce); see also Madeline Ngo, CHIPS Act Funding for Science and
Research Falls Short, New York Times (May 30, 2023), available online
at (``The total funding for research agencies was nearly $3
billion short of authorized levels this year, according to a recent
Brookings Institution analysis . . . he director of the National
Science Foundation said the money would help the Nation lead in
industries that were listed as key focus areas in the law, such as
artificial intelligence and biotechnology . . .  could also help
the agency expand A.I. research and training programs aimed at building
up the nation's STEM work force, which agency officials said were
critical since the country is facing a shortage of workers to build
semiconductors.''); see also Matt Hourihan, Analysis: As Congress
Considers COMPETES, How Short Are We From The Old COMPETES?, American
Association for the Advancement of Science (Feb. 22, 2022), available
online at .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Avoid Taking Action that Would Limit Private Sector R&D Spending
and Instead Incentivize It in Critical Areas. Today, the private sector
represents 70 percent of all R&D expenditures in the United States,
with technology companies leading the way, making up seven of the top
ten R&D spenders, including all of the top five. \75\ Core R&D
spending, along with our permissive economic and legal environment and
the availability of significant amounts of venture and growth capital,
as well as a highly skilled workforce, is what makes America the
technology innovation hub of the globe. These capabilities are not only
at the heart of our economic success, they are also a core reason why
our national defense capabilities remain relatively unmatched across
the globe today. If we are to compete effectively with the PRC, we need
to incentivize, not limit the capabilities of the top R&D investors in
the U.S., including the technology companies that are in the top five
R&D spenders in the Nation. To do so, we must avoid the temptation to
artificially restrain successful innovators in the absence of actual,
demonstrable bad behavior, while also providing new tax and other
economic incentives for increased private R&D investment--both for new
entrants as well as existing players that can scale--in a range of
areas like high-performance computing, quantum technology, AI/ML,
trust, safety, and security, and the design and production, in the
United States and allied nations, of leading-edge semiconductor
capabilities.

Development Funding and Performance: Fact Sheet, Congressional Research
Service (Sept. 13, 2022), available online at ); see id. at 1 & n. 5
(citing Prableen Bajpai, Which Companies Spend the Most in Research and
Development (R&D)?, Nasdaq (June 21, 2021), available online at
).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Incentivize Technology Infrastructure Investment. For the better
part of the last six decades, the United States has benefited
significantly from being the core hub of the global telecommunications
infrastructure. As the place where much of the world's
telecommunications systems come together, particularly when it comes to
global Internet traffic, the United States has been able to innovate
rapidly and gain both economic and national security benefits from this
convergence. \76\ It is critical that the government provide the right
incentivizes for industry to build out both domestic and allied
computing and communications infrastructure and invest in the capacity
and innovation to deliver such capabilities globally while also
continuing efforts to rip and replace adversary gear, whether it is in
state, local or allied systems. To that end, the government should
provide tax and other economic incentives for increased private
investment in the development of such technologies, the broader
deployment of large-scale computing infrastructure to support cloud and
edge computing, the replacement of adversary technology, and the
expansion of AI capabilities being made available to U.S. and allied
innovators.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\76\ Cf. Manyika et al., Innovation and National Security, supra n.
73 at 2, 19, available online at (``This seventy-year strength
arose from the expansion of economic opportunities at home through
substantial investments in education and infrastructure, unmatched
innovation and talent ecosystems, and the opportunities and competition
created by the opening of new markets and the global expansion of
trade. '').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Maintain U.S. Capacity for Innovation. Ensuring that the United
States is able to access the underlying manufacturing capacity and
workforce necessary to support a modern technology and communications
infrastructure--including consistent access to semiconductors, critical
minerals, and other core materials necessary to support major
technological innovation--will also be of strategic importance to the
United States in the coming years. It is critical that government and
industry work together to create the right tax and regulatory
incentives to ensure that American and allied companies invest their
money here (and in allied nations) to create much-needed capacity and
to ensure that we have the skilled workers necessary to build and
maintain this capacity.
5. Avoid Harmful Overregulation. To ensure that the United States
remains a leader in technology innovation, it is critical that the
United States avoid adopting significant new regulatory or
administrative policies that would undermine the ability of the United
States to effectively compete on a global scale. Efforts in recent
years to amend longstanding and highly effective antitrust laws that
have served our economy well for decades, \77\ are a key example of the
kind of new policies that would be highly detrimental in the context of
the ongoing economic and national security competition with China.
These efforts, which target a handful of technology companies based on
the nature and scale of their business, are largely driven by policy
issues unrelated to innovation or competition. \78\ As such, they would
likely undermine the very companies that have the largest potential to
benefit the United States and our allies by posing the biggest threat
to the PRC's effort to win the technology competition and sends exactly
the wrong message to new entrants: namely, that if small, innovative
businesses thrive and become highly successful, expanding not through
unfair competition, but through market success, the government might
seek to target them for special attention, creating laws to cut them
down to size. \79\ To the extent there are concerns that market power
actually is being used to undermine competition, existing law--and the
longstanding consumer welfare standard that undergirds them--when used
appropriately, can effectively address these concerns. \80\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\77\ See, e.g., American Innovation and Choice Online Act, S. 2992,
117th Cong. (2021); Open App Markets Act, S. 2710, 117th Cong. (2021).

Companies Is a Recipe for Economic Disaster, Barron's (June 17, 2022),
available online at
(``Conservatives are often worried--sometimes for good reason--that
certain social or mainstream media companies might actively seek to
suppress or quiet conservative voices. On the liberal side, there are a
range of legitimate concerns with technology companies, including the
displacement of traditional labor in the new gig economy . . . Yet
rather than tackling these concerns directly by going after the
specific behaviors or actions that trouble ordinary Americans,
politicians in Washington have chosen instead to vilify some of our
most successful companies and to go after them economically.''); see

Institution (Mar. 3, 2022), available online at .
\79\ Klon Kitchen & Jamil Jaffer, The American Innovation & Choice
Online Act Is A Mistake, The Kitchen Sync (Jan. 19, 2022), available
online at (``Going after our technology companies, particularly a
targeted shot at certain big ones, sends the wrong message to startups
and investors alike; it tells them that if you are innovative enough to
be successful and grow significantly larger, you may be targeted for
different treatment . . . This undermines not only the companies that
are likely to be investing in R&D over the next decade and generating
some of the key innovations that will contribute to our national
security, it also undermines a central proposition that has created a
robust tech ecosystem in this country: take risk, innovate, fail fast
and often, and when you succeed, reap the rewards so long as you don't
exploit your position to gain unfair advantage.''); Evanina & Jaffer,
Kneecapping U.S. Tech Companies, supra n. 78 (``Picking and choosing
individual companies to be treated differently than others under our
antitrust laws is inconsistent with the heart of our economic system,
which Seeks to reward innovation and success, not penalize them.'').

Evanina & Jaffer, Kneecapping U.S. Tech Companies, supra n. 78.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Avoid Being Tempted By the European Model. There are those who
argue that the U.S. ought enact laws like the General Data Protection
Regulations, the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the
AI Act in order to make sure we are keeping up on the latest in
regulatory creep. \81\ The reality, however, if one looks at the
economic and innovation scoreboard as between the United States and
Europe--when looking at GDP growth, the creation of highly successful,
highly innovative businesses, or building private companies whose
technology innovations have a massive benefit for national and economic
security--it tilts decisively in favor of the U.S. today, as it has for
the last five decades at least. \82\ Unlike Europe, which often seeks
to drive specific market outcomes, the United States has generally
sought to institute a broadly applicable set of rules designed to
ensure that all market participants compete fairly. Sticking with the
traditional American approach is the right way to go.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\81\ See, e.g., Cecilia Kang, As Europe Approves New Tech Laws, the
U.S. Falls Further Behind, New York Times (April 22, 2022), available
online at

Big Tech Could Be Bad News For U.S. National Security, Forbes (July 7,
2022), available online at ; Jaffer, The Role of American Technology
Sector, supra n. 75.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Incentivize AI and Emerging Technology Innovation and Focusing
Any Regulation Only on Critical Gaps. The approach that best protects
U.S. national and economic security in AI and emerging technology is
one that allows innovation to flourish, stepping cautiously to address
legitimate concerns where regulation is warranted and appropriate,
based on traditional considerations like a demonstrable market failure.
Rather than rushing to broad-based regulation, as the European
Parliament has recently, the wiser approach, consistent with the
American approach to innovation, would be to identify potential
regulatory need, assesses whether regulation is necessary and
appropriate, and prioritize the voluntary adoption of industry-driven
frameworks, before moving to a regulatory posture, which in turn would
build upon the voluntary frameworks. \83\ While much has been written
about the potential of AI to cause significant harm, the fact is that
AI has the potential to have a transformative effect on human society,
raising all boats and allowing a broad range of workers to do mundane
tasks more efficiently while freeing innovators to create even more
productive tools and capabilities. \84\ As such, the best approach on
AI may be the more cautious one: encouraging those closest to the
actual creation of the technology to craft potential frameworks and
industry best practices that might guide the trusted, safe, and secure
development and implementation of these technologies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Stop Investing in Our Adversaries. In 2022, the total U.S.
foreign direct investment in China was $126.1 billion, an increase of
more than $10 billion from the prior year. \85\ American companies have
made major investments in leading-edge Chinese companies, including in
the artificial intelligence arena, and by one metric, U.S. investors
``accounted for nearly a fifth of investment deals in Chinese AI/ML
companies from 2015 to 2021.'' \86\ We must take sustainable action to
limit on outbound investment from the U.S. in critical industries like
high performance computing, semiconductors, critical minerals, cloud
computing, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, to name just
a few.

(Feb. 1, 2023), available online at .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Growing a STEM-Capable Workforce By Investing Here and Fixing
Our Broken Immigration System. The U.S. must take action to grow our
STEM workforce, including continuing appropriate funding the workforce-
related programs authorized in the CHIPS and Science Act and directing
new and existing resources to the States in form of block grants to be
used through public schools, public charter schools, and private
institutions. \87\ We must also incentivize those who come from abroad
to study here to stay here, develop their new technology, and build
businesses in the United States, rather than forcing them to back home.
One of the nation's most enduring achievements is our ``ability to
attract and retain some of the world's best STEM talent . . . [that
can] drive research and development efforts,'' yet our current
immigration system makes little sense, because it allows a wide range
of undergraduate and graduate students to benefit from our world-class
higher education system, but then--with exception of the small number
that are able to obtain H-1B visas or otherwise stay in the United
States--requires them to return home to build businesses abroad. \88\
This poorly thought-out policy actually forces American companies to
hire high-skilled workers abroad and deprives our own economy of the
benefits of their employment here, including the tax revenues and
spending of these high-skilled, high-wage workers who could easily be
vetted to address any potential IP theft and foreign intelligence
concerns. \89\

10. Set a Clear, Declaratory Cyber Deterrence Policy and Where
Needed Take Action to Deter Future Attacks. If we are to take seriously
the threat posed by China and other nations that are actively targeting
our critical infrastructure, we cannot simply remain on the defensive;
rather, we must implement effective deterrence in the cyber domain. We
can do so being clear about what kind of activity we can tolerate and
what kind of activity would cross a line; we must talk about our
offensive capabilities in the cyber domain to demonstrate one way we
might effectuate that deterrence; and, having established a clear line,
we must be willing to enforce it and impose significant consequences on
bad actors and we must do so in a way that is open and transparent so
we are able to deter both the current and future actors. \90\ While
there are those that argue such a policy is too provocative or more
likely to get us into a conflict, the reality is that we are already in
state of sustained low-level combat in the cyber domain, and that it
has gotten worse in recent years not better. \91\ The fact of the
matter is that when our adversaries don't know how we might react--or
worse, based on prior practices assume that we won't react all--they
are more likely to push the envelope and test our boundaries. \92\

vii. conclusion
For over a decade now, Congress and the executive branch have been
talking the very real threats that globally repressive nations like
China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea pose to the United States,
particularly in the cyber domain and with respect to emerging
technologies. And while we have taken significant action to address
some of these threats, the reality is that we are far from where we
need to be if we are going to successfully limit the threat these
nations pose. It is critical that the United States take swift action,
alongside our allies, to limit the threats we face in the cyber domain
and to limit our exposure to the threats that are apparent in the
emerging technology domain as well while continuing to lead on
innovation. To do any less would be significant mistake.

Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you, and thank all of you
for your testimony.
And just picking up on one of the points you raised, we
have had bipartisan support to try to provide substitutes--
competitive substitutes to Huawei and ZTE for the reasons that
you explained--rip and replace here at home. But we need to
continue to be vigilant on a bipartisan basis and provide
alternatives to these countries.
Let me just focus first with you, Ms. Cunningham, because
we are trying to use this hearing to identify things that we
can do to try to break through censorship, like the firewalls
in China and other places, and as Senator Romney said, in many
cases, as you know, this is a race against technology.
But there are also ways we can raise costs on both
countries and companies that are engaged in this kind of
activity or aiding and embedding this kind of activity.
You know, back in the day during the cold war we had Radio
Free Europe, Radio Liberty, to try to, you know, overcome
censorship in the Soviet Union. There were always efforts to
jam those radio signals. We are on to new technologies right
now.
So just focusing now on technology, if you could talk a
little bit about how you all at the OTF are helping dissidents
and others in countries that have extreme censorship to try to
use technology so they can get good information about what is
happening in their countries and elsewhere around the world.
Ms. Cunningham. Thank you.
The Open Technology Fund invests in two categories of
technology--anti-censorship tools like VPNs that the chairman
has already spoken about, as well as privacy and security
enhancing technologies to make sure that civil society and
journalists around the world are able to stay safe and report
safely during their work.
The challenge here is that we are just woefully outspent
when it comes to innovating and supporting these technologies.
In just the last 2 years demand for OTF supported VPNs has
increased by over 500 percent, and we do not have the resources
to support the VPN users around the world who are eager for
these tools, who want to access free and independent
information.
The challenge, frankly, on that front is not a technical
one. We have VPNs that work well, that are secure and
effective, but we just do not have the resources to be able to
meet the demand for users around the world who are facing
online censorship for the very first time.
It is also critically important to your point, Mr.
Chairman, that these tools are there to help get free and
independent news and information to citizens around the world.
We actually work very closely with Radio Free Europe, including
Radio Farda, which works in Iran. We know that our VPNs deliver
90 percent of their Farsi audience to Radio Farda.
So these tools are not only effective, they are being used
to seek out and find the exact type of information that we want
dissidents--that we want human rights defenders to find.
However, as I said, the challenge right now is resources.
When we are competing with China and Iran, who are spending
billions of dollars on these technologies, it is hard with only
millions to be able to meet the accelerating demand we see
around the world.
Senator Van Hollen. So it sounds to me like your answer is
we do have the technological wherewithal to break through some
of these censorship walls, but it is a question of resources.
Let me also ask you about the role of sort of private internet
service companies and others in these spaces.
So, for example, in China U.S. social media companies do
not--they cannot operate there consistent with the rules. Of
course, China has a wide open access to markets in the United
States and elsewhere around the world.
But in many of these places there are internet service
providers and other private companies that are aiding and
abetting authoritarian regimes.
So maybe you could identify some of those examples and what
we can do to raise the cost on those private sector companies
that are essentially colluding with those foreign governments
that are trying to oppress the people and deny them access to
important information.
Ms. Cunningham. I think this is one of the most critical
challenges that we face in China right now in particular, is
U.S. private sector technology companies' complicity with
Chinese government censorship.
An example that comes to mind for me is the Apple App
Store. We know that at the request of the Chinese government
Apple has removed independent news and information apps like
Radio Free Asia, for example, from the Apple App Store in
China, preventing Chinese citizens from accessing that
information.
But they have gone further than that. They also remove,
based on requests from the Chinese government, most internet
freedom technologies. So if you are a Chinese citizen in China
you cannot access the VPNs that I just described.
You cannot access the secure information and communication
technologies that the U.S. Government is supporting because
Apple is actively removing them from the App Store.
Finding ways to increase both the transparency and cost for
those companies to remove U.S. funded internet freedom
technologies, but also independent news and information, is
critical in ensuring that Chinese citizens can continue to
access this information.
Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate your raising that example,
and we are looking at ways to address it. We need to also make
sure that if, for example, another company comes in and just
replaces Apple that they do not get the benefit of that market
share without being somehow penalized from their entry into
other markets. So thank you for raising those issues.
Senator Romney.
Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to
the individuals who have spoken with us this morning.
I would imagine that if I were an authoritarian like Xi
Jinping I would use these tools exactly the way he is doing
them. I would use them to spy on people, to spy on the United
States, to spy on my adversaries.
I would use them to censor the news to make sure they only
got what supported me and my continuation as the leader of
China.
So when I hear discussion of we need to establish norms and
let them know they are breaking norms or an expression of, what
was it, an expression of concern by the U.S. Senate, if I were
Xi Jinping I would laugh.
It is, like, who the heck cares about global norms or
expressions of concern of the United States and the Senate? The
only thing that would allow us to defeat the spread of
authoritarianism and digital authoritarianism is by having the
tools and capabilities to push back against it and exercising
our own strength.
Am I wrong in that assessment? I mean, It just strikes me--
I will turn to you, Mr. Jaffer. It strikes me that the pathway
for us is to lead in technology, to push back against the
Huaweis.
I mean, to eliminate the Huaweis from our systems and
TikTok from our system, get them out, and then work to help
replace them in other places, and to have the rest of the world
recognize this is a battle between freedom and
authoritarianism, and they are going to do all these things
because our norms they laugh at, and their norms we find
reprehensible, but that is where we are.
Am I wrong? And I applaud the work that you are doing to
provide additional sources for information. But I look at what
the Russians are doing and the Chinese, but particularly the
Russians with all their bots overwhelming our systems. They are
so far ahead of us in these things. That is one more that I
would take on.
But Mr. Jaffer, help me on this. It strikes me that most of
what we are talking about just does not make sense unless it
is, hey, stay ahead of them--use our technology to identify
them and kick them out.
Mr. Jaffer. No, Senator Romney, you are exactly right. The
idea of sort of strongly worded letters from the Senate or from
our diplomats or the like are not going to get this job done.
What is going to get this job done is providing people who
want freedom in those countries access to news and information
the way that the Open Technology Fund is doing, and ensuring
that we are investing here at home, that we are building the
best and most awesome technology here at home.
I mean, look, if you look around the world today, we are
the leaders in AI, but that position is not guaranteed. In
fact, if we adopt the approach the Europeans have taken, which
is regulate, regulate, and regulate, right, we are likely to
lose that edge.
So we need to avoid over regulation here. We need to
incentivize investors here in the United States and innovators
here in the United States. You know, there is a reason why the
world wants to come here to the United States.
It is because we have the most productive system of the
allocation of capital around the globe, and protecting and
preserving economic liberty is critical to the effort to fight
authoritarianism around the globe, right.
It is not just that we are going to have a freedom of
societies. We have got to take advantage of it, double down on
it, and that is why also ensuring that our investors are not
investing in Russia, in China, in Iran, and North Korea--all
too many American investors take the benefit of investing in
China and getting that advantage.
But the truth is those investments are terrible. Those
investments ultimately lose money, and in the long run the
right approach is to invest here, invest in our allies, and
invest in trust, safety, and security.
And so we believe that there actually is an investment
thesis around investing in the U.S. Senator Ricketts, you are
an innovator. You have worked in this space. You have helped
develop startups.
Senator Romney, you have done this at Bain for a decade.
That is what it is about. It is about the allocation of
capital, and until we recognize that all too many Europeans and
the European system views us as the enemy, views our technology
companies as the enemy, when in fact we are actually the
innovators who are creating this space and these opportunities,
I think, at the end of the day, what we have got to do to your
point, Senator Romney, is double down on that and avoid the
strongly worded letters.
And the last point I will make is if we are worried about
what is happening in cyber domain, the best and most effective
way to succeed in the cyber domain is to push back against what
Russia, China, and Iran are doing, and until we respond to
their activities here in our country attacking us and our
allies, they are not going to get the message.
Senator Romney. I have not got quite enough time to turn to
the next question, but I got to try it nonetheless.
Please be brief because I took a long time, and that is and
I guess I will do it in the second round. I am looking--I have
got 19 seconds. So I am not--that is not fair to you, Ms.
Cunningham. We will come back and address in a moment. Thank
you.
Mr. Jaffer. Apologies. I think I used up too much of your
time, Senator. I apologize.
Senator Van Hollen. To the newest member of our committee,
Senator Helmy.
Senator Helmy. Thank you, Chairman.
I would start by thanking you and the ranking member and
this committee for the work it has done and the legacy you both
in this committee have. You have taken a global competitiveness
and security issue, and from my experience in financial
services, health care and state government, the work that this
committee does on the global level has had real impacts, as Mr.
Jaffer mentioned, to the work that state governments do to
better prepare for the global threat and our critical
institutions like health care, utilities, and otherwise.
Mr. Jaffer, I am going to pull on a string you left in your
testimony there, if I may, and to the ranking member's
question.
It is clear that the U.S. Government has much ground to
cover to compete with the PRC in technological innovation. You
have mentioned the need for additional capital, which would
include more robust funding for research and development to
emerging technologies, cross-collaboration with the private
tech sector as a means of advancing our interest in national
security in the cyberspace.
How do you envision the U.S. cyber deterrence strategy when
the legal parameters and international norms do not address the
current bad behavior of our adversaries, including the PRC and
Russia?
Mr. Jaffer. Thank you, Senator Helmy.
Look, I think that today the level of activity we have seen
on American systems is sufficient to enable us to push back if
we wanted to, and that pushback can come in the form of cyber
options, or it can also come in the form of other options--
sanctions and the like.
Today, America's intellectual property has been stolen to
the tune of billions of dollars a year, trillions total, and as
a result, that damage alone to our economy and the threat it
poses to our national security is enough to warrant more
aggressive active pushback in the cyber domain.
I think the norms are there. We are choosing not to take
advantage of them.
Senator Helmy. Thank you.
Mr. Kaye, in light of the upcoming election the
subcommittee's work, obviously, is going to pivot on the
critical response to enduring the challenge of curtailing
authoritarian regimes that seem to have no constraint on their
digital oppression at home and their efforts abroad.
What hopes do you have for future Administrations to
properly address the use of commercial spyware, particularly by
our authoritarian adversaries?
Mr. Kaye. Thank you for that question, Senator Helmy, and
that also gives me an opportunity to respond in part to Senator
Romney's point.
So I want to make two points here. The first is that
although I share the concern very much about Chinese repression
at home and its export of its repression abroad, I think it is
important to see the moment that we are facing as a moment in
which we have a very cheap availability of tools that are
spreading well beyond the states that have that kind of power.
And so there is a range of steps actually that the Congress
has already been taking actually at a normative and at an
operational level, let us say, to deal with the threat of
foreign commercial spyware, and I think that is actually
important, and there is quite a bit to build on there.
The second point that I wanted to make is maybe to give it
defensive norms for a moment because I do think that while
there is a kind of battle in the trenches right now that is a
technology battle and is also a geopolitical battle, it is also
a normative battle, and that normative battle is a vision of a
free and open internet on the one side, the one that I think we
all share, and a vision of one that is all about state control.
And it is not just a question of those norms being adopted
by U.N. resolutions and so forth. It is a question of those
norms being essentially embedded in our laws and the Congress
and the State Department and others pushing for those norms to
be a part of our allies' laws, so that their own use of this
technology and their own export of the technology is
constrained by rules.
So I see a connection between norms, which I agree in the
abstract do not mean that much, but norms that are actually
operationalized, I think there is quite a bit of room, and
there is actually quite a bit to build on from both what
Congress has done and what the Biden administration has done in
recent years.
Senator Helmy. Thank you, Mr. Kaye. That concludes my
questions.
Thank you, Chairman.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Senator Ricketts.
Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The use of cyber warfare both in peacetime and armed
conflict has become a reality. Over the last 20 years Russia
has developed its capabilities, trained its hackers, advanced
its capacity to undertake a wide range of cyber operations.
Since Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine Russian hackers
have breached Ukrainian telecom systems and executed multiple
cyber attacks on the Ukrainian government.
Despite these efforts, Ukraine has proven resilient. While
the odds seem to favor Russia's dominance in cyberspace, they
have not prevailed against Ukraine, and Ukraine has largely
maintained its presence online.
Banks remained operational. Lights have remained on, unlike
the cyber attacks of 2015 and 2016 that caused blackouts,
electricity and information--you know, electricity and
information continue to flow.
While Russia possesses the means and capabilities and the
intent to cripple Ukraine's cyberspace and critical
infrastructure, the reality has been different. Their efforts
have not been successful.
So, Mr. Jaffer, why has Russia not succeeded? Why have they
not been able to bring Ukraine to its knees from cyber attacks
and turn off the power and so forth?
What do you attribute Ukraine's success to?
Mr. Jaffer. Well, I think a few things, Senator Ricketts.
One, I think that we did do a lot of work ahead of time
working with Ukraine to get it stronger, get it more
defensible.
A lot of the capabilities Ukrainians are deploying today
are American technologies built by American technology
companies that have been hardened against these type of Russian
attacks. So that is one, I think, answer to why Russia has been
less successful than we would hope.
I think the second piece of it is, frankly, that the
Russians have not embedded as deep as they might have in the
Ukrainian networks and delivered the capabilities they could
have delivered early on in this conflict, and so Ukraine was
able to get their stuff out more rapidly than I think the
Russians expected.
It is true in the physical world, and it has been true in
the cyber world as well. I think there is a lesson for that--
for the United States.
We rely so much on our technological networks that we can
identify ahead of time if the individual--if the private sector
and public sector, are able to partner effectively we too can
defend ourselves against these type of threats in a more
effective way than we are today.
Senator Ricketts. So, I am interested by what you said
there about being embedded. Is this something where Russia was
not looking at Ukraine as much as maybe they are looking at the
United States? Or is there a lesson here for us with regard to
what else we need to be doing with regard to rethinking our
cyber strategies?
Mr. Jaffer. Well, I think that we know how deep the
Russians and the Chinese are in our networks. Just over the
past year we have heard a lot about how deep the Chinese have
gotten and the fact that they are deploying actual disruptive
and destructive capabilities in American systems through this
Volt Typhoon set of attacks.
So we know that they are doing it. We know that they are
getting in place. Now, whether the Russians deploy those kind
of capabilities, which we know they have, as deep in the
Ukrainian networks or not is unclear. They clearly did not use
them.
We have seen the Russians use destructive attacks in the
past. We know they have the ability to wipe out systems.
So I think the answer here is twofold. One, when we
identify these capabilities in our networks we have got to get
them out.
We have got to deter them from putting them in in the first
place, which we are not doing effectively because we are not
really pushing back against Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and
North Korean attacks.
And then, finally, I think what the Ukrainians did
effectively, which we still need to do more of in this country,
is to partner between the public and private sectors to ensure
that their systems are more defensible. We want to do that here
in the United States.
We are just not been--not very good at it. We have tried
for a decade. We need to get better at that and fast.
Senator Ricketts. So we talked about what we can learn from
this. What do you think our adversaries are learning from this,
based upon Russia, what they have done in Ukraine and what they
have not actually been able to get done in Ukraine?
Mr. Jaffer. Yes. As we think about China and a potential
Taiwan scenario I think what they are looking at is if you are
going to go in make sure you have the capabilities you need
both on the ground and cyber wise, and do not go in until you
can finish that conflict in a week.
We thought it would be over in a week when the Russians
invaded Ukraine. The Ukrainians were able to push back
aggressively and hold the line and have held the line now for
the better part of 2 years.
So I think what our adversaries are learning is you got to
get in. You got to get deep. You have to know your capabilities
are there and then effectuate them, and that is why I think the
Russian--I think that is why the Chinese are waiting, for
instance, on Taiwan.
They are not waiting because they are scared of us. We are
not there. We cannot get there in time to stop them. If we do
not position stuff forward, we will never win that fight and
they know it.
So they are not waiting for us. They are waiting because
they are not ready to go in fully, and I think that is a lesson
they are learning from Ukraine.
Senator Ricketts. But specifically on the cyber aspect of
it you think that what they are learning is they have to be
deeper into the networks?
Like, Russia should have been deeper into Ukraine's
networks before they launched this attack, and you think that
that is what the PRC is learning about Taiwan, that maybe they
do not feel like they are deep enough into Taiwan's networks
before they could be successful in executing some of these
cyber attacks?
Mr. Jaffer. I think that is exactly it.
Taiwan and our networks, because they want to be able to
push back against us so that if in fact we were to intervene on
behalf of Taiwan, they could cripple us as well.
They know that is their strategic advantage. That is what
they are looking to do, and that is why Volt Typhoon and the
change in Chinese behavior that we have seen in the last 6
months is so critical to focus on.
Senator Ricketts. Great.
So OK, I am down to 2 seconds too, so I am going to turn it
back over to the chairman. But thank you very much, Mr. Jamil.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Ricketts.
So in my initial questioning I was focused on how we try to
break through the censorship firewalls in places like China,
places like Iran, Russia now. But if we look at the commercial
spyware market, it is not necessarily those countries who are
the most advanced in developing these technologies.
So, Mr. Kaye, I would like to focus on that issue for a
moment, because groups like the University of Toronto Citizen
Lab, Amnesty International, and Access Now have documented the
targeting of Russian and Belarusian speaking civil society and
media figures residing in exile in Europe, civil society
figures in Jordan, journalists and human rights defenders in
Mexico and El Salvador, and pro-democracy activists in
Thailand, just to note a few.
There is a report that just came out this month by the
digital forensic research lab of the Atlantic Council entitled
``Mythical Beasts and Where to Find Them, mapping the global
spyware market and its threats to national security and human
rights.''
They identify companies in India and Italy and Israel as
being some of the main sources of selling this spyware to
regimes around the world. It also goes on to say that this is a
very thriving market, and there are a lot more actors joining
this.
I think the one that got early attention, of course, was
when NSO technology was used by the Saudis to essentially track
and monitor Khashoggi's fiancee at the time, leading ultimately
to his death.
The Administration, the Biden administration--I give them
credit--they have worked to try to raise the costs to these
companies that are engaged in this commercial spyware and
selling it to these regimes including by putting them on the
Entities List and other measures. You mentioned some of these
in your opening statements.
Could you elaborate a little more on your assessment of
whether or not those penalties have been effective and then
elaborate a little bit more on some of your suggestions on
whether you think there are more things we should be doing
right now to raise the costs on those companies?
Mr. Kaye. Mr. Chairman, thank you for that question.
Let me answer in two ways. The first is on raising the
cost. I do think this is not only the Biden administration; it
has actually been on the basis of law that has been enacted by
Congress in the last couple of years where you have had both
the normative development against foreign commercial spyware,
and you have had the Administration through the Commerce
Department and the Treasury Department's OFAC imposing pretty
strict restrictions, essentially sanctioning spyware companies
from around the world, and the early evidence--and I stress
that this is early evidence--but the early evidence is that
these costs are actually having an impact on these companies.
We see that in a number of areas. We see that in reporting.
We see that in the change that some of the companies are
undergoing. So I think there is a movement although, again, it
is early.
I think the next step is recognizing that the United States
cannot do this alone. This is a global problem, as the
reporting by the Citizen Lab and Amnesty and Access Now have
indicated. It is a global problem, and it requires a global
solution.
Now, the Biden administration has pulled together a number
of other states in order to push similar kinds of approaches
that we have done at home. I think these other states are
somewhat lagging behind. I think a bit of congressional
pressure and support for those Biden administration initiatives
would be extremely valuable.
I also think that it would be valuable for Congress to look
at ensuring that those victims, particularly victims in a
transnational repression context--those who are in the United
States, because we have evidence of people in the United States
being targeted by different forms of either mercenary spyware
or other kinds of hacking--that those individuals can actually
take action themselves, bring suits against states.
Now, those suits are often barred, often by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act, but there may be some room there, I
think, for Congress to consider whether there might be a
benefit to ensuring that some remedies are available.
So I think there is a lot of room to increase those costs.
There is a lot of global space to do that, and I think that,
honestly, Congress and the Biden administration have been on
the right track. There is a good trajectory there.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Senator Romney.
Senator Romney. You have each spoken about or not--I think
almost everyone has spoken about a free and open internet, and
I am not sure entirely what that means.
We would obviously believe that all of our information
sources should be available. The Chinese and Russians and
others would think all of their information should be
available.
There would also be massive disinformation. We are seeing
that now. I wonder whether the day is coming when the American
public stops looking at the internet for information because it
is so overwhelmed with information coming from bots--made up
stories, made up pictures.
So when we talk about a free and open internet, I do not
know precisely how you determine that. Are we going to--are we
going to--if you will censor Russian bots? I guess I think yes,
but then it is no longer free and open. And how do you--how do
you define a free and open internet?
Because I am sure Xi Jinping would say that is what we
have--we have a free and open internet. All the information
that people need to see, all the truth as he wants people to
see it, is there. And we disagree. We think what they have is
false.
But so who determines and how do we assess what is a free
and open internet, and do we limit disinformation? Who decides
if it is disinformation? This is--I mean, obviously it is
something we are struggling with just here at home.
Mr. Kaye, it looks like you have a comment on that.
Mr. Kaye. Thank you for that question, Senator Romney.
It is a very good question, and it is an important question
that I think is actually quite complex. At the international
level we have basic rights to freedom of opinion and
expression, and it is a robust right, actually. The
international right is the right to seek, receive, and impart
information and ideas of all kinds regardless of frontiers.
So it is a right that should enable us to access
information, and when we think about subjects like
disinformation and how you restrict that, once we start to go
down that path we actually start to give the authoritarians a
kind of opening to censor because their view of what is
disinformation is not our view of what is disinformation.
So there are a few things that I would sort of point to
here that I think are valuable for us to think about. First
off, on the normative side--I hate to bring up norms--but the
Human Rights Council, the U.N. General Assembly, have very much
pushed this idea that international human rights apply online
as much as they do offline, and that is part of the normative
shift that has happened within the international community.
It is being pushed back against by China, by Russia, and by
many others. I think we need to continue to push for the idea
that individuals should have access to all kinds of
information.
I think we could also promote ideas that would essentially
involve both the private sector and public actors in being
involved in determining sort of the security that is required
for people to engage online.
I think this is a big part of what OTF does.
Senator Romney. I am going to interrupt just because I have
to go to another hearing, and I want to just follow up a bit on
this avenue of disinformation and open and free internet, what
it means.
Right now an entity can publish an absolute lie and slander
someone, libel someone, and there is no recourse for that
individual because they do not know who did it. They do not
know whether it is a bot or a person, and the internet company
is free from liability as well--the social media company.
I do not know what the answer is to deal with this
disinformation and slander and libel that occurs and wonder
should we insist that the social media companies determine that
there is an individual or an entity that is actually posting
something on the internet so that there is recourse if someone
wants to bring an action against either a government or an
institution or a person, as opposed to right now when there is
absolutely no awareness whatsoever of who is behind a post and
who is responsible for it?
Ms. Cunningham, I will turn to you and Mr. Kaye and Mr.
Jaffer. We have not got much time but any thoughts on that?
Ms. Cunningham. Well, actually----
Senator Romney. All right. All right. OK.
Yes. Mr. Kaye.
Mr. Kaye. Well, I would say that we ought to look to
actually to the European regulation, the Digital Services Act,
which tries to address this problem in a way that we have not
and their fundamental approach is transparency, on the one
hand, but also risk assessment, an actual requirement that the
companies conduct the kind of risk assessment to prevent the
kind of harms that you are describing, and then requiring that
there be some mechanisms of appeal for an individual who faces
these kinds of harms.
It is a very tricky and narrow path to walk, I think,
between demanding transparency and recourse and promoting and
protecting rights to free speech.
I think that is exactly where you are suggesting there is a
problem, and I think that we should--we could learn something
from what the European Union has done in this case in trying to
address----
Senator Romney. We are in trouble if we got to learn from
the Europeans. But maybe you are right.

Senator Romney. Mr. Jaffer, anything you want to say on
that regard?
Mr. Jaffer. No, I think that is exactly----
Senator Romney. By the way, I agree. That was humor. I
agree.
Mr. Jaffer. I too actually worry that when we look at the
European regulatory approaches to the solution to America's
problems on free speech, right. I actually think that could
actually have significant innovation challenges.
I think at the end of the day what we have got to figure
out is how do we protect anonymous speech, which there is a
long history of in this country, right, while also addressing
disinformation and misinformation, while also ensuring that we
are providing capabilities to people who live in unfree
societies to talk about the things they want to talk about and
get the news from us.
I have to say I think the only solution to this challenging
problem you raise, Senator Romney, is recognizing that there is
not a moral equivalence between what we do and what the Chinese
do.
When the Chinese or the Russians or Iran conduct
surveillance, they do it in a one party state with one control.
No judges. No independent authorities.
When we conduct surveillance, we have got to go to judges.
We have to have review. Congress reviews it. There is a lot of
oversight, and ultimately a judge weighs in.
And so, at the end of the day, I think that is the
difference. It is not the same when we talk about their
disinformation versus ours, or our legitimate information
versus theirs.
There is a fundamental distinction, and when we all embrace
that fundamental distinction I think at the end of the day, you
know, it is fine to put in place rules that require disclosure
of names and addresses if somebody is violating American, or in
the right case, European law, right, and it is OK to say, no,
China, Russia, you cannot get that same thing because you are
an authoritarian society.
It is just a different system, and it is OK to say when
they do it it is different, and when we do it it is OK.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Romney.
Senator Ricketts.
Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
All right, Mr. Jaffer, I want to pick up our conversation.
One of the things you said in our first round of
questioning was we need to push back harder against Russia,
China, Iran.
Talk to me. What are some of the specific steps you think
that we need to do to push back harder on these bad actors?
Mr. Jaffer. Well, look, Senator Ricketts, you know, we----
Senator Ricketts. Specifically talking about cyberspace on
this.
Mr. Jaffer. Yes, fair enough.
The same theory actually applies to the real world as well.
For all too long in the cyber domain we have accepted that
China steals billions of dollars a year, trillions of dollars
in total of American intellectual property.
We have accepted that the Iranians and North Koreans both
conducted destructive attacks in the United States back in
2015, right--Las Vegas Sands and the Sony Corporation.
We have accepted that, and we have not pushed back. We have
not hit their systems. We have not taken other actions in the
real world whether--you do not have to respond in cyber, right,
with a cyber activity. You can respond in the real world with a
cyber attack but we have not responded.
We have taken it on the chin over and over again, and what
that does is it creates more risk. It incentivizes bad actors
to try and test where our boundaries are.
Now, it is clear that some of them know where some of our
boundaries are. We have not seen a major takedown of our energy
grid or our banking system even though we know some of the most
cable actors--China, Russia--have that capability, right, and
we have seen, although it got close with Colonial Pipeline with
Russian sort of supported ransomware actors.
So we know there are some bounds that they recognize. The
problem is that if we do not hit them back, and we do not do it
in a way that is public, that we cannot effectively then deter
our adversaries or their friends from coming back against us,
and we have just taken our weapons off the table. We do not
talk about the red lines and we do not enforce them.
Senator Ricketts. So when you talk about hitting them back
are you talking about we should conduct cyber attacks against
them? And I think one of the reasons we do not do that is so we
preserve our capabilities so they do not know what we can hit
them with.
But are you also talking about, like, sanctions? What are
you talking--like, what are the specific things? You say hit
them back. How do we hit them back?
Mr. Jaffer. I think all the above. But let us talk about
cyber capabilities because I think that is a really good point,
and you are exactly right. Too often we say we do not use cyber
capabilities because we do not want them to know what weapons
we have.
But the same is true in the real world, right? There are a
lot of weapons we keep secret, we keep classified, but there is
a lot of weapons we talk about that we have and we use, right?
If we are going to effectively deter, you got to talk about
where your red lines are. You have got to talk about what you
are going to do if those red lines are crossed, you have got to
talk about the capabilities you have to enforce those red
lines, and then--last piece--when those red lines are crossed
you got to enforce them.
We do not do any of that. We do not talk about
capabilities. We do not talk about red lines. We do not enforce
them, and so it is no surprise that our adversaries are testing
our boundaries. They do not know where they are, and they do
not know what we are going to do, and then when it happens we
do not do anything.
Senator Ricketts. All right. I want to go back to this
other thing too because we talked about Ukraine and Russia
attacking them and not being discussed when you said it was
with American technology, American companies, helping out.
So why do you believe that our systems are so much more
vulnerable than Ukraine from a Chinese attack or a Russian
attack, you know, if they wanted to do that?
Mr. Jaffer. I think a couple of reasons. One, we are
innovating rapidly here in the United States as we deploy new
capabilities. They are not necessarily built with trust,
safety, and security in mind at all times. I think that is a
key thing.
We have got to incentivize that kind of behavior, and that
comes both from investment but also from light touch, you know,
regulation. The government can use the way that it spends its
money to get companies that sell to the government to build
more trust, safety, and security in their systems.
And then, finally, I think that, you know, in the United
States it is harder for the public and private sectors to
partner, right. There is a lot more challenges to it.
Private industry is afraid of regulation. They are afraid
of lawsuits. The government itself is afraid of giving
classified information to the private sector, right, and giving
it at scale to the private sector.
We have talked about it for decades. We have not done it
effectively. Those problems were a lot less true in other
countries, including Ukraine, where the public and private
sectors work a lot more closely together.
Senator Ricketts. OK.
And again, I am kind of running out of time here but can
you just talk about what are some of the most critical steps
that the U.S. needs to do? And I am looking for specific things
we can do to be able to enhance our cyber capabilities to
successfully be able to deter the PRC?
Mr. Jaffer. Well, I think, one, we have got to spend a lot
more on the cyber capabilities. We are underfunding our Defense
Department across the board including in the cyber domain.
We have got to give them the best cutting edge
capabilities. We have got to get them to lean forward. They
also, for their part, have to be willing to buy and build with
the private sector effectively.
All too often the government says we have got to build it
ourselves internally, or we are going to buy from the five
defense contractors we always buy from.
We have got to break that mold when it comes to emerging
technology. We are not going to be able to do this without
cutting edge startups.
And as for investment starts today, I can tell you it is
very hard for a startup. You know this, having done this in
Nebraska. It is very hard to start to sell to the government.
It is a no win. They want to do it. They cannot do it.
And at the end of the day, I think that if we continue to
over regulate, if we take the European model--Digital Services
Act, Digital Markets Act, GDPR, right--which a lot of people
think we are behind the Europeans. We are actually ahead of the
Europeans.
If we adopt European regulations, all that will do is harm
the ability of the U.S. to innovate and take our best players
off the field. That is a terrible idea.
The reason why Europeans do not have great innovation, they
over regulate it right at the jump. We should not make that
mistake, particularly not in the AI domain.
Senator Ricketts. Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Jaffer.
Mr. Jaffer. Thank you, Senator.
Senator Ricketts. Mr. Chairman.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Ricketts.
So I just want to follow up on some of these particular
issues.
First of all, thank you, Mr. Jaffer, for mentioning the
issue of protecting American IP. Years ago I authored a bill
called Protecting American Intellectual Property Act along with
former Senator Sasse, which is trying to get away from the fact
that companies' only recourse sometimes is to go to court in
the United States against foreign actors, where even if you get
a good decision it is hard to actually enforce.
The idea is to give the U.S. Government more tools where
you have a pattern of theft of intellectual property of
strategic value that we can go after and sanction them. We need
to use that tool more effectively.
I do just want to say with respect to international norms I
agree with you, Mr. Kaye, they are important. I do not think
anyone is under an illusion that we are going to convert China
to our way of thinking, or Iran.
But what we can do is try to both raise the costs and
increase the benefits to countries and the rest of the world to
follow the norms of an open internet or not engage in selling
of commercial spyware or whatever it may be, and that has value
if we are talking about sort of digital authoritarianism and
our efforts to combat it.
We have got to create these rules of the road, try our best
to do that, and then work very hard to try to enforce them
through both carrots and sticks around the world. So I think
that is what we are really focused on here.
Before I leave the issue of commercial spyware, I do want
to ask you about that because I think you referred to it. But
the Biden administration through a White House statement did
try to get a bunch of countries--and I think they got 17
countries--to sign on to a resolution, a document about
adherence to rules about not allowing companies in their
countries or discouraging companies from exporting commercial
spyware to authoritarian states.
Am I right about that?
Mr. Kaye. Yes. I think actually as of 2 days ago there are
21 states that have--that are part of this including the United
States, and the objective is not only to promote stricter
export controls so that spyware is not allowed to proliferate
the way it has but also to ensure that there are conditions on
relationships and on the sale of technology to states that are
committed, and not just committed in a sort of paper thin sort
of way, but in an implementable sort of way that they are
committed to observing human rights in the use of the
technology.
So that effort, I think, is part of what I was suggesting
before is that the United States can do a lot on its own, but
most of this really does have to be multilateralized in this
particular field.
Senator Van Hollen. Well, I do not know which additional
countries just signed on, but I do know that the three I
countries, as they say--India, Italy, and Israel--that were
identified in this Atlantic Council report were not part of the
original 17. Are they part of the 21?
Mr. Kaye. I do not believe that any of those three are. I
would have to check the list.
But you are right. When you look at the list, it is
actually a very interesting list, and maybe one I could just
identify to give a good example of both the threat and the
response to it.
So Poland has joined this effort, and of course, there has
been a change of government in Poland. The previous government
engaged in pretty massive spying on journalists and opposition
figures within Poland, and the new government--the newly
elected government from last year--has begun to sort of peel
back what actually was taking place, and they found that there
were literally hundreds of individuals who were targeted with
Pegasus spyware, and they have taken the decision that there
needs to be accountability for that use.
In a sense, they are modeling something that the United
States is encouraging, and in a way they are modeling it to
other states. They are not modeling it just to us because, as
Jamil said, we have the rule of law in the United States, and
we need others to demonstrate that they have it, too.
So I think there is--you know, it is really not just a
question of having states sign up to this statement on its own,
but it is having them sign up and do the things like Poland is
doing to actually demonstrate that they mean business and they
mean accountability.
Senator Van Hollen. And what would you suggest the United
States do for countries that choose not to participate in this?
We talked about some of the things we can do with respect to
companies by putting them on the Entities Lists or, you know,
visa sanctions on individuals who work for companies. But how
about at the country to country level?
Mr. Kaye. On the export side, I think there is quite a bit
that the United States can do to encourage compliance.
It is difficult in part because, as you noted earlier, the
spyware industry is a massive industry that is incredibly
remunerative and economically beneficial to the countries where
they are headquartered.
So we are fighting against that. But I do think there are
kinds of conditions that the United States can impose. I do not
mean conditions on our entire relationships with countries, but
conditions on certain kinds of support and cooperation that are
related to the end user.
In other words, the client country's use of technology
should be based on fundamental human rights norms, and we can
do some conditioning in terms of what we share, what our
relationship looks like in order to move them.
We have that power to move them in a positive direction. I
think some of that if it is embedded in law as well could be
also extremely valuable.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you for that.
I want to turn briefly to the tools for mass surveillance
which we see in use in China, and China, of course, also making
available for export to other countries that want to adopt a
lot of these tools.
Now, obviously, facial recognition has some beneficial uses
that can be used with proper guardrails and rules with respect
to law enforcement, but the line gets very murky, as you all
know.
My colleague, Senator Merkley, has been very focused on
this. Now when you go through TSA you get your picture taken,
although you can opt out. But we are trying at least to--
whether we can have a debate over what rules should apply, but
obviously that debate is not happening in places like China or
elsewhere where these technologies are being applied.
The Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department
of Commerce recently published a proposed rulemaking that
creates a control for facial recognition.
Could you talk about how this technology is developing very
rapidly and what your thoughts are and what kind of guardrails
we can put around those and again, try to create global norms?
And after Mr. Kaye if any of you others want to answer that
question please feel free to jump in.
Mr. Kaye. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that question.
I will answer briefly. First, I would say that we need to
be thinking about what kind of society we want to live in and
what we want to construct, and we, I think, just have to
recognize that some of these technologies are already in vast,
nefarious, authoritarian use in places like China, and we see
that, for example, with respect to the Uyghur population in the
west of China.
The surveillance state that you have there is, clearly, not
the kind of state that we as Americans deserve to live in. And
so I think that perhaps as a first order of business we need
privacy protection. We need nationally enforceable privacy law
in the United States.
We also need continuing strong commitment to fundamental
digital security tools, in my view, including encryption
technologies. These are the kinds of technologies that can
protect us. But also I do not think that we want to put all of
the onus for protection on the individual herself.
The protections need to be legal protections, so my view is
when we are talking about things like facial recognition,
affect recognition--all of these tools that essentially
interfere with our ability to be anonymous when we are out in
the world--I think we need to be thinking about legal
protections like a national privacy law.
Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate it.
Do either of the other two--if you want to comment on that
question.
Mr. Jaffer. Senator Van Hollen, I think privacy laws are
interesting but GDPR in Europe has not stopped mass
surveillance, right. Encryption technology is important. Has
not stopped mass surveillance in the United States or anywhere
in the globe.
So I think the real way to do this is the reason why these
things are so lucrative is because people will buy them, and
the reason why they can build them is because people will
invest in them.
If we can starve them of capital, that is one way to solve
this problem. Now, not all surveillance tools are built alike,
right. There are surveillance tools that are used by democratic
societies that are appropriate use under the rule of law,
right.
Our group of investors--our trusted capital group
investors, 19 investors around the globe including in Poland,
has come together and committed to not selling or building
technologies that will be used by our adversaries.
We have committed to only building technology capabilities
that are used by America and its allies. Now, of course, right,
that is because we believe in free and open societies.
It is OK for the U.S. Government and other governments that
have the rule of law to use surveillance technologies in
appropriate ways. So there is no upside to saying we are not
going to invest in those, but we are not going to invest in
capabilities nor invest in companies that sell to these
adversary nations.
And so if you have investors making those kind of
commitments and saying, we are going to bake trust, safety, and
security into our tools, we are going to follow the NIST
framework, we are going to follow these AI frameworks and the
like, and we are not going to invest in adversary technology,
that is the way to starve some of these companies who build
these technologies of capital.
Now, other capital providers will, of course, step in--
China, Russia, Iran. Sovereign wealth funds may step in. But
then the government can take action against those.
So there is an appropriate space for the government to act.
There is an appropriate space for private capital to act, and
the question then just becomes can we convince other private
capital actors to get in this and to ultimately build and buy
technology that is actually protected, secure, and capable.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Starting with you, I think, Mr. Kaye, on this legal
question. But again, if the other witnesses want to answer it
please feel free to do so.
Last month the U.N. ad hoc committee on cybercrime adopted
the U.N. Convention Against Cybercrime, setting up a critical
vote in the U.N. General Assembly I believe later this year.
I think we can all recognize that there would be benefits
of having a common understanding across nations for what is
considered cybercrime. But critics of the draft text have
raised concerns about this treaty, that it would put at risk
privacy and data and the safety of dissidents, journalists, and
activists around the world. I believe that it was Russia that
first put forward this draft.
I believe the United States and others have pushed back
against certain provisions, and changes have been made, but the
question is whether the changes that have been made are
adequate to address the concerns about privacy and continuing
to expose dissidents around the world to unfair use of the
terms of the draft treaty.
So, first of all, as the Biden administration considers its
ultimate position on the treaty could you clarify for the
committee what issues the current draft presents as it relates
to potentially being used and abused by autocratic countries to
legitimize digital repression?
Mr. Kaye. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that question.
So you are absolutely correct. I mean, this was a Russian
initiative originally to put forward a global cybercrime
convention.
Of course, there already is a cybercrime convention, the
Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, and at a strategic level I
would say that because the Budapest Convention, which
admittedly has some of its own sets of problems, has stronger
protections for human rights, also for states that want to
resist abusive uses of cross-border legal procedures, that we
should be encouraging states to join the Budapest Convention,
not to join this new U.N. cybercrime convention.
And I think the proof of the problems to a certain extent
in the cybercrime convention is the array of industry, of
companies, of civil society that have expressed really grave
concerns and actually have expressed grave concerns about this
convention as it was being negotiated for the past several
years.
I would just give one little example, and the example is
how the convention defines `` serious crimes'' according to how
severe the penalty would be for that.
But if a matter is identified as a serious crime, it
provides a state with the ability to request data, including
personal data, subscriber data, and others across borders, and
I think that is something that puts in the hands of
authoritarians, including governments like Russia, the ability
to seek information and to weaponize their law in a
transnational sense that is just deeply, deeply problematic.
And certainly it is problematic at this particular moment
when, as the subject of this hearing indicates, there is a very
serious rise of authoritarianism in cyberspace.
So my view is that at the very least the United States
should abstain when this comes to a vote. But more generally,
strategically, we should be encouraging states to join the
Budapest Convention.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Do either of the other witnesses want to comment on this?
Ms. Cunningham.
Ms. Cunningham. I think to Ranking Member Romney's point
about kind of norms versus technology, this goes back to that
for me in that I think it is critical that we are investing in
both of these areas.
Certainly, it is the case that we are not going to get
China and Iran and Russia to start implementing a democratic
internet. But my bigger concern from a technical perspective is
that they are actively promoting their norms around the world.
The Cybercrime Convention is a great example of that, but we
see it from a technical perspective as well.
China, Iran, and Russia are engaging in technical standard
setting bodies as well to try and fundamentally even redefine
what the internet looks like from the inside out, trying to
undermine interoperability, trying to undermine security.
It becomes even more critical that we are thinking about
norms from a legal and policy perspective, but also a technical
perspective when we know these other governments are investing
time, money, and energy in terms of trying to redefine what the
internet looks like itself.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Mr. Jaffer. Senator Van Hollen, I agree completely with
what Mr. Kaye and Ms. Cunningham have said on this topic. I
think the idea that the U.S. spent the better part of 3, 4
years actually creating a separate process to develop this
treaty, have an existing convention that we are part of, and
then now it sort of changes its position is odd, and I am
hopeful that when it comes to the General Assembly here in the
next few days or next few weeks that there will be a different
outcome.
I mean, I think Ms. Cunningham's point is an excellent one
which is, you know, the role that these unfree countries--China
in particular, but Russia, Iran, North Korea as well--are
playing in some of these bodies, whether it is the U.N. Human
Rights Council, or you know, ITC or the like, there are a lot
of organizations that are setting standards and rules in key
areas of technology where they are able to get the jump on us
and then embed the kind of tools--the kind of rules that would
then empower Chinese technology to get in, I think that is very
problematic.
That is why it is so critical that the U.S. Government is
already on this issue. They are putting a lot more of our
people in these spots. But it is also important to bring
American industry in as well.
American industry is so critical to these standard setting
bodies that it has got to be a partnership between the
government and industry. Simply putting more government people
in these seats is part of the answer, but it is not the only
answer.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. So it is your view that if
the United States had to vote today on this treaty up or down
that you would at least abstain. Am I understanding your answer
correctly?
Mr. Jaffer. I would vote against it.
Senator Van Hollen. So we are coming toward the end of the
hearing, but I do want to just give each of you a chance to
cover any issues that you think that we have overlooked both in
terms of the issue itself but most importantly recommendations
that you can make to us as a Congress.
Obviously, the Administration can use the tools available
through executive action.
Mr. Kaye, you have already identified some additional legal
changes that we might consider here. But I just want to give
you all that opportunity.
I do also--if you could--this issue of standard setting
bodies, international bodies, is really important because it is
part of the conversation about the normative battle.
I mean, it is not disconnected from that. It is directly
connected to that, because that is actually where the rules get
put into place that govern the international use of these
technologies.
So maybe as you answer this question you could also just
point out where you think at this particular moment we need to
be doing more with respect to those international standard
setting bodies.
As you said, Mr. Jaffer, the Administration has increased
its focus on this, trying to deploy more people there, but this
is an ongoing battleground.
So this is just an invitation, really, to make whatever
sort of closing remarks you want to make, Ms. Cunningham, and
then we will just go down the line.
Ms. Cunningham. I will start by saying, I think we have
debated a lot about technology and norms today and I think it
is critical that we do both. I think to try and choose one of
the two would ultimately mean that we fail in this endeavor.
I think when it comes to staunch authoritarians like China,
Iran, and Russia we need to find ways to raise the cost by
investing in novel technologies that can help protect human
rights, and also provide anti-censorship and security
capabilities to citizens domestically so that they can push
back on authoritarianism where it is starting.
I think we also really do need to focus on norms, because
the reality is that Russia and China are exporting these
technologies, and not just the technologies--the training and
the beliefs that come with them, to over a hundred countries
around the world.
And even if norms may not win the day in China and Iran,
there are many countries across the Belt and Road in Africa and
Latin America that we still have a significant potential to
influence. I think if we are to lose focus on them we will lose
the larger battle in terms of defining what a democratic
internet could really look like.
To your question about standard setting bodies, one of my
concerns with this issue is that it is often seen very narrowly
in a human rights perspective when, frankly, it has huge
implications, as we have talked about today, for national
security, for our democratic principles.
And so when we think about where we need to engage on this
issue in standard setting bodies, the first thing that I would
encourage us to do is look across the board at all the places
where cyberspace is being raised and make sure that we are
engaging on this issue not just from a human rights
perspective, which is critical, but from all of our national
security and foreign policy interests.
One place that we engage particularly that I think could
use more focus is the IETF, but there are a number of different
places where China and Russia are raising these issues, and we
are underrepresented.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Mr. Kaye.
Mr. Kaye. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I actually share everything that Laura just said and would
only add a couple of additional points.
The first is on her point that I think we have been all
talking about, a situation where human rights and national
security actually align.
In other words, our interests in a robust human rights
approach to new technologies, to intrusive technologies, is
very much also a question of U.S. national security, and we can
point to example after example, I think, as we have all
indicated of where there is an alignment there--that the human
rights abuse is also a national security threat.
And so if we think in those terms I think there is a way to
think about how we engage in different international forums and
why we do and what we invest in.
So to give just one example of a forum that I think is
extremely underresourced, also occasionally under serious
criticism, is the U.N. Human Rights Council where the battles
there are sometimes normative but sometimes they also lead to
change in law at domestic levels.
And I think that is a space where the United States as it
has actually over the last few years has increased its voice
there could continue to do so. Also in the ITU there is room to
do that kind of work where, you know, the head of the ITU is
somebody who is well known in Washington.
I think there is a lot of room to do that kind of work in
those settings including the other standard setting bodies that
were mentioned before.
But I think that is the place that I would tend to focus
on. I think that, as we have discussed, all of those come
together as a question of both national security and
fundamental human rights.
Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
Mr. Jaffer. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
The only thing I wanted to mention was we spent a lot of
time today talking about a lot of the challenges that
technology can pose to free and open societies, to Americans
here at home, to repressed peoples abroad.
I want to focus on the fact that technology has actually
benefited the globe tremendously. American technology has
benefited free and open societies around the world.
It has raised standards of living around the globe. It has
provided opportunities for people in free and unfree societies
to have access to information in ways that have been
transformative.
I feel the same way about AI. AI has its challenges, to be
sure. It can empower authoritarians and the like. But writ
large I think artificial intelligence and the broad adoption of
it will actually be a tide that raises all boats, that creates
opportunities, creates new jobs, creates innovation, and
creates economic benefits not just here in the United States
and in our allied countries, but around the globe.
And so I am actually very heartened by the transformative
power of technology and the transformative power of systems
like ours that allocate capital toward innovative capabilities
and that drive us toward freedom and democracy.
And so while we have our challenges in this country, and
there are plenty, and our system is not perfect it is the best
the world has ever seen, and it is one both in the form of
allocation of capital, economic liberty, but also in freedom of
speech, freedom of thought and the like, and it is an idea that
we have got to once again embrace.
All too often we focus in on the threats of the challenges
we face, and there are tremendous ones both in this country and
abroad, but we also need to embrace the fact, I think, as
Americans and as folks in societies that are free and open that
we have responsibility to give that capability and that
opportunity to others around the world.
That is why the work that OTF is doing is so critically
important. That is why setting these norms is important but it
is about once you set the norms enforce them in living by them,
which all too often we talk about them, and they become
aspirational and do not become practical.
At the end of the day, I think that the opportunity that
you have given us to talk about these issues, the work that you
and the ranking member are doing on these issues to
 them here in the Senate and that folks in the
House are doing as well is so critical.
And thank you for the opportunity to be here, and thank you
for your attention to these important matters.
Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you all, and you are
absolutely right. I mean, these new technologies have huge
potential benefits.
I mean, technologies are not in and of themselves good or
bad. They can be put to good purposes. They can be put to bad
purposes, and I think one of the things we want to do in this
hearing, as you have all expressed, is maximize the good and
the benefits and minimize the harm and that is not easily done.
It requires, I think, thoughtful conversation.
So thank all of you for being part of it. It has been a
very engaging discussion. Thank you.
And with that, the record will be open until close of
business of Wednesday, September 25th, and again, thanking all
of our witnesses.
The hearing is adjourned.

Additional Material Submitted for the Record
Responses of Ms. Laura Cunningham to Questions
Submitted by Senator Brian Schatz
Question. U.S. technology companies actively comply with the
People's Republic of China system of digital authoritarianism in order
to operate in the country, including by removing VPNs and other
democracy-promoting applications from app stores at the behest of the
PRC. What can we do to raise the cost of this compliance, including by
making it more public?
Answer. The U.S. private technology sector is often excluded from
important markets unless they are willing to make unreasonable
accommodations to authoritarian demands--a choice between their bottom
line and respect for democratic values and human rights. This tension
is evident with respect to app censorship, wherein thousands of apps,
including many internet freedom tools, have been removed from app
stores at the request of the Chinese government as a form of meta-
censorship.
To place the scale of China's app censorship in perspective, a
report from OTF partner GreatFire's App Censorship project found that
66 of the 108 (61 percent) most downloaded apps worldwide were
unavailable to Chinese iOS users, compared to only 8 that were
unavailable in the U.S. Apps categorized as news, books, and social
networking are disproportionately unavailable in China. Notably,
Apple's own News app has been removed. So-called ``sensitive
categories,'' which include many OTF-supported technologies like VPNs,
privacy, and digital security, along with religion (especially related
to apps for Uyghur or Tibetan users), are also disproportionately
censored. In the lead-up to the commemoration of Tiananmen Square in
2022, for instance, the secure messaging app Session was removed.
App censorship as a form of information control is not limited to
the PRC, and instead is being adopted by other digital authoritarians
as further evidence of autocratic learning. Another report from
GreatFire's App Censorship project found that Apple removed over 50
VPNs from the Russia App Store this summer, double the number reported
by Roskomnadzor. The discrepancy suggests the scale of VPN app removals
is much larger than publicly acknowledged, and that Apple may be
proactively removing more VPNs than authorities have expressly
requested.
OTF continues to make investments in censorship monitoring
platforms to enhance transparency. However, increased public disclosure
requirements related to app censorship and the precise nature of how
governments mandate removals would be beneficial. Companies are
currently required to disclose cybersecurity incidents to the U.S.
government; they could be required to do the same when they enable
censorship and surveillance by autocratic regimes or by states that are
designated as foreign adversaries. While Apple reports on the total
number of apps removed worldwide because of a government takedown
request, this information is not disaggregated or specific. It also
does not include which apps are later removed globally, or for vague
violations of community standards. A wider range of public reporting
would provide policymakers with missing information to fully understand
the breadth and depth of authoritarian app censorship.
Question. How much demand for Virtual Private Network (VPN)
technology does OTF estimate there is amongst global civil society
organizations, what amount of that is OTF able to fulfill, and how much
additional funding does OTF estimate would be needed to cover the
difference?
Answer. Today, two-thirds of the world's population--nearly 5.5
billion people--live in a country where the internet is censored. In
the last 2 years there has been a marked acceleration in the speed,
scale, and efficiency of digital authoritarianism, such that OTF has
seen a more than 500 percent increase in demand for the VPNs we
support. We regularly supported about 9 million VPN users each month
for over a decade, but as a result of bipartisan support from Congress
and a one-time allocation from the State Department, we are now
supporting over 45 million users each month.
And demand continues to grow globally, including in Iran and
Russia, but also in Belarus, Cuba, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela,
and more. This growth indicates that VPNs are no longer solely for the
most at-risk populations: they are an essential prerequisite for
billions of people around the world who want to access the global
internet as we experience it.
However, the surge in demand for secure, trusted VPNs is quickly
outpacing the public resources that are available. In order to stretch
Federal funding, we have worked with VPN providers to reduce their
costs as much as possible to less than one dollar per year per user.
Similarly, we have engaged the private sector on ways they can further
contribute.
Despite these cost-saving efforts, OTF is anticipating a $10
million budget shortfall for VPN support in fiscal year 2025. As a
result, we will be forced to cut off as many as 14 million monthly
users in priority countries. In addition, we anticipate demand for OTF-
supported VPNs to increase 150 percent by fiscal year 2027 to
approximately 70 million users per month.
Question. What is OTF doing to strengthen the ability of civil
society organizations around the world to coordinate amongst themselves
and defeat digital authoritarian technology? How can Congress further
support this crucial cooperation?
Answer. Once only available to a small number of well-resourced
autocrats, highly advanced surveillance technologies are now widely
accessible to nation-states and other illiberal non-state actors around
the globe. Over the last 10 years at least 75 countries--nearly 40
percent of all nations--have acquired commercial spyware, giving rise
to a mercenary spyware industry now worth an estimated $12 billion per
year.
This pervasive use of accessible and affordable spyware and digital
surveillance technologies by authoritarian regimes has made civil
society organizations more vulnerable than ever. In many countries,
civil society organizations are working individually in isolation to
identify and mitigate digital threats to their organizations and
communities. While some groups have stepped forward to investigate and
analyze new surveillance tools and techniques, they remain few in
number, under-resourced, and cannot respond quickly to the immense
volume of new threats spread across different regions. The lack of
coordination often means that organizations spend too much time and
money on digital threats, and still often miss important critical
vulnerabilities. Even known actors in this space like Citizen Lab agree
that there is an urgent need for coordination among civil society
organizations to collect, analyze, and ultimately mitigate digital
threats and attacks.
To this end, OTF is supporting digital ``helpdesks'' to increase
threat intelligence expertise and coordination among local and regional
civil society organizations in order to effectively combat
authoritarians' enhanced and coordinated surveillance efforts. For
example, OTF supported the Tibetan Computer Emergency Readiness Team
(TibCERT), a formal, coordinated structure to identify, analyze, and
mitigate online threats to the Tibetan community--a frequent target. In
addition to significantly improving the digital security of the Tibetan
community, TibCERT has played an invaluable role in quickly identifying
and exposing new technologies and tactics being deployed by the Chinese
government globally.
This example is illustrative of a larger model that can be scaled
and replicated in other contexts. Our investments in digital security
consistently show us that increasing threat intelligence expertise and
coordination among local and regional civil society organizations can
effectively combat authoritarians' enhanced surveillance efforts. An
additional $10 million annually would allow for the establishment of a
global civil society threat intelligence coordination network to fill
existing forensic research and coordination gaps. These funds could
support at least 10 local/regional digital security helpdesks to
quickly identity and respond to novel digital threats; local
researchers to conduct in-depth forensic analyses of identified threats
and tactics; and regional and global coordination networks to rapidly
alert journalists, human rights defenders, and civil society
organizations of identified digital threats and share effective
mitigation strategies.

Response of Mr. David Kaye to a Question
Submitted by Senator Brian Schatz
Question. How are authoritarian states like Russia and China using
international bodies like the U.N. to advance digital authoritarianism?
What further should the U.S. Government, specifically Congress, be
doing to counter this?
Answer. Russia, China and other authoritarian governments advance
their interests within the United Nations system in different, if
mutually reinforcing, ways. As I noted in my testimony, China and
Russia take very seriously the normative system embodied by the U.N.
(even as they do not abide by its rules in their own laws and
policies). They tend to play a long game; whereas many authoritarian
governments simply seek to avoid censure within U.N. human rights
mechanisms, China and Russia see a long-term process which would, if
successful, reinforce their national efforts to promote state control,
extend the long arm of censorship, and counter democratic states'
efforts to maintain and reinforce a free and open internet.
For China, this has involved, among other things, robust engagement
with the negotiation of the UN's Global Digital Compact (GDC), in which
it has repeatedly sought to include language that emphasizes ``cyber
sovereignty,'' that is, a model of internet governance that privileges
state control over human rights. It played an active role in the GDC
negotiation, courting the main U.N. official guiding the negotiation,
the Secretary General's Technology Envoy, and coordinating the approach
of the G77 Group within the U.N. It follows a similarly engaged
approach across the range of U.N. activity, including with respect to
resolutions in the General Assembly and Human Rights Council. Moreover,
its efforts go beyond language in U.N. resolutions. In the
International Telecommunications Union's World Telecommunications
Standardization Assembly, for one example, China has sought to promote
an internet protocol favorable to its own economic and political
interests and inconsistent with an internet that enables the protection
of digital rights such as privacy and freedom of expression and
association.
Russia typically has taken a more aggressive rhetorical and
diplomatic approach, even as it shares China's long-term normative
agenda within the U.N. system. During my time as U.N. Special
Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, Russian diplomats
within the Human Rights Council would publicly dispute my argument that
individuals enjoy free speech and privacy rights online just as they do
offline, going so far as to pretend that freedom of expression did not
apply online at all. They echoed this aggressive approach in other
forums, such as the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), regularly seeking to undermine the OSCE's Representative on
Freedom of the Media. Perhaps the most notable recent Russian effort
has been its initiation and promotion of the Cybercrime Convention,
which the U.N. General Assembly may adopt later this fall. As I
suggested in my testimony, the Convention would open the door to a
global legal landscape friendly to state efforts to obtain private data
of dissenters, dissidents, and journalists across borders. Russia
fought hard against even the weak human rights safeguards included in
the final text of the Convention draft, but it is on the cusp of
getting U.N. approval of a vehicle for authoritarians to seek the
information of those it alleges are responsible for the vague category
of ``serious crimes.''
The United States plays a leading role in the global effort to
counter digital authoritarianism within the U.N. system and other
international bodies. Notwithstanding the example of the Cybercrime
Convention, the Biden Administration has been a strong supporter of
global digital rights. It has actively supported civil society
participation in those spaces where digital rights are considered and
negotiated. In order to promote and deepen that role for the United
States, I would suggest at least three concrete items for a
congressional agenda:
First, Congress should closely scrutinize the Cybercrime
Convention even if a future administration does not transmit it to the
Senate for approval of ratification. Such scrutiny, including briefings
and hearings with civil society participants in the negotiations, would
provide strong insights into how the Convention came to be, what it
suggests about authoritarian government strategies to undermine online
freedoms, what protections in law should be considered in the face of
the Convention's future entry into force, and what support the United
States might give to those states likely to face pressure from
authoritarian governments to share private data.
Second, the United States has strong allies promoting
digital rights within the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights (OHCHR). A U.S. voluntary contribution to support OHCHR's
digital rights efforts would reinforce a chronically under-resourced
institution that does work that supports a human rights approach to
issues of internet governance. I would urge the Congress to provide
substantial funding for this purpose.
Third, authoritarian governments, as with all governments,
including the United States, regularly appear before the Human Rights
Council in the context of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The UPR
is a high-profile moment for many governments to showcase what they
perceive as their human rights successes--and for others, including
civil society organizations, to point out a country's failings. The
United States should make it a standard procedure that its delegates to
the UPR highlight the specific policies, laws and practices that
authoritarian governments deploy to interfere with human rights online.
Congress could play an important role, through hearings and legislative
language, in ensuring that U.S. participation in the UPR focuses
attention on the authoritarian agenda within the U.N.
