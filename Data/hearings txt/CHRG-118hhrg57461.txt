PROVEN RESULTS: HIGHLIGHTING THE BENEFITS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ---------- Wednesday, March 6, 2024 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington, DC. The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:15, a.m., 2175 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Aaron Bean (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Bean, Owens, McClain, Miller, Kiley, Williams, Foxx, Bonamici, Hayes, Bowman, Wilson, DeSaulnier, Norcross, and Scott. Also present: Letlow Staff present: Nick Barley, Deputy Communications Director; Mindy Barry, General Counsel; Isabel Foster, Press Assistant; Daniel Fuenzalida, Staff Assistant; Amy Raaf Jones, Director of Education and Human Services Policy; Georgie Littlefair, Clerk; RJ Martin, Professional Staff Member; Hannah Matesic, Deputy Staff Director; Audra McGeorge, Communications Director; Eli Mitchell, Legislative Assistant; Rebecca Powell, Staff Assistant; Brad Thomas, Deputy Director of Education and Human Services Policy; Maura Williams, Director of Operations; Nekea Brown, Minority Director of Operations; Rashage Green, Minority Director of Education Policy & Counsel; Christian Haines, Minority General Counsel; Stephanie Lalle, Minority Communications Director; Raiyana Malone, Minority Press Secretary; Veronique Pluviose, Minority Staff Director; Olivia Sawyer, Minority Intern; Clinton Spencer, IV, Minority Staff Assistant; Maile Sit, Minority Intern. Chairman Bean. Ladies and gentlemen, a very good morning to each of you. Welcome to your nation's capital, the House of Representatives, and the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education will come to order. A quorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to call a recess at any time. It is a special time of year in our Nation's capital, and no, not because cherry blossom season is almost upon us, for children across the country trapped in failing school districts, this is the season of opportunity. Each year, in the spring, thousands of parents, families, and eager young students gather around their computers to wait and pray for a name to appear. The room is still. Parents sit quietly with bated breath. They know the next few minutes could have a profound impact on the course of their children's lives. A name appears and happiness erupts. A lucky winner has been picked, but with the good fortune comes the opportunity for a student to escape an abysmal traditional public school and enroll in a school that meets his or her individual needs. This is the story of our Nation's charter school lotteries. The joy in a parent's heart is when their child is accepted is one of the foremost reasons that I support charter schools. I also recognize there is a flipside to the story, charter schools have limited seats in the lottery system, while fair, does not pan out for every family. For the smiles, there are tears. This is a sad reality, but it is not an argument against the schools. On the contrary, it is an argument for expanding charter school access so that every child can receive a high-quality education no matter his or her zip code. Expand they have, charter schools are relatively new in terms of the American education system, with the first charter issued in Minnesota in 1992. They have since ridden the school choice way to over 8,000 communities serving nearly 4 million students across 45 states. Furthermore, charter school growth is accelerating. Enrollment doubled in the most recent decade, and 74 percent of parents would consider sending their child to a charter school if just given the chance. Charter schools' success is linked to thousands of success stories across the Nation. As studies and testimoneys emerge from the first class of charter schools, they have proven what we all have expected. Removing the educational bureaucracy is a boon to student achievement. Now, charter graduates have the chance to send their own children to charter schools, and I see it as the Committee's role, give them the best possible chance to do it. Today, we will embark on a journey to learn more about where charter schools are, how they are benefiting students, and to get more information. With that, I yield to the Ranking Member for an opening statement. Ranking Member?  Statement of Hon. Aaron Bean, Chairman, Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education This is a special time of year. No, not because cherry blossom season is almost upon us.

Thank you very much, Chairman Bean. Thank you to our witnesses for being here today. As recognized by the founding fathers, numerous Supreme Court Justices and many State Constitutions, the provisions of a free, high quality, public education to all children, serves a compelling community interest. Mr. Chairman, I see your scenario not as a case for more charter schools, but as a case for making all public schools the best they can be. When we invest in education, we are investing in our future. Members of this Committee should understand that children, regardless of where they live, or how involved their parents are, they deserve access to high quality, public education that allows them to achieve their full potential. Now most agree that parents should have a say in their child's learning environment, and under some circumstances this may include well-regulated public charter schools. Well-funded, transparent, and accountable public charter schools in some instances may be a better fit for some students. For example, KairosPDX is a charter school in Portland. They work to dismantle structural racism, close opportunity and achievement gaps for students of color, through hands on, culturally competent teaching. Unfortunately charter schools are not subject to the same level of oversight and accountability as traditional public schools, and as a result we often do not know whether charter schools will provide the students with benefits, and any meaningful benefits. Concerningly in many instances, charter school schemes are another way for my colleagues across the aisle to divert taxpayer dollars and community resources from already struggling public schools. Now, we must not ignore the growing number of charter schools that are operated by for-profit corporations, located in states that have lax, or even nonexistent oversight. According to the Network for Public Education, more than 1,100 charter schools are now run by for-profit entities, and that is more than 14 percent of charter schools. Prior to the Education Department's updates to the Charter School Program, a 2016 audit found that charter school programs run by for-profit entities in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, all lacked internal guardrails that posed risks to student learning, and enabled waste, fraud, and abuse of Federal funds. I also have serious concerns about the effects of charter school programs on students' civil rights. Although charter schools by law are required to honor students' and families' civil rights protections, such as individual education plans for students with disabilities. Gray areas surrounding a school's legal status may leave them ill-equipped to provide every study with the legally required fair and equitable education. Studies show that charter schools are more segregated than traditional public schools. In addition, students may be rejected, unnecessarily disciplined, or expelled for reasons that would not be allowed in a traditional public school, often with few or no avenues for recourse. Then there is the issue of the number of charter schools that close, often abruptly. In fact, about 25 percent of charter schools close within 5 years, leaving students and families without support, and sometimes without information. Often for-profit management, entities are based outside the bounds of Federal oversight, not really the choice parents are looking for. Yes, parents should be able to decide the best way to educate their children, however this should not come at the expense of a strong quality public education system that protects and supports every child. That is why I ask that Committee members join me in supporting more Magnet schools, schools that provide choice within the public school system, and that come with accountability and nondiscrimination. My home district in Beaverton, Oregon for example, offers some very popular options, an Arts Magnet, a Science and Engineering Magnet, an International Magnet. Instead of proposing an 80 percent cut to the Title I program, my colleagues should invest in public education and evidence-based choice programs, so that every family can send their child to a high quality, accountable, and safe public school. Thank you to our witnesses for being here, and I yield bank the balance of my time.  Statement of Hon.

Pursuant to Committee Rule 8-C, or Sub-C, all Committee members who wish to insert written statements into the record may do so by submitting them to the Committee Clerk electronically. You have to use Microsoft Word format to do it by 5 p.m. after 14 days from today's hearing, which is March 20, 2024. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 14 days after the date of this hearing to allow such statements, and other extraneous material referenced during the hearing to be submitted for the official hearing record. I note for the record the Subcommittee that some of our colleagues who are not permanent members of this Committee may be waving on for the purpose of today's hearing. Now, I know you are wondering how does our Committee staff find foremost experts in the field, but once again, they have done so. They have traveled across the Nation, and we have got some premier experts on charter schools. Once again, it is my pleasure to introduce today's all-star panel. Our first witness is Dr. Macke Raymond, who is the Founder and Director of the Center for Research for Education Outcomes at Stanford University, located in Stanford, California. Dr. Raymond has served as Director of the Center since its inception and has steered the group to national prominence as a rigorous and independent source for policy and program analysis. She leads the Center in investigating the effectiveness of public charter schools and has spearheaded several landmark studies on charters. Our next witness will be introduced by our Ranking Member, Ms. Bonamici. Ranking Member? Ms. Bonamici. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Julian Vasquez Heilig is a Founding Board Member of the Network for Public Education and an academic whose research focuses on K12 education practices that impact equity and innovation. He previously served on the Executive Committee, and as Education Chair for both Kentucky and California NAACP. Dr. Vasquez Heilig received his Ph.D. in Educational Administration and Policy Analysis, and a Master's Degree in Sociology from Stanford University--kind of west coast heavy here so far. He has also earned a Master's Degree in Higher Education and a Bachelor's Degree in History and Psychology from the University of Michigan. Go Wolverines. Welcome Dr. Vasquez Heilig. Chairman Bean. All right. Let us go to the east coast where our third witness is standing by waiting to be introduced. Mr. Robert Pondiscio who is a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute located in Greenville, New York. Mr. Pondiscio is a Senior Fellow at the AEI where he focuses on K through 12 education curriculum, teaching school choice and charter schooling. Before joining AEI, Mr. Pondiscio was a Policy Analysist for Education Reform at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, and education policy think tank. He worked previously for the Corps, this is good, previously for the Core Knowledge Foundation as an advisor and civics teacher at Democracy Prep Public Schools, and then became interested in education policy issues where he started teaching fifth grade at a struggling South Bronx Public School in 2002. We will hear from him in just a moment, but our final witness is Mr. Kenneth Campbell, who is the CEO of New Schools for Baton Rouge, which is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Previously, Mr. Campbell served as Executive Director for IDEA Public Schools of Southern Louisiana. President of the Black Alliance Educational Option and as Founding Director of Charter Schools for the Louisiana Department of Education where in the years following Hurricane Katrina, he was responsible for rebuilding New Orleans education infrastructure to high-quality charter schools. Mr. Campbell served 8 years of active military duty, and 13 and 1/2 years of Reserves before retiring as a Captain in 2005. Thank you for your service, Mr. Campbell. We thank all our witnesses. We are eager to hear you. There is this one little rule that you need to know about, and it's the 5-minute rule. Everybody has 5 minutes, we do too, and so pursuant to Committee Rules, I ask each of you to limit your oral presentation. If you go over or get near, you will hear this sound, that means to wrap it up. We appreciate you, but you can submit your written testimony as long as you want, I have received--I think we have all received the written testimony. We also remind everybody that we have a duty to be responsible in the information that you provide to the Subcommittee. With that, let us get to it. Dr. Raymond, you are first of all, welcome. We are glad to have you here, and you are recognized. The floor is yours. Dr. Raymond, your mic. Mine is clicking off too, but. STATEMENT OF DR. MACKE RAYMOND, FOUNDER AND DIREC- TOR, CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON EDUCATION OUTCOMES, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA Ms. Raymond. All right, starting over at zero. Chairman Bean, Ranking Member Bonamici, and other members of the Committee, good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I am joined by Dr. Won Fy Lee, a lead analyst with the study that I will discuss today. For over two decades, CREDO has studied national charter schools, and have produced three national studies of the academic progress in charter schools, compared to carefully selected comparison students in nearby district schools, in partnership with 29 states and the District of Columbia. By the time I saw the results of our third analysis in early 2023, we had waited 10 years to solve a mystery. To tell you more, I need to frame the results in the context of the two prior studies. In 2009, our studies showed charter students learning less than their District peers in both reading and math, by a statistically significant amount. Using a comparison standard of 180 days of learning in a typical District year of 180 days of schooling, charter students only had a 174 days of learning in math, and 163 days of learning in--I am sorry, 174 in reading, and 163 in math. In 2013, the second study showed improvements across the sector, posting a positive advantage of six extra days in learning and reading, and breaking even with District students in math. As everyone knows, two points make a line, but they do not make a trend. The latest results from 2023 were keenly anticipated. Our findings showed charter school students had 16 more days of learning in reading, and 6 additional days of learning in math than similar peers in local District schools, and both comparisons were statistically significant. I will return to this trend later. Good results for charter school students were even more pronounced for urban students, for black and Hispanic students, for low-income students, and students served by charter school networks. For each of these groups attending charter schools led to more learning in a year's time compared to peers in adjacent District schools. Not all the results in the national charter school study were positive. The learning for rural charter school students is not strong, and special education students in charter schools also lagged the learning of their peers in District schools. While comparative progress of black and Hispanic charter school students is positive compared to their District counterparts, both sets of students learned substantially less than their white peers on average. Targeted improvement would benefit all of the groups I have just mentioned. The study revealed insights about charter school networks, also called Charter Management Organizations or CMOs. The average student in a charter school network gained more than a month of extra learning compared to their District school counterparts in both reading and math. More importantly, charter school networks do not sacrifice learning as they replicate in scale. The final set of results I want to mention are the so-called gap busting schools. We look for charter schools that had above average achievement in their respective states, and of these, we subset schools that had learning for minority or poverty students that was at least as strong as the learning of their white or non- poverty charter school classmates. We found hundreds of schools who met the criteria. In fact, over 1,000 schools where Hispanic students exceeded the progress of their white classmates. Moreover, we found dozens of charter networks able to produce these impressive results across their entire networks. The implications from the national charter school study are important and timely. Millions of charter school students have been well served, adding to their education progress, and their life outcomes. The charter school community also delivered many examples of successful schools and showed that scaling successful models is now common. These examples hold promise for adding more charter schools, and for fulfilling their charge to be laboratories of new, and now proven ideas. The long-term trend of these three studies shows especially what legislators like of this Committee, are able to do, to devise policy levers to create good outcomes. The Charter School Law pairs flexibility and accountability, and these forces produce incentives for continuous improvement that are readily apparently in the data we study. We see thousands of schools getting a little bit better each year, which explains the upward trend line. The insight we think is welcome, considering the general State of schools coming out of the pandemic. I will conclude with the idea that there are untapped opportunities for exporting successful models to other schools, and for other laws to use similar incentives to provide further improvements in our public school system. Thank you very much.   Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Dr. Raymond. Well done. Next, let us go to Dr. Heilig. Dr. Heiling, thank you for coming today and welcome, and the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF DR. JULIAN VASQUEZ HEILIG, FOUNDING BOARD MEMBER, NETWORK FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION, AU- GUSTA, MICHIGAN Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Thank you, Chair and members of the Committee. I am honored to contribute to this critical discussion on school choice, sharing insights from my multi- faceted engagement with the charter school sector. As a former charter school educator, donor, parent, board member and now researcher. These experiences combine with my academic inquiry have provided me with a deep understanding of the nuances and complexities surrounding charter schools. In the late 1990's, my research of charter schools began in Michigan, as a State at the forefront of the charter school movement. This journey continued through an instructional role as the Aspire charter school in East Palo Alto, California, and as a Board member of a charter school in Austin, Texas. Witnessing my daughter's education within a charter school further personalized my insights into the sector's impact on students and families. As a researcher and tenured scholar, I have published 28 peer reviewed articles, reports and law reviews and other publications on school choice. The foundational premise of charter schools was to foster innovation and provide an alternative that would spur improvements within the traditional public school system. The body of peer reviewed academic research, including my own studies, increasingly questions the efficacy of charter schools in delivering on these promises. Data from the NCES indicates no significant academic advantage for charter school students over their public school counterparts. Furthermore, CREDO's series of ongoing reports have sometimes noted positive achievement results, and other times they have found negative results. Often in the hundredths of a standard deviation. CREDO has also faced criticism for the methodology from the National Education Policy Center and the Network for Public Education, casting doubt on the significance and replicability of their days of learning framing of their findings. Beyond the question of academic outcomes, charter schools have been shown to exacerbate pre-existing challenges within the public education system. As noted by the 2016 resolution from the NAACP that came forward when I served as NAACP Education Chair in California, charter schools on average exhibit higher rates of teacher turnover, decreased teacher quality, serve less special needs students and intensified racial segregation, and have exhibited inequitable disciplinary practices. The work of such scholars as Kevin Welner, among others, have illuminated how charter schools' selective recruitment and retention practices contribute to a deepening of educational disparities. My own research corroborates these findings, highlighting the troubling extent of racial segregation in charter schools, and challenging the inclusivity and equity of the choice model. Here is the flip side. The issue of accountability, or lack thereof in the charter sector is particularly alarming. The absence of rigorous oversight in many states has paved the way for financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and a disturbingly high rate of school closures. A recent study by NPE found that over 25 percent of charter schools closed within 5 years. By year ten, the closure rate was 40 percent. Millions of public funds from the Department of Education have been spent on charter schools, they either never opened after receiving those grants or closed within a year. These dynamics not only disrupt a students' educational paths but have resulted in documented misallocation of billions of dollars in public funds. The governance structure of many charter schools, especially those managed by for-profit entities, often fail to align with the broader community interests where they are located, undermining the principal of public accountability and education. Moreover, the unchecked expansion of the charter sector poses significant risks to the public education system because it dilutes resources and exacerbates the challenges of delivering a high-quality education in all sectors. The problem is accentuated by the expected nationwide decline of K-12 student populations in public schools, underscoring the urgency of focusing our efforts on improving existing infrastructure, rather than expanding the charter sector indiscriminately. Given these concerns, my stance on charter schools has evolved toward a more cautious and critical perspective. While most have heard the original idea that charter schools would serve as laboratories for educational innovation, and provide families with diverse options, it is imperative that we address the profound existing issues of accountability and financial management that currently beset the school choice movement. In consideration of the predominant perspective of educational research data, it is imperative that we unite in advocating for strategic reassessment of the charter school model, with a focus on upholding educational excellence, reinforcing our value of education as a public good, and enhancing community's involvement in charter schools. Only through a concerted effort to confront and resolve these challenges can we ensure that charter schools will instead contribute positively, rather than negatively, to our collective goal of an effective education system for all students. It is my sincere hope that this testimony serves as a catalyst for thoughtful and comprehensive reevaluation of the charter school landscape. I do not mean to be the skunk at the garden party, but may it ignite initiatives and policies aligned with our highest educational aspirations, guaranteeing every child access to a high quality education that is emblematic of our Nation's dedication to excellence in education for all children and families. Thank you for considering these perspectives on this critical issue.   Chairman Bean. Dr. Heilig, well done. Thank you very much. I was following along because you have submitted your written testimony earlier. Mr. Pondiscio, you are recognized. Welcome to the Committee, and you got 5 minutes, and your mic needs to. STATEMENT OF MR. ROBERT PONDISCIO, SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, GREENVILLE, NEW YORK Mr. Pondiscio. Thank you, Chairman Bean, Ranking Member Bonamici and members of the Committee. Thank you for having me. My name is Robert Pondiscio, I am a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former teacher. In 2002, I became a fifth-grade teacher at the lowest performing public school in the south Bronx, New York City's lowest performing school district. A mere 16 percent of PS277 students could read at grade level. The first charter schools were just opening up in the neighborhood. Back then there were virtually no alternatives to the schools that had failed children for decades. In my role at AEI, I study and write about education, including charter schools, but my focus has seldom strayed from the question that motivated me to become a teacher in the first place. How can we ensure that disadvantaged children in places like the south Bronx have every opportunity to succeed in school and in life? A few years ago, that very question took me back to the south Bronx where I spent a year at Success Academy Charter School, literally across the street from where I had been a student teacher, and a few blocks from my old school. This charter school was delivering astonishing results for children. In the years since I had left my classroom, Success Academy had grown from a single school in nearby Harlem, to 45 schools across New York City, educating 17,000 children. The lowest performing of those schools had 85 percent of its students pass the New York State English Language Arts test. That was the worst one. The Success Academy school with the lowest pass rate in math had 92 percent of its students at or above proficiency, the others were even better. Said differently, if Success Academy were a school district it would be the highest scoring district in New York State. It gets better results than the city's gifted and talented programs, and better results than wealthy suburban districts with multimillion dollar homes. More than 90 percent of Success Academy students are children of color, mostly low-income, black and Hispanic. By comparison, only 1 in 3 black and Hispanic children in New York City test at or above grade level in math or reading. I spent a year embedded at Success Academy Bronx 1, not as a teacher, but this time as a reporter and researcher, writing a book about the lessons that Success might teach us that could be applied to K-12 education at large. After all, a founding ideal of the charter school movement was to serve as an engine of innovation and experimentation. I welcome the opportunity to discuss in detail what I observed, but in a sentence, what I saw is what is possible when you allow parents to select a high-functioning school, and when every adult in a child's life teachers and parents alike, is pulling in the same direction, just as it has been demonstrated time and again in America's past. For years I have applied what I call the Tiffany test to my work in education. It is named after a real-life student that I had when I taught fifth grade. You have heard of the expression ``a problem child''? Well, Tiffany was a not your problem child. She came to school every day in my fifth-grade classroom in a spotless school uniform. Never missed a day of school, never missed a homework assignment. She was hard-working and conscientious. Tiffany was solidly at grade level in a school where that was rare. I called her a not your problem child because 1 day I pointed out to my Assistant Principal that I was not doing very much to challenge Tiffany, this incredibly diligent, dutiful, perfectly behaved, entrusting kid who was deeply devoted to her school and her education. The Assistant Principal said something I'll never forget. She said, ``She's not your problem.'' What she meant was, why are you worried about Tiffany? You have got kids who are far below grade level in reading and math, you have got behavior problems, you have got special needs kids. Who cares about Tiffany? She will be fine. Reading and doing math at grade level is the starting line for my child, and for yours, but it is the finish line for Tiffany, and kids like her in America. No one would tell the parent or teacher of a well-off student we have got bigger problems than your kid. She is doing well enough. Even in the most dysfunctional schools and classrooms in America, you will find some number of diligent and hard-working kids whose parents believe in the promise of education, but whose teachers have bigger problems than the not your problem child. The Tiffany test is simply this. There are parents and kids who demonstrate faith in education and upward mobility and the American dream. Are we doing all in our power to ensure that faith is rewarded? Ten years later, what did I see at Success Academy? Tiffany, in nearly every seat. Tiffany, or someone like her. It is commonly said in teaching that we should meet the children where they are. It is equally important, I believe, to have an education system that meets families where they are. There is no rational or moral reason for government policy at any level to prevent the children of motivated, engaged, and invested Americans of any race, ethnic group, or income level, from reaping the full rewards of their talents and ambitions. There is no reason to interfere with parents' earnest efforts to do what is best for their children. I title my book How the Other Half Learns, and I chose that title frankly, because I do not think I am wrong, or over-simplifying to suggest that if you are wealthy, you have every conceivable option available to you. If you are poor, black or brown, you get a lecture. You get hand wringing over fairness. You are told to be patient. You are told your most promising student is not your problem. Public charter schools pass the Tiffany test. Thank you very much.   Chairman Bean. Mr. Pondiscio, thank you very much, and right on time. Our final witness, who has given service to our country, thank you again, Mr. Kenneth Campbell from Louisiana. Welcome to the Committee, and you are recognized. STATEMENT OF MR. KENNETH CAMPBELL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NEW SCHOOLS FOR BATON ROUGE, BATON, ROUGE, LOUISIANA Mr. Campbell. Thank you. Good morning. Chairman Bean, Ranking Member Bonamici, and members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you. My name is Kenneth Campbell, and I am the CEO of New Schools for Baton Rouge, a nonprofit founded in 2012 by civic and community leaders to transform public education in our city. Our core belief is that every child deserves a great school, and our mission is to ensure that every child has access to an excellent education. I have spent the past 30 years advocating for, and working with educators, parents and community leaders across the country to develop and implement thoughtful and impactful charter school policies and initiatives. In 2007, I was tapped by the Louisiana Department of Education to serve as the Founding Director of the State Charter School Office, and to help lead efforts to rebuild New Orleans education system following Hurricane Katrina. We did it by empowering local educators to restart their schools as charter schools, so that they would have the autonomy to make the best decisions for students. Before Katrina, New Orleans was the second lowest performing school district in Louisiana, with the graduation rate of less than 60 percent. Recent studies now say that New Orleans, an all charter district, has one of the highest academic growth rates of any urban school district in the country. As CEO for New Schools for Baton Rouge, my energy and efforts are focused on utilizing charter schools to drive the same type of improvement and innovation in Baton Rouge. Our work with charters is centered around two questions. First, are charter schools serving students and families well? Second, are they accelerating learning for our most vulnerable children? We believe the answer to both of those is a resounding yes. As with most school districts nationwide, Baton Rouge schools have struggled to recover from COVID. However, in the state's most recent performance evaluation almost 70 percent of our charter schools surpass their 2019 school performance scores, compared to less than 40 percent of the District's traditional schools. Almost 80 percent of charter schools in our city improve their performance year over year. Not surprisingly, this academic success and innovation are driving greater demand. We are celebrating 30 years of chartering in Louisiana this year. We have 87,000 kids in charter schools in Louisiana, and in Baton Rouge, almost 30 percent of students who attend a public school, attend a charter school. That tells us that moms, dads, grandparents, continue to seek out new and better schools for their kids, and we should be in the business of trying to help them do that. Charter schools serve as catalysts for educational innovation. Bell Chase Academy, just south of New Orleans was the Nation's first charter school on a military base was founded to meet the unique needs of military children. We have two charter schools in our city that partner with large healthcare centers and hospitals to collaborate on academic resources and opportunities in STEM education. GEO Next Generation High School is committed to ensuring that every student graduates from high school, having also earned an associate's degree. Unfortunately, as has been mentioned here a couple times a day, not every charter school is successful. In fact, accountability is a cornerstone of the charter school model. Unlike traditional public schools, when charter schools are not performing up to standards, they can be closed. While the decision to close any school is regrettable, we must be committed to evaluating performance, and when necessary, making the difficult decision to redirect resources to schools that better serve students, and our communities' needs. Earlier I spoke about the growth of charter schools in Louisiana and across the country. While local leaders deserve all of the credit for the hard work of planning and launching schools, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the key role that the charter school program has played in the growth and expansion of charter schools over the past 25 years. We are deeply appreciative that Congress continues to allocate resources to the charter school program, and we hope that charter schools continue to enjoy strong, bipartisan support. I also want to acknowledge Congresswoman Letlow, and Senator Cassidy, both from the great State of Louisiana, for partnering with colleagues, and their respective chambers, to introduce legislation to help charter schools solve two of the biggest hurdles, access to facilities and resources to help educators and community leaders strengthen their charter applications. Charter schools provide viable options for families and students who want more from their public schools. They empower families with the ability to choose the school that best fits their child's needs. They engage communities with a sense of ownership and pride. There is no question that our public education system is struggling, and I believe charter schools can be important collaborators with school districts to develop programs and services that improve all public schools for all students. Again, thank you for this opportunity to speak, and thank you for recognizing the vital role that charter schools play in the education of our students.   Chairman Bean. Mr. Campbell, thank you so much. Leave it to the military man to finish early and give us time back. Thank you so much. Under Committee Rule 9, we will now question witnesses under the 5-minute rule. I will begin the questioning. Put the clock on Bean as we embark. You all did a great job by the way. Thank you all for coming forward. Mr. Pondiscio, you have got a unique perspective because you were a teacher in a public school, and now you have been involved in a charter school. Is it possible for you to tell us what is the difference? What is the secret? What is the secret sauce in charter schools and the difference? Mr. Pondiscio. I was a teacher at a public school and at a charter school. I taught high school civics for a time at Democracy Prep public charter schools in Harlem, New York. The difference is, and let me be clear, I do not think there is any particular magic that happens when you put the name Charter on a school building. What it is, is a permission structure, right? Chartering allows you to innovate, allows you to do something new and different that you could not do in the public school system. Some charters take full advance of that, some do not. Let us be honest. The best charters embrace this, and innovate around curriculum and instruction, which is my particular interest. Some of the very best charters think thoughtfully about the job of the teacher, and making--how do you make that job, as I like to say, doable by mere mortals? As a former public school teacher, I can tell you that it is--I like to say it is the easiest job in the world to do badly, the hardest job in the world to do well. One of the things that I have studied over the years, particularly in charters, particularly like the one that I reference in my testimony is innovative ideas around making the job doable by the teachers we have, not the teachers we wish we had. Chairman Bean. Were you coached differently? Is the administration at one or the other? Mr. Pondiscio. Oh, no question. Well, back to my experience as a charter school teacher, I got more observations in coaching on a single day than frankly, I got in 5 years at PS277 where I had two observations in 5 years. I do not mean two a year, two observations period, in 5 years. In my first day teaching high school civics at Democracy Prep, my principal was in my classroom giving me feedback. If I may---- Chairman Bean. I believe we will, I have got to move on, but hopefully we will explore that because I know you have had that insight right there. Dr. Raymond, we have heard we all want what is best for kids. We all want a system that thrives. We want an accountable system. We want to be measuring everybody's report card. All of our report cards should be the same because we can measure. There has been some criticism on charters today that we do not measure them appropriately and what not. How do you respond to that criticism? Is that fair? Ms. Raymond. I think that all schools should face the same outcomes performance criteria, and I think if we do that you will find, as Mr. Pondiscio said, some charter schools do not do very well, but the vast majority of them do. Those sets of criteria should apply regardless, and they ought to be tied to our learning standards that we think kids need to know in order to be successful in life. Chairman Bean. Is the CREDO measuring stick, and that is the measuring stick of how we based on educational outcomes. Is that fair? Does that need to be reformed? Is it accurate? Ms. Raymond. Well, if we thought it was unfair we would change it. No. The idea that we have is that we have precisely matched on all things that we can measure, a student in a charter school, with students who look exactly like them, including their starting score, so, their educational endowments, in local District schools. It is a peer reviewed methodology. We have had four published critiques, evaluations, of our methodology, and not only do we hold up well as a regular matching methodology, but our results actually approximate what you would get with so- called experimental designs. I am confident it is useful. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much. Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell. Yes, sir? Chairman Bean. You have got a distinguished career as a military veteran, but also as a business leader. You could do a lot of things, probably go elsewhere and make a lot of money, but you have made a decision to engage in bolstering charter schools and educational choice. Why are you doing that? Mr. Campbell. Very simple. I mean just the hundreds and hundreds of families, parents that I have talked to. I have been in living rooms where I have heard them talk about the challenges of getting a great education. I have heard them share their hopes, their wishes, their dreams, their aspirations for their kids that they felt like were being unmet. Anything that I can do to help them do that, I think that is the most important work, and work that I will always look back upon fondly. If I could help parents be able to do that, that is what I am going to do. Chairman Bean. Was my opening statement accurate when I said there is a lottery, there are lines to get in, families literally live on that computer trying to get in. They know that sometimes it is the only way they can get out. They can elevate their family. Is that accurate? Mr. Campbell. It is in some cases. That is absolutely accurate in some cases. Others, you know, the reality is that you know, if we do this well, our schools will be better, and also traditional public schools will be better. My hope again, is that we have great charter schools. They push our district in ways that they might not always want to be pushed, but that they get better also. That we have a variety of offerings that parents, especially those parents who have a limited means can be able to access those schools. Chairman Bean. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Campbell. I now yield the floor to Ranking Member Bonamici for 5 minutes, you are recognized. Ms. Bonamici. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses. I would like to start by reiterating that research on charter schools is mixed at best when it comes to determining their effectiveness at providing high quality academic instruction for students. Additionally, research has shown that charter schools are less likely than traditional public schools to enroll and support students with disabilities, more likely to be segregated by race, socioeconomic status, class, and student language proficiency. I think, Dr. Raymond, you made a great case for a longer school year. Mr. Pondiscio, you certainly made a case for more professional development, a differentiation, a great case for smaller class sizes, and more engaged administration, but I see our role as policymakers to care about all students, not just with those students with the parents who say okay, well we want to find a right fit for our students because you still have to look at everybody and give everybody a great education. When I was in the Oregon legislature, I was on a charter review Commission, where we looked at it was 10 years after our charter law passed, and we were grappling with issues back then, maybe 12--15 years ago. A lot of questions still have not been answered today. How are charter schools determining which students enroll? Who serves on boards? To whom are they accountable? What happens when charter schools close? Where do their students go? We had a lot of questions about the proliferation of online charter schools, which tend to have an abysmal record. Dr. Vasquez Heilig, you mentioned the lack of accountability and rigorous oversight of charter schools in many states, and also the high percentage of schools that closed. What do students and families do when their charter school closes its doors? What recourse is there? What options do they have? If a charter school closes in the middle of an academic year, how does that affect the local public schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. I have to work in an example about the University of Michigan. I can want to go to the University of Michigan, but the University of Michigan also wants to have me too. I think that is one of the issues that we have with charter schools is we talk about lotteries and these types of things, but the charter schools get to decide who is eligible for that lottery in a lot of cases, right. If those students leave, then they are able to backfill those students, and they can decide how they want to backfill students when students leave, et cetera. When charter schools close, we know that public schools are going to welcome them back. Because public schools are a part of education as a public good, and so they are going to bring any student that comes to their door, they are going to allow them in. We have to understand the school choice does not mean that parents can willy nilly choose a student they want in the school that they want to go to, they also have to be chosen by that school. It is the same premise for vouchers too. Whether it is charters or vouchers, school choice means that the schools have a role in that choice. If a charter school is closed, and we know that quite a few charter schools do close. I gave those numbers in my opening statement, that disrupts their education. That disrupts their families, and so those students are welcomed back with open arms to their public schools. They do also have a lot of other opportunities for choice. Many districts have in-district charters. Those are community engaged charters. There are Magnet schools, there are community schools, there is a lot of community driven choice. Ms. Bonamici. Thank you. I want to get another question in. Like many other states, Oregon's witnessed of proliferation of online charter schools as I mentioned. In 2015, a CREDO report about online charter schools found such poor performance that Education Week actually quoted Dr. Raymond as saying it was literally as though the student did not go to school for the entire year. Despite this enrollment, we know that they have long been some of the worst performing schools in the charter sector. There was a rise, of course, during the COVID 19 pandemic. In a 2022, a GAO report found that virtual charter schools had significantly lower proficiency rates on State tests compared with other school types. What are the long-term outcomes for students who attend these schools, and what if anything, can we do to hold online charter schools accountable for poor performance? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Right. I think that the CREDO has been very consistent in finding that the online charters perform especially poorly, especially in math, that they have been performing very poorly. When I was in California as Education Chair, this was something that California was tackling. This is one of the biggest challenges in the charter sector. I think it is in the best interest of the charter sector to support accountability, because then their numbers would look better than hundredths of standard deviation of improvement. I think it is in their best interest for the good apples to call out the bad apples. Ms. Bonamici. I appreciate that---- Ms. Raymond. Can I clarify for the record? Ms. Bonamici. Go ahead, Dr. Raymond. Ms. Raymond. The numbers that you have quoted are accurate, but of just a few weeks ago our team in part led by Dr. Lee, behind me, published a policy brief about online charter schools. I would be happy to enter that into the record during the follow-on period. What we found is that in most online charter schools, while the average performance is bad, and that is certainly the case, there are in every school a substantial proportion of students who do well. The problem that I see now in this additional insight is that online schools are not for every student. They do not have the necessarily clearing and matching. Ms. Bonamici. I have to reclaim my time. They are also significant equity issues for students who do not have a parent or someone at home with them. Mr. Chairman, as I yield back, I want to enter into the record a letter by the National Network for Public Education about charter schools and enter into the record as well, a report by the National Council on Disability entitled ``Choice and Vouchers--Implications for Students with Disabilities.'' Chairman Bean. Without objection, so ordered. Thank you very much Ranking Member.   Chairman Bean. We will now yield to the State of Michigan, where Representative Lisa McClain is recognized for her 5 minutes. Representative McClain, you are recognized. Mrs. McClain. Thank you. Before I get started, Ms. Raymond, did you want to finish your thought? Ms. Raymond. I was done. Thank you. Mrs. McClain. Okay. Thank you. Then I will start just with a general question to Mr. Heilig because we have talked a lot about charter schools and what happens if they close, and we are all concerned about that, right? Goodness gracious, what happens if the close in the middle of a school year, right? We want to make sure that we are protecting the children. What happens when a public school fails? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, that is a good question. How do you define failing, Congresswoman? Mrs. McClain. Same way we define failure for charter schools. What happens--it is real simple. One, do you have a determination whether a public school is failing? Yes or no? Yes, you do? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, I was asked to do that at work for Rod Page when I worked in Houston. Did you want me to say more on that, or just leave it? Mrs. McClain. I am just asking. Do we have a measurement for when a public school fails? Yes we do, no we do not. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Bureaucrats do create arbitrary measures for a failing school. Yes. Mrs. McClain. Yes, we have that measure for when public schools fail? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. Bureaucrats do create that now. Yes. Ms. McClain. Okay. I appreciate that. What happens to a public school when it fails? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, we should make investments in---- Ms. McClain. I am not asking what should, I am asking when a public school fails what happens? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, I could tell you what happens in Texas. In Houston, they have gone and taken away the schools from the community. That is what is happening in Houston. I think that we need to make investments in the things that we know matter. Ms. McClain. I understand. When a public school fails, this is what I am trying to wrap my head around. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Sure. Ms. McClain. We have two separate sets of rules for the same children, which is kind of interesting to me. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Okay. Ms. McClain. If a charter school fails, we have all these rules and regulations and it closes, right? If a public school fails with less rules, less regulations, we just want more money to fix the problem. If money is the answer for public schools, why would we not give money to the answer for charter schools? With that, I am going to switch my questioning now to Mr. Pondiscio. The National School of Choice Awareness Foundation January's survey found that 72 percent of parents considered not--but considered different schools for their children. A 35 percent increase since 2022, right? What do you see is driving such a significant increase in school of choice? 35 percent. Mr. Pondiscio. Yes. I think the short answer may be COVID. For years I have pointed out that what happens inside of the American school classroom is a bit of a black box. We do not really know. COVID ripped the lid off of that black box, as it were, so suddenly your child's school was coming onto your laptop, onto your kitchen table every day all across America. In many, and hopefully most instances, the parents were edified by what they saw. In some number of cases, unfortunately, parents were aghast at what they saw. When parents are unhappy with their school, they tend to want something else. If they are in a public school that is not doing well, then they are going to seek choice. Congresswoman, if I also may just answer your previous question about what happens when a public school fails, well in 2002, I went to work at the lowest performing public school in New York City's lowest performing district. It is now 2024, that school is now the lowest performing school in New York City's lowest performing district. Mrs. McClain. Well, we just have measurements, I thought we just talked about we had measurements for those public schools when they close. Why did that one not close? Mr. Pondiscio. That is a very good question, Congresswoman. Mrs. McClain. Hmm. Did we have--that is interesting, but we care about the children, right? Okay. Just checking. In my district over--we have 3,300 charter school students, right? I am wondering if you could help--there is a need, there is a want, maybe not a need, but a want for more charter schools, right? There is a waiting list to get in, right, which I would think would be a good thing. Can you describe the roadblocks that exist at the local and State level in developing more options? Mr. Pondiscio. Sure. Mrs. McClain. Why can we not have more of these schools that parents are demanding for their children? Mr. Pondiscio. I understand that we are talking about this at the Federal level, but in New York, where I have spent my entire education career, there has been a charter school cap in place for nearly a decade. Despite the fact that the City in particular, New York City, is home to some of the highest performing, highest demand public charter schools in the country, there has been no more room at the inn, so to speak. State lawmakers have blocked the creation of new charters. Mrs. McClain. Why do you think we are so afraid and so scared of charter schools? Mr. Pondiscio. That is a very good question. I do not have an answer for you. Mrs. McClain. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much. Let us go to the great State of Connecticut, where Representative Hayes is recognized. You are recognized. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you and thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today. I just want to make a few corrections to the record before I get into my remarks. First of all, teaching virtually is a skillset, so this idea that people turned on their computers and were aghast by what they saw, many of our educators had never had the investments made in what it takes to teach students virtually, which is a different skillset. For that to be the metric of evaluation for what is happening in our public schools, it is just wrong and inaccurate. I am not sure where in the country a teacher would only be evaluated two times in 5 years. Teacher evaluations are part of our school systems. I was evaluated every year, multiple times a year, on things like student learning objectives, standards-based observations. Parent and peer feedback, whole school measures and also student feedback. You cannot advance as a teacher and maintain your certification without evaluation, so that needs to be said. There is already a partnership in place between parents and teachers. I have to shout out from my own home State of Connecticut, our PTA Chairman, Joe Accomando, who is here in the gallery today listening. Listen, I am an educator, and I support school choice. I support high quality public charter schools. There are no exceptions, but I also recognize the importance of specialized learning. Schools with a focus on a particular strand or a topic because these schools can engage students in a very different way and help them to excel in their learning. Charter schools get to pick and choose if and when they will accept a special education population. They get to choose to exclude students based on disciplinary or attendance issues. Public schools cannot do that. We have to support all students, no matter what they bring to the table. Even the kids who have no one else advocating for them. Even to your point the Tiffanys. That is our job, to support all students, so why then are we not talking about making all schools the best that they can be, instead of picking off and creating subsets where a select handpicked group of students have access to high quality specialized learning. As a parent, I would expect that for my child, and I want that as a teacher for every child. That should be our response. I also do not support moving public funds from students who need it most, to fund for-profit charter networks. The Department of Education invests millions of dollars in charter schools, so we must have transparency and oversight of these funds, and that is not unreasonable. To my colleague's point, these are questions that for a decade still have not been answered. Dr. Vasquez Heilig, in your testimony you mention that charter schools have higher rates of teacher turnover, and lower teacher quality than traditional public schools. Can I ask you why public schools are able to retain quality teachers at higher rates than most public charter schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. That is a great question, and I think there is a lot of peer reviewed research on this topic. The charter teachers say it is because there is a lot of inexperienced teachers in charter schools. One fifth of public school teachers have less than 3 years' experience. One third of charter school teachers have that experience. They also have a challenge with experienced leaders and working conditions. Right here in D.C., 25 percent of teachers turn over in public, neighborhood public schools, 40 percent in charter schools according to a Washington Post piece that I recently saw. It is very well established in the research literature on average because we are talking about the averages here, that charter schools have less experienced teachers, and they are less qualified, and they have higher turnover. Mrs. Hayes. According to the Network of Public Education, over 15 percent of charter schools around the country are run by for-profit corporations. Do you think that a mandatory spending report, or other measures by Congress would help in providing transparency to where these funds are going? Mr. Vasques Heilig. We absolutely need more accountability. There was a comment about money for these planning grants, with the CSP grant, and I have been a CSP reviewer for the U.S. Department of Education. We have seen a billion dollars going to planning grants for schools that either never opened or closed after a year. There is excessive malfeasance in terms of the finances in the charter school sector. Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I do not have much time, so I will end by thanking you all for your testimony, and just reminding you that investing in our teachers and in our public schools, is the way that we reach all students. This idea about picking out and pulling out the most egregious statistics about failing schools should be our call to action, not us turning away from the kids who need it most, or the kids that have no one but us advocating for them. With that, I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Representative. Let us go to the great State of Illinois, where Representative Miller is recognized. Representative Miller. Mrs. Miller. Thank you, Chairman Bean, and thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today. Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell. Yes, ma'am? Mrs. Miller. You mentioned in your testimony that 67 percent of Baton Rouge charter schools are surpassing their pre-pandemic test scores. Congratulations. Mr. Campbell. Thank you. Mrs. Miller. Which is roughly double the percentage of traditional public schools in Baton Rouge achieving the same success. That number is simply remarkable. What do you think explains the charter school success in Baton Rouge? Mr. Campbell. I think several things. One, being able to be in that smaller environment where you are worried primarily about the kids in that building gives you a laser like focus on those kids and their needs and their interests. We have a school district, and you are kind of worried about everybody and everything, it is kind of hard to forget about the one kid, and what does that one kid need? I think charter schools being mission aligned, and mission focused really digging in on instruction, and understanding you know, kind of what the learning loss during COVID entailed, and how they can get past that. I think our schools have done a wonderful job. We have further to go, but by far we want to be far better. We are really encouraged that those schools are back to that level. We think they could be even better next year, so that is what we are focused on. Mrs. Miller. That is great. Mr. Campbell, I am also deeply impressed by your dedicated service to our country, having served 8 years on active duty, and an additional 13 years in the Reserves. First and foremost, thank you so much for your commitment and sacrifice to preserve our freedom. Mr. Campbell. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Miller. Your contributions are truly commendable, and our Nation is indebted to individuals like you. In your testimony you highlighted the potential of charter schools in addressing the unique needs of military families. Could you elaborate on how charter schools can effectively cater to the specific needs of military families? Mr. Campbell. Yes, ma'am. First, it is knowing the kids. The reality is you know, our military families, especially in the post-911 era, you know, they were facing frequent deployments, and so our family members were gone all the time. What does that mean to a kid who is in your school, you know, if they have a dad gone, or a mom gone for an extended period of time? Frequent TDY's, the fact that they are moving every two to 3 years and they are at a different community with different friends, all those things affect kids and how they learn, and their ability to be deeply connected to teachers and schools. A school that recognizes that and those little things, for example, when you walk into Bell Chase, you know, shortly after 9/11, you would see banners hanging in the entryway with the names of every parent who was deployed, right? That kids would walk through that on their way into school knowing that people cared about their family member, and that they were praying for them, and hoping for their success. The fact that these kids have to go on to different school district, and they need to be on grade level. All those sorts of things I think made a big difference to the families, you know, just south of New Orleans, and I am hoping that other schools can have also that laser like focus on particular kids who go into their doors. Mrs. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Campbell, and may God continue to bless and grant you wisdom as you seek to be impactful in these children's education, and Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Representative. Let us go to the great State of Florida where Representative Wilson, you are recognized, good morning. Ms. Wilson. Thank you, home boy. Thank you, Chairman Bean, Ranking Member Bonamici, and thank you to our witnesses for your testimony today. I must State upfront that I find your claims of charter schools outperforming public schools to be not only misleading but entirely deceptive and unfounded. Charter schools have failed to uphold their promises to the communities they serve. A number of years ago, I became a public school teacher to keep the promise that traditional public schools make. My mission was clear to provide Black and Brown children with opportunities for life, knowledge, civic engagement, and the pursuit of the American dream. Charter schools fall short of this promise. Instead, poorly monitored charter schools deliver subpar academic results, snatch money from our public schools, and then wash their hands clean of any responsibility. On top of that in my home State of Florida, we see charters exacerbate patterns of resegregation along racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines. In Florida, Black students consistently perform worse in charter schools than in their traditional public schools. While Florida's charters boast more A rated schools, they also lead the pack in F rated institutions, compared to public schools, and that is just the reality. In fact, in 2022, News4Jax report revealed that 10 out of 40 Duval County charter schools received D or F grades from the State. Does this sound consistently successful to you? Help me make sense of this. Again, the assertion that charters are best for minority, low-income communities, is not just misleading but downright dangerous and destined for failure. In a WTSP Tampa Bay report, Florida's charter school statistics paint a grim picture, a staggering 409 charter schools have shut down since the first opened in Florida in 1996. That is a 40 percent failure rate. As a former teacher, and former principal, myself, let us recap what we have learned. What are charter schools actually good at, if anything? We have learned that charter schools are good at snatching Florida's money that should be going to public schools, leaving them deprived. Then, they peddle substandard education. When the damage is done, they shut down and leave nothing but chaos in their wake. This is what we get with charter schools. We as a nation have worked very hard, made so many gains, and we simply cannot continue to regress into an educational landscape where we fail to keep the promises we have made to our children. The very first charter school in the Nation was established in my hometown of Florida, Miami, Florida, by Jeb Bush, who used that platform to win the Governorship of Florida. After the school board, which I served on, passed the charter provision, despite my protest, I worked with Mr. Bush side by side to make sure that the school was at least halfway equal to our public schools. It was not, and it soon closed. Please stop diverting funds from public schools to experiment with our children. With that, I have a few questions. Dr. Vasquez Heilig, data is consistently showing that traditional public schools are increasing in performance over time. Meanwhile, charters have higher teacher turnover rates. Would it not make sense to invest in our traditional public school system, rather than splintering our resources in a variety of school types? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. This is particularly important for the African American community. The NAACP has had five resolutions on charter schools, and the one in about 2010 made exactly this point. This is why the NAACP called for a moratorium on charter schools in 2016, and this is especially important because in urban areas, one in every five Black students is now attending a charter school. Ms. Wilson. I am out of time. Thank you. Chairman Bean. Thank you, Representative Wilson. Let us go to Utah where the Chair of the Higher Ed Subcommittee is recognized. Burgess Owens, Representative Owens, you are recognized. Mr. Owens. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Heilig, I would like to ask a quick question. Would you agree with--I will get to what the question is, what is the priority of education? The child or the institution? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, part of the education system should be to make the investments in our students, so they can have successful futures---- Mr. Owens. No, no, no. Just--is it the child? Is that the priority? Or is the institution? There are two different focuses I think we are kind of dealing with right now? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Investments in the children. Mr. Owens. Okay. Okay. The State of California 2017, 75 percent of the black boys in the State of California could not pass standard reading and writing tests. Here in Baltimore, three districts--zero proficiency in math. Should the parents of those children--well, let me also ask this. Would you agree the parents of these children care about their kids as much as everybody else, even if they are poor, black, Hispanic, they still care about those kids that are failing? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. I am sorry. I do not understand. Mr. Owens. Would you agree that the parents of those children care about their kids as much as we do care about our kids? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Absolutely. Mr. Owens. Okay. In a situation where there in these schools should parents have a choice of leaving failing public schools to go someplace else? Can I just reState this? 75 percent of black boys in the State of California fail to read, write and think. Should those parents have a choice of leaving those public--failing public schools, to go someplace where their kids have a chance to succeed? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. The question you asked has limited the responses I can provide. The response to the actual question is we need to make an investment in these children. Mr. Owen. Well, let me just say this. If we were talking about your child, I am sure you will say I want to choose someplace else. I have been hearing this for 40 years that we need to reinvest in these schools. Guess what happens? Every three to 4 years, kids are graduating not understanding how to succeed as we are talking about investing more into failing schools. Should public school systems have the same level playing field, in terms of the outcome, as charter schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, I think the record should say that charter schools should have the same accountability. Public schools have vastly more accountability in State law than charter schools do. Mr. Owens. Okay. Why are we having so much failure across our country? This is not just California, by the way. Everywhere, and by the way, let me just say this. It is happening more in black, Hispanic and low-income that this is going on. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes, yes, yes. That is the elephant in the room in our country. We know that inequality is--20 billion dollars more go into districts that are primarily white compared to districts that are primarily Black and Latino. Mr. Owens. Well, let me just say this. I know that charter schools in the same communities as these public schools, so if you go to a charter school you have a majority of black, Hispanic and low-income. You go to the same public school, charter, you are going to have the same geographics. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes, but here is the answer. Here is the answer to that question. If I go into your local supermarket, I have $10.00, and I have to split it three ways, that is completely different than if we invest it in a public choice decision. The vouchers, charters---- Mr. Owens. Okay. Just let me say this because I do not want to get into too much of the weeds. I am going to ask you, and I look at this. The problem is accentuated, this here statement, by nationwide declining K through 12 student populations at public schools. That could be because parents realizing it is not working for their kids. I think we have to--I understand this, how about we look at best practices? Have you ever thought about this? You look at what is going on in Baton Rouge, you look at what is going on in the Success Academy. If those are working, should we not replicate that if the focus is our kids? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, I think that is a great question. We have a district in Louisiana that is all charter schools, and I do not think anybody is arguing that they are a model of educational success. After Katrina, charter schools were forced on New Orleans, and nobody is arguing that they are a beacon of educational success. Mr. Owens. No. We can also not argue, we have to argue that there is 75 percent failure rate in California, so those public schools are failing too. My point is we should have a standard for all of them because failing our kids, they should not be part of the equation, right? Would you agree with that? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. I agree we should have a high standard for all schools, absolutely. Mr. Owens. Okay. That means public schools also. If the public schools are failing, let us get rid of them. If charter schools are failing, let us get rid of them. A bottom line is our output of our kids being able to sit and have these kinds of conversations, to have a dream, the ability to move forward, only happen if they can read, write and think. For us to talk about putting down the best practices of college, of situations that are working is we are--I am trying to understand why that is happening. If it is succeeding, if it is in Baton Rouge it is succeeding, New York, I would go to the Success Academy upstairs in the same building is where Success Academy is. Downstairs is public. The biggest--the biggest disappointment of those kids and those same families, one knows they are going to be succeeding because they are a part of that lottery ticket, and the other know they are not going to succeed because they are going downstairs to a public school system that is going to guarantee their failure. We need that focus on our outcome, focus on our kids, not the institution. Thank you guys, actually, for what you are doing. I appreciate particularly those in these communities that these kids have not had a chance in the past. Thank you, guys, so much for that, and I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Representative Owens. Let us go to the great State of California where the Chair of the Subcommittee of the Workforce is recognized. Representative Kiley, you are recognized. Mr. Kiley. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Campbell, I want to ask you about the New Orleans experience because it is such an important case study that in the wake of Hurricane Katrina you had to rebuild the whole education system. New Orleans went 100 percent charter. Is that correct? Mr. Campbell. That is correct. Mr. Kiley. What have the results been in terms of student achievement? Mr. Campbell. The results have been nothing short of remarkable. As we said, it was virtually a wasteland. It was one of the worst school districts in America prior to Hurricane Katrina. You look today and you actually see a vibrant school system. It actually works very well. Contrary to what a lot of people said, the folks who started schools after Hurricane Katrina were education leaders who were already from New Orleans. It was not like there was some invading force that came in with all these charter schools. The reality is we empower local educators who were already there, already operating schools, with a new way to be able to do it, that they have embraced and ran with and done phenomenal things with. Right now, if you look at our State, New Orleans again was always at the bottom. It is in the top tier in terms of school district performance, and top 40 percent. There is no way you would have expected that in New Orleans when you look at the demographics of New Orleans. We have veteran educators who love New Orleans, who have lived there their entire lives, who are running great charter schools. If you ask a person, they will tell you they will never go back. That is the reality of what is happening in New Orleans. Mr. Kiley. New Orleans went from among the worst to among the best. Mr. Campbell. Yes. Mr. Kiley. After going 100 percent charter? Mr. Campbell. Yes. Mr. Kiley. We see in some parts of the country charter schools are under attack. One of the first things that the Biden administration Education Department did was propose cutting charter school grants. In California, a number of laws have been passed, and have been signed into law by the Governor, making it harder to open and to reauthorize charter schools. In Los Angeles, Unified School District, the second largest district in the entire country, that we are proposing right now to significantly restrict the ability to operate charter schools. We have heard today, several just blatantly false statements about how charter schools work from our friends over there, as well as one of the democrat witnesses, who just blatantly mischaracterized the New Orleans experience. What would your message be to those who are waging this war on charter schools when they have been shown to produce remarkable results? Mr. Campbell. I think the first thing we have to understand is that this is really about money and control, right? We can talk about all these other things performance, others, it is money and control. It is who gets to decide how kids are educated, where they are educated, and who gets to spend the money. The fact is now we have a situation where all of a sudden it is not all housed in one district. There are other people who can say this is how we are going to spend our dollars. These are the results we are trying to achieve. For the first time, we have empowered poor families to say I do not like what is happening in this school, so I am going to take my money, and I am going to move and go somewhere else. At the end of the day, as long as we are talking about money and power and control, you are always going to have this kind of contentiousness but let us not make it something else. It really is about money and power and control, and who has it and who does not. Mr. Kiley. In other words, the attacks on charter schools are about putting politics over kids. Mr. Campbell. Absolutely. Mr. Kiley. Dr. Raymond, I wanted to ask you briefly about the CREDO study because this is really the gold standard when it comes to measuring charter school success. I think you have results specifically from California as well, which is my State. Can you speak to that a little bit about how charters are done in California? Ms. Raymond. I knew I would get a detailed question. Hang on just a second. Yes, thank you. In our charter school study of 2023, students in California charter schools were able to host 11 extra days of learning in reading, and four extra days of learning in math. These are 1,300 charter schools across the State, so on average they are moving students forward faster than students in traditional public schools that are right down the street. Mr. Kiley. Is it not interesting that the politicians in Sacramento see those results and decide these are precisely the schools that we need to go after, and to target, and make it more difficult to operate them? Thank you very much for your work, and thank you as well for your testimony, Mr. Campbell, and your work--the tremendous work that you are doing to provide opportunities to students. The beauty of charters is that not only are they helping to close achievement gaps in districts that have historically struggled when it comes to student success, but you know, they also allow for just different options for different types of kids, and different types of families. In the area that I represent, we actually have some truly excellent traditional public schools, and then we also have some outstanding charter public schools that some families choose to opt into. I want to thank the Chair for holding this hearing. I think it is very important that we continue to support the charter movement and to support successful charter schools and charter leaders. I think it is highly unfortunate that that cannot be as bipartisan as frankly it should be. Thank you, and I yield back to the Chair. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Chair Kiley. Let us go to the great State of North Carolina, where the Chair of the Education and Workforce is standing by. She is now recognized for questions. Representative Foxx, you are recognized. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Chairman Bean. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. Dr. Raymond, coming to you again, you mentioned that charter school results for students in urban areas, and for minority students are especially positive. Could you say something more about that? I know you have done excellent research and have terrific numbers about this, so we would love to hear more about that. Ms. Raymond. I love it when somebody asks me for more numbers, thank you. Mrs. Foxx. Will you turn your mic on? I am not sure it is on. Ms. Raymond. Yes, ma'am, it is on. Can you hear me now? Mrs. Foxx. Okay. Ms. Raymond. Urban students enrolled in charter schools learn an extra 30 days in a year's time in reading and 28 extra days of learning in math in a year's time compared to district students that they're matched with. For black students, those numbers are 35 extra days of learning in reading, and 29 extra days of learning in math. Hispanic students, reading 30 extra days in reading for Hispanic students, and 19 extra days for Hispanic students in math. The poverty results are 23 extra days of learning in reading, and 17 extra days of learning in math. What this means is over a course of several years, students are making months and months and months of additional academic progress. This means they are better prepared to graduate. They are better prepared for life after high school. Mrs. Foxx. Which makes it again even more puzzling as to why policymakers do not want these students to have these opportunities. It is just maddening. Mr. Pondiscio, in the last few years we have seen parents in traditional public schools get silenced, excluded and shamed for simply wanting to be part of their children's education. I think that is inexcusable. How can charter schools help ensure parents have a voice in their child's education? Mr. Pondiscio. The best schools, charter, public, privates alike, recognize the power of getting every adult on the same page so to speak, or pulling in the same direction. I think one of the potential benefits of charter schools is to encourage again, innovation, and create a more--a wider variety, an ecosystem if you like, of different school types. With respect to my research-based colleagues, I focus on curriculum, on instruction, on school culture. If you think of the choices that an affluent American parent has at his or her disposal, depending on where they live of course, they likely have access to a classical school, a Montessori school, a project-based learning school. They have, without controversy, unfettered access to make the best choice for his or her child. Imagine if we had a similar range of options for low-income families, where--and this should be the magic of chartering. Let us be honest, if there is a weak link in the charter ecosystem, it is that we are not encouraging this robust flowering of different school models and cultures. If we use the chartering process to create an equal system, a system that it was just as robust and diverse and had as many different options as well-off families have, well then you would more likely match parents and children to schools that match their interest, their values, et cetera. That I think is the promise of chartering that is unfulfilled, but it is fulfillable. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell. Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Foxx. We have heard a lot of concerns about how having too much red tape can stifle charter school flexibility and growth. As someone who has been involved in charter schools for several years, what kind of regulations could be eliminated without compromising charter effectiveness? Mr. Campbell. Yes. Honestly, ma'am, I do not know where to start, right? There are so many regulations, and I must say this is not only the case for our charter schools, this is for traditional public schools also. Like the amount of red tape that we throw at education is ridiculous. I will give you a really quick story. In Louisiana, we passed a bill several years ago that would allow every kid to get $1,000.00 in free tutoring. A report just came out last week that only 1 percent of eligible students were taking advantage of that. The reason was because we made the mandates for being a tutor so hard, like you had to be a retired teacher, you had to have so many hours of training, that we could not find enough teachers to do it. Across the board, we are always bringing in additional mandates, cursive writing. You have to learn about this one little obscure thing. At the end of the day, let us set the outcomes and let us try to get out of the way. Let us take the handcuffs off. I mean we certainly want to protect kids. We want to protect families. Those things are really important. I would argue our whole system is overly burdened by regulator red tape, and it certainly affects charters, which are supposed to be exempt from that. Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Chair Fox. Let us go to the great State of New York, where Representative Bowman is recognized. Good morning. Mr. Bowman. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses for being here. Before I get into my questions, Dr. Vasquez Heilig, is there anything you want to clarify based on questions you may have been asked before I arrived? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. I would like to clarify. There is a lot of conversation about why CREDO's results are valid. I am really surprised that they are spending so much time trying to convince us that they are valid, which to me tells a story. Now, one of the things about being at Stanford was I was subjected to a lot of statistical torture in my graduate program. I would like to talk a little bit about CREDO. Our understanding of that report, and only they really know, is that less than 40 percent of public school students are compared to more than 90 percent of charter school students. It is not really a comparison of charter schools and neighborhood public schools. It is a very--and she said carefully selected, and I want to underline selected. It is really narrow subject groups, rather than actual samples, so I think that is very important to say. I do not think that we should cherry pick results about educational outcomes. They note in their report that they had issues with sampling, especially for Native American students, and ELL students, sub-50 percent, and their ability to match in those areas. She talked about CMOs, and they decided to omit several states that have CMOs. Ohio, one of those. 78 percent of the charters in Ohio are CMOs, and one in every two is for-profit. I think it is important that I am just really surprised that they spent a lot of time trying to justify their methodology, and I think that is because of the last 14 or 15 years that scholars have had lots of critiques of their methodology. Mr. Bowman. Thank you so much. As a former teacher, principal, and founder of a district run public school across New York City, I have also seen countless examples of the ways that charter schools can negatively impact traditional public schools, and often go against the wishes of local communities. Dr. Vasquez Heilig, how do charters impact students in communities at traditional public schools, especially as it relates to things like funding, available space, and student enrollment? Can you say more about how, as you stated in your testimony, charters often fail to align with the broader community interests? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. I think this is a very important point, and I was able to make it briefly to the other gentleman. What is happening now is we are opening charters. We are offering opportunities of vouchers, et cetera. We are using the same educational dollars, and we are funding three separate systems, which is a very inefficient way of going about public education. Now, we have examples from other countries. I will give you an example of Chile. Chile is a place where they have universal choice. What we see in those situations is that you have your great public schools in the nice neighborhoods. You have your other public schools where most of the lower achieving and low SES students go, and then you have some private schools where those voucher students go. What these systems actually do is they promote stratification of students. You see less special ed students being served by charter schools. You see greater segregation. When we did our study on segregation, we looked at every single school in NCES. We did not say here is 40 percent of neighborhood public schools. Here is 95 percent of charter schools. We looked at every single school in the NCES dataset and found that charters are more segregated. I think it is very important that we are attentive to these critiques, and that where the NAACP was coming from in 2016. There are significant critiques of charter schools, and I think charter school supporters could get a lot more people onboard if they would actually address the critiques, and they have not. Mr. Bowman. Thank you and let us try to get this one in before the time runs out. Can you also discuss in more detail the harsh discipline practices that exist more often in charter schools than in traditional public schools, and how these practices disproportionately impact marginalized students, including students with disabilities? I mean, I have seen kids thrown--just thrown out of the charter schools, the public schools cannot do that. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes, yes. Mr. Bowman. Get suspended for long periods of time, public schools cannot do that. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes, yes. Mr. Bowman. Can you say more about that, please? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. I think the big picture is that it really disturbs me that we spin these sort of negative aspects of charter schools, that we need to have these harsh discipline, no excuses charter schools. That it is Okay that charter schools close. That it is okay that we have lower quality teachers. That spin. For me, as a former charter school instructor, I think of Gary. He reminded me a lot of myself, and I do not want to cry here, but he reminded me a lot of myself. He got into a little bit of trouble now and then, but one day he got into a little bit too much trouble, and the charter school kicked him out. I came back 1 day, and Gary was not there, and it broke my heart. I just think about all the Gary's out there who charter schools have decided that they do not want to serve, and they want to send them back to our neighborhood public schools. Mr. Bowman. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Representative Bowman. Let us stay with the great State of New York where Representative Williams is recognized. Welcome, and good morning. Mr. Williams. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and thank you. Thank you to all of our witnesses for being here. I am an advocate for school choice. I believe that parents, not bureaucrats, make the best decisions for their parents, I am sorry--for their kids' success, and particularly for their education. In my district, we are very fortunate to have some excellent public schools, and I commend those administrators and teachers and school boards that deliver excellence in their communities. I also have excellent charter schools, and they are usually located in the most disadvantaged communities in my district. They are also very successful. They are wonderfully diverse. They are skillfully led, and they are in great demand. In fact, right now there are ten families waiting on a wait list just to get into kindergarten in their community charter school. Every year they have more applicants than seats available. Dr. Vasquez Heilig, do you believe that charter schools cherry pick students to inflate positive academic results? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, I think that I made a point earlier before you arrived, Congressperson. Mr. Williams. It is a real easy question. Do you believe that charter schools cherry pick students? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. They have the ability to do that. Yes. Mr. Williams. You believe they do? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. They have the ability to do that if they so choose. Mr. Williams. You have on record for having said an option is that we can ban charter schools altogether in a September 2019 interview. Are you really considering banning all charter schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Well, I think that--I do not think that we should ban all charter schools. I think all charter schools should be democratically accountable to the public. Mr. Williams. Can you provide some context for me to understand your comment that an option is that we can ban charter schools altogether? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. Mr. Williams. That sounds like banning charter schools, that is what it sounds like to me. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Again, great question. I do not know the context of the comment? Do you know where that comment was made? Mr. Williams. They are your words. I assume that you meant them when you said them. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. I do not know the context of the comments, but---- Mr. Williams. It is always context. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. I do believe that all charters should be democratically accountable. Mr. Williams. Okay. Is it not your whole mission really just to avoid direct competition to local public schools? Is that really your mission? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Sorry. I am a scholar, so my job is---- Mr. Williams. Well, scholars can have political objectives. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. My job---- Mr. Williams. Please do not interrupt me, sir. Thank you. Scholars can have political points of view, as we have all learned. I am educated in engineering, and engineers have political opinions. This is a very political issue. Is it not your whole mission simply to avoid direct competition to local public schools? Is that your mission? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. No. Mr. Williams. That is not your mission? Mr. Campbell has pointed out that this is really about money, control and power. Mr. Campbell, you made some very compelling statements there. What is a good reason to ban charter schools altogether? Mr. Campbell. Sir, I could see no good reason to ban charter schools altogether. They are viable, they are popular with our families, and they are doing well. There is no reason to ban charter schools. Mr. Williams. Well, we have scholars who are saying that that is a viable option. What animates and motivates that point of view? I am surprised to have heard it today? Mr. Cambell. I think sometimes there is a tendency to look at something that is not perfect, and to try to equate something else to it, to try and compare and contrast. We have had conversations today, and I have heard people talk about stratified schools. Our public school systems are stratified today, right? The reason we have charter schools is to help those folks who are stuck where they are, and so you know again, it is not as if parents are leaving to go to charter schools because everything is perfect. They are leaving because of the challenges that are already there. Now our public school system needs to be better, and our working in Baton Rouge, we support great schools regardless, Magnet, outside under a tree, whatever it is. If it works we are for it, and the reality is that too many of our schools do not work, and we need more schools that do. Mr. Williams. It just seems that getting back to where I started--that putting power in the hands of parents, and letting them choose, like in my community where they are on a wait list for these wonderfully diverse schools that achieve just remarkable results, not at the exclusion of public schools. We have excellent public schools as well that dot my landscape. Mr. Campbell. Yes. Mr. Williams. I am proud of both. Mr. Campbell. Yes. Mr. Williams. This idea that to avoid direct competition of local schools, and perhaps even ban charter schools altogether as a scholarly option is absurd, and I appreciate you all for testifying here today. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Mr. Williams. Let us go to the great State of Louisiana, where Representative Letlow is recognized. Good morning, and you are recognized. Ms. Letlow. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all the witnesses for being here, especially my fellow Louisianan, Mr. Ken Campbell, from New Schools for Baton Rouge, for coming to testify in front of the Subcommittee. Mr. Campbell. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Letlow. I have previously visited Mr. Campbell's charter school operations and was so impressed by the educational innovation occurring at your schools, and how they are meeting the student's needs, and catering to their learning styles. It is no secret that I am a strong supporter of charter schools. The charter school's program at the U.S. Department of Education, and in fact, last September, the Louisiana Department of Education was awarded 55.5 million in Federal CSP grants to support Louisiana's charter school movement. Over 5 years LDOE will support the addition of over 5,000 seats at 25 new, expanding or replicating the charter schools primarily located in failing school districts, including in rural areas, just like mine. I am thrilled this grant will benefit our State, and ultimate our students. As I visited with the charter advocates, it has been increasingly clear how tedious and long the administrative process is for starting our new charters. To address these concerns, last November I introduced H.R. 6418, the Empowered Charter Schools Educators to Lead Act. The bipartisan bill, which authorizes states who receive grants through the CSP, to use a portion of their funding to support the application process and development of new charter schools. These planning awards will help support experienced educators with at least 5 years of school-based experience to the charter school application process, and increase technical assistance opportunities for them, including locating and accessing a facility for their new school. It is my hope the Committee can consider my bill, so it can ensure high-quality perspective charter school applicants have the tools and assistance they need to successfully complete the process. My question is to you, Mr. Campbell. Can you share your experience with this Committee, including any red tape that you have encountered when opening new schools for Baton Rouge? Then second, how could access to a planning grant and increased technical assistance, ease the way for additional charter schools to open in Louisiana and eventually across the country? Mr. Campbell. Yes, ma'am. Thank you and so pleased to, you know, kind of have you here, and good to see you today. For your piece of legislation, I think it is incredibly helpful. Starting a charter school is hard, as it should be, right? I was the authorizer for the State of Louisiana. I am going to tell you right now to get over our bar to be able to start a school is incredibly hard. The reason it is hard is because serving kids is hard. Like this is not an easy endeavor. The hurdles that you have to overcome in order to be able to start a school are significant. With the CSP grant, we are able to solve part of the challenge. We are able to get the money between the time their applications are approved, and the time their school opens, hire teachers by curriculum, furniture, all those sorts of things, and that is a wonderful use of the program. The reality, however, is that I think stronger schools are made in the planning process. If we are able to get some money to educators sooner, to help strengthen their applications and their planning, it will be remarkable. For example, if you decided that you wanted to start a school for girls in STEM education, you might want to go visit two or three of those schools and take some people with you from around the country to see them, which ones are succeeding. Why are they successful? What is working really well? These funds would allow you to be able to do stuff like that. The budget, the finance piece, you know, there has been a lot of talk about charters struggling with finance, and I think that is a real thing. Being able to get real support of people to help you put together a budget that is conservative, realistic, that allows your school to get started to be successful, would be tremendously helpful. That is not a skill that everybody has. Things we can do to help strengthen planning, to help strengthen the applications I think will lead to stronger schools, and it is one piece that has been missing, and I am really encouraged about the possibility of being able to make that happen. Ms. Letlow. Thank you so much. Thank you for all that you are doing for Louisiana. You are changing the landscape of our State, and eventually the country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Representative Letlow. Let us go to the Commonwealth of Virginia, where the Ranking Member of the Education and Workforce is standing by. Representative Bobby Scott, you are recognized. Good morning. Mr. Scott. Thank you, and good morning. We have heard a lot about questions about what happens when a school is failing. I just want to remind people that we updated the law in the Every Student Succeeds Act, to require that the lowest performing schools receive additional supports as a solution of addressing failing schools. Dr. Vasquez Heilig, can you say a word about what sense it makes as a solution to a failing school to let a few students slip out the back door? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Thank you so much. I would like to answer your question, and also correct the record on two places. The Congressman dropped and said I had called for a ban, but that was related to California's ban on for-profit schools. I just did a quick Google on that. Yes, I do believe that we should not be--we should not have for-profit-charter schools, so I want to make that clarification. I think the second thing about the New Orleans conversation, we looked at the ACT, SAT data, the NAEP data, and Louisiana RSD has been last and nearly last for quite some time. I do not believe that deserved accolades. If there is new data that I have not seen since I published that brief, I am very open to seeing those New Orleans data. Then finally, I think it is very important that we serve all students. All students that come to our door. That is what is great about public schools. Now, I understand the concerns about failing schools, and the---- Mr. Scott. Well, if you have a failing school, saying letting a few people slip out the back door, those have figured out what is going on, leaving everybody else in the failing school. That does not sound like much of a solution at all. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. No. Mr. Scott. In fact, everybody, if you have a failing school, all of them would choose to leave. Then what happens? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. Not every parent has the option to take their kid all the way across a city or a neighborhood to a charter school that does not provide transportation. There are a lot of limitations to what parents are able to do. It is in our best interest to have in the neighborhood a strong public school. Mr. Scott. The solution would be to improve the school, not let a few people slip out the back door? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. Mr. Scott. Let me ask you another question. I have limited time. Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. Mr. Scott. You mentioned on school choice that it is not the student, but the school that is choosing, and said eligible for lottery. What did you mean by that? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. I mean I have been to kid's schools where they outline who is eligible for their lottery. Now I am not saying that all public schools cream and crop students, and so in the research literature you have Kevin Welner's work, there is a variety of ways that students are creamed and cropped. I will not go deeply into that. There is well established research on how charter schools can change their populations, which makes the analyses that CREDO do very difficult because it biases their selective sample. Mr. Scott. Even with all that bias, some charters are obviously better than others. On average, are charters better or worse than public schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. I do not think that conversation could be limited to just test scores, because most of the research that CREDO does, they take very small standard deviations and hundredths of standard deviation and create these days of learning. We also need to look at teacher quality, and teacher turnover, and discipline, and suspension rates. We cannot just look at---- Mr. Scott. What is the effect of teacher quality, pay, inexperience, and turnover of teachers in charter schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Yes. We have looked at the success of teachers in terms of teacher quality. When you have a stronger teacher, it means better student achievement. There has been folks that have looked at well, is it okay if we have great teachers come in and they leave very quickly? There is very little research that establishes that is a good idea. Mr. Scott. Well, do charter schools have better pay, turnover and experience with teachers, or worse than public schools? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. They have worse turnover, worse teacher quality, in some cases better pay. Mr. Scott. Can you say a brief word about the disciplinary policies? If a kid gets expelled from a charter school, where do they go? Mr. Vasquez Heilig. Sure. Well, they are going to have to go back to their neighborhood public school. Charters in many states can reject students because of prior disciplinary issues. Mr. Scott. Then, Dr. Campbell, the city of Baton Rouge got significant funding under the American Rescue Plan Act. Do you know what the public schools did with that money that they were able to do because of that money to address learning loss? Mr. Campbell. Sir, first of all, it is Mr. Campbell, do not confuse me with the good folks down here. Yes. Yes. I think much of that funding went into real high-quality interventions for kids. We rapidly expanded, or greatly expanded high dosage tutoring for students, which I think is very powerful. We increased the number of math and literacy coaches in our schools. We were able to use some of that funding to expand early childhood education. I do think that in the State of Louisiana, city of Baton Rouge, rescue funds have been used by things that have made a difference. Mr. Scott. Well, did it make a difference? Mr. Campbell. Yes, sir. Mr. Scott. Thank you. Chairman Bean. Ranking Member Scott, thank you very much. We are nearing the end of our journey, but before we adjourn, let us yield to the Ranking Member Bonamici for her final thoughts. Ms. Bonamici. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses. It has been an important discussion today. Every student deserves a high-quality education that will prepare them for success. As we have heard, not all charter schools provide students with a quality education. When we consider all students, nor do they deliver the same educational outcomes that our traditional public schools could. Certainly, they are not a panacea for the challenges facing students today. As we heard, poorly regulated charter schools often have poor academic outcomes, and leaves students with no recourse when their rights are violated. I want to followup on Ranking Member Scott's comments about the conversation, the questions regarding so-called failing schools. As we know, under No Child Left Behind, a failing school was used--a term used to describe schools where the students have lower test scores. As those of us who were here in 2015 and worked on the Every Student Succeeds Act, as Ranking Member Scott clarified, we asked those questions. What does that mean to have low test scores? Maybe we need to ask a question, what does that school need? Why are the students not getting higher test scores? In fact, we changed that so that no longer are test scores used as punitive measures to label schools as failing. We put in the Every Student Succeeds Act that those schools should probably have more resources, right? Why are the students failing? Do they need smaller classes? Is there lead in the water? Are they hungry? All those questions. Where do we put the resources to help every student? I wanted to point that out because the term failing schools is really one where we have to question. A school is a building. What is happening with the students inside of it? I also want to take strong exception to the suggestion that this is about money. I find that personally offensive as a Member of Congress, as someone who cares deeply about every student, to suggest that I might have questions about charter schools because of money. We care, not only about the students whose parents say wow, I need to look at a charter school option for my child. We care also about the students whose parents are maybe a single parent household. Maybe they are stressed. Maybe they do not know about other options. Maybe they do not know how to get involved. To say that we only care, and that we want to provide a good education to those who want to leave the traditional public schools, I find to be inappropriate, and I just want to get that on the record that we should be here. We care about every student and want every student to have a good education. Calling for unchecked expanded access to charter schools that lack meaningful accountability, while continuing to underfund our already overwhelmed traditional public education system is not in the best interest of students. It is not in the best interests of parents, and it is certainly not in the best interest for the future and for our economy. I know on my side of the aisle, I will continue to fight for a strong quality public education system that protects and supports every child, not just those with involved parents who are looking for an alternative. We do not, as Ranking Member Scott said, we do not want to just leave everybody else behind. We would need to say what can we do to give them a great education, so with that Mr. Chairman, I yield back, and thank you. I look forward to continuing the conversation. Chairman Bean. Thank you very much, Ranking Member Bonamici. Here are my four takeaways. One, charter schools have high levels of academic achievement, and as we have heard during this hearing charter students, on average, learn more reading and math than their peers in traditional public schools. The fact is it is especially important when we know parents across the country are looking for better academic options. No. 2, charter schools are open to innovation, as Robert pointed out. Innovation is there, we have heard testimony that charter school autonomy can enable teachers to pioneer fresh teaching methods, encourage schools to develop better personnel practices and equip schools to innovate in curriculum. All of this can happen because charter schools are not burdened by the regulations and contracts that restrict traditional public schools. Three, charter schools can provide a lifeline, as Mr. Campbell pointed out, to the most disadvantaged students. While there are some traditional public schools that provide a good education, we know that many students sometimes can be trapped when it is not the best option for them. We should keep trying to improve public schools, but we are going to try to improve charter schools too. We realize that charters can provide a vital lifeline to students where there are no other good options. Everyone benefits when families have high-quality educational opportunities to choose from. Four, I have got three kids. They all learn differently. Every kid is different. To give them just one choice I think is not the best way to go. Everybody learns different, and maybe it is a charter school, maybe it is the public school, maybe it is a Magnet school. Maybe home schooling. I do not know, but everybody is different. We recognize that, and I think that is what we recognized today. Finally, to our witnesses, let me tell you what I did. You saw me, I promised a very innovative, invigorating, robust discussion. I did set the bar high for you but let me tell you what you did. You exceeded expectations. Thank you so much for participating. This, as Ranking Member Bonamici has said, we will continue this conversation as we embark on a journey to make American schools the best they possibly can be. With that, if there is no further---- Mr. Scott. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bean. Yes. Ranking Member Scott, you are recognized. Mr. Scott. The notice of consent requests that I would like to enter into the record, a letter from the Network for Public Education about charter schools and a report by the National Council on Disability entitled ``Choice and Vouchers-- Implications for Students with Disabilities.'' Chairman Bean. Without objection, so ordered, and thank you so much. There being no further business to come before the Committee, we stand adjourned.
