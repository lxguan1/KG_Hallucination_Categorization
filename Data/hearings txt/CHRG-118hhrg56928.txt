THE STATE OF AMERICAN AVIATION AND THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
----------
TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2024
House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Aviation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:03 a.m. in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Garret Graves
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The Subcommittee on Aviation will
come to order.
I ask unanimous consent the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document in the
record, please also email it to DocumentsTI@mail.house.gov.
I now recognize myself for the purpose of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GARRET GRAVES OF LOUISIANA, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you for being here,
Administrator Whitaker, and I want to, first off, congratulate
you on your unanimous confirmation vote. As you know, achieving
something like that in today's times is quite remarkable, and I
really appreciate your expertise and look forward to working
with you. I hope you understand that that's a strong support
from Congress, but also enormous recognition of the
responsibility of the job that you have now taken on.
We have heard a lot of descriptions about America's
aviation industry, everything from: it's the gold standard,
it's the leading edge of technology, and we have also seen in
recent months that we have had incredible challenges in the
aviation industry. I can't say enough that the aviation
industry needs to be successful. It needs to be successful in
terms of promoting technology, regulatory stability, safety,
and importantly--and I think often folks lose sight of--the
passenger experience.
Every American enjoys the enormous benefit of this
collaborative work. Commercial aviation has never been safer or
more prosperous. Our aerospace industry moves hundreds of
millions of people every year, creates millions of jobs,
trillions of dollars in economic activity, and forms a critical
pillar of national defense.
Maintaining our gold standard of aviation safety is in the
vital interest of the United States, and should be an urgent
national priority, but the only guarantee in our gold standard
is that what got us there yesterday is not going to be what
keeps us there tomorrow.
In the past year, as I've noted, we've seen several
aircraft manufacturing defects, aircraft engine fires, a whole
passenger airframe destroyed by fire, near-misses at our
airports, ramp worker deaths, pilot mental health issues,
general aviation accidents, poor airline customer service--
especially for disabled passengers--and other challenges.
The subcommittee has received testimony about FAA
organizational deficiencies and struggles the agency has had
integrating drones, advanced air mobility vehicles, commercial
space transportation, and cybersecurity into our National
Airspace System, and updating the technology that is needed to
ensure the efficiency and performance of our air traffic
control systems.
For each and every one of those instances, you can find a
provision in the House-passed FAA bill to address those issues.
I am going to say that again. For every one of those
issues, you can find provisions in the House-passed a bill to
address these issues.
I want to remind you that we passed that bill months and
months ago, well before the September 30 expiration. That
didn't happen by mistake. We worked methodically.
I want to thank Ranking Member Larsen and Ranking Member
Cohen; our leader, Sam Graves, Chairman Sam Graves; and all of
the aviation team for plowing through, literally, thousands and
thousands of stakeholder, of public, of Member of Congress
requests, and ultimately yielding a strong bipartisan bill.
Despite the differences, the House was successful in
passing that bill by a vote of 351 to 69. And similar to your
confirmation vote, in these times, that is absolutely
extraordinary.
Since the passage of the bill, it has received support from
all corners of the aviation sector: general aviation, business
aviation, manufacturers, innovators, labor, members of the
FAA's own workforce, commercial aviation, groups representing
passengers, airports, and on and on.
The House-produced legislation makes transformative changes
in the passenger experience and in private aviation. It
provides innovators of the unmanned aerial systems and advanced
air mobility space the regulatory certainty they need to deploy
some of the most advanced technologies we have seen in
aviation.
We also make meaningful reforms to expedite agency
processes and to position the agency to manage the ever-
expanding aviation system, and the bill contains numerous
provisions aimed at improving aviation safety.
With all the recent incidents, accidents, near-misses and
problems, it is nothing short of malpractice that the Senate
hasn't bothered to even mark up the FAA reauthorization bill.
The Senate's repeated failure has destroyed $650 million in
airport investments this year alone and delayed enactment of
urgently needed safety measures and reforms. There has never
been a worse time to leave the FAA unauthorized, yet that is
where the Senate's inaction has left us.
You are doing the best that you can with the job you have,
Mr. Administrator, but it's clear to me the Senate's inability
to do its job has real-world consequences that directly affect
American leadership in aviation and in the safety of the
traveling public. We stand ready, willing, and able to
negotiate the FAA reauthorization bill when the Senate is
ready. Hopefully, you can do something to help us with that,
Mr. Administrator, and hopefully, the conversation we have
today serves to underscore the urgency of getting a long-term,
comprehensive reauthorization bill signed into law.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Garret Graves of Louisiana, Chairman,
Subcommittee on Aviation
Thank you for being here today, Administrator Whitaker. I want
first to congratulate you on your unanimous confirmation vote. As you
know, achieving something like that today is quite remarkable, and I
really appreciate your expertise and look forward to working with you.
I hope you understand that this is strong support from Congress but
also enormous recognition of the responsibility of the job you've now
taken on.
America's aviation industry is the gold standard and has long since
been at the leading edge of technological advancement. We've also seen
in recent months that we've had incredible challenges in American
aviation.
The aviation industry needs to be successful promoting technology,
regulatory stability, passenger safety, and importantly--the things
folks sometimes lose sight of--improvements to the passenger
experience.
Every American enjoys the enormous benefit of this collaborative
work. Commercial aviation has never been safer or more prosperous. Our
aerospace industry moves hundreds of millions of people annually,
creating millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of economic
activity, and forms a critical pillar of national defense.
Maintaining our gold standard of aviation safety is vital to the
United States and should be an urgent national priority. But the only
guarantee in our gold standard is that what got us there yesterday will
not be what keeps us there tomorrow.
In the past year, as I've noted, we've seen several aircraft
manufacturing defects, aircraft engine fires, a whole passenger
airframe destroyed by fire, near misses at American airports, ramp
worker deaths, pilot mental health issues, general aviation accidents,
poor airline customer service--especially for disabled passengers--and
other challenges.

organizational deficiencies and struggles the agency has had
integrating drones, advanced air mobility vehicles, commercial space

and updating the technology that's needed to ensure the efficiency and
performance of our air traffic control systems.
For each and every one of those instances, you can find a provision
in the House-passed FAA bill addressing it. Let me say it again: for
every one of those issues, you can find provisions in the House-passed
FAA bill addressing them.
I want to remind you that we passed that bill months and months
ago, well before the September 30, 2023 expiration. That didn't happen
by mistake. We worked methodically.
I want to thank Ranking Member Larsen, Ranking Member Cohen,
Chairman Sam Graves, and all of the Aviation team for plowing through
literally thousands and thousands of requests from stakeholders, the
public, and Members of Congress and ultimately producing a strong,
bipartisan proposal.
Despite differences of opinion, the House of Representatives
successfully passed a FAA reauthorization bill by a vote of 351-69.
Just like your confirmation vote, in times like these, that is
extraordinary.
Since the passage of the bill through the House, it has received
support from all corners of the aviation sector: general aviation,
business aviation, manufacturers, innovators, labor, members of the FAA
workforce, commercial aviation, groups representing passengers,
airports, and the list goes on.
The House-produced legislation makes transformative changes in the
passenger experience and in private aviation. It provides innovators of
the Unmanned Aerial Systems and Advanced Air Mobility Space the
regulatory certainty they need to deploy some of the most advanced
technologies we've seen in aviation.
We also make meaningful reforms to expedite agency processes and to
position the agency to manage an ever-expanding aviation system.
And the bill contains numerous provisions aimed at improving
aviation safety.
With all the recent incidents, accidents, near misses, and
problems, it's nothing short of malpractice that the Senate hasn't even
bothered to mark up the FAA reauthorization bill.
The Senate's repeated failure has destroyed $650 million in airport
investment this year alone and delayed the enactment of urgently needed
safety measures and reforms.
There has never been a worse time to leave the FAA reauthorized,
yet that's where the Senate's inaction has led us.
You're doing the best you can with the job you have, Mr.
Administrator, but it's clear to me that the Senate's inability to do
its job has real-world consequences that directly affect American
leadership in aviation and the safety of the traveling public.
We stand ready, willing, and able to help negotiate the FAA
reauthorization bill whenever the Senate is ready. Hopefully, you can
do something to help us with that, Mr. Administrator, and hopefully,
the conversation we have today underscores the urgency of getting a
long-term comprehensive reauthorization bill signed into law.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I now recognize Ranking Member
Cohen for 5 minutes for an opening statement.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE COHEN OF TENNESSEE, RANKING
MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to say I
disagree with everything he said, that we need to fund Ukraine
and Israel at the same time.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I am just glad you were here to
listen to it.

Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr.
Whitaker, for coming before us today, such an important time
with aviation and your being at FAA. We appreciate that.
It's important that we have leadership. That's the thing I
heard most from people in the industry over the last 6, 7, 8
months, was we need a strong Administrator, and we need an
Administrator. And I think everybody is pleased with your
selection.
But we've had the recent problems--obviously, not your
fault--with Boeing, the 737 MAX 9, we had the Japanese airline
collision, an increase in runway incursions which have been
around for a while, and I know that that's on the top of your
mind, is getting something straightened out with those
potential intersections of airlines with the FAA and getting
better air traffic controllers, or more air traffic
controllers, really, more, and we need to get a pipeline going
to get more of everybody to give an opportunity to participate.
The FAA's prompt response to the January 5 Boeing incident
is commendable. Temporary grounding of more than 170 aircraft,
the audit of Boeing, and what you have done there has been--I
think everybody agrees with and appreciates.
Boeing must be held accountable because, as you have said
and others have said, safety is first, and that needs to be
made clear. As this incident and the MAX 8 crashes demonstrate,
complacency is a luxury we cannot afford when it comes to
aviation safety. Boeing and the FAA's oversight must make the
necessary changes to ensure similar incidents and accidents
don't happen again, doors flying off in the middle of the air
or planes falling out of the sky, or whatever.
As the FAA and the NTSB investigations into this accident
unfold, our subcommittee will stand ready to work with you and
all the relevant parties to enact legislative changes that are
necessary. But of course, the first thing we need to do is get
the reauthorization bill passed. We have done our job; now it's
your job to get the Senate to do their job.
I want to thank all the FAA employees who worked day and
night to ensure that no stone was left unturned when it came to
reviewing the MAX 9 inspection instructions, as well as the
airline maintenance technicians who are implementing these
instructions to ensure that aircraft can safely transport
passengers again.
NTSB Chair Homendy did a great job, and she is having some
of us over for a briefing later today, and showing us some of
the problems, and we appreciate that. She has been thorough.
Based on what has been communicated to us and the public thus
far, that work has been outstanding.
So, we must do everything we can to pass our next
reauthorization. We have done that. The next deadline is March
8, quickly approaching. Of course, we need our Senate
colleagues to act, because we need to make sure that the air
traffic control has more people, and beefed up.
There are tricky issues with the reauthorization. Our
committee worked in a bipartisan way to find common ground and
pass a bill that contains hundreds of provisions that will
preserve and enhance the aviation system and ensure a robust
and vibrant future for U.S. aviation. That bill passed by an
overwhelming bipartisan margin, and we hope the Senate can be
bipartisan, as well.
I look forward to your testimony. I appreciate the work of
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and the other Chairman
Graves. We put together a good bill, and we hope that we can
have success and confidence in the American public for
airplanes and flying, and that we don't lose business to
Airbus.
The French have already made overtures, what they are
trying to do to make sure that there are safe planes produced
all over the world, but particularly, I guess, they are
thinking in France and Airbus. So, that is an important
industry to America to have Boeing.
So, good luck. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Aviation
Thank you, Chairman Graves, and thank you, Administrator Whitaker,
for testifying today.
It is fortunate that we finally have a permanent Administrator, as
your leadership is needed more than ever.
Given the recent safety accident with the Boeing 737 MAX 9, the
Japan Airlines Flight 516 collision, and the increase in runway
incursions, this is a timely and important hearing.
I appreciate the FAA's prompt response to the January 5 Boeing 737
MAX 9 accident, including the temporary grounding of more than 170 of
the aircraft, the audit of Boeing's quality control and safety
practices and investigation into Boeing's 737 MAX 9 manufacturing, and
the capping of Boeing's production rate of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.
We must continue to hold Boeing accountable, and as Administrator
Whitaker previously noted, ``This won't be back to business as usual
for Boeing.''
As this accident and the MAX 8 crashes demonstrate, complacency is
a luxury we cannot afford when it comes to aviation safety. Boeing and
the FAA's oversight must make the necessary changes to ensure similar
accidents never happen again.
As the FAA and NTSB investigations into this accident unfold, our
Subcommittee will stand ready to work with all relevant parties to
enact any legislative changes deemed necessary to resolve quality
control problems, strengthen the oversight of aircraft manufacturers
and suppliers and prevent further safety issues from arising.
I want to thank the FAA employees who worked day and night to
ensure no stone was left unturned when it came to reviewing and
approving the MAX 9 inspection instructions, as well as the airline
maintenance technicians who are implementing these instructions to
ensure these aircraft can safely transport passengers again.
I also want to thank NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy and all of the
NTSB investigators for their vigorous efforts. Based on what has been
communicated to us and the public thus far, their work has been
outstanding, and we all look forward to their forthcoming preliminary
report.
In the meantime, we must do everything we can to pass our next FAA
reauthorization bill, which is needed now.
The next deadline of March 8 is quickly approaching, and we
urgently need our Senate colleagues to act. We have already passed two
short-term authorizations, and I fear passing a third will lead to
continued delays.
While there are certainly tricky issues with any reauthorization,
our Committee worked in a bipartisan way to find common ground and pass
a bill that contains hundreds of provisions to preserve and enhance
America's aviation system and ensure a robust and vibrant future for
U.S. aviation.
Our bill, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American
Aviation Act, passed by an overwhelming 351-69 vote. Meanwhile, the
Senate Commerce Committee has yet to hold its markup. I sincerely hope
they stick to their February 8 commitment.
Our House-passed bill makes historic airport infrastructure
investments, enhances aviation safety, protects consumers including
those with disabilities, addresses environmental resiliency, and
ensures the safe operation and integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems
(UAS) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) aircraft.
It also contains provisions that address the recent spike in near
miss incidents at U.S. airports, air traffic controller staffing
challenges, and the recording times of cockpit voice recorders.
For these reasons and many more, a long-term comprehensive FAA
reauthorization bill is vital to the safety and continuity of U.S.
aviation.
We are at a critical juncture in the U.S. aviation industry, and
proactive leadership is needed more than ever.
I certainly appreciate the work of my friend, Chairman Graves, and
also Ranking Member Larsen and Chairman Graves. Together, we've put
forth a good bill that will address many critical issues, and we will
continue our collaboration as we address issues from the Boeing 737 MAX
9 investigations.
Thank you again, Administrator Whitaker, for being here today, and
I look forward to today's discussion.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ranking Member Cohen. I
now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Chairman Sam
Graves, for 5 minutes.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN,
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Chairman Graves and
Ranking Member Cohen, for the hearing, and thank you,
Administrator Whitaker, for coming in. It is a pleasure to have
you before the Aviation Subcommittee.
The United States aviation system has been a major focus of
our committee's work this Congress. Last year, we
overwhelmingly--as has been the theme here so far today--we
overwhelmingly passed a comprehensive, bipartisan Federal
Aviation Administration reauthorization that is going to
dramatically improve American aviation and the FAA.
Unfortunately, the bill, as has been pointed out, and its many
improvements have been held up in the Senate for more than 6
months.
Fortunately, it appears that the Senate is poised to resume
its markup of the FAA bill in a few days, and I look forward to
seeing if it finally happens. And I look forward to sitting
down with our Senate Commerce Committee counterparts to start
reconciling the two bills.
Serious issues within our aviation system have played out
time and time again on the nightly news, and in my opinion, the
consequences of having no long-term FAA bill are exacerbating
them. Now, more than ever, American aviation and FAA needs some
bold direction from Congress. We can't afford business as usual
or half measures, and our bill will secure the growth and
robust leadership the American people deserve in their
aerospace system.
While Congress continues to move the FAA reauthorization
towards the finish line, we are looking to you or depending on
you to pick up that slack. Many of the provisions in the House-
passed bill are noncontroversial and can be implemented by the
FAA without any additional authority from Congress. I would
urge you and your staff to start laying the groundwork for an
expeditious and efficient agency implementation of the
provisions in line with the congressional intent.
Today is a great opportunity for Members to highlight the
aviation priorities that matter to them and ensure that their
issues are heard and understood and, hopefully, are addressed.
We also want to hear what your impressions of the agency
are since you have taken over the agency, since your
confirmation, and what your priorities are, moving forward.
And finally, we look forward to hearing an update on what
the FAA is doing regarding the flight 1282 accident and what
you have learned so far.
I do want to thank you, Administrator, and your staff, for
your very effective communication so far related to the
incident and your related findings that you found so far. Open
communication, I think, is important, a very important
component, in the committee having confidence in the actions
taken by the FAA. I hope that this continues as the agency
progresses with its oversight work and audits. We all share the
same goal of ensuring the safety of our aviation system and
maintaining that gold standard that we all talk about.
So, with that, thank you again for coming before the
committee.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves of Missouri, Chairman, Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure
The United States aviation system has been a major focus of the
Committee's work this Congress. Last year, the House overwhelmingly
passed a comprehensive, bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) reauthorization bill that will dramatically improve American
aviation and the FAA. Unfortunately, this bill and its many
improvements have been held up in the Senate for more than six months.
Fortunately, the Senate appears poised to resume its markup of
their FAA bill in a few days. I look forward to seeing if this finally
happens and to sitting down with our Senate Commerce Committee
counterparts to start reconciling the bills.
Serious issues within our aviation system have played out time and
time again on the nightly news, and in my opinion, the consequences of
having no long-term FAA bill are exacerbating them.
Now more than ever, American aviation and FAA needs bold direction
from Congress. We cannot afford business as usual or half measures. Our
bill will secure the growth and robust leadership the American people
deserve in their aerospace system.
While Congress continues to move the FAA reauthorization towards
the finish line, we're looking to you, Administrator Whitaker, to pick
up the slack. Many of the provisions in the House-passed bill are
noncontroversial and can be implemented by the FAA without any
additional authority from Congress. I urge you and your staff to start
laying the groundwork for expeditious and efficient agency
implementation of provisions in line with Congressional intent.
Today is also a great opportunity for Members to highlight the
aviation priorities that matter to them and ensure their issues are
heard, understood, and hopefully addressed.
We also want to hear what your impressions of the agency have been
since your confirmation, and what your priorities are going to be
moving forward.
And finally, we look forward to hearing an update on what the FAA
is doing regarding the Alaska Airlines flight 1282 accident and what
you have learned so far in the aftermath. And I do want to thank you,
Administrator Whitaker, and your staff for the effective communication
thus far related to this incident and your related findings. Open
communication is an important component in the Committee having
confidence in the actions taken by the FAA, and I hope that continues
as the agency progresses with its oversight work and audits. We all
share the same goal of ensuring the safety of our aviation system and
maintaining that gold standard.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. And with that, I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Larsen, is recognized
for 5 minutes.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair. Just one more,
Administrator Whitaker. Thanks for joining us today, I
appreciate it very much. We have got a lot to discuss. This
hearing comes at a critical time.
First, we have to review the implementation of the 2018 FAA
reauthorization which expired last September.
Second, we have to continue to push for the passage of a
comprehensive, long-range 2023 FAA reauthorization which passed
the House last July.
And finally, we must examine the problems that the recent
737 MAX 9 incident exposed.
Safety has always been this committee's top priority, and
the aviation system here in the U.S. is responsible for safely
transporting hundreds of millions of passengers each year
without fear of harm or injury. Americans have to have full
confidence in our aviation system. That confidence must be
justified.
This committee must ensure the FAA has the resources and
tools it needs to effectively conduct its investigations, its
audits, and enforcement actions. As always, we have to remain
vigilant to ensure that the likelihood of this accident
happening is decreased substantially.
The January 5 737 MAX 9 accident was terrifying to
everybody on board, but thanks to the calm and professional
actions of the flightcrew, everyone landed safely. I fully
support, as this committee does, the FAA's decisive response to
this accident, which included grounding the affected MAX 9
fleet, a separate investigation into whether Boeing delivered a
noncompliant aircraft to its customer, an overarching audit of
Boeing's MAX production lines and suppliers, and a prohibition
on increasing the Boeing 737 MAX production rate until its
quality control issues are resolved.
Unfortunately, it is not the first time we have seen
aircraft quality control issues in recent history.
In May of 2021, then-Chair DeFazio and I wrote to the
Department, to the FAA, and to Boeing with concerns about no
less than nine reports of quality control issues at Boeing
production facilities. Since then, there have been dozens more
reports of similar issues, leading to emergency fixes and
delays in production.
The safety culture of any organization flows from the top,
and I urge the Boeing leadership to take time now to examine
the culture that they have currently instilled and to improve.
I look forward to the implementation of the 2020
certification reform bill which this committee passed,
including the recommendations from the Boeing safety culture
review. Boeing has some of the most skilled, hard-working, and
technically proficient workers in the world, and they depend on
their leadership to instill the right policies so they can
effectively do their jobs. These dedicated women and men who
work at Boeing plants deserve answers, and the flying public
deserves answers.
I also look forward to the NTSB's preliminary report and
the findings of the FAA's investigations.
I will continue to work with the chairs of the committee
and subcommittee and the ranking member to take any potential
legislative or oversight actions needed to ensure the safety of
our skies.
Now, moving on to reauthorization, as the committee
continues its oversight of the MAX 9 accident response, we
can't forget our other responsibilities. We passed an FAA bill
in July. It passed 351 to 69. We are awaiting Senate action.
This bill created a framework to ensure a safer, cleaner,
greener, and more innovative and accessible U.S. aviation
system.
On aviation safety, there are numerous safety gaps that
have to be addressed since the last authorization, which were
enumerated in the recent NAS Safety Review Team report. The
House bill addresses these issues, including the hiring of air
traffic control and the installation of surface surveillance
and detection technology. And Administrator Whitaker, I look
forward to hearing your takeaways from that safety review
report, and what the FAA is doing to implement the
recommendations.
We have to do more to ensure all passengers can travel
safely and with dignity. The House bill improves training for
airline personnel and contractors on assisting travelers with
disabilities and mobility devices, and directs the DOT to
reduce damage to wheelchairs and mobility aids. Administrator
Whitaker, I want to hear how the FAA is working with DOT and
airlines to do more for passengers with disabilities.
We have a talented aviation workforce in this country, and
the FAA reauthorization bill triples funding for the FAA's
aviation workforce development programs to expand the talent
pipeline to all Americans. I look forward to hearing more on
what the FAA can do to recruit, train, and retain the expertise
that we need to lead globally.
We also have to provide a clear and predictable framework
for innovators to scale new entrants safely, while ensuring the
needs of local communities are addressed. Our bill requires the
FAA, as an example, to issue Beyond Visual Line of Sight, or
BVLOS, requirements for drone operations--ensuring their safe
integration into the skies and creating jobs. And so,
Administrator, I want to hear more about what the FAA is doing
on the BVLOS rulemaking and your work to integrate these
technologies.
The recent Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug accident is yet a
reminder of what is at stake if we continue to delay addressing
systemic safety issues in the U.S. aviation ecosystem. That is
in part why the Senate needs to move a bill forward so we can
start to negotiate a long-term FAA reauthorization to ensure
the FAA and NTSB have the authorities and resources that they
need to do their important work.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Graves, for calling today's hearing on ``The
State of American Aviation and the Federal Aviation Administration.''
Administrator Whitaker, thank you for joining us today. We have
plenty to discuss and I look forward to your testimony.
This hearing comes at a critical time.
First, we must review the implementation of the 2018 FAA
Reauthorization, which expired last September. Second, we must continue
to push for the passage of a comprehensive long-term 2023 FAA
reauthorization, which the House passed last July. Finally, we must
examine the problems the recent 737 MAX 9 accident exposed.
Safety must always be this Committee's top priority.
America's aviation system is responsible for safely transporting
hundreds of millions of passengers each year without fear of harm or
injury.
Americans must have full confidence in our aviation system--but
that confidence must be justified.
This Committee must ensure the FAA has the resources and tools it
needs to effectively conduct its investigations, audits and enforcement
actions.
As always, we must remain vigilant to ensure that the likelihood of
something like this accident happening is decreased substantially.
The January 5, 737 MAX 9 accident was terrifying to all on board,
but thanks to the calm and professional actions of the flight crew,
everyone landed safely.
I fully support, as does this Committee, the FAA's decisive

I look forward to the NTSB's preliminary report and the findings of
the FAA's investigations.
And I will continue to work with Chair Sam Graves, Chair Garret
Graves, and Ranking Member Cohen to take any potential legislative or
oversight actions needed to ensure the safety of our skies.
As the Committee continues its oversight of the MAX 9 accident
response, we cannot forget our other responsibilities.
We passed an FAA bill in July. It passed 351 to 69. We are now
awaiting Senate action. Our bill created a framework to ensure a safer,
cleaner, greener, more innovative and accessible U.S. aviation system.
There are numerous safety gaps to be addressed since the last
authorization in 2018, several of which were enumerated in the recent
NAS (National Airspace System) Safety Review Team report.
For instance, to address air traffic controller workforce
shortages, the House bill requires the FAA to hire the maximum number
of controllers and to adopt the most appropriate staffing model to meet
the system's growing needs.
The House bill also requires installation of surface surveillance
and detection technology at all medium and large hub airports to help
prevent future runway incursions.
Administrator Whitaker, I look forward to hearing your takeaways
from the NAS Safety Review Team report and what the FAA is doing to
implement its recommendations.
We must also do more to ensure all passengers can travel safely and
with dignity.
The House bill improves training for airline personnel and
contractors on assisting travelers with disabilities and mobility
devices and directs the DOT to reduce damage to wheelchairs and
mobility aids.
Administrator Whitaker--I want to hear how the FAA is working with
DOT and airlines to do more for passengers with disabilities.
Our talented U.S. workforce makes the nation's leadership in
aviation safety possible.
The House FAA reauthorization triples funding for the FAA's
aviation workforce development programs to expand the talent pipeline
to all Americans.
I look forward to hearing more on the FAA's efforts to recruit,
train and retain the expertise it needs to lead globally.
We must also provide a clear and predictable framework for American
innovators to scale new entrants safely, while ensuring the needs of
local communities are addressed.
Our bill requires the FAA to issue beyond visual line of sight
(BVLOS) requirements for drone operations--ensuring their safe
integration into our skies and creating U.S. jobs.
Administrator Whitaker, I would like to hear more about the FAA's
BVLOS rulemaking and the agency's work to ensure our airspace is ready
for such promising new technologies.
The recent Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug accident is yet another
reminder of what is at stake if we continue to delay addressing
systemic safety issues in U.S. aviation ecosystem.
That is in part why the Senate needs to move a bill forward so we
can start to negotiate a long-term FAA reauthorization to ensure that
the FAA and NTSB have the authorities and resources they need to
continue their important work.
Thank you.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you very much. I yield
back.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MICHAEL WHITAKER, ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL
AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, Chairman Graves, Chairman Graves,
Ranking Members Larsen and Cohen, and members of the
subcommittee. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to discuss
the current and future priorities of the FAA.
Our number one priority is safety. Recent events,
especially the January 5 incident involving the Boeing 737 MAX
9, have shown us we can't become complacent when it comes to
maintaining safety and public confidence in the aviation
system.
Since being sworn in as Administrator, I have focused on
addressing potential risks to the safety of our national
airspace, particularly in three areas: significant safety
events, air traffic controller hiring, and continuous safety
improvement.
Last year, we saw an uptick in significant safety events,
including runway incursions and close calls around airports. In
response, the FAA tasked an independent Safety Review Team to
look into these issues. They provided a report to me in
November, and we have already begun implementing many of those
recommendations.
To mitigate the risk of incursions, we are pursuing a range
of strategies and solutions including better data analytics,
pilot and controller outreach, improved airport signage, and
runway and taxiway redesign.
We are also committed to continued development and
deployment of technologies that enhance runway safety. We will
continue to work this issue until we reach our goal of zero
significant safety events.
The safety of the U.S. aviation system is due in large part
to the skilled and dedicated air traffic controllers who work
the system. To maintain our safety record, the agency must
accelerate the pace of recruiting, training, and hiring to meet
increasing traffic volume, while also integrating safely new
technologies and new entrants into our system.
We are taking immediate steps to grow the controller
workforce through several key initiatives. We are filling every
seat at our Air Traffic Controller Academy in Oklahoma City. We
are expanding the use of advanced training and facilities
across the country, including upgrading simulators in 95
towers. Just last week, we installed the first tower at Austin
Airport in Texas. We are working with aeronautical colleges to
move graduates quickly to on-the-job training, and we have
initiated year-round hiring for experienced controllers from
the military or from private industry.
During my first 3 months as Administrator, I met with
controllers in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and here at DC in
the tower. In those conversations, controller fatigue came up
repeatedly as a top concern, caused in large part by shifting
schedules and challenging overtime requirements. Increasing our
controller ranks will help mitigate risks associated with
controller fatigue.
Additionally, we have stood up a panel of fatigue experts
to review the latest science on sleep needs and how that can be
applied to work requirements and scheduling. We expect to
receive the panel's report later this spring.
The third priority is to continuously improve our safety
processes and procedures. For example, our Air Traffic Safety
Oversight Department now reports directly to me. This gives me
unfiltered, candid feedback on the state and quality of the
organization.
We are also exploring how the agency can improve data
accessibility and collaborate with stakeholders to collect and
analyze data across our aviation system. Data is crucial to
identifying and mitigating significant risks and emerging
safety trends. To support these efforts, I plan to hold a
discussion tomorrow with senior leadership from major U.S.
airlines on how we can share information more transparently and
improve our safety management systems.
The need to be vigilant on safety came clearly into focus
on January 5, with the incident involving Alaska Airlines
flight 1282, when the left midcabin door plug blew out of a
Boeing 737 MAX 9 shortly after departure. I want to commend the
flight and cabin crews for their professionalism and heroic
actions to ensure the safety of everyone on board during that
emergency.
Less than 24 hours following the incident, the FAA took
decisive action to ground 171 MAX 9 airplanes. We then approved
a thorough inspection and maintenance process that was
performed on each of the grounded aircraft prior to returning
to service. We have begun an audit of Boeing's production and
quality control practices, and we have informed Boeing that the
FAA will not grant any production expansion of the MAX until we
are satisfied the quality control issues uncovered during this
process are resolved.
Going forward, we will have more boots on the ground
closely scrutinizing and monitoring production and
manufacturing activities. Boeing employees are encouraged to
use our FAA hotline to report any safety concerns.
Let me stress the safety of the flying public is our
mission, and it will continue to inform our decisionmaking
going forward. I am honored to lead the FAA team of more than
45,000 dedicated employees who work every day to meet our
mission of ensuring we have the best and the safest aviation
system in the world. I am confident in our agency's ability to
address our current challenges and those that lie ahead.
I also want to confirm, as Chairman Graves alluded to, I
really commend the bipartisan effort in the House toward
completing a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. I look forward
to working with Congress as it finalizes this vital
legislation.
Thank you for your continued support of FAA, and I look
forward to answering any questions.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael Whitaker, Administrator, Federal
Aviation Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation
Chairs Graves and Graves, Ranking Members Larsen and Cohen, and
members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to be here
with you today for the first time as the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) to discuss the agency's priorities and my
initial observations within the agency.
The agency's number one priority is safety. We must continuously be
proactive, consistent, and deliberative executing our mission to
maintain and build on the agency's safety record. Since being sworn in
as the FAA Administrator on October 25, 2023, I have worked to ensure
that we remain solely focused on our mission. Upon joining the agency,
I began a process of renewed focus on potential risks to the National
Airspace System (NAS), initially targeting three specific areas: first,
significant safety events, including close calls and runway incursions,
and related safety events; second, air traffic controller workforce
issues including fatigue and the workforce shortage; and third,
continuous safety improvement.
Significant Safety Events
Close Calls, Runway Incursions, and Related Safety Events
My initial area of inquiry was around the close calls, runway
incursions, and related safety events that occurred in 2023.
Focus on these events began in March of last year when Acting
Administrator Billy Nolen convened more than 200 leaders from across
the aviation industry to examine ways to prevent future occurrences.
That summit resulted in a variety of concrete actions and a commitment
from the FAA and the aviation community to collaborate on the goal of
reaching zero significant close calls.
Following the summit, the FAA moved swiftly, taking several actions
to enhance flight safety and reduce incursions by providing more
controller training and supervision as well providing pilot and
operator outreach and training. In 2023, the FAA held over 100 runway
safety meetings at airports with control towers to identify and address
airport-specific risks. Also, the FAA tasked the Investigative
Technologies Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) to recommend new
technologies, such as cockpit alerting systems, to reduce runway safety
events. I expect the ARC to submit an interim recommendation report
later this year.
Additionally, the FAA named an independent National Airspace Safety
Review Team to examine ways to enhance safety and reliability in the
nation's air traffic system. The team examined the FAA's internal
safety processes, staffing levels, practices, facilities and equipment,
and how the agency's air traffic budget is funded. I received the
independent report on November 15, 2023. Two days later, I took
immediate action on their recommendations including several that
provide resources to assist air traffic controllers, such as deploying
tower simulator training systems in 95 facilities by December 2025. On
January 29, the agency installed the first system at Austin-Bergstrom
International Airport.
These technology investments will continue to be an effective
mechanism to enhance aviation safety, in particular, runway safety. We
are committed to continue to develop, test, and deploy technologies to
improve surface surveillance and situational awareness for controllers,
flight crews, and ground personnel through a variety of means,
including surface lighting, visual and aural alerts, and enhanced
displays. Over the last several years, the FAA has researched and
issued standards for both Runway Incursion Warning Systems (RIWS) and
Vehicle Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) emitters to
help combat Vehicle/ Pedestrian Deviations (VPDs). RIWS and vehicle
ADS-B transmitters are available for installation on airport and
airline-owned ground vehicles that regularly operate in the movement
area. These technologies enhance situational awareness for surface
operators and Air Traffic Controllers. The FAA has been actively
encouraging airports to voluntarily equip their vehicles and grants are
available through the FAA Office of Airports. As a result, there are
now over 2,100 vehicles equipped with ADS-B transmitters and over 1,000
vehicles equipped with a RIWS.
Moreover, the FAA continues to focus on airport infrastructure
improvements to address airfield geometry issues, a significant
contributing factor for many runway incursions. The Runway Incursion
Mitigation (RIM) Program is at the forefront of industry and FAA
partnerships in mitigating airport locations with a history of runway
incursions. To date, this work has achieved a 70 percent overall
reduction at more than 100 locations. Because of their high safety
impact, the FAA prioritizes funding RIM projects through its
competitive grant programs. We appreciate the funding Congress has
provided through the Airport Improvement Program, Supplemental
Discretionary Grant Program, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
achieve these critical safety improvements.
The FAA also continues to evaluate runway safety areas (RSAs) and
works with airport operators to improve RSAs that do not meet federal
standards. RSAs enhance the safety of aircraft that undershoot,
overrun, or veer off a runway. The FAA previously assessed all RSAs
serving air carrier runways at the nation's commercial airports and is
now focused on determining the RSA status of general aviation airports.
The FAA also continues to work closely with industry and other Federal
agencies to address and reduce the risks associated with wildlife
hazards.
Since the beginning of fiscal year (FY) 2023, the FAA has awarded
57 grants for runway safety projects under the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and 154 runway safety projects under the Airport
Improvement Program, totaling more than $1 billion. These projects will
install airfield lighting, signage, and markings, as well as
reconfigure and construct new taxiways to enhance safety on the
airfield.
Overall, our data shows a recent downward trend in the rate of
runway incursions. We are optimistic that our recent and ongoing work
and collaboration with industry will lead to continued safety
improvements. But to drive the number of runway incursions to zero, we
must continue to focus on and invest in this priority.
Controller Workforce
The safety of the United States aviation system is due in large
part to our skilled and dedicated air traffic controllers. To maintain
our safety record, the agency must accelerate the pace of recruiting,
training, and hiring to meet increasing volume and safely integrate new
entrants in the NAS.
The President's FY 2024 budget request includes funding for the
hiring and training of 1,800 controllers, an increase of 300
controllers as compared to the hiring level for FY 2023. This funding
also supports the continued training of the 1,500 controllers hired in
FY 2023. We have 2,716 trainees making their way through the system
right now, and nearly 1,600 of these trainees are partially certified
to work an air traffic control position, adding capacity to support
operations. The budget request will allow the FAA to continue progress
toward attaining the necessary Certified Professional Controller
staffing levels to meet current traffic demands, which have returned
to, and in some markets exceeded, pre-pandemic levels.
To increase this pipeline of new controllers, we are working with
colleges and universities in the Air Traffic-Collegiate Training
Initiative (AT-CTI) to expand their curriculums so that AT-CTI schools
can offer training that is equivalent to the FAA Academy. Once
implemented, graduates of the FAA-approved AT-CTI programs will still
need to pass the Air Traffic Skills Assessment exam, be selected for
employment by the FAA, and meet medical and security requirements. If
hired as trainees, these graduates will be able to move directly to on-
the-job training at the start of their employment instead of attending
the FAA Air Traffic Controller Academy before being assigned to a
facility as required today.
Similarly, we have launched several other initiatives to increase
controller hiring:
Initiating a year-round hiring track for experienced
controllers from the military and private industry.
Filling every seat at the FAA Academy and increasing our
classroom capacity.
Finishing the deployment of upgraded tower simulation
systems (software and hardware) in 95 facilities by December 2025. As I
mentioned earlier, the FAA deployed the first upgraded system in Austin
last month. These tower simulation systems will help address staffing
shortages by reducing time to certification by 27 percent for new hires
and 21 percent for Certified Professional Controllers in Training.
Increasing our controller ranks will help mitigate risks associated
with controller fatigue resulting from shifting schedules and excessive
overtime. During my first three months at the agency, I met with air
traffic controllers in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Washington,
D.C. to get their perspective on issues facing the workforce.
Controller fatigue came up repeatedly, which is why the agency
established a panel of fatigue experts to study the issue. The panel
will examine how the latest science on sleep needs and fatigue
considerations could be applied to controller work requirements and
scheduling. We look forward to receiving their report in the coming
weeks.
Continuous Safety Improvement
As we learned from the tragic accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 in
2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019, we must continuously
improve and reexamine processes and accepted procedures that support
our safety mission by continuing to gather and use data to detect
risks, simulate outcomes, optimize the agency's safety decision-making,
challenge our organizational structures and assumptions, and introduce
more transparency in how we do business.
My commitment to continuous improvement begins by looking
internally within the FAA and is reflected in a number of actions we
have taken over the last three months, including the following:
To further strengthen our safety culture and the
connection between the Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service (AOV) and
the ATO, and consistent with the Safety Review Team recommendations, I
realigned the AOV Executive Director to report to both the Associate
Administrator for Aviation Safety and directly to me. AOV is
responsible for directing independent, risk-based, data-driven safety
oversight of air navigation services provided by the Air Traffic
Organization. Direct, candid feedback is crucial to aviation safety,
and that is why I have provided a direct line from the person who
independently assesses the safety of air navigation services to the
Administrator.
I chartered the Mental Health and Aviation Medical
Clearances Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC). This ARC is comprised
of members of the aviation and medical communities. It is intended to
provide a forum for discussion among such communities and provide
recommendations to the FAA that break down the barriers that prevent
pilots and air traffic controllers from reporting and seeking care for
mental health issues. The same disclosure issues exist for pilots and
air traffic controllers and can impact safety. I expect the ARC to
submit its report to me this spring.
We proposed requiring certificated repair stations
located outside the United States whose employees perform safety-
sensitive maintenance functions on certain air carrier aircraft to
obtain and implement a drug and alcohol testing program. These programs
would align with the FAA and Department of Transportation (DOT)'s drug
and alcohol standards.
I am exploring how the agency can better collect and
utilize safety data. We are assessing tools, techniques, and processes
that will better identify and mitigate risk in the NAS.
Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and Boeing Production Problems
On January 5, the left mid-cabin door plug blew out of Alaska
Airlines Flight 1282. The next day, on January 6, the FAA issued an
emergency airworthiness directive grounding all 737-9 MAX aircraft with
the door plug configuration.
We then approved a thorough inspection and maintenance process that
was performed on each of the grounded aircraft before returning to
service. Our findings during inspections of those aircraft showed that
the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require
further scrutiny. That is why we are increasing oversight activities
including:
Capping expanded production of new Boeing 737 MAX
aircraft to ensure accountability and full compliance with required
quality control procedures.
Launching an investigation scrutinizing Boeing's
compliance with manufacturing requirements. The FAA will consider the
full extent of its enforcement authority to ensure the company is held
accountable for any non-compliance.
Aggressively expanding oversight of new aircraft with
increased floor presence at all Boeing facilities.
Closely monitoring data to identify and mitigate
significant safety trends and risks in the system.
Launching an analysis of potential safety-focused reforms
around quality control and delegation.
As we increase our oversight of Boeing, we also look forward to the
results of the Boeing Safety Culture Review report, which will inform
the agency regarding future action. Required by the Aircraft
Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, the review panel included
representatives from NASA, the FAA, labor unions, independent
engineering experts, air carriers, manufacturers with delegated
authority, legal experts, and others. The panel has been reviewing
thousands of documents, interviewed more than 250 Boeing employees,
managers, and executives, Boeing supplier employees, and FAA employees
and visited several Boeing sites as well as Spirit AeroSystems' (a
subcontractor for Boeing) facility in Wichita.
Let me stress: we will follow the data and take appropriate and
necessary action. The safety of the flying public will continue to
inform our decision-making. We will continue to implement the Aircraft
Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act as recent events
underscore the importance of continuously looking for ways to improve
and refine safety oversight activities.
Additionally, the FAA has been working closely with the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to support their investigation of
the incident. We will take further safety actions based on the
findings, as necessary.
National Outreach Program for Diversity and Inclusion
Before I close, I would like to address inaccurate reporting
related to the FAA's National Outreach Program for Diversity and
Inclusion. Congress enacted equal employment opportunity laws years
ago, and we comply with them. Let me be clear--all FAA employees
contribute to our safety mission. The FAA employs tens of thousands of
people for a wide range of positions, from administrative roles, like a
clerical assistant, to oversight and execution of critical safety
functions, like an air traffic controller. Like many large employers,
the agency seeks qualified candidates from as many sources as possible,
all of whom must meet rigorous qualifications that of course vary by
position. These policies go back over several bipartisan
administrations. Any statements to the contrary are misleading. The FAA
must follow the law in its hiring practices. It does and will continue
to do so as long as I am honored to lead the agency.
Closing Observations
In the three months since I have been back at the FAA, I have
reaffirmed that our employees are our most important asset. I have met
with the FAA employees who work daily to carry out the agency's
mission. I saw first-hand their professionalism and commitment, and I
hold them in the highest regard.
Notably, I began my tenure as FAA Administrator shortly before the
busiest time of the year for air travel, and 2023 was also the busiest
year for air travel ever. I saw firsthand the steadfast professionalism
of our controllers as I visited various FAA facilities during the
holiday season. They worked around the clock so that passengers were
safe from takeoff to touchdown, and it is because of them that travel
during the holiday season was notably smooth. From Sunday, December 17,
2023, to Monday, January 1, 2024, the cancellation rate was just 0.8
percent despite a record number of passengers flying during the busy
holiday season. The cancellation rate during that same period in 2022
was 8.2 percent. Taking a broader view, in 2023, there were 16.3
million flights and a cancellation rate below 1.2 percent, the lowest
rate in a decade.
I appreciate the opportunity to serve as Administrator of the FAA,
and I am confident in the FAA's ability to address the challenges
ahead. I also want to express the Administration's support for the
enactment of a long-term FAA reauthorization bill and commend the
bipartisan efforts in the House to complete this important work. I look
forward to working with Congress as it considers the Administration's
recently submitted views and finalizes the FAA reauthorization bill.
I am happy to answer any questions you may have.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Administrator. I
recognize myself for questions.
In 2020, Congress passed the Aircraft Certification,
Safety, and Accountability Act in response to design flaws
which contributed to the crashes of two Boeing 737 MAX
aircraft. One of the provisions of that bill requires aircraft
manufacturers to implement safety management systems.
Given what you have learned so far from the Alaska Airlines
flight 1282 incident and challenges that Boeing has had with
quality control, is the FAA considering further action with SMS
requirements for aircraft parts suppliers or other entities
involved in aircraft manufacturing, whether that be rulemaking,
regulatory changes, or requesting changes in the law?
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, Chairman Graves. That's a great
question.
The SMS process is really the core technology for our
safety systems. So, we have a rule now that rolls this out to
manufacturers and part 135 operators. Boeing has been
voluntarily deploying an SMS system.
One thing we have learned in this particular set of
circumstances with the Alaska flight was that we need to make
sure those SMS systems are talking to each other, and we need
to make sure we are getting all the data that we can from those
systems, and have the tools to analyze those.
To your specific question, the rule that is out there
covers manufacturers. It doesn't necessarily cover all the
component part manufacturers, but an OEM has the ability to
impose those terms by contract, and we would expect that, as
part of their safety management system, they would insist on
those types of controls with particularly key suppliers like
Spirit AeroSystems.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. And obviously, the
committee is going to be working very closely with you and NTSB
to make sure that we get this right.
Administrator, I am going to be really candid. Looking back
on what happened in the aftermath of the MAX incidents, I can't
help but think that the FAA had a lot of trouble walking and
chewing gum, candidly. I think that they really struggled with
being able to carry out all of their duties and
responsibilities.
And so, turning to drones, I want to bring up BVLOS, and I
heard Ranking Member Larsen bring it up, as well. The Beyond
Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee submitted
its final report to the FAA nearly 2 years ago. While I don't
think it was perfect, I think it's a pretty good roadmap on how
to move forward. Can you give some projection for what the
aviation industry should be expecting in that regard?
Mr. Whitaker. I think there has been a lot of interaction
with stakeholders over BVLOS. And I know, from my roles before
taking this position, there has been some frustration on how
quickly that might be moving. We do expect to have the NPRM out
this year, so, it is a priority, and we will continue to push
that forward.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I can't emphasize enough how
important I think it is for the FAA to be able to manage all of
its various functions to maintain the certainty and
predictability that these new entrants need into market, while
we are also continuing to advance our gold standard of safety
in the United States.
Last question.
Mr. Whitaker. I agree with that.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. Administrator, there
are provisions in the 2016 FAA bill and 2018 FAA bill that have
not been fully implemented yet. Here we are, advancing a 900-
page, 2023 or 2024 FAA authorization bill.
The House and Senate bills have a number of identical
provisions. While it's very difficult to improve upon the
perfection, the Senate is trying to add some new things. I want
to hear from you. What is the FAA doing to ensure that they are
going to hit the ground running, be able to comply with and
implement this bill in a manner that is as urgent as the law is
in regard to addressing a number of the safety and new entrant
and passenger experience issues that we have solved in the
legislation?
Mr. Whitaker. So, what I can say is, I can commit to you
that, when this bill passes, we will work hard to work together
to have work plans on all of these various initiatives, and
communicate with you on our expectations as far as when we can
meet those.
So, I think what we can do is make sure we have good, open
communication about how we will execute on the provisions of
that bill.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Administrator, in my 30 seconds
here I am just going to say that as much blood, sweat, and
tears as the folks up here, the aviation team, has gone through
over the past few years in putting this legislation together,
striving to reach bipartisan consensus, and addressing many of
the urgent issues in the aviation industry, I am hopeful that
the FAA will treat the implementation with the same urgency as
we have in putting the legislation together.
Mr. Whitaker. We will, and we appreciate that effort. We
welcome this bill.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. I recognize Ranking
Member Cohen for 5 minutes.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you sir.
Mr. Administrator, what parts of the production oversight
and quality assurance of Boeing airplanes are considered
delegated by the FAA to the manufacturer?
And how does the FAA oversee Boeing representatives when
they are performing those delegated functions?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, there are a couple of answers to that
question.
One, we have tasked MITRE to actually look sort of at a
technical level on where the delegations are and what our
options are with respect to delegation.
Quality control and quality assurance are a key function
for a manufacturer, so, it normally falls within the purview of
that manufacturer, although there is no reason to not have
those types of functions done by a third party. So, I think
that is something we want to look at, as well.
At a macro level, I think with manufacturing, there has
been an oversight approach that has focused heavily on audit,
checking the paperwork to make sure it is correct and making
sure the systems are in place. We are migrating to a system
that is, I would call, ``audit plus.'' So, we are going to have
more of a surveillance component, much like you would find on
the flight line or in maintenance stations where inspectors are
actually on the ground talking to people and looking at the
work that is being done.
So, we are proposing at this point to expand the oversight
approach to include both audit and inspection, which is why we
are moving inspectors into the facilities.
Mr. Cohen. I presume we look at what has been done around
the world and get best practices on all these things.
Mr. Whitaker. Well, we like to think that we are the best
practices, and----
Mr. Cohen . I like to think that, too.
Mr. Whitaker . We want to----
Mr. Cohen . And we may be, but Airbus kind of
claims that they are doing pretty good.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes. We do pay attention to what others are
doing. I think, in this case, I think we know what we need to
do next, which is to have more on-the-ground presence to verify
what's going on.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir. The committee passed into law
the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act,
which was a direct response to the MAX 8 crashes. Can you
provide an update to us on what the FAA's implementation of
that has been, particularly the sections we highlighted in the
letter that we sent you last week?
Mr. Whitaker. I can. The sections that you specifically
highlighted, we have completed much of that work.
You highlighted section 102 around SMS. So, that rule has
been pushed out, and SMS systems are being deployed.
The culture survey of section 103 is due within a month. We
are very much looking forward to getting that data around
Boeing's safety culture. That will inform some of our
adjustments to the risk model approach.
We have updated the ODA policy under 107. We have completed
standing up the EC and SC for compliance under 122 and 125,
incorporated the ODA best practices into our process.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir, and I would like to take two of
my pet issues, which are also important issues to, I think,
everybody on the committee, and that is evacuation of airplanes
in the required 90 seconds and also seat size that is safe for
people to ingress and egress.
We have passed laws to say that they had to do a study on
seat size and on evacuation. And what they did on evacuation
was embarrassingly poor and didn't have a model of what an
aircraft looks like and the passengers. It had nobody over, I
think, 60 years of age, and nobody under 7 or 8 or whatever.
And they claim that was for liability purposes. Well, that's
hooey. And they also didn't have any dogs on there, and
packages, or people with disabilities et cetera, et cetera.
There were 26,000 comments in response to that SEAT Act
that the FAA requested public comments of--26,000 comments.
Considering the request closed in November 1 of 2022, when can
we expect the FAA to issue a final rule on the issue of seat
dimensions?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I am familiar with the work that has gone
on around that and those comments. I think it is important for
us to make the distinction between what might be economic
regulation and what is a safety regulation. So, a lot of the
comments focused on more ``I want more leg room'' type of
comments versus safety provisions, but we are taking all those
comments into account.
Typically, with evacuations, the problems tend to be piling
up at the exits, rather than getting out of the seats. So, we
have had trouble identifying issues around difficulty with
seats. It tends to be piling up on the exits. But all of that
information has been considered, and we will certainly take
your feedback as well, sir.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you. I have got to close out, but I
appreciate your giving serious consideration to getting this
done. Seat size does have to do with getting out of the plane,
and if you are crowded in there, and you have got somebody next
to you that is physically challenged because of girth, it makes
it difficult to get out, and I can't imagine people doing--in
Japan, it was 18 minutes. So, if you work on this 90 seconds,
work on the seat size, realize safety and comfort can be the
same.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, sir.
Mr. Cohen. I yield back.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. The chairman
is going to defer to Mr. Perry for 5 minutes.
Mr. Perry. I thank the chairman. Thank you, Administrator
Whitaker. I am going to start out with a couple of perfunctory
questions here.
Would you agree that the Airport Improvement Program Grant
Assurance, ``19: Operation and Maintenance,'' requires the
following--I am going to read this right out of the manual
here--``The airport and all facilities which are necessary to
serve the aeronautical users of the airport, other than
facilities owned or controlled by the United States, shall be
operated at all times in a safe and serviceable condition and
in accordance with the minimum standards . . . for maintenance
and operation. It will not cause or permit any activity or
action thereon which would interfere with its use for airport
purposes.'' Do you agree with that? I mean, it is out of the
manual.
Mr. Whitaker. I mean, I am not familiar with it by word,
but sounds----
Mr. Perry . OK, yes, it sounds right.
Mr. Whitaker. I take your word for that.
Mr. Perry. OK. So, would you also agree that the FAA
Airport Compliance Manual, ``Section 22.6, Request for Interim
Use of Aeronautical Property for Other Uses,'' generally
requires the FAA to approve the use of airport facilities for
nonaeronautical purposes and, in fact, it explicitly states
that the FAA approval shall not be granted if the FAA
determines that an aeronautical demand is likely to exist
within the period of interim use?
Mr. Whitaker. I believe that is accurate. That is my
understanding.
Mr. Perry. Yes, it is right out of the manual. I will give
it to you if you want to see it.
So, these documents from the FAA make it abundantly clear
that airports are restricted in their ability to use their
facilities for nonaeronautical purposes. And when they are
doing that, or when they are requesting so, they must receive
FAA approval. The restrictions are in place to protect the
flying public and the safety, but also to protect the
investment that taxpayers have made in federally funded
airports.
Yet, I will tell you, I have seen a disturbing trend in
cities choosing to use their airports--such as Chicago O'Hare,
Midway, Boston's Logan--as facilities to house illegal foreign
nationals brought here by the administration's--well, I am
going to say ``failure'' to enforce the immigration laws on the
books. And that clearly falls, in my mind, into the category of
nonaeronautical use.
Now, my question to you is, has the FAA approved any
request to use airports to house illegal foreign nationals?
Mr. Whitaker. So, to your explanation, the FAA does have a
role in----
Mr. Perry . I know it does, but I am just
asking if you have approved--you are the Administrator. Has the
FAA approved any requests to house illegal foreign nationals?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I am going to answer that if you will let
me.
Mr. Perry. OK.
Mr. Whitaker. Because my understanding is----
Mr. Perry . I just want to use the time
efficiently here.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes. So, the FAA does approve requests for
community use, whatever the category. There is a huge number of
categories for community use, and our criteria is whether it
interrupts aeronautical uses or is otherwise disruptive----
Mr. Perry . So, how many----
Mr. Whitaker . Or whether there is a----
Mr. Perry . How many requests have been
approved for housing illegal foreign nationals?
Mr. Whitaker. My understanding is there has been one
airport that has made that request.
Mr. Perry. So, the others that I mentioned--well, was the
one that made the request any of the ones that I mentioned?
Mr. Whitaker. I believe it was--it was either Kennedy or
O'Hare. I can't remember for sure.
Mr. Perry. OK, so, it could be O'Hare, but then it wouldn't
be Midway or Logan, yet they are housing illegal foreign
nationals at the airport.
Did the FAA make the required determination that no
aeronautical demand is likely to exist?
This is an airport, and I am reading right from your
regulation here, chapter 22.6. Did the FAA make that
determination?
Mr. Whitaker. The determination was that it did not
interfere with aeronautical uses.
Mr. Perry. So, in that case, I guess, the FAA won't enforce
its grant assurances, which it says right here, literally on
number one, ``These assurances shall be complied with in
performance of grant agreements for airport development,
airport planning, noise compatibility program, grants for
airport sponsors.''
So, the Federal Government is paying for it. They make the
agreement, agree to it, and then don't follow it. And the FAA
is not going to do anything about it.
I want to yield some time to a friend, but let me just ask
this question. How does walling off portions of the airport to
house unvetted illegal foreign nationals, which passengers in
America have to walk beside--these are unvetted, illegal
foreign nationals--how does that promote safety or utility or
efficiency in these airports?
Mr. Whitaker. I think you are out of my area of expertise.
I am not familiar with that circumstance.
Mr. Perry. I think that answers the question. I am going to
yield some time to my good friend from Texas, Mr. Nehls.
Mr. Nehls. I thank you, sir.
Mr. Administrator, I am going to reference a letter dated
February 5, 2024, to the Honorable Maria Cantwell and Honorable
Ted Cruz. Are you familiar with this letter on February 5 that
you sent?
Mr. Whitaker. I am not sure what the topic is.
Mr. Nehls. OK, I am going to make sure, because I have only
got--I am going to make sure that you get a copy of this letter
so when it comes to me--I have a lot of questions regarding
this letter.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. The gentleman yields
back. I recognize the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.
Larsen, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you. Thank you,
Administrator, for coming today, helping us out on some things.
The first question I had, in your testimony, you mentioned
the hotline that workers can call, as well as a whistleblower
hotline. Do you have that phone number? Can you, for the
record, state what it is? Can you remind folks where they can
go in order to make that call?
Mr. Whitaker. We have a link on our website, so, faa.gov,
where you can go find access to that hotline. We have also set
up a specific hotline for Boeing employees, which we have had
communicated out at the factory so they can reach us directly.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Is that on faa.gov, as well?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes. Yes, it is.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. So, for Boeing employees, they
can go to faa.gov right now if they have any concerns?
Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Is that a confidential
communication?
Mr. Whitaker. It is run through a very confidential
process. We have a group that focuses on whistleblowers to make
sure identity is protected and that appropriate actions are
taken.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you very much. I know FAA
has chosen to put inspectors in the facilities. Does that
include in Spirit, as well?
Mr. Whitaker. We do have inspectors in Spirit, as well,
yes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. And that's new. And can you
give us a range of the numbers of people that you have deployed
into the Boeing and Spirit facilities?
Mr. Whitaker. I think we have about two dozen at Boeing and
maybe a half a dozen at Spirit.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. And can you give an
indication of whether you think that will be permanent? Is this
going to be short-term? How long does this last? Is it part of
what you need to be doing as part of a permanent solution?
Mr. Whitaker. So, we are undertaking a 6-week audit. So, we
are in the middle of that now. And that audit will give us
guidance on where we need to go.
I think we are also going to look at this culture survey
that is due at the end of the month, and then make a
determination of how many folks we need on the ground in both
places. So, we haven't made that determination, but I do
anticipate we will want to keep people on the ground there. So,
we don't know how many yet, but we do think that presence will
be warranted.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Do you have any initial thoughts
on the impact of the MAX 9 accident and its influence in your
decisionmaking about ODA authorities and how much to pull back
from Boeing at this time?
Mr. Whitaker. I think the events of January 5, it really
created two issues for us. One, what's wrong with this
airplane? But two, what's going on with the production at
Boeing?
And there have been issues in the past, and they don't seem
to be getting resolved. So, we feel like we need to have a
heightened level of oversight to really get after that. So, it
was certainly triggered by the MAX 9, yes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. But nothing--no permanent
decision yet about removing some authority from the ODA
organization at Boeing?
Mr. Whitaker. No----
Mr. Larsen of Washington . On a permanent
basis?
Mr. Whitaker . No permanent decisions. I mean,
we have tasked MITRE to give us a view on what the options are.
I have heard a Boeing CEO mention an option for third-party
quality control. So, I think it's important that we look at all
options on the table and understand how do we make changes that
are going to give us a different result than we've had.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, thanks. I want to move a
little bit more to the FAA bill that we passed.
I jokingly asked you ahead of time if--I was going to ask
you if it was a great bill or greatest bill, but we really want
to impress upon the Senate how important this is to get--they
are trying to get it done, but how important it is to get a
final bill done.
Is there anything in that bill--can you talk to anything in
that bill that you would have needed ahead of this--ahead of
January 5, or do you have everything that you need, at least
for this particular investigation?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, I guess I will make two comments. One
is, we really appreciate the effort on the bill because it
creates a huge amount of disruption to not have it. So, the
constant running up against deadlines, I have only been there 3
months, and I have probably had a dozen meetings on what
happens if there is a shutdown, what happens if we don't have
authorization. So, it does create a lot of uncertainty for us.
I don't see anything in particular that--it is possible I
will come back in 6 months and tell you that we need something.
I think we are going to need more boots on the ground, we are
going to need more inspectors. We don't have that many
inspectors on the aircraft certification side of the house, so,
that will be an addition of manpower. But we haven't scoped
that, and I think we can do it within our current authorities
as long as we can find the funds for it.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, great. So, I did outline
some of the issues in the 2023 bill on accessibility, on BVLOS,
a few other things, and we will just get back to you with those
for the record----
Mr. Whitaker . Great.
Mr. Larsen of Washington . As well, but thanks
for coming up. I appreciate it.
And I yield back.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ranking Member Larsen.
Chairman Westerman is going to defer, and we are going to
recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Mast.
Mr. Mast. Thank you, Chairman, Administrator. I want to
talk a little bit about training and air traffic controllers,
and I want to go back to November.
You announced that the FAA would expand Collegiate Training
Initiative, also known as CTI, and those programs to harness
specifically the underutilized capacity among college programs
that meet the FAA's equivalent levels of safety to help train
air traffic controllers--we all know that's something that we
need--and help address that shortage of potentially 3,000,
maybe more, maybe a little less, air traffic controllers,
certified controllers.
And my question is, I want you to bring us up to speed on
what the FAA has done since November to implement a new
enhanced CTI program. What's being done?
Mr. Whitaker. So, we have done a--what we are trying to do
is make sure that these schools are duplicating the curriculum
that we teach at the Academy. So, we have put some definition
around what that curriculum is, and also looking at what
physical tools they need. So, flight simulators, tower
simulators, things of that nature to put together a very clear
curriculum.
And my goal is to make sure that in the academic year 2024-
2025 we are actually executing on this, so that we start to see
graduates from those schools come directly into FAA to be
controllers. The immediacy of the issue is why we are pushing
so hard. So, of the couple dozen CTI schools out there, we are
hoping to have at least half of them able to start training
students beginning in the fall.
Mr. Mast. Do you see new programs opening up as a result of
your efforts?
Mr. Whitaker. I would like to see that. It hasn't been our
initial focus. We are trying to work with the schools that are
already sort of set into that space, but I don't see any reason
why other schools, particularly those with a technical bent,
can't have this program, as well.
Mr. Mast. OK, that is the extent of my questioning today.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank
you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Mast. I recognize
the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and to the
Administrator, thank you for being here, for coming to speak to
us today, your first hearing before this committee.
Americans are upset. They have a right to be upset. Last
month, door plugs failed on a 737 MAX 9 and caused a door plug
to fly off mid-flight. Thank God no one was seriously injured
in this accident. But make no mistake, this was a close call,
too close. The incident, along with reports of near-misses of
planes colliding as they depart and arrive at America's
airports in the past year, is concerning and, frankly,
unacceptable to all of us on this committee.
We need to pass a comprehensive Federal Aviation
Administration reauthorization bill that's currently sitting in
the United States Senate to give the FAA and this Administrator
the tools they need to enforce safety rules and prevent
catastrophe. In this very committee, we crafted a strong,
bipartisan, 5-year FAA bill, and the House passed it nearly
unanimously. We did our job, and now the Senate needs to do
theirs as quickly as possible.
Mr. Whitaker, as the FAA Administrator, you are the head of
aviation oversight and safety. I want to underscore what the
ranking member has discussed here today in terms of oversight,
particularly on production facility inspections, a crucial part
of making sure our planes are safe. Section 521 of the House
FAA reauthorization calls for the FAA to update the risk model
used to inform frequency of these inspections, but we have
problems right now.
Can you, in a couple of sentences, explain how the agency
determines the frequency of these inspections and what impact
these inspections have on production?
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir. The agency uses a risk model
with respect to manufacturers that--it is a fairly uniform
survey to identify the level of risk. And so, how many
inspections would be driven by that. That model will likely
evolve based on the rollout of SMS systems, which should reduce
risk and give us better insight into what's happening, and also
in the case of Boeing, based on the culture survey that we
expect to receive later this month.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. I want to address another issue
that was touched upon by our ranking member, and that is the
recent trend of mishandled or damaged wheelchairs of aviation
passengers.
This recent trend of mishandled or damaged wheelchair
incidents by commercial airlines raises serious concerns about
the systemic barriers for passengers with disabilities. How is
the FAA working to prevent these incidents and improve
accessibility for air travel for people with disabilities?
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir. The DOT has a large role in
this related to how customers are treated on aircraft. So, we
work very closely in supporting DOT to make sure accessibility
is an option and that innovations can happen to make sure that
is enabled.
Mr. Stanton. OK. It is an important issue for us. You are
going to hear a lot more from this committee on it.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, sir.
Mr. Stanton. We need to up our game, if you will, in terms
of improving the travel experience.
On near-misses I mentioned, in response to the recent trend
of runway near-misses at some U.S. airports, the House-passed
FAA reauthorization would expand ground surveillance and
detection equipment at large and medium-hub airports. How would
increasing the deployment of this technology help air traffic
controllers and flightcrews?
Mr. Whitaker. I think these near-misses are one of those
areas where there is a lot of ability to have tailored
solutions for each airport. Every airport is different, it has
its own challenges. But a lot of these surface awareness
technologies or tools in the tower can really make the
difference and create awareness to avoid these types of
mishaps.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you so much. In my remaining time,
Administrator, I want to give a thank you. I want to thank you
and the FAA for the collaborative partnership in helping
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport expand its infrastructure to
accommodate extraordinary growth.
Gateway Airport is the busiest contract air traffic control
tower in the region and contributes nearly $2 billion to our
regional economy. They recently completed their new Terminal
South Concourse, due in part to $14.4 million in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funds. A ribbon cutting will be held in a
couple of weeks. The cooperation between the FAA and our
Arizona delegation in Congress has been crucial to this growth,
and I look forward to a continued strong working partnership to
implement innovative ways to increase capacity at Gateway.
With that, I thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Stanton. I
recognize the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Westerman, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Chairman Graves. Thank you,
Administrator Whitaker--over here.
I want to follow up with my colleague Mr. Perry's line of
questioning. I know your whole testimony was basically about
safety, and we all want safe airports, and Mr. Perry read to
you from the manual about how a nonaeronautical purpose for an
airport has to be approved by the FAA, and you stated that only
one airport had approval to be used for the nonaeronautical
purpose of housing migrants. Would you like to correct that
answer, or is that the answer you want to stick by?
Mr. Whitaker. To my knowledge--and this is not an issue
that--I have only been there 3 months, it is not an issue I
have spent much time on, but to my knowledge, there was only
one application.
It's also my understanding that applications are only
involved if it is behind security. So, other properties on
airports don't come through our office for approval. It's
really just behind security properties.
Mr. Westerman. So, it's well documented that many airports
have been used for this purpose. So, do you think these
airports are in violation of any Federal law, or do you think
they found a way around that?
Mr. Whitaker. I assume they are in compliance. I have not
heard otherwise, but our role is to make sure that the proper
procedures are followed.
Mr. Westerman. This is an issue that I didn't think we
would have to deal with in Congress. I chair the Committee on
Natural Resources, and we have got a similar issue with
National Park Service land where the administration has
approved use of National Park Service land to build migrant
shelters, which--that's kind of crazy that you would think that
that would even be an issue. But it has happened.
And in researching the process how that happens, it appears
that maybe Secretary Mayorkas had a lot more to do with that
than even the DOI Secretary. Are you aware of any meetings
between Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Buttigieg to discuss
issues of using FAA or using airports to house migrants?
Mr. Whitaker. I am not aware of any, no.
Mr. Westerman. Are you aware of any meetings between other
DOT or DHS officials to discuss this issue?
Mr. Whitaker. I am not.
Mr. Westerman. Have you been in any meetings regarding
this, or phone calls?
Mr. Whitaker. Just getting briefed for this hearing.
Otherwise, I have not had any meetings.
Mr. Westerman. So, is this--we sent a letter, Chairman
Graves, chairman of the full committee, I think 60-some-odd
Members signed the letter last November asking about this
issue. And as of today, we have still received no response. I
know you are new, but why do you think we would be getting
delayed on a response on this issue?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't know, but I am happy to follow up
afterwards, sir.
Mr. Westerman. So, you will follow up. Will you follow up
with Secretary Buttigieg, as well?
Mr. Whitaker. I will follow up on the status of the letter,
and I will let you know.
Mr. Westerman. All right. It's amazing that this is
something that has been very well documented in the news, and
there seems to be no response from the administration. And
you--I know you are new, again, but you have no real knowledge
of what's going on here or the rules associated with it. So,
yes, if you would, follow up with Secretary Buttigieg and tell
him we are still waiting for his response.
And Mr. Chairman, I yield back--Mr. Chairman, I yield my
time remaining time to Mr. Nehls.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The gentleman from Texas is
recognized.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So, Mr. Administrator, you received--did you look at that
letter that I referenced that was dated February 5? You sent it
to Cantwell and Ted Cruz.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, I have that.
Mr. Nehls. All right. Did you write that letter?
Mr. Whitaker. Did I write the letter?
Mr. Nehls. Yes, sir.
Mr. Whitaker. No, it was drafted for me.
Mr. Nehls. It was drafted for you. Who drafted it for you?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't know. It went through a process, as
this issue was developed internally to respond to requests for
technical assistance on various issues----
Mr. Nehls . OK.
Mr. Whitaker . With the reauth bill.
Mr. Nehls. Is this letter the official position of the FAA,
to oppose raising the mandatory retirement age without a study
beforehand?
Mr. Whitaker. The official position is that we don't have a
position on the retirement age, but if it changes, we would
like to have data to support the change.
Mr. Nehls. OK. So, I want to be clear. So, for everybody
listening, the FAA, the Administrator, does not have an
official position on whether Congress--we passed it in the
House--should raise the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67.
Mr. Whitaker. Our role has been to identify issues around
that, and we have identified two, one about international
compliance and then one about understanding the data of
changing the age from 65 to 67.
Mr. Nehls. Did ALPA influence your decision to write this
letter? Did ALPA have any influence in the drafting of this
letter, yes or no?
Mr. Whitaker. Not that I am aware of.
Mr. Nehls. OK. I will yield.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The gentleman yields back. My
friend from Kansas, Ms. Davids, is recognized for questions.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. Thank you to Chairman
Garret Graves and to Ranking Member Cohen for this hearing
today, and thank you also to Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking
Member Larsen for their leadership on passing a commonsense,
bipartisan reauthorization of the Federal Aviation
Administration in the House last year.
Mr. Whitaker, welcome to the Aviation Subcommittee, and
thank you for taking the time to be here. I do believe your
experience and leadership will be invaluable at the FAA. I
would like you to address an issue that's affecting the
National Airspace System, which is aging infrastructure and
functional obsolescence.
The failure of the FAA's NOTAM system in January of 2023
highlights the risk to the flying public when aging, safety
critical aviation infrastructure isn't replaced in a timely
way. And sadly, the FAA now operates and maintains one of the
oldest collections of safety critical aviation infrastructure
in the world. One such system in the NAS desperately in need of
replacement is ILS, or instrument landing systems.
There is a map up there. I have got one here. This ILS map
demonstrates just how many 1970s-era Mark 1F systems are in
operation in the NAS. The FAA has more than 1,200 ILS systems
located at hundreds of airports across the country.

Slide: Map of 1970s-Era Instrument Landing Systems in Operation in the
National Airspace System, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Sharice
Davids
Ms. Davids of Kansas. The ILS is the only system approved
by FAA to support all-weather landings at the Nation's busiest
airports. As such, these systems are required to remain in
operation for the foreseeable future. However, the vast
majority of these safety-critical systems were placed into
service in the 1970s and 1980s and are now functionally
obsolete. In Kansas alone, 17 of the 21 systems, which is 81
percent, are functionally obsolete.
This body passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law more
than 2 years ago with a set-aside of $5 billion to replace
these aging systems. But the FAA told industry leaders and
members of this committee that modernization of these systems
wasn't an eligible expense under the program.
Then-Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Larsen and I
subsequently engaged in a colloquy on the floor on December 9
of 2021, which is shown here, expressing congressional intent
that this was, in fact, an eligible expense.

Slide: Hon. Davids' and Hon. Larsen's Colloquy on House Floor, December
9, 2021, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Sharice Davids
Ms. Davids of Kansas. This colloquy was shared with U.S.
DOT, again, on August 17, 2022, when Mr. Larsen and I noticed
that there was no money directed in the fiscal year 2023 FAA
spend plan for replacement of these systems. We asked for a
timeline and budget detailing specific allocation of IIJA
resources to landing and navigational aids equipment for fiscal
years 2022 through 2026, which you can see here.

Slide: Letter of August 17, 2022, to DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg from
Hon. Davids and Hon. Larsen, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Sharice
Davids
Ms. Davids of Kansas. The response we received, which is up
now, contained none of the information that we asked for.

Slide: Letter of December 9, 2022, to Hon. Sharice Davids from DOT
Office of the Secretary, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Sharice
Davids
Ms. Davids of Kansas. In followup conversations with FAA,
we have yet to receive a satisfactory response as to why the
acquisition and modernization of these systems has lagged. In
fact, several taxpayer-funded instrument landing systems--there
are 14 of them--are sitting in a cave in Independence,
Missouri, simply waiting to be installed. At the FAA's current
pace of modernization, which is about four to five systems per
year, it would take more than 100 years to replace these
systems. This means that FAA expects many of these safety
critical systems to be in operation, despite being over 100
years old.
I can't imagine that's actually the expectation. And just
so we are clear what system failure looks like, the most likely
impact on these airports is on capacity, on throughput, and
delays. When an ILS is out, runways can't be used for all-
weather operations. But there is also this inherent safety
risk, should a system fail in the middle of landing operations.
So, Mr. Whitaker, what is the FAA's schedule for deploying
these devices systemwide?
And as you might be aware, the professional aviation safety
specialists have proposed a pilot program for deploying these
systems within 18 months. And I am curious if, to your
knowledge, is the FAA considering that proposal?
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. You have hit on a
very interesting issue at the FAA, which is how we fund
facilities, equipment, and particularly--we are in a situation
now where we have a lot of redundant systems in the NAS and
facilities. We have facilities that need to be replaced, as
well.
With respect to this particular issue, my understanding is
that that infrastructure funding is available for deployment of
those ILS systems, specifically the ones that you mentioned
that are in storage. So, my understanding is that that will be
deployed, those funds will be used to begin deploying those
systems.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Do you have a timeline?
Mr. Whitaker. I can certainly respond to your office with
some specifics on the timelines.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. OK. And I would very much like a
specific response, given the length of time that this has been
going on. The bipartisan infrastructure bill gave us a 5-year
timeline, and we are over 2 years in.
I yield back.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ms. Davids. I recognize
the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Administrator Whitaker, thanks for being with us and
congratulations.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Whitaker, how many positions are there at
the FAA?
Mr. Whitaker. How many positions? Well, we have 45,000
employees.
Mr. Stauber. 45,000. And what percentage of those positions
are filled?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have an exact position number for
you.
Mr. Stauber. Is the COVID emergency over?
Mr. Whitaker. I believe so, yes.
Mr. Stauber. Yes, May 11th, President Biden declared the
emergency over.
I understand you use a hybrid telework model. Is that
correct?
Mr. Whitaker. It depends on the function. So, obviously,
our controllers are all on the job, but other employees are
still in a hybrid situation.
Mr. Stauber. How many days a week do the employees have to
show up in a 2-week work period?
Mr. Whitaker. The policy--again, it depends on the employee
and the job description, but the baseline is 4 days.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes. So, 4 days your employees have to, in a
2-week period, show up, 4 days. What if the air traffic
controllers only showed up 4 days in their work week? Would it
affect commercial, general aviation?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, as I mentioned, they show up every day
for their jobs.
Mr. Stauber. I understand that. What I am trying to get at
is what if our controllers just showed up 4 days out of a 2-
week work period----
Mr. Whitaker . Yes.
Mr. Stauber . Four days, would that interrupt
our work?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, they can't control traffic from home--
--
Mr. Stauber . I understand that.
Mr. Whitaker . So, it certainly would.
Mr. Stauber. You know what I am getting at. If they only
showed up--would it be a problem for our airports and general
aviation, commercial aviation across our country? Yes or no.
Mr. Whitaker. Of course.
Mr. Stauber. How do you track employee accessibility and
productivity in this hybrid model?
Mr. Whitaker. It's up to individual managers to manage
their workforce to meet the needs of their mission.
Mr. Stauber. I can just tell you, from what I am hearing
from stakeholders, is that accessibility to FAA staff is
limited, and it seems evident that productivity is waning as
several high-profile rulemakings are still ongoing. And you
know this, the rule for regular Beyond Visual Line of Sight
operation of unmanned aircraft systems, that final report, was
concluded in March of 2022, and now it is not expected until
August of 2024.
I know workplace flexibility is an important recruiting
tool in our new world. However, as an agency with a safety
mission first, do you find that a 2-day in-person work week is
rather low?
Mr. Whitaker. Again, it depends on the job position. So,
many of our employees--not only controllers, but inspectors--
need to be in place. But others, it may work for working
remotely, so, I think it depends on the position.
Mr. Stauber. Administrator Whitaker, I believe that the FAA
should hold itself to a higher standard, and the FAA's telework
schedule requires--again, they are only in person 2 days--or
correction, 4 days----
Mr. Whitaker . Per pay period.
Mr. Stauber . Out of a 2-week work period, and
I would just like to point out again our controllers are
working a lot of hours, a lot of pressure on them to keep our
flying public safe.
And speaking of controllers, the National Airspace System
Safety Review Team concluded that, under the FAA's most recent
controller workforce plan submitted to Congress, when
retirements and other attrition is accounted for, the hiring
plan produces a negligible improvement over today's
understaffed levels, resulting in a net increase of fewer than
200 aircraft controllers by 2032.
This is extremely concerning for safety and the efficiency
of the aviation system. Can you reassure the committee that the
FAA will prioritize this issue, conduct maximum hiring of new
controllers, and continue to request adequate resources from
Congress to address the problem?
Mr. Whitaker. I can. Yes, sir.
Mr. Stauber. And I understand that the FAA has committed to
maximum controller hiring for only fiscal years 2024, 2025, and
2026. Will the FAA commit to a longer term maximum hiring
posture, since it will take a lot longer than just 3 years for
max hiring to return to healthy controller staffing levels?
Mr. Whitaker. We certainly commit to max hiring until we
get healthy.
What we have done is we have--there are competing staffing
models at play, so, we have commissioned the Transportation
Research Board to review those models. So, within 3 years, we
will have a new model in place, and I will set those goals.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you. The last question: Will you
prioritize and support general aviation like you do commercial,
and will you support rural airport investment and
infrastructure?
Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you. And again, congratulations.
Mr. Whitaker. Thanks.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Stauber. I
recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Garcia.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chairman, and welcome,
Administrator Whitaker.
As you know, Boeing recently withdrew its request for the
MAX 7 to receive a safety exemption, which would have allowed
the aircraft to be certified with a known defect if granted. As
you know, Boeing's fleet of MAX aircraft have an anti-ice
system issue that could cause the nacelle, the pods surrounding
the engine, to break and fall off in certain conditions. This
could have potentially catastrophic consequences.
Boeing is now working on a long-term fix that will require
retrofitting the entire MAX fleet. How did the FAA, in your
understanding, fail to detect such a defect during the
certification of the MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft?
Mr. Whitaker. So, my understanding on that particular issue
is that that potential defect was discovered in--during--using
computer modeling some years after the original certification
of the aircraft, modeling that was required by the ACSAA
legislation, actually. But that is my understanding of how that
was discovered.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. While I appreciate the FAA's
attention to this topic, Boeing has demonstrated time and time
again that it will cut corners on safety in order to maximize
profits.
My second question, Administrator, is this: In response to
the recent Alaska Airlines accident, the FAA has launched an
investigation into Boeing's compliance with manufacturing
requirements. Has the FAA comprehensively engaged with employee
groups, those involved in the production, and those who have
filed whistleblower reports regarding reduction of quality
assurance procedures in the manufacturing system?
And if so, how is the FAA handling these reports?
Mr. Whitaker. So, on the engagement aspect, we now have 20
inspectors on the ground in Boeing, engaging with the employees
in every phase of the manufacturing process. And so, this is to
allow us to have direct conversations with employees about what
pressures they might be feeling, or what instructions they are
getting, and what incentives they are dealing with.
On the whistleblower, we dedicated a portal for Boeing
employees, but we also have a normal portal for whistleblowers.
And we have a pretty regimented process on how we deal with
those reports to make sure the identity is protected and the
reports are taken seriously.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Should I take that to mean that
there is currently engagement with those employees?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, sir.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you. Of course, I look
forward to working with the FAA to hold our aviation community
to a higher standard of safety.
It is equally crucial for the operation of our aviation
industry that their airport workers are paid livable wages.
Airport workers are largely Latino, Black, and immigrant
workforce. They have been overlooked and underpaid for the
vital role that they play in keeping our airports running. My
bill, the Good Jobs for Good Airports Act, would change that.
Administrator, are you committed to doing what you can to
ensure that the airports that the FAA oversees are delivering
fair wages and benefits to all employees?
Mr. Whitaker. I am very committed to making sure that they
have a very safe working environment. Safety is my mandate, and
we are focused on safety at airports, particularly on the ramp.
So, we have taken some initiatives around that to make sure
that those employees are in a safe environment.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, and I yield back, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Garcia. I recognize
the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Van Drew.
Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Chairman.
Welcome, Mr. Whitaker.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir.
Dr. Van Drew. You know, you've got a tiger by the tail. I
was going to speak on something else, and I am, in a moment,
but using airports for housing undocumented, that's a big deal.
It's a big deal to the communities these airports are in. It's
a big deal fiscally. It's a big deal for safety. And I know you
are new, so, I want to be fair, but we need you to drill down
and tell us more what's going on. Please check thoroughly on
this issue. I think it's a totally inappropriate use. Safety is
our number-one issue. It was never meant for housing, any of
these airports.
There was a plan--and this is fact--it was leaked out by a
whistleblower, 10 different airports that they were going to
house illegals in. Of course, we got a hold of it. And Atlantic
City International Airport in my district, they were talking
about housing up to 60,000 illegals in a community of 35,000 to
40,000 people. That's wrong.
So, I need some commitments from you to thoroughly drill
down on this issue to know how many airports are involved, a
complete list of airports that are involved, a policy coming
from the FAA. We need a policy from the FAA dealing with these
requests, and ensuring that the FAA is part of the process in
determining if, where, and when this is going to be done, and
we need a complete list of requests and from whom it came.
I brought this up to Secretary Buttigieg when he was here.
He wasn't aware of it. Of course, we have the information. I
need you to do that. I would appreciate if you would get that
information back to me and the entire committee. Could you
commit to getting us that information?
Mr. Whitaker. I can commit to making sure that we are
complying with the law around any approvals.
Dr. Van Drew. Mr. Whitaker, I appreciate that, but we
really need----
Mr. Whitaker . We don't own the airports, so,
we don't----
Dr. Van Drew . I know, but it deals--but you
are a very important part of what happens at the airport. You
should be included. You should be part of it.
The people, quite frankly, of our districts, of our
country, should be part of it, as well. So, I ask you to please
think about that, and I would ask you to please commit to doing
that. It's not a big request. It's a real obvious thing. And I
will look forward to that report.
Last month, the fuselage of a domestic Boeing 737 MAX
exploded open at 16,000 feet. I know you are real aware of it.
There were 180 people on board. We are unbelievably blessed
that nobody died, that there weren't injuries, that it wasn't
much worse than the result that we had. This accident, in my
opinion--in my opinion--is the result of the decades-long
process of globalization.
In the early 2000s, Boeing aggressively outsourced its
business model. The strategy peaked in 2005, with the sale of
the Wichita-based Spirit AeroSystems. I know you are aware of
that. Spirit Aero is now a ``global'' corporation, and it has
been identified by the FAA as responsible--you all identified
it as responsible for the faulty components behind the Alaskan
Airlines incident.
This is one example of how Boeing's outsourcing has led to
Boeing's decline. And Boeing has hidden its decline, in my
opinion and many, by appealing to diversity, equity, and
inclusion for its investors, because it's a cool thing to be.
And the investors that are interested in that were more likely
to invest. And their stock, no doubt, has gone up 400 percent
since--their product has gone down, but their stock has gone
up, which is real interesting.
You should be worried about safety when you are selling
private equity firms, but they were not. This is a one-two
punch of globalization and social engineering. It doesn't
belong. Job number one is safety. Job number one is safety for
every man, woman, and child that go in those airports. And it's
a company that is struggling to reliably produce safe aircraft.
Mr. Whitaker, are you concerned by the trajectory of Boeing
as an American institution, an American institution? Are you
concerned?
Mr. Whitaker. My concern is that Boeing makes safe
aircraft. So, I am less concerned about externalities. I am
more concerned about the quality of the aircraft coming off the
line, and that is my focus.
Dr. Van Drew. Well, I would maintain it is part and parcel.
They have a job to worry about safety, efficiency. And when you
are worried about all these other issues and not the green
economy and everything else, you should--that should be your
job, number one. And I hope you have a plan to put them back on
track.
I sent you a letter in December about the FAA Technical
Center, and I would like to submit this, Chairman, for the
record.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Without objection.

Letter of December 11, 2023, to Hon. Michael Whitaker, Administrator,
Federal Aviation Administration, from Hon. Jefferson Van Drew,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. Jefferson Van Drew
Congress of the United States,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515,
December 11, 2023.
The Honorable Michael Whitaker,
Administrator,
Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independent Ave., SW, Washington,
DC 20591.
RE: FAA Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request
Dear Administrator Whitaker,
We are in a pivotal time for aviation. With strong leadership now
in place at the FAA, and a robust FAA Reauthorization coming down the
legislative pipeline, we must make shrewd investments that will
position the Nation's aviation system for long-term success. My
district is home to the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center. This
facility is essential to the day-to-day and long-term operation of our
National Airspace System, and in need of investment.
I have developed a package of budgetary items to equip the
Technical Center with the infrastructure and programs it needs to face
the challenges of 21st century aviation. As such, I respectfully
request that you provide for the following priorities in the Federal
Aviation Administration's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request to Congress:
1 $29.9 million for the William J. Hughes Technical Center
Laboratories, $13 million above the FY24 Budget Request of
$16.9 million.
This funding is needed to bring the Technical Center's
Laboratory infrastructure into compliance for priority 1
operational NAS systems located at the Technical Center.
Priority 1 system types include critical systems such as the
Federal NOTAM System, the FAA Enterprise Network Service, and
the National Defense Program.
The operational systems located at the Technical Center provide
a pivotal role in the NAS and need to remain operational
continually (24/7/365). Planes, pilots, and passengers are
dependent on these systems and without the proper
infrastructure these systems could be taken offline by natural
or unnatural disasters/events.
2 $23.2 million William J. Hughes Technical Center Building and Plant
Sustainment, $13.2 million above the FY24 Budget Request of $10
million.
The Main Electrical Utility Substation Sustainment Project
replaces outdated high-voltage electrical distribution
switching equipment and associated structures. These
components, which are over 35 years old, have exceeded the
industry standard lifecycle of 25 years. The substation plays a
crucial role in providing power to various Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) owned and operated buildings, as well as
multiple Federal and State agencies resident at the Center. Of
particular importance is its critical impact on active
airspace, including the Atlantic City International Airport
Control Tower, airfield lighting/flight instruments for the
SJTA ACY airport, and operational FAA NAS systems.
3 $10 million for the Emerging Technology Accelerator, as included in
the Fiscal Year 2023 request.
This program establishes an effective pathway for the
development, demonstration, and transfer of technology
applications and will lead to tangible operational improvements
to our aviation infrastructure.
Congress is preparing an FAA Reauthorization that emphasizes
advanced technology. Included in the House-passed bill is
language that will strengthen the role of the FAA William J.
Hughes Technical Center in facilitating technology transfers to
the federal government. The Emerging Technologies Accelerator
is the necessary programmatic infrastructure that will allow
the Technical Center to meet this new mission.
Inclusion in the budget request is effectively a pre-requisite
for funding a program of this type. The program was included in
the FY22 and FY23 budget requests. Now is the appropriate time
to fund this program and advance it in alignment with the
agency's broader aviation technology initiatives.
Should you include these items in your budget request, I shall
strongly champion their full appropriation. I urge you to provide for
all the above items in your Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request to Congress
so that we may ensure a strong future for American aviation.
Sincerely,
Jeff Van Drew,
Member of Congress.
Dr. Van Drew. The needs include the National Airspace
System, electrical utilities, and technology transfer programs.
My time has run out. I wish I had a half hour with you. I
appreciate you being there. I would hope that you would take my
request seriously, because the American public takes it
seriously. And I thank you, and wish you good luck.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The gentleman's time has expired.
I recognize the gentlelady from Alaska, Mrs. Peltola, for 5
minutes.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good morning, Administrator Whitaker.
Mr. Whitaker. Good morning.
Mrs. Peltola. General aviation accident rates in Alaska
continue to outpace the rest of the country. Can you provide an
update on FAA's implementation of the recommendations of the
2023 FAA Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative Tiger Team,
including the eight Automated Weather Observing Systems
installation scheduled to have been completed in September of
2023?
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you ma'am. So, I am fully supportive of
the unique nature of Alaska and the role of general aviation,
in that I had a chance to visit when I was deputy and got to
tour quite a bit of some of the remote facilities. And I think
the FAASI program has really been a very strong program, and we
support that, and we will continue to support that.
On the AWOS, I know that I got briefed on this ahead of the
hearing, and I understand that seven of the eight have been
deployed. The eighth is inaccessible, due to some flooding or
some other climate conditions. So, we will make sure that that
continues, as well.
Mrs. Peltola. OK, excellent. And as you say, Alaska is
unique. I think 82 percent of our communities are not
accessible by any other way except airplane.
The House passed the FAA reauthorization bill, and it
included section 510, the Don Young Aviation Safety Initiative,
which calls on aviation stakeholders to work together to reduce
the rate of fatal accidents by 90 percent by 2033 in Alaska,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and other American Territories. And this
provision includes a number of initiatives designed to further
the objective, and I am wondering what you see as steps that
are necessary to achieve this kind of reduction.
Mr. Whitaker. Well, I think it's laudable that we have such
an aggressive goal, and that is how we brought the commercial
aviation accident rate down to its current level and getting
the stakeholder groups working together.
I think with GA, there are a lot of technologies that can
be deployed to create better situational awareness in the
cockpit, and more tools particularly around weather and
unpredictable weather, but also redundancies around landing
systems and the like. So, I think this is an area where
technology and quick deployment of technology can really be a
benefit. So, I think it's really positive that all these
stakeholders are working together toward that.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you so much.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mrs. Peltola. I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Burchett . Regrettably, I yield to Mr. Mann.
Mr. Mann. Thank you, and thank you for being here today,
Administrator Whitaker.
I represent the Big First district of Kansas. There is a
strong relationship between the Kansas economy and aviation.
There are 91,000 jobs attributed to the aviation industry in my
State, including 42,000 from the aerospace manufacturing
segment. Aviation ranks second in economic impact in Kansas
only to agriculture.
For our aviation industry to thrive, the FAA needs a
roadmap of updated congressional priorities to adopt long
overdue policy changes and regulatory requirements. Delays in
rulemaking and insufficiencies in the workforce are
bottlenecking the industry. It is imperative that Congress
passes the reauthorization bill, so the FAA, its workforce, and
the aviation industry are able to address the backlog of
concerns that my colleagues and I have all been raising for
months so that America can return to its gold standard status
in aviation.
A few questions, Mr. Whitaker. We have heard a lot about
the FAA's rulemaking process and the importance of it for
innovation, safety, and international leadership. What will you
do under your tenure to make this process more timely,
transparent, and accountable?
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir. I think there--transparency
in general, I think, needs to be improved, and efficiency needs
to be improved delivering services. Registrations, for example,
certification process. So, we are working on those issues.
Rulemaking is a little different, because it's driven by
the Administrative Procedure Act. So, we are required to have
certain time periods for comment and certain process and
procedures. I think the best we can do is make sure we get that
transparency, and know where we are in the process, and try to
keep the process moving. A rulemaking can have a dozen
different steps in it. Just make sure that we are continuing to
keep sunlight on that, and keep things moving as quickly as we
can within the confines of that law.
Mr. Mann. And then can you specifically address unmanned
aerial systems?
In other words, how is the FAA adapting its regulatory
framework to accommodate the rapid evolution of unmanned aerial
systems and advanced air mobility technologies?
I think we have got to acknowledge that this is here to
stay. It is a growing part of the aviation industry, tremendous
potential for Kansas and the rest of the country. And how do we
make sure the FAA is appropriately and quickly reviewing these
new technologies with safety front and center, but also not
having unnecessary delays, as well?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, it is one of our big challenges, and
right now, I think it has mostly been dealt with in a one-off
manner. So, I think recently we have gotten much better on the
small UAS and through this exemption process, so, we have been
able to satisfy a lot of the BVLOS operations and such.
Advanced air mobility currently would have to operate under
existing rules, which is doable, but not scalable, if you will.
So, I think what we need to do is work as an industry with
all stakeholders to develop that roadmap that integrates all
these technologies and tries to keep up with their pace of
development. So, I think we don't want to be in the way, but we
need to make sure that they are being deployed safely, and that
is our top priority.
Mr. Mann. Yes, I agree. As an aside, I hear from multiple
manufacturers in Kansas of all sizes that just talk about how
long it takes for the FAA to respond to new ideas on how do we
do things better, how do we innovate, how do we make sure that
the U.S. continues--that we are the world leader in the
aviation space. A big part of that, of course, is
manufacturing. A big part of that is having an FAA that is
adaptable, understands technology, understands where the
industry is heading, and how do we partner together to promote
safety.
So, last question. In your testimony, you outlined several
initiatives on increasing the air traffic controller workforce.
What strategies are you implementing to bolster other fields in
the aviation force such as aircraft mechanics, pilots, other
segments of the industry?
Mr. Whitaker. That's a great question, and I am remiss for
not mentioning that we are actually hiring in all these
sectors. The controllers are sort of the most immediate safety
need for us, but we are hiring in all sectors, and we are
competing with all those other industries you just mentioned in
a market that is a pretty good market if you are an employee.
So, I have often said I am the chief recruiting officer for
the agency, so, we are doing direct outreach to schools. We are
trying to cast as broad a net as we can to interest people into
coming into the FAA. And maybe they come in for 30 years or
maybe just 3 years, so, we want to make it easier for folks to
come through and have an experience there, and then maybe go do
something else afterwards.
So, it is a priority, and it is not an easy one to get
after.
Mr. Mann. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that, I
yield back.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana . Thank you, Mr. Mann.
The gentlelady from Nevada, Ms. Titus, is recognized.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It is nice to see you, Mr. Whitaker.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. Congratulations on having this position.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. It is going to be a tough job in a tough place,
but I know you are up to it, and we appreciate it very much.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. Aviation is so important to my district, Las
Vegas. We have got a very crowded airspace with the military,
with the drones, with the commercial flights, with the general
aviation. So, this is really critical.
And I want to thank you all for your recent investments
from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. You brought $49 million
for the infrastructure grant funding for all the airports in my
district, and that is really helpful and really appreciated for
improving runway safety and taxi upgrades.
And I would like to go back to the issue of the air traffic
controllers. We know that air travel is increasing, and yet the
number of air traffic controllers is not. I think you hired 30
last year, including trainees. And they are often forced to
work overtime, 6 days a week, and that leads to stress and
burnout. And would you just say again for the record how you
are trying to address that issue?
Mr. Whitaker. You have identified all the problems that I
have also identified coming in. And it is, I think, one of our
most pressing needs.
And I would add to that it takes years to make an air
traffic controller.
Ms. Titus. Yes.
Mr. Whitaker. It's a long journey. It's not an easy job.
It's a very rewarding job, but we need to hire as many as we
possibly can.
So, we are ensuring that our own process is delivering as
many as it can through the Academy in Oklahoma City, but we
also want to work with universities in the private sector to
make sure we are able to pull as many from that source, as
well. So, we have become more flexible with military hires. It
used to be twice a year. So, if you didn't happen to leave the
military at just the right time, you had to wait 6 months. We
now have a constant hiring of military controllers, which will
increase the number of folks who can go directly into the
towers or centers. And we are working--I think one of our most
promising outlets will be these aeronautical colleges and
universities, where the students can get the exact same
curriculum as the Academy, pass the exam, and then go directly
into a tower or radar facility.
So, going forward, that will allow us to really increase
the pipeline, but in the short term, because it takes so long,
it's going to be hard to move that needle very much, at least
until you get about 2 years out.
Ms. Titus. I think there is a place in some of the
community colleges for developing programs like this that
would----
Mr. Whitaker . I think that would--that can
certainly--that could certainly be eligible, if they are able
to teach that curriculum and have the training tools. It often
requires being around a lot of retired controllers. They have a
relatively early retirement age, and a lot of them become
instructors afterwards, but I think I would like to really see
that program expand as we go forward.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. Yes, me too. If we can be helpful,
let us know.
Also, we are seeing more and more in different modes of
transportation that companies are acting in ways that seem to
prioritize profits over safety. And you mentioned in your
testimony that the agency found inspections of the grounded
737-9 MAX aircraft showed Boeing's quality system issues were,
and I quote, ``unacceptable and required further scrutiny.''
Do you have confidence then--your suppliers, that they can
kind of maintain this quality control? It's not a fox guarding
the henhouse kind of situation?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, I think we are looking--we are going to
look at this process really top to bottom to see where the
incentives are, where the failures are in the system, and we
are going to demand that that quality come up to the
appropriate schedule.
We certify aircraft to be built to very specific
specifications, and they have to be built to those
specifications. So, regardless of their other motives, they are
not going to be able to build more airplanes until they meet
those standards.
Ms. Titus. OK. You don't see a problem with conflict of
interest with self-inspections?
Mr. Whitaker. We are looking at that specifically. We have
asked MITRE, our research firm, to give us options on
delegation, and where we might bring in a third party--for
example, in quality control or quality assurance--to make sure
you have a neutral set of eyes on some of those issues. So,
that is something we are looking at.
Ms. Titus. Again, and just in a second, I would throw out
there about the framework for Beyond Visual Line of Sight. Now
it's based on a waiver system. We want to put those rules in
place. Are you moving forward with that?
Mr. Whitaker. We are going to move as quickly as we can on
that one, yes.
Ms. Titus. OK, a lot of people want you to move a little
more quickly.
Mr. Whitaker. I have been getting that message. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. OK. Thank you very much.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ms. Titus. The
gentleman from Utah, Mr. Owens, is recognized.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chair. On behalf of the
westerners, Utah is a remarkable place of convergence and
connections, the fastest growing State in the Union right now.
We have the Olympics, possibly, inland ports, so, it is going
to be very important that we have that conduit of coming from
places--a hub like Utah.
That being said, the FAA has identified multiple time
blocks where the DCA airport is currently underutilized. Do you
believe more flights could be added safely and efficiently to
that process?
Mr. Whitaker. So, our focus, with respect to DCA, is
whether it's safe. So, we are not involved in the decision
around where the flights can go from DCA. So, our focus is
entirely on the safety aspect.
It is an airport that is very close to capacity. There are
some hours when there is some room for new capacity, but it is,
as you know, a pretty full operations. It tends to operate at
around 60 operations a minute--I mean, an hour, sorry, so, it's
basically one a minute. So, you can't really squeeze much more
than that in there. So, that tends to be where our focus is.
Mr. Owens. Well, according to some of the reports we got
from the FAA, there are blocks in which it can be effectively
done safely, according to the FAA.
Mr. Whitaker. Well, we will always make sure it is
operating safely.
Mr. Owens. OK.
Mr. Whitaker. If something suffers, it will be efficiency.
Mr. Owens. OK. Outside the perimeter are tens of millions
of Americans who deserve better pricing, better value, and more
convenient access to DC Representatives. I encourage you to
support the efforts to provide a consumer free market to our
Nation's Capital. I would really appreciate that.
And my hometown airport, Salt Lake City, is currently in
phase 2 of a three-part, $5 billion development. Can you
explain the impact of the delayed FAA reauthorization to Salt
Lake City International and airports like that that are going
through modernization?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, I think you are hitting on a very
important point. These projects have a certain momentum, and
they need to be funded, and they need to operate under current
authorization. So, I think it's vital that both of those pieces
happen.
Mr. Owens. OK. I am going to yield my remaining time to my
good friend from Texas, Mr. Nehls.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
And I apologize, Mr. Administrator. These wonderful
gentlemen give me their time when they don't have anything else
to say, and I have got so much to talk about with you.
So, just for the record here, I asked you, did you write
this letter, and you stated you didn't, but you had somebody
ask you to write this letter. Can I ask you who asked you to
write this letter dated February 5?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I think the discussion probably would
have been with our Government affairs team that focuses on
providing technical assistance on legislation.
Mr. Nehls. But you couldn't specifically--somebody came up
to you and said, ``Hey, Mr. Administrator, I am drafting this
letter, I want you to approve this letter so we can send it out
to Senators Cantwell and Cruz''?
Mr. Whitaker. No, it comes through a correspondence--we put
out a lot of correspondence. And the last 4 weeks, I have been
mostly busy on other topics.
Mr. Nehls. OK, so, it was written by, in your opinion, some
Government affairs team within the FAA.
Mr. Whitaker. Presumably, but I don't know precisely, but
that normally would be how it would be developed.
Mr. Nehls. All right, fair enough, fair enough.
You did state that--I bring this letter up, and you stated
that it is not the official position of the FAA to oppose
raising the retirement age to 67, but you have some concerns.
And in the letter it talks about ``we always prioritize a
robust process to identify risk and ensure mitigations to
maintain safety, but we do not test in a live environment.''
``We do not test in a live environment,'' could you tell us
what that means?
The Members up here--what the hell is a live environment?
Explain that to me.
Mr. Whitaker. I believe what that means is we don't change
a rule to see how it plays out. We usually like to do the
research before we change a rule.
Mr. Nehls. OK. Would you consider--are you familiar with
BasicMed--BasicMed, the study, the BasicMed safety study?
Mr. Whitaker. I am.
Mr. Nehls. All right. The FAA authorized it. They let it
run. They looked at it after 3 years, like 2017, 2018, 2019,
and they reported back to Congress. It's right here. I have it
here. An FAA report submitted to Congress, as required, on
March 10 reviewed 3 years of general aviation data and
concluded that the BasicMed program is safe. Isn't that a live
study? I mean, they were flying around. These general aviators
are flying around. They are looking at whether it's a third-
class medical versus a BasicMed, and they found out that
BasicMed works. That is a live study. Would you agree?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, that was based on a legislative mandate.
Mr. Nehls. Yes, but that is--I know it's a legislative
mandate, but----
Mr. Whitaker . We don't refute that----
Mr. Nehls . But that is a live study, though.
Mr. Whitaker. Right.
Mr. Nehls. I mean, come on, how could you not agree with
that? They are flying around, and they are reporting back 3
years of data, and they are saying, hey, there are no issues
with BasicMed. That's a live study.
Mr. Whitaker. Right.
Mr. Nehls. OK, I just want to get that because it says,
``We do not test in a live environment.'' That's not true.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Nehls. I recognize
Mr. Carbajal for questions.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Welcome, Administrator Whitaker. Prior to the Alaska
Airlines 1282 accident, did the FAA find any evidence of
persistent quality control lapses in any of Boeing's production
lines?
Mr. Whitaker. So, recognizing that to answer that
question--a lot of that is before my tenure, but I think the
production problems with the 787 beginning in 2019 through
recently are pretty well known. And even just in December, we
had an airworthiness directive around a loose bolt on a rudder
system. So, I think there were already some recent reports of
production issues with Boeing.
Mr. Carbajal. Not to hammer on that, but you did mention
some bolt issues recently. Has the FAA become aware of any
other lapses since the start of the investigation?
Mr. Whitaker. So, the investigation is ongoing, and we are
supporting NTSB in their investigation, of course, of the
incident itself. So, there are no findings, really, to discuss
at this point.
The audit investigation is going on, and the only thing I
can say about that, it hasn't shown any findings that have led
us to immediate action. So, we are just going to take the data
we get from that and analyze that to decide how to move
forward.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Mr. Whitaker, one of the FAA's
most successful Government-industry partnerships is the
Contract Tower Program. Two hundred sixty-two smaller airports
participate in this critically important air traffic safety
program, including 21 in California, 1 of which is in my
district, the San Luis Obispo County Airport. This critical air
traffic safety program is important to maintain and develop
regional service, and supports DoD flight training operations
and military readiness at pilot flight schools all across the
country.
It is also important to note that contract towers account
for approximately one-third of all tower operations in the
Nation, and about 70 percent of contract controllers are
veterans.
Mr. Administrator, what assurances can you give me and my
colleagues that contract towers will remain a priority for you?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, I can assure you that we certainly
support the program. And given the hiring challenges we are
having with air traffic controllers, no incentive to try to
tinker with the system as it's working. And in fact, we also do
hiring from contract towers, as well. So, it is a source for
our own controllers. So, we are fully supportive of the
program, and want to make sure it's working, particularly in
smaller airports.
Mr. Carbajal. Great. Also, staffing shortages continue to
be a challenge throughout the industry, which you just now
touched on, including contract towers. What measures can the
FAA and the industry undertake collaboratively to address
staffing challenges at these towers?
Mr. Whitaker. I think we are doing all that we have been
able to think of for our own hiring purposes, but I think it
has become a very competitive market. There are a lot of new
entrants in different aspects of aerospace. So, I think we just
have to really compete for those employees, and give them a
good working environment.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I appreciate your leadership. I
appreciate you recently becoming the Administrator, and I think
you have your hands full with a lot of challenges, but I think
you are the right person for the job. And I just wanted to
recognize you for all that you bring to the table to this very
important position, and all the problem-solving that you are
going to help us achieve. So, thank you very much.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Carbajal. I
recognize the gentlelady from Oregon, Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Chairman.
It's nice to meet you, sir.
Mr. Whitaker. Nice to meet you, thanks.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. I represent Oregon's Fifth
Congressional District, and I am grateful to be on this
committee to ask these questions. So, I will get right started.
Long delays and cancellations have become too common in
airports, in large part due to the shortage of pilots. It would
be ridiculous for us to look at the current state of things and
say everything is fine, let's just keep the status quo.
Last week, through my work on the Education and the
Workforce Committee, the Flight Education Access Act was
included in a major student loan reform package. This is a huge
step in resolving that shortage.
The commonsense proposal closes the pilot workforce gap by
letting prospective pilots access the same loan opportunities
available to students at traditional 4-year schools. It
increases the total maximum amount of the Federal direct and
subsidized Stafford loans an eligible dependent may borrow to
$11,000, increases the maximum amount for independent students
to $137,500, and increases the maximum amount of Federal direct
Stafford loans to a total of $65,000.
Mr. Administrator, if prospective pilots could access these
types of student loans and use them when completing the FAA's
regulated training, would that help improve the pilot shortage?
Mr. Whitaker. I think that would be a very useful
initiative. It is very expensive to become an airline pilot,
which means 1,500 hours. So, you can become a private pilot
with as few as 40 hours, so, getting from 40 to 1,500 is a
hugely expensive endeavor. So, it is like any other
profession--doctor, lawyer, plumber--it costs money to get
there, and I think it would be useful.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. So, you would agree it is a positive
outcome.
Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. This would be a positive initiative to
move forward.
Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. So, moving on, what should be the most
common part of air travel safety?
Of course, you have heard plenty about the Boeing Alaska
accident today, amongst others, but it is not lost on me that
it happened in Oregon, my home State. Oregonians, we choose
Alaska Airlines as our preferred airline, and I fly on them
every single week back and forth. Boeing jets rightfully have
cause for concern and many questions.
Can you speak to the level of confidence once again today
in the FAA-approved inspection steps for the 737-9 MAX door
plug?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, I think that that was a very thorough
inspection process, and the mechanical fix to that defect, we
have a high level of confidence that takes care of the problem.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. And so, you would fly on the 737-9
MAX?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, I would.
Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Congressman Carbajal kind of talked on
my last question on the contract tower program, and I have one
of those in my district in Bend. So, I appreciate you answering
that you are in full support of continuing that.
So, I will yield my time, then, to my colleague, Mr. Nehls,
the remaining time.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you very much.
Mr. Administrator, obviously, this letter that you did not
write, but you had the Government affairs team write, I
believe--and listen, you are a busy man. I don't think maybe
you proofread this thing very clearly. I mean, there are some
issues here as it relates to the ``but we do not test in a live
environment.'' I believe that BasicMed safety study is a prime
example, and I have a few more, I believe.
It's interesting. ALPA is taking dues from pilots in Canada
over the age of 65. ALPA is taking dues from pilots over the
age of 65. And we know ALPA doesn't--they want to squash this.
They don't want this retirement age range. WestJet is flying
ALPA-represented pilots over the age of 65 right now. That is
your live study, Mr. Administrator. That is your live study.
Let's talk about the part 135 operators. We allow pilots to
fly over the age of 65 under part 135. Is that not a live
environment? Could you explain to everybody up here what a part
135 is versus a 121?
Mr. Whitaker. A part 135 carrier, typically under 30
passengers----
Mr. Nehls . Sure. NetJets would be an
example?
Mr. Whitaker. That is correct.
Mr. Nehls. All right. Do part 121 and 135 share the same
airspace?
Mr. Whitaker. They do.
Mr. Nehls. They do. So, they taxi with part 121, i.e., the
big airliners folks, Delta, United, everything, and you can get
this NetJet, Taylor Swift flying to the Super Bowl in her
supersonic jet. They could be in the same airspace, taxiing on
the same runway. Why do part 135 that flies around the
millionaires and the billionaires across the country, why can
they fly to the age of 67, but United and Delta, that
gentleman, we fire him at 65. How does that make any sense?
Mr. Whitaker. Congress passed a law limiting them to 65.
Mr. Nehls. Congress passed a law limiting them to 65.
Mr. Whitaker. Right.
Mr. Nehls. And how do you feel about that? Do you think
that's just, it's right?
Mr. Whitaker. I think it's what Congress did, so, we don't
second-guess Congress. So, I think our point was, if you are
going to change it, we would like to have some data around
that.
Mr. Nehls. I think that's perfect. When they--I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Sheriff. For the
record, I am not sure that Taylor Swift flies supersonic. I
just want to make a note.
The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Auchincloss, is
recognized.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chairman, and I want to second
what the chairman said about the imperative for the Senate to
pass the FAA reauthorization. This committee did good work,
bipartisan work, and it needs to happen in the Senate now.
Mr. Whitaker, you were earlier getting questions from my
Republican colleagues about migrant housing at the airports. By
statute, FAA has jurisdiction over airside, not landside,
operations at airports. Correct?
Mr. Whitaker. That is correct, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss. And there was one instance of the airside
of an airport asking to house migrants. Correct?
Mr. Whitaker. That is my understanding.
Mr. Auchincloss. And there has been no documentation of
airside safety being impeded at that one airport, JFK. Correct?
Mr. Whitaker. That is the standard, yes.
Mr. Auchincloss. And is the FAA an aeronautical safety
organization, or is it an immigration agency?
Mr. Whitaker. Our mission is safety, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss. The hard-working men and women of Border
Patrol, which actually is this Government's immigration agency,
have endorsed the Senate's bipartisan deal on border security,
which is a tough and fair compromise to address the migrant
surge. And if my Republican colleagues are so concerned about
solving this problem, I suggest that they stop asking you, sir,
for answers, and start asking Speaker Johnson for answers. And
question number one might be, are you Donald Trump's campaign
manager or are you Speaker of the House?
Sir, back to your job, you authorized the MAX airplane to
fly again after the Alaska Airlines accident. Why do you
believe the MAX airplane is now safe?
Mr. Whitaker. So, the MAX 9 was grounded because of
concerns about the quality of manufacturing for the plug door.
So, the focus of that airworthiness directive was to inspect
those aircraft and come up with a repair that would ensure that
it met the standard of safety built into the certification of
the aircraft. Once that inspection and repair scenario was
agreed upon, then the aircraft was allowed to return to
service.
Mr. Auchincloss. Now, in 2020, you took back--not you, but
the FAA--took back airworthiness ticketing from Boeing. What
did that do for oversight of Boeing then, and was that
oversight sufficient, given the problems it has had at
factories regarding the MAX 9?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I wasn't there at the time, as you noted.
I guess I would say, in retrospect, and given what happened
with the plug door, it is hard to call that oversight
sufficient. So, we are looking at that process and what
additional steps need to be taken to make sure that that
oversight is sufficient.
Mr. Auchincloss. Last August, the FAA announced almost $45
million in funding for Boston Logan International Airport to
simplify the airfield layout and reduce the risk of runway
incursions. Can you speak to how investments like that will
improve passenger safety, and any other work the FAA is doing
to reduce the risk of near-misses?
Mr. Whitaker. So, issues that happen in the airport
environment and on runways, each airport is unique, it has its
own geometry. And certain geometries create natural situations
that can cause confusion. So, trying to--and we call them
hotspots--trying to identify those hotspots and correct them,
either through signage, lighting, or sometimes moving taxiways
is highly effective in keeping them safer.
So, the good news about these type of events is there are
really straightforward solutions, and we have been deploying
those solutions.
Mr. Auchincloss. All right, I want to join my colleagues in
saying how happy we are to have you in this position, how
qualified I think you are for this job, and I am looking
forward to seeing the work that you can do for maintaining and
improving America's gold standard reputation for airline
safety.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Auchincloss. I
recognize the vice chair of the subcommittee, the gentleman
from Indiana, Mr. Yakym.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
Administrator Whitaker, for being here today.
After a robust, open, transparent, and bipartisan process,
the House passed its FAA reauthorization last July in an
overwhelming 351 to 69 vote. And it appears we are finally
going to see some welcome movement from our colleagues in the
Senate later on this week. Hopefully, that means we can soon
provide certainty and stability to your agency, to the aviation
community, and to the flying public with an FAA reauthorization
centered around our gold standard of safety and continued
American aviation leadership.
But it is that leadership I would like to speak about today
or, in this particular case, the lack thereof. As we held
hearings in the lead-up to our FAA reauthorization bill, we
heard from witnesses, especially in the drone delivery
industry, who said that they were expanding in markets like
Australia instead of the United States due to a lack of
regulatory certainty.
I have been encouraged to see the FAA in recent months
issuing a number of part 107 waivers that enable Beyond Visual
Line of Sight operations for drone delivery companies. The
waivers represent another step in a long journey that must
strike that fine balance between safety and forward momentum.
But it is a journey that, in my estimation, has been moving far
too slow.
Mr. Whitaker, earlier you told my colleague, Chairman
Graves, that the BVLOS notice of proposed rulemaking will be
published ``this year.'' Last September, an FAA official had
pegged that timeline at August of 2024. Is that timeline
slipping, or is August still the goal?
Mr. Whitaker. I could look, and if you like I will give you
a specific answer. I was covering for my lack of memory on an
exact date, so----
Mr. Yakym . Yes, I would like a specific
answer, if you don't mind.

Mr. Whitaker. I will just circle back with you. I will give
you a precise answer. I just don't recall.
Mr. Yakym. I would like a precise answer on that.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes.
Mr. Yakym. And furthermore, if the timeline from August,
which was told to us--or an FAA Administrator told--or official
told back in September--if that timeline from August is
slipping, I would like to have you circle back and articulate
why within the FAA that timeline is slipping.
And then my second question is, once that notice is
published, are you able to commit to publishing a final rule
within 12 months of the notice of proposed rulemaking?
Mr. Whitaker. I can commit to keeping the rule moving as
quickly as possible. It depends on what comments come in, how
they get arbitrated, and then it has to go through a review
process, as you know, up through OIRA. But we will give as much
transparency as possible, and try to keep that moving as much
as possible.
I think it is an important rule. We want to get it out.
Mr. Yakym. Right, and I agree with you. It is an important
rule and it is one that, due to so many delays in timelines, we
have companies who are reevaluating their innovation, their R&D
right here in the United States. We want companies to continue
to make those investments here in the United States, so----
Mr. Whitaker . I agree, yes.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you for your commitment to moving forward.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes.
Mr. Yakym. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to
yield the balance of my time to my colleague, Mr. Nehls.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Sheriff Nehls.
Mr. Nehls. So, we have talked about this letter. We have
talked about the fact that I don't believe it was proofread,
sir, I really don't. You seem to be a great guy. I think you
have a bright future. But this letter is full of inaccuracies.
It has flaws. It says ``we do not test in a live environment,''
but I don't believe you believe that. I just think that is not
what you believe, and I think we can point that out.
The last sentence of the letter, it says, ``it is critical
to provide the agency an opportunity to conduct research and
determine mitigations.'' You talk about conducting research.
Everybody that is listening, watching--Japan, New Zealand,
Australia, our friends to the north, Canada--all have pilots
above the age of 67. They have had no safety issues. Zero, no
safety issues.
The head of the FAA in New Zealand--I went up to ICAO, I
flew up to Canada, went to the ICAO meeting. The FAA
Administrator of New Zealand said they have pilots flying up to
the age of 75, and they have no issues. That is your live
study, sir. Call them. Ask them.
I even got, believe it or not, John Prater, the former
president of the Air Line Pilots Association, it says, ``In the
past''--reference 60 to 65--``In the past, commercial airline
pilots who did not want to stop working at age 60 took jobs
with international airlines or charter operators for which the
retirement age was higher. The experience of these pilots
should also be studied, said John Prater, president of the Air
Line Pilots Association.
``You can look globally, look at Canada and look at pilots
flying in corporate aviation and on-demand services like
NetJets,'' Mr. Prater said, referring to a large private
aviation service. ``The GAO could expand and ask the airlines
themselves. That's an avenue they could investigate if they
chose to expand their look.''
I yield.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Sheriff. I recognize
the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Allred.
Mr. Allred. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank
you for holding this hearing. It's on an incredibly important
topic at an important time.
And thank you, Mr. Administrator, for being here. I know
that we are all united in wanting to restore confidence in our
air travel. And when we have some Americans--I travel quite a
bit, as we all do, and I was sitting next to some folks the
other day who were saying that they were filtering out in their
travel plans the planes that they think are unsafe. And when we
have that, we know that we have to respond, and so, we have to
respond together. Here our responsibility is to help you to
ensure that we remain the gold standard. And you certainly have
my commitment on that.
And I wanted to just ask you about, in reference to
Boeing's internal oversight, you say that it's time to
reexamine the delegation of authority and assess any associated
safety risks. Could you discuss how the FAA intends to change
oversight at the manufacturing sites to meet this goal?
Mr. Whitaker. So, what we are doing, we are doing a number
of things. We are doing an audit of the manufacturing process.
We are looking into what is delegated, what could be overseen
by a third party, and we have inspectors on the ground talking
to employees to understand sort of the ground truth, if you
will, of what is happening, what the pressures are.
And based on that outcome, we will look at putting together
a program to continue to add direct oversight to what otherwise
was sort of an auditing approach, so, a much more hands-on
approach going forward. That will be really designed after this
6-week audit period is finished, and we have a better
understanding of what's going on in the factory.
Mr. Allred. And do you need any further authorizations or
support from the Congress in order to do that?
Is there anything in the FAA reauthorization that would
assist in that?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, I do appreciate you saying--the
willingness to work together. I do think, with a problem like
this, we all need to be rowing in the same direction: Congress,
Boeing, the airlines, the FAA. I think we all want the same
outcome, which is safe airplanes. So, we will certainly come
back with you on that.
I think we do anticipate needing to hire more inspectors.
The oversight before was a different skill set, and we need
folks who are trained to be on the ground and much more hands-
on, so, we do anticipate some hiring. I think we have the
authorizing authority to do that. We may need to find the money
to do it, but I think that will be a top priority, and we will
either come back for that or we will make it work, one way or
the other.
Mr. Allred. Because there is an inherent tension here
between competition, the need to rush products to market.
I remember back when we dealt with the MAX initially a few
years back, some of the internal discussions about needing to
compete when you are also your own regulator or doing your own
internal reviews. And so, it seems to me that we have to have
more on our side in terms of independent investigators, and I
recognize the cost associated with that. But I think that for
the American flying public, it's a cost that's worth us bearing
in terms of making sure that we don't have another incident
like what we had.
And so, in order to have a truly safe system, it seems to
me that we can't rely on the manufacturers themselves to be
their own watchdogs. Is that something you would agree with?
Mr. Whitaker. I certainly agree that what--the current
system is not working because it is not delivering safe
aircraft. So, we have to make some changes to that.
And I think we also have to look at the culture. To your
point, incentives drive behavior. And I think maybe that we
need to look at the incentives to make sure safety is getting
the appropriate first rung of consideration that it deserves.
Mr. Allred. Yes. I mean, I played in the NFL, and if they
had let us be our own referees, every time an offensive lineman
tried to block me, it would have been a holding call, you know
what I am saying? So, I think this is certainly something we
should work on.
I wanted to come really quickly to the announcement that
you just issued about the installation of the first modernized
tower simulation system for traffic controller training in my
State, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. Could you
elaborate how this technology will benefit our controller
workforce that is already stretched so thin?
Mr. Whitaker. So, these simulators, they are, in a way, a
simple technology. It is a circle of screens that really
reproduces the environment of that particular airport, and
allows controllers to train on that environment. So, that works
for new controllers. But also, if you have a problem at your
airport, for example, a hotspot area or some other persistent
problem that we have identified, existing controllers can
actually train to that problem in that simulator.
So, it can be thrown at them as a situation to see how they
respond, and it becomes a learning tool. So, it's really
important for current training, but also for helping move
controllers fast through the training process.
Mr. Allred. That's great. Well, thank you so much.
I yield back.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Allred. I recognize
the gentleman from New York, Mr. Molinaro.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, Mr. Whitaker. We welcome your leadership. It
goes without question, the FAA, in at least my estimation and
many others, has been in need of leadership, and certainly FAA
reauthorization, critically important. We are hopeful the
Senate moves earnestly, and that we can move that bill to law.
Without question, Americans have witnessed too many
alarming incidents, from aircraft employee treatment to
aircraft safety and passenger experience. I appreciated
participating in the briefing last week regarding the door plug
incident, and look forward, obviously, to the NTSB report and
FAA's reaction and response.
On the topic of safety, I was very happy to see in your
testimony you referenced FAA rulemaking on drug and alcohol
testing for foreign repair stations. One of the first bills I
introduced was the Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety
Improvement Act, which ensures parity of safety protocols
between domestic and foreign aircraft maintenance--you are
familiar with--I am very happy to say this provision has been
included in the House-passed FAA reauthorization, and I am
hopeful that it will remain a part of final law.
In the area of, in particular, both the treatment of
aircraft employees and passenger experience, supporting mental
health and breaking down barriers is a top priority of many of
ours. It is why I joined Chairman Graves, Garret Graves, in
urging the FAA to modernize its mental health protocols and
take immediate steps to dismantle barriers that discourage
individuals from seeking care.
I do appreciate in your testimony that you referenced the
FAA's Mental Health and Aviation Medical Clearances Rulemaking
Committee. I certainly, as do others, urge swift release of the
report that comes from that committee and ask, sir, for your
commitment here today in supporting making mental health and
the treatment, in particular, of aircraft employees a top
priority within FAA's regulatory environment.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, sir. It is a top priority, and I think
it's long overdue to update the approach to mental health, and
just treat these as health issues, and have a clearer path to
treatment, and get people back in the cockpit as quickly as
possible.
Mr. Molinaro. Yes, we certainly acknowledge the rise in
mental health concerns across America. They are made even more
dangerous in confined environments like aircraft, and certainly
men and women who are flying or participate in keeping us safe
in that arena deserve adequate care. So, I certainly look
forward to the progress and urge swift action.
Another question that I just wanted to touch on as it
relates to advanced air mobility, a topic that we all have
focused on pretty acutely, can you provide us a timing on the
powered lift?
As far as I know, the FAA committed to completing it in
2024. I am certainly interested, as others, in hearing your
insights and hearing what stage of development the SFAR is in.
Mr. Whitaker. So, that rule is under development, and we do
expect a final rule by the end of the year.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Whitaker. I want to reinforce
my support of your efforts. In response to a comment and
question from my colleague from Massachusetts, I just would
note, the FAA, when it desires to, has a great deal of
influence on landside activity at airports. Having managed one,
I know that firsthand. And certainly, when there needs to be
FAA clarity, I encourage it.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time
to Mr. Nehls.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, again, sir.
In the letter, again, it is critical to provide the agency
an opportunity to conduct research and determine mitigations.
We talked about the research. I mentioned to you, sir--and
thank you for being here--I mentioned to you Japan, New
Zealand, Australia, Canada. They are all operating with pilots
over the age of 67. Do you think it would be a good idea to
maybe reach out to those countries and ask them, hey, how is it
working for you, Canada to the north? I mean, any issues with
this?
I mean, we are all human beings. Any issues? Do you think
that would be maybe a good idea to try to help accomplish what
you asked for in this letter, to conduct research and determine
mitigations?
Mr. Whitaker. Certainly, if the legislation is passed, we
will look at that option.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. I think it is very, very important because
it is all there for you.
I mentioned--I talked a little bit about the 135s, right,
these part 135 operators that are flying the millionaires and
billionaires. A lot of people can't fly that in this room here.
They are flying around the millionaires and the billionaires,
and those pilots can be 67 years old. And the FAA is OK with
that. Correct?
I mean, it's--they can fly 67 years old, and fly the
millionaires and billionaires in the same airspace. Ambrosi
argued with me on that one. The ALPA president said, oh no,
they don't operate in the same--he is not being truthful. They
fly in the same airspace. You would agree with that?
Mr. Whitaker. Do I agree that they fly in the same
airspace?
Mr. Nehls. Yes.
Mr. Whitaker. They do, yes.
Mr. Nehls. So, how can we allow pilots to be 67 to fly the
millionaires and the billionaires, but not allow Delta, United,
and American to do it when we know we have a pilot shortage?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, we don't set these age limits. The
Congress does that.
Mr. Nehls. I know it, and we are going to fix it. We are
going to fix it today.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Sheriff. I recognize
the patient gentlelady from California, Ms. Brownley.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that.
Welcome, Mr. Administrator. Thank you for being here. Last
week, we learned again about Spirit AeroSystems, and they
incorrectly drilled holes in the fuselage. I am wondering if
you know at this point in time, has FAA determined how many
aircraft were delivered to customers with these problems, and
what actions are being taken to address this newest problem
with Boeing and its supplier?
Mr. Whitaker. So, we are working with Boeing to understand
what happened here, and so, we are investigating that piece of
it.
These are small rivets that hold a window in place. So,
likely what that means is it's--well, we know it's not to
compliance, so, we want to understand why it has not been
manufactured per design, and then we will see what corrective
actions need to be taken to repair the windows, and when that
has to happen.
Ms. Brownley. I am talking about incorrectly drilled in the
fuselage, that they had drilled holes that were too close to
the edge.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, those were around a window holding.
Ms. Brownley. Oh, they--OK.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, in the fuselage.
Ms. Brownley. OK. Very good, very good. So, the House FAA
reauthorization bill would create a new Deputy Administrator
for Safety and Operations to engage in the certification and
operational approval of lifesaving technologies.
Can you share your thoughts on how technology will improve
aviation safety, and how you would use the new Deputy
Administrator role to further advance technologies?
Mr. Whitaker. I think that technology has been one of the
great tools that we have had to reduce the accident rate in
aviation, and I think there is a lot of benefit in expanding
what is available, particularly into GA aircraft, to provide
more situational awareness in the cockpit.
I think the focus needs to be looking at ways to bring that
kind of technology to market as quickly as possible,
recognizing the positive impact that it has on safety. So, I
can see that role helping to facilitate that action.
Ms. Brownley. So, the Deputy Administrator would be really
responsible for trying to really prioritize this within the
organization?
Mr. Whitaker. I think we always want to prioritize safety,
but it would be an additional resource to have perhaps quicker
implementation.
Ms. Brownley. Great. Thank you for that. The FAA and PASS,
the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, have been in
collective bargaining for over 2 years now. What is the status
of that?
Mr. Whitaker. My understanding is that the vast majority of
terms have been agreed. There are, as happens in these types of
things, a handful that are still outstanding. We are committed
to working as quickly as possible to try to get to a final
resolution.
Ms. Brownley. I understand that following the January 24
FAA approval of the 737 MAX 9 inspection plans, both Alaska and
United began to return aircraft to service. Do you know how
many aircraft remain to be inspected?
And have you heard from these airlines what their total
estimated losses have been since the original grounding?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have any information on the financial
impact of this, and I am sure they are dealing directly with
Boeing.
As far as the number of aircraft returned to service, I
think it has been about 90 percent so far. I don't have a
precise number, but most of them have been returned to service.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. You didn't want to yield your time
to the gentleman from Texas?
Ms. Brownley. I thought about it, but I thought I would
pass.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ms. Brownley. I
recognize the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Kean.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I
would like to thank Administrator Whitaker for being here
today.
Runway safety is a critical aspect of aviation, and many
runway instances and near-misses have been reported over the
past year. And you outlined in your testimony the actions the
FAA has taken to address these risks. What are some of the
challenges you still face in addressing such safety risks?
Mr. Whitaker. I think--we don't have a lot of direct
barriers, other than sort of capacity of manpower. So, we have
dispatched runway safety teams to virtually every major airport
in the country to review the geometry of the airport and to
assess what technologies might be helpful, whether it's as
simple as lighting and/or signs, or a more complex surface
awareness technology. It's the surface awareness technology in
the tower that's the most helpful, and I think that's sort of
the long pole in the tent at this point.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. OK. How is the FAA addressing
workforce challenges, particularly in terms of acquiring and
maintaining the expertise necessary for certifying new
technologies such as unmanned aircraft systems and advanced air
mobility technology?
Mr. Whitaker. So, these new technologies do present
challenges for us on the certification side. There are a lot of
new systems, a lot of new capabilities that are new to
aviation. So, bringing in the right workforce to work those
issues is an ongoing challenge. We are competing with all these
companies out there that are developing those technologies, but
we are working to make sure we have those resources in place.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. What is the FAA doing to ensure
that the agency is ready to fully implement the FAA
reauthorization legislation, which the Senate has yet to act
on, when signed by the President and enacted into law?
Are you doing anything to anticipate your reauthorization
in-house?
Mr. Whitaker. Are you talking about the new legislation?
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Yes.
Mr. Whitaker. So, when that legislation is complete, we
have a process that we will run to identify the projects for us
that come out of that, and set up a sort of a program
management approach so that we are tracking those, trying to
meet the deadlines and, if the deadlines are not achievable,
communicating that as quickly as possible. But I think the key
will be open communication with the committee.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. If I may, I would recommend there
has got to be broad agreement. And as you can see and this
administration must be able to see, between what this committee
and this Chamber, as well as what the Senate is looking at,
that you can anticipate what is coming in a number of areas.
Mr. Whitaker. Right.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. So, I would anticipate--if I may,
if you can also anticipate some of those efforts.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, sir.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. And with that, I will yield the
remainder of my time to Mr. Nehls from Texas.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, sir.
In your early testimony, you talked about--you established
an--I think it was an independent Safety Review Team for the
Boeing situation. Is that correct, to look at Boeing?
Mr. Whitaker. There was an independent Safety Review Team
established last year, before I came, in response to near-
misses.
Mr. Nehls. Sure.
Mr. Whitaker. And they put out a report in November.
Mr. Nehls. And I am all about safety. I know you are.
Everybody in America wants to have--we got the greatest
aviation--I mean, our reputation is rock solid. We are safe. We
have done a very good job in this country as it relates to
aviation safety.
Could you consider asking a group like that to go review
some of the records from Japan, New Zealand, and Canada, to
look at it? I mean, it's a Safety Review Team. Get the records.
Ask them, hey, tell us a little bit about your history over
here, and your programs, and having these pilots at 67 flying
around up to 70. How is it working out?
Don't you think that would be very useful information, not
only for Congress here, but for the FAA, the Administrator
specifically?
Mr. Whitaker. If that legislation does raise the age, we
will certainly look at all the tools available, absolutely.
Mr. Nehls. Absolutely, and I think that's fantastic, even
with the--like the part 135s. I mean, are you aware of any
issues related to, like, part 135s?
I mean, has your office received phone calls about
potential issues related to all the 135 operators that are
flying right now while we are having this conversation?
You get all the data, don't you? I mean, are you a
receptacle of a lot of the complaints and the data, safety
regulations as it relates to part 135?
Mr. Whitaker. We would certainly look at that data as part
of that.
Mr. Nehls. Yes, up to--do you feel the--I mean, are you
aware of any issues with these pilots flying around in the same
airspace as Delta at age 67 with the part 135s?
Mr. Whitaker. I have not looked at the data to see if there
are any issues around that.
Mr. Nehls. I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Sheriff.
I will take a moment of personal privilege here. The
staffer on my right keeps screwing up this list, I have had
enough of this, and so, we are going to go ahead and fire him.

Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Seriously, to my right is Chris
Senn, who has served in our military, got a master's in
aviation, a new entrant in the market, has a law degree, and
has been an incredible asset to this committee as we have gone
through and built this near-perfect aviation bill.
I think this is going to be the last subcommittee action
this week, and I just want to take a minute. He is going to be
taking off at the beginning of next month, and I just want to
thank him for his dedicated service, working in a bipartisan
manner with the entire aviation team and, I will say it again,
has just been a tremendous asset to the committee, and I really
do appreciate his service.

Mr. Graves of Louisiana. But I did want to fire him before
he was able to resign.

Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, Chris, thank you very much. I
really do appreciate your service and friendship, and good
luck.
With that, I recognize the gentleman from California, Mr.
DeSaulnier, for 5 minutes.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like
to add my thanks to your staff.
I also want to, right at the beginning, say to Mr. Nehls, I
am too old to yield any time to you, so, you are not going to
get any of my time.

Mr. Administrator, you have a long, illustrious career, and
I agree with many of the comments, but you have seen this
industry your organization and the industry regulates, both the
manufacturers and the airline companies. Clearly, the world has
changed. And I worry--you mentioned this in your opening
statements--it's the near-misses, it's the manufacturing
problems, it's NOTAMs, it's runway incursions. All of those
things, to me, send bright red warning signs.
And what I hear from you so far is you accept that. Not to
be Pollyannaish, but we can't rest on our laurels. And I am
afraid, in many of these hearings prior to you getting your
position, my sense is that the FAA was resting on its previous
track record. And quite frankly, your organization reminds me
of NASA just before the Challenger disaster and the observation
by the Commission, the institutional deviation. But with you,
it is writ large into the culture. So, that is a comment, the
safety culture of these companies.
The perfect storm to me is this long, wonderful
relationship between the Department of Defense, the military,
and aviation, both contractually and manufacturing, and
supplying workforce, and then this changing at the same time we
have issues around climate change, and we are coming out of
COVID. Airbus and Boeing, they had great profits after
consolidation, and now Boeing is losing money, and Airbus is
close to losing money.
Similarly, in your conversations with the air carriers, the
commercial air carriers, enormous pressure. Warren Buffett had
a great line about investing in airlines. He said, ``I have an
800 number. I call at 3 o'clock in the morning to say, `This is
Warren Buffett, I am afraid I am going to invest in air stocks
again. Please talk me out of it','' but he still did it.
So, this safety culture versus the risk assessment, from
the details in the FAA reauthorization, one of the parts that
we put in there in the case of Alaska, the root cause can go
back and find out who actually worked on that plane, what hours
they worked on. I am told Airbus has that information when they
do it. So, those simple things from the safety culture writ
large, I would like your response.
And as you talk to the CEOs, who are under enormous
pressure coming out of COVID, when we kept them in business,
and with ridership going up to make--to avoid losses in an
investment market that can move very quickly away from them,
that would create greater damage.
And then, on top of that, you have got Boeing that is not
going to be able to supply the product that they are
contractually already into, and have serious financial
disincentive to delay that too long.
So, that is a long question about safety culture. How do
you maintain a safety culture or return to that safety culture
that we used to have, and I think we have lost?
And we are one disaster away from the industry imploding.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. I think you have
hit on some really true points. I have been reemphasizing since
I have been at the agency that we can't rest on our laurels. We
have to be ever-vigilant to look for risks in the system, and
that has been the focus for the past 3 months.
And culture and safety is really important, and it is one
of the things we are going to be looking at with Boeing. We
have got a safety culture review that was commissioned as part
of the certification reform legislation that is going to be
complete later this month, and I think that will be
informative.
But at the end of the day, the goal is to make safe
airplanes. And if you don't have that safety culture, I think
it is hard to make safe airplanes. So, we are going to be very
focused on that, on the quality process, and really looking at
wherever the data takes us as we do this audit. We have to get
back to a culture where safety is first. I don't care what's
second, but safety has to be first, and that's where we need to
get.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And on the operational side, on the NOTAMs
and the near-misses, same thing. I have talked to pilots who
really express--and air traffic controllers--that we are
pushing a lot of product from pressure from the operators.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, that's right. And I think, in my realm,
controllers was one of the first orders of business. It's a lot
of folks working overtime, and have been doing so for years.
And that's not a sustainable thing, in my view. So, hiring as
many controllers as we can, and looking at fatigue as a risk
that needs to be mitigated is our approach there.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito . Thank you. I now recognize
myself for 5 minutes.
Mr. Administrator, I want to thank you for being here
today, and I know that it was touched upon by a couple of my
colleagues already, but I have some further questions.
Ninety-two days ago, you were copied on a letter that was
sent to the Transportation Secretary by members not only of
this committee and other committees, but by the chairman of the
subcommittee, the chairman of the full committee, and 68 other
Members of the House. The letter asked very straightforward
questions about the Biden administration's plan to house
illegal immigrants and migrants at FAA sites and airports, some
of our largest transportation hubs in this Nation, including
one that's just blocks away from my district at JFK Airport. We
requested a response by November 20, 2023. Today is February 6,
2024, and we haven't gotten any response.
So, I would like to submit the letter for the record--
again, signed by 68 other Members of the House, sent 92 days
ago.

Letter of November 6, 2023, to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary, U.S.
Department of Transportation, from 70 Members of Congress, Submitted
for the Record by Hon. Anthony D'Esposito
Congress of the United States,
Washington, DC 20515,
November 6, 2023.
The Honorable Pete Buttigieg,
Secretary,
United States Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE,
Washington, DC 20590.
Dear Secretary Buttigieg:
We are deeply disturbed by reports that the Federal Government is
allowing for and encouraging the use of our Nation's airport
infrastructure as temporary shelters for illegal immigrants. We
adamantly oppose these ill-conceived plans that blatantly ignore the
true crisis at hand and would inappropriately utilize America's
infrastructure. Our Nation's airport infrastructure was built to
facilitate commerce and transportation, not to serve as housing for
unvetted and undocumented migrants. We request that you enforce public
airport grant assurances and reject such plans.\1\

As you are aware, our Nation's southern border is an uncontrolled
and unmitigated disaster. Untold numbers of illegal immigrants cross
our borders unchallenged every single day. Over six million illegal
immigrants have entered the United States and been apprehended under
President Biden's failed leadership.\2\ Many are then released into the
United States, some of whom will presumably never be seen again.\3\ The
Biden-Harris Administration's abject failure to protect our border or
support policies that will keep America secure is an unconscionable
dereliction of the most fundamental duty the Federal Government has to
the citizens of this country.

Unsatisfied with the indignity of our unsecure southern border and
incapable of dealing with the effect its failed policies have had,
turning every state into a border state, this Administration is now
reportedly proposing to transform our Nation's airports into migrant
camps.\4\ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed
housing 60,000 migrants at four public airports and various other
facilities in New York and New Jersey.\5\ These airports and their
communities rightfully fear being transformed into larger versions of
Chicago O'Hare International Airport, which has reportedly converted
portions of its terminal into a shelter for hundreds of migrants.\6\ At
a time when the Administration is proposing higher screening
requirements on known airline crewmembers due to security risks, we are
extremely concerned about the lack of regard for security risks posed
by housing thousands of unknown persons at airports, many of which
support passenger air service and host sensitive military
facilities.\7\

Airports are generally required to request permission from the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) before using aeronautical land
and facilities for nonaeronautical purposes, like the housing of
migrants, on an interim basis.\8\ These provisions prevent governments,
including the Federal Government, from abusing taxpayer investment in
aeronautical facilities and commandeering them at below-market rates
for nonaeronautical and incompatible purposes. It is your
responsibility to direct the FAA to reject any attempt by a Federal,
state, or local agency to use airport facilities for such a
nonaeronautical and incompatible purpose as housing migrants.

cc: The Honorable Rick Larsen, Ranking Member, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure.
The Honorable Michael Whitaker, Administrator, Federal Aviation
Administration.
Mr. D'Esposito. And since we haven't heard back, I would
like to pose the questions from the letter to you right now.
How many and which airports regulated by the FAA currently
host temporary or permanent shelters for illegal immigrants or
other persons?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have any information about that.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK. I also want to point out that probably
not mentioned in the letter--and I know wasn't mentioned by my
colleagues--I took a visit to JFK Airport just days after this
site was apparently approved. I coordinated with Mayor Adams'
office, I coordinated with the port authority, TSA.
And I spent a career in the NYPD as a detective. And one of
the most startling things that I found when I got to JFK
Airport was not the fact that the FAA or the city of New York
actually had me go all the way to JFK Airport only to tell me
that the meeting was canceled and they were not going to allow
me to tour the facility, but the biggest concern that I have is
that there is zero communication amongst agencies at that
airport. Nobody knows who's in there, nobody knows what's going
on.
I mean, it is a transportation hub, probably one of the
largest in the country, and we have people just wandering the
streets coming out of this facility. I am not sure how anyone
thought that this was a good idea.
Has the FAA received or granted any request from an airport
or a local, State, or Federal agency between January 20, 2021,
and today to temporarily use a facility for purposes of hosting
a migrant shelter?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have direct information. I am happy
to respond after with a response to that.
Mr. D'Esposito. To what extent has DHS consulted with the
FAA about the appropriateness of proposing to house migrants at
airports?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have any direct information about
that.
Mr. D'Esposito. If DHS has consulted with the FAA, what has
been the FAA's response?
Mr. Whitaker. Again, I have no direct information on this.
Mr. D'Esposito. Committee staff asked in a followup email
if the FAA could provide a detailed description of any analysis
or assessment of the DHS housing plan, or any other instance of
airport migrant housing that has been conducted by the FAA in
accordance with the FAA's safety risk management policy.
The decision to approve housing of migrants poses a serious
security threat and represents failure of the Biden
administration's disastrous border policies.
Does the FAA have a plan in place to ensure that any of
these sites, even the ones that perhaps you don't know about
yet, will no longer be used to house migrants?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have any information about that.
Mr. D'Esposito. So, you are the Administrator of the FAA,
and you don't have any information on any FAA locations that
have housed migrants or could potentially house migrants?
Mr. Whitaker. To my knowledge, there are no FAA locations
that house migrants.
Mr. D'Esposito. To your knowledge, are there any FAA
locations that were approved to house migrants?
Mr. Whitaker. I mean, I don't consider an airport an FAA
location. Maybe you are talking about airports, but----
Mr. D'Esposito . You were--the FAA has to
approve in order for them to become migrant shelters.
Mr. Whitaker. We approve use--community use agreements,
yes.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK, and at no point did the FAA think that
perhaps it was a bad idea to house migrants in these locations?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have any information on what FAA was
thinking before I got there.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK, so, when did you take reins as
Administrator?
Mr. Whitaker. The end of October.
Mr. D'Esposito. The end of October. OK, so, on November 6,
2023, was when the letter was sent. It is now February 6, 2024.
We still haven't received a response.
Will you commit today in front of this committee that in 1
month, you will respond to the questions that were asked in
this letter?
Mr. Whitaker. One month from today I will, yes.
Mr. D'Esposito. From 1 month today. So, by March 6 of 2024,
we will have an answer to all of the questions?
Mr. Whitaker. Yes.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you very much.
I now recognize from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chairman. Today, I want to focus
on the constant helicopter noise we face in our district, in
New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District. It's a densely
populated, urban area. I have heard from countless constituents
about helicopters that fly at low altitudes for prolonged
periods of time, shaking apartment buildings and disrupting
enjoyment of public spaces such as our urban oasis of Liberty
State Park.
Residents are also concerned that helicopters have been
using new flightpaths without input or notice to residents. How
does the FAA monitor and enforce helicopter altitudes and
decibel limits in areas like New Jersey's Eighth Congressional
District and Liberty State Park?
Mr. Whitaker. So, we don't have direct authority over
noise, per se. But what we do have are operating rules for
helicopters. So, they are required to operate at certain
altitudes as they traverse land, but beyond that, it's a--they
fly routes according to what's available in the airspace.
Mr. Menendez. And the monitoring component, how do you
monitor their altitude?
Mr. Whitaker. Well, they monitor their own altitude. We
would get reports if there are altitude deviations. That could
come from a variety of sources.
But for all operations in the air, there are certain
minimum altitudes to be operated at.
Mr. Menendez. Understood. And what can the FAA do to
address persistent and burdensome helicopter noise?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I think the most effective tool that we
have found is community meetings sponsored by a Government
entity, usually an airport, that are open and inclusive, so,
include not only the immediately affected areas, but also areas
surrounding that, so that there is an ability to have a
community dialogue around solutions.
Mr. Menendez. Great, and that is a great segue. Last week,
I wrote to you highlighting the impact helicopter noise has on
the district. My office and the Hudson County Board of
Commissioners have received a growing level of complaints and
are requesting the opportunity to discuss the issue and
potential solutions during a public meeting with you or a
representative from the FAA. I want to formally invite you to
our district to experience this issue firsthand, and to work
together towards a solution by attending this public meeting
with the Hudson County Board of Commissioners.
Mr. Whitaker. We would be happy to have a representative
participate, provided it's, as I mentioned, a Government-
sponsored meeting, and one that includes a very broad
community.
And I think it's also useful to include zoning officials,
since some of this is also zoning related----
Mr. Menendez . Sure.
Mr. Whitaker . Which is outside of our domain,
as well, sir.
Mr. Menendez. Yes, absolutely, and we would be happy to
build a broad coalition of folks there and different
stakeholders to ensure that's a productive meeting for the
representative that's able to attend.
Switching gears, I am glad that the FAA has taken serious
steps to deal with terrible assaults and violent incidents
against flightcrews, and I commend the agency's efforts in
taking on this issue.
However, I am still concerned that assaults against
landside employees aren't receiving the same level of response.
These workers work directly with customers who are experiencing
delays, cancellations, or other complications with their
travel. The 2018 FAA reauthorization bill tasked the FAA with
implementing employee assault prevention and response plans.
Those plans have yet to be put into place, and I have tried to
fix this problem through my bill, the Airline Employee Assault
Prevention Act.
While I am pleased that the House-passed version included
pieces of this bill, the work is far from over. Mr. Whitaker,
do you know why these plans haven't been implemented yet?
Mr. Whitaker. I am not familiar with that specific plan.
I do share your concern about, obviously, assaults on not
only flightcrew, but in the airport. I think the airport space
becomes a little more complicated. You don't have the clear
authorities and the sort of captive environment, and it's
unclear, for example, what TSA's involvement might be, what the
local police involvement might be, what the airport's
involvement--so, I think the issue becomes murkier in the
airport environment.
This issue has been raised to me, and I have had some
discussions with airport directors about that. So, it is an
issue of concern.
Mr. Menendez. Yes, and we understand it's a jurisdictional
issue, and that's what part of our legislation was meant to
address, to ensure that these assault prevention plans cover
both the airside and landside. And so, I want to make sure we
work with all partners to ensure that all folks and employees
are kept safe, especially sort of as some of these travel
challenges lead to upset passengers and they have unfortunate
impacts.
So, I look forward to working with you on this issue, and I
appreciate your testimony here today. Thanks so much.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you, sir, yes, we will follow up on
that issue with you.
Mr. Menendez. Great. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Menendez. I now recognize
Mr. Massie for 5 minutes.
Mr. Massie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Whitaker, I have heard from several aircraft
manufacturers and component manufacturers that the
certification process at the FAA has become even more long and
arduous than normal in a post-COVID era. Some of this they
attribute to people not returning to work in the office yet
after COVID, some of it is because there are a lot of new
employees who don't have as much familiarity as the more senior
employees did who left.
What are you doing or what do you plan to do to improve
this certification process so that U.S. companies can be
competitive, and improve safety and efficiency for our pilots
and passengers?
Mr. Whitaker. So, it is a very important issue, and we have
a number of things that we are looking at doing.
One is creating more transparency in the process. So, we
identify where an application is, why it's not moving. So,
sometimes it's because we are still waiting for data, or
sometimes maybe we have the data, and we are not moving fast
enough. So, we want to get some certainty around that.
I think there has been a little bit of overcorrection
following the MAX events, frankly, a little more conservative
approach. And I think having clear leadership and clear process
so we can resolve decisions is an important part of that, and
we are looking at ways to do that. It's an important issue and
one we are working on.
Mr. Massie. There is another area of efficiency that I have
heard from people that may need to be addressed. And I might
not be articulating this exactly correctly, but a pilot
explained to me that when pilots have to leave for health
reasons, and then that health reason is overcome, and then they
try to get back into the system, that there's not enough
people, or that process is also being delayed and has a long
lead time. And I think that's particularly problematic, given
the chronic shortage of pilots. Is he correct in that? And is
there anything you can do about that?
Mr. Whitaker. He is correct in that. I have had two flight
instructors who both went through that, and they both
complained to me about how long it took. So, we are trying to
move that approach.
It's not unrelated to the Mental Health ARC that we have
stood up. Just trying to make the system clearer and be able to
get to decisions more quickly, so, that's something we are
looking at, as well.
Mr. Massie. Another thing in that line of questioning with
pilot shortages, training is a big issue, and getting pilots
through that process. And it just came to my attention that the
GI Bill, it's a great program for veterans, and it covers a lot
of things, but it doesn't cover some of the things that you
need to become a pilot. And I would think using a GI Bill to
get those hours that you need to become a certified pilot may
be more important than basket weaving, a degree in basket
weaving, which the GI Bill will cover.
So, would you be supportive of having more flexibility in
the GI Bill, so that we could use that money that these
veterans have earned in service to their country in order to
become pilots?
Mr. Whitaker. I absolutely would, and I would favor
treating pilot training the way you treat any other educational
endeavor to get a status. It's expensive to become a pilot, it
takes a long time. So, I would fully support that.
Mr. Massie. Another question that I have, we used to see
these notices at the airport that said you need to have a REAL
ID to fly come a certain date, and that date kept getting
pushed back, and now I don't see the signs at all. Are we going
to have to have a REAL ID that has the new and improved
driver's license, if you will, in order to fly any time soon?
Mr. Whitaker. That would typically be regulated by TSA, so,
I am not really familiar with that issue.
Mr. Massie. OK, because I think it is a concern. There was
a lot of bureaucracy that was implemented in order to do all
that.
One other question that I have is I know a lot of--maybe
not a lot, but there were some pilots who left because of
vaccine mandates, and I don't know if the air traffic
controllers had that same issue. But what are you doing to make
it easier for them to come back to work?
Mr. Whitaker. It's not an issue that I have run across. I
will look into that, and I am happy to respond.
Mr. Whitaker. But you are aware that some pilots did leave
because of the COVID vaccine mandate.
Mr. Whitaker. Well, that would be between the pilots and
the airlines, but I will--I can look into the controllers. It
is not an issue I have become familiar with, but I am happy to
look at it.
Mr. Massie. Well, if we are looking into the--I appreciate
you agreeing to look into that, because if we are looking into
the chronic shortage, which does affect issues that you do have
to deal with, I think that's an important thing to look at.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes.
Mr. Massie. So, I appreciate your time today, and good luck
finding all the inefficiencies. I am sure you will find all of
them, and you will have perfect solutions to everything.
And thank you for addressing the certification process,
because I think that is really important. We want to make sure
U.S. companies are competitive, and they can get their products
certified that will increase awareness and safety for pilots
and passengers.
Mr. Whitaker. I agree.
Mr. Massie. Thank you.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. Massie. I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Massie. I now recognize Ms.
Scholten for 5 minutes.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. I want to thank our chairman and
ranking member for hosting this hearing.
And thank you so much, Mr. Whitaker, for taking the time to
be here. Not only as a member of this committee, but as a
mother and a frequent flyer myself now because of this, this is
also a deeply personal issue. When I fly with my kids and back
home to my kids, the safety and security of air travel is
essential.
You have a mighty task in this new role, and we know that
you are up to it. I thank you for your patience in handling all
the questions today. I have two questions for you. One is
general for all air travelers and then another specific for my
district.
We have talked a little bit in this hearing today about the
differences in approval delegations. We on this committee may
understand the differences between design and manufacturing
approval delegations, but for the American people, they don't
necessarily know that. They know that hundreds of people died
in 2018 and 2019 because of the Boeing 737 MAXes. And they know
that now there are terrifying experiences happening to
travelers on essentially those same planes.
What are we doing to not only ensure safety, but that
assure that people can feel safe after this investigation
process?
Maybe more specifically, what are you specifically tasking
MITRE to examine in terms of reclaiming certain approval
authorities? And if you can, give some examples of that.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you. So, the MITRE tasking is to really
look at what has been delegated and what our options are for
reeling in that delegation, and what areas are being undertaken
by the manufacturer that could be done by a third party, for
example. So, really, it's a question of looking at having a
neutral third party overseeing parts of this process. So, we
will see what they come up with.
You're right. There is confusion between the design
delegation, which is really where a lot of delegation happens,
and manufacturing, where there is less delegation, but there
are functions that look like oversight, like quality control
that don't seem to be being properly executed. So, the audit is
designed to allow us to really understand what are the impacted
areas, why is it not working, and what are our tools for fixing
it, whether that's bringing a third party in to oversee it or
somehow change other incentives or the process.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. Again, for the sake of the
passengers, for the sake of the industry which we all rely on,
we implore you to make it clear in these studies what has been
done and what has been undertaken to assure safety for the
American people going forward.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes.
Ms. Scholten. My second question is a little bit more
district-specific. Grand Rapids is home to the Gerald R. Ford
International Airport. It is one of the busiest 75 airports in
the entire country, one of the first airports to return to pre-
pandemic levels. We had record travel numbers in 2023, close to
4 million travelers through the terminal, up 6 percent from a
previous record in 2019, and yet it has the oldest airport
tower of all of the top 75 busiest.
Currently, there are no standards for how and when we
replace these airport towers. I hope to change that through my
bill, which was included in the FAA reauthorization, which we
are hoping the Senate will act on any day now.
But the important thing is you don't need to wait for them
to act. The FAA owns this tower, and the community cannot
replace it until the FAA says so. Can you speak a little bit to
the importance of infrastructure in ensuring safety around the
country?
Mr. Whitaker. I can. Infrastructure is a huge challenge. We
have a lot of it at FAA, and a lot of it is really beyond its
useful life, including, for example, all of the high-altitude
control centers that are designed for no more than 50 years of
service, and they are pushing 60 at this point. The funding for
that has been a challenge over time, and maintenance falls
behind.
So, I can certainly look into that particular instance that
you have cited, but it is a problem throughout the NAS.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, and we would be grateful for you
having a look.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes. Thanks.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you again for your testimony today.
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Collins for
5 minutes.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good to see you there, Administrator Whitaker, and I guess
I want to kind of start out with--I mean, I have been running
like crazy, so, I had to change hats for a second.
But I had the opportunity last year to go to the Atlanta
airport. I am out of Georgia, and I visited the tower, the
airport, and TRACON. So, we are down to just one more facility
that we want to visit up there. And they are very impressive.
So, I know you have got your work cut out for you.
And like so many agencies and so many hearings that I
attend, I think one of the main themes that I get over and over
again is how we have such a lack of modernization and
antiquated--I don't care if it is software, hardware, whatever
it is, it seems like the Federal Government just doesn't do
anything to stay up to date or improve their technology.
So, last year, with NOTAM going down--and from my
perspective, it looked like the Department of Transportation
spent a lot of time on just changing the name of that acronym,
instead of updating that 30-year-old software, which was where
they should have had their focus. Can you tell me what steps
you have taken since your confirmation to speed up the
modernization of technology, where we are at on NOTAM, and what
other specific systems you may have updated?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I think one of the challenges that we
have is, as we do modernize, we get stuck with a lot of legacy
systems that are hard to take out of the airspace. Even some of
the systems that were in place before we were born are still
used. And sometimes it's the military that relies on those
systems, and sometimes it's just folks that have been flying a
long time. So, we end up supporting a huge amount of antiquated
systems, and that impedes our ability to modernize.
There has been a lot of modernization over the past 10 or
15 years. What you would have seen in the TRACON and the center
are new systems and, basically, a new platform for new
technologies to make the system more efficient.
But there are over 1,000 systems that make up the airspace.
Some of them are pretty old. And I think what we saw with the
NOTAM is we really need to have the redundancies in place to
make sure that, if there is a failure, it doesn't bring the
whole system to a halt. So, we are very focused on the
resiliency of that system.
And part of what I will be doing going forward is starting
to have conversations about what the next phase of
modernization is. I think the NextGen phase is over, and now we
need to talk about how these new technologies, advanced air
mobility, and drones are coming into the system, and how it's
going to operate in the future.
Mr. Collins. All right. One of the other policies that I am
focused on here in this committee is high-speed, high-altitude
travel and civil aviation, as a matter of fact. And as a matter
of fact, we got put into the FAA reauthorization an amendment
that states that the FAA needs to come up with a study on how
to certify new hypersonic engines.
And if you note, if you look at FAA--the European
counterpart, EASA, they already have issued a roadmap for high-
altitude operations for hypersonic and supersonic aircraft. So,
can you tell us what, if anything, the FAA is doing to prepare
similar guidance for American airspace?
And further, can you tell me what else the agency can do to
ensure that American companies continue to lead in this
innovative field?
Mr. Whitaker. I don't have a specific answer on the high-
altitude airspace, but it will be part of what we look at as we
talk about the airspace of the future, and we will also look at
what EASA is doing and what other jurisdictions are doing so we
don't have to reinvent the wheel.
But I think we need also our own comprehensive roadmap that
integrates these new technologies and gives us a way to bring
them on as quickly as possible while keeping that same level of
safety that we all want.
Mr. Collins. My time is almost up, but I just wanted to
make a last quick comment.
When I was at TRACON, they were about 40 percent down on
air traffic controllers. We use a lot of veterans, and they are
great people to put in those positions because they are very
organized and very dedicated. And I would just caution you, it
seems like we have made a move to get away from hiring people
on qualifications, and hiring them on classifications.
Mr. Whitaker. So, I can assure you that we hire everybody
on qualifications. And I can also tell you that we have just
recently put in changes to be much more flexible in how we hire
out of the military, because we are able to hire from the
military and put them directly into facilities. So, that's one
area that we are really trying to open the pipeline on.
Mr. Collins. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito. I now recognize Ms. Holmes Norton for 5
minutes.
Ms. Norton. I thank the chair and ranking member for
holding this hearing to learn more about the challenges the
Federal Aviation Administration is currently facing and to
emphasize the importance of passing a long-term FAA
reauthorization bill soon.
Mr. Whitaker, as co-chair of the Quiet Skies Caucus and the
Member who represents the District of Columbia, which is
plagued by aviation noise, I have been fighting to reduce
aviation noise in DC and across the country. While the safety
of the aviation system must be the FAA's priority, the FAA
needs to do much more to combat airplane and helicopter noise
which will harm the health, quality of life, and the structural
integrity of homes.
Last year, I got two provisions included in the House-
passed FAA reauthorization bill to combat helicopter noise in
DC. One of these provisions would require the FAA within 180
days to create and implement a helicopter noise-sharing
mechanism for all helicopter operators in the National Capital
region and to make the data collected accessible to the public
online. This data would help us develop additional solutions to
address helicopter noise.
My other provision would direct the Government
Accountability Office to conduct a study of reducing helicopter
noise in DC, almost all of which is generated by Government
helicopters. This study would be required to consider the
extent to which military operators consider operating over
unpopulated areas outside of DC for training missions, the
extent to which vehicles or aircraft other than helicopters
could be used for emergency and law enforcement response, and
the extent to which helicopter operators have assessed and
addressed the noise impacts of various factors of operating
helicopters, including altitude, the number of flights,
flightpaths, time of day of flights, types of aircraft,
operating procedures, and pilot training.
Mr. Whitaker, what, if any, steps is the FAA taking to
reduce airplane and helicopter noise over populated areas like
the District of Columbia?
Mr. Whitaker. What I can say is in the past several years,
they have made some improvements in that area. They have hired
specific folks who are focused on community engagement and, in
situations where airspace is being redesigned or where there
are persistent noise issues, they will engage with
organizations to have community meetings and understand the
views of the citizens and see if there are actually real-time
changes that can happen in the airspace to try to mitigate----
Ms. Norton . Well, we certainly haven't heard
it yet. It hasn't been felt here yet.
Mr. Whitaker. Yes, I don't know the specifics of DC. I know
that we are on a fairly tight footprint, and the approach paths
are fairly limited by the restricted airspace. So, there
probably aren't a lot of options beyond the north-south arrival
and departure for DCA. So, that may be a limiter in this case.
Ms. Norton. All right, thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you very much, I now recognize Mr.
Nehls for 5 minutes.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you so much.
Understand here, Mr. Administrator, I am not on this
subcommittee, so, they had to waive me on, so, I am the last
one in line here. But hopefully, we can finish this. And I
thank you so very much for your time. Obviously, this is very,
very important to the industry. It really is. This legislation,
obviously, has passed this House. It passed it overwhelmingly.
And now it's sitting there over in the Senate.
I think we beat the dead horse on part 135. Everybody
knows, the FAA knows that we have pilots flying around that are
67 years old, and these private aircraft with everybody else--
with Delta, and we fire them at the age of 65. And that just
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
I find this letter that was issued just a day or so before
the Senate markup of a bill that has lingered for over a year
on a matter that has been repeatedly proposed over 4 years, a
matter that--which you were asked specifically in hearings, you
had a hearing before the Appropriations Committee just a few
months ago, and you answered quite matter of factly about
faithfully executing the legislation of Congress, and I think
we agree with that. This is Congress' decision to make, and you
will implement once it's passed. Correct?
All right. So, now it seems like this letter, which I
believe is full of flaws, and I think we pointed those out--it
seems to have some opposition to raising the age. If you read
the letter, and you read between the lines, it appears that the
FAA--that you, sir--are against raising this age, and that's
just not true. You are not opposing it.
Mr. Whitaker. My intent was not to oppose it. My intent was
to identify the issues that we have identified during technical
assistance, which is around international compliance----
Mr. Nehls . Sure.
Mr. Whitaker . And around data for what this
means to raise----
Mr. Nehls . Yes, sir. And I think that we
have addressed all those issues with ICAO. When we raised the
age from 60 to 65, all those issues got worked out. The gray on
gray--remember all the gray on gray? ICAO did it. We obviously,
had it here, and now we don't even have the gray on gray.
So, the point is I think about--looking at your background,
you are a former pilot, and I think you are 62 years old. You
are 62 years old, right? And I think you have a 5-year term, 5
years? Do you think that we should give you a cognitive test
when you turn 65, before you finish your term? I do not believe
that we should give you a test to make sure that you are all
there, you got the cognitive--when you turn 65. I mean, we do
it for the pilots. We do it. They get their EKGs, they get
their physicals. I mean, that is a stringent process. We do it
for them. Why shouldn't we do it for you?
Mr. Whitaker. So, I think, with respect to regulating
airmen and the safety of the NAS, the medical certification is
there to protect people, so----
Mr. Nehls . I agree.
Mr. Whitaker . So----
Mr. Nehls . And you agree we have the safest
aviation record in the past 10 years. I mean, things are going
very, very well, knowing that we passed legislation that
allowed part 135 to fly to 67. We haven't any issues. Do you
have any issues right there with part 135 right now, any
concerns with that safety record?
Mr. Whitaker. As I said earlier, I have not looked at that
data.
Mr. Nehls. Well, I will help you. There is no problem
there. There is no problem. You've heard of Wheels Up? Do you
know who that is? Delta's own little private version of their--
right? I wonder how they would feel, the Delta CEO, if you
start raising concerns about their safety as it relates to part
131.
Dave, in the audience, this guy right here, has been at
Delta for 30 years, former Air Force spy plane pilot. He is
63\1/2\. America, we are going to fire this guy in 18 months.
It's an arbitrary number. We just come up with it, 65, let's
just fire him. He goes through all the testing, he does it all,
but we are going to fire this man because of that age.
But yet, sir, you are out there touting a project to
recruit retired, experienced military air traffic controllers,
but an existing, fully qualified, and not-yet-retired pilot is
somehow unsatisfactory.
Nobody in this hearing, my friend--I think Mr. Massie
brought it up once--talked about retirement age today. Nobody
brought it up because it passed this committee. It passed the
House of Representatives overwhelmingly, and now it's over in
the Senate. ALPA got beat over here, Ambrosi got beat. Now he
is kind of through a train wreck, and trying to get you to
confuse the other Members in the Senate with this letter,
making it sound like this isn't safe.
All the data is there. The live environment testing is
there. You can reach out to Japan, all these other countries.
You know that we have pilots flying at 67, part 135. It's all
there. All the data is there. And ALPA--as a matter of fact,
Ambrosi was served last night with a lawsuit, 2,500 ALPA union-
paying members filed a lawsuit on Ambrosi for a breach--a
breach of duty--for fair representation. Shame on him.
Let's get this done. And I think, sir, it is incumbent upon
you to get some clarification as it relates to this letter
before the Senate meets on Thursday. Would you be willing to do
that for me, look at this letter?
Mr. Whitaker. I am sorry. Would I be willing to do what?
Mr. Nehls. Would you be willing to look at this letter and
look at this, and try to say, hey, listen, there are some
problems with this letter, it's not true?
Mr. Whitaker. I think I have clarified the intent of the
letter.
Mr. Nehls. Very good. I appreciate that.
I yield back.
Mr. D'Esposito. The gentleman yields. Are there any further
questions from members of the committee who have not been
recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank the witness for his testimony. The committee
stands adjourned.

Appendix
----------
Questions to Hon. Michael Whitaker, Administrator, Federal Aviation
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Hon. Sam Graves
Question 1. What quality metrics will Boeing have to meet in order
for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to allow them to increase
their production rates of 737 MAX aircraft?
Answer. This past February, I directed Boeing to develop a
comprehensive action plan within 90 days to address its systemic
quality control and production issues. During the subsequent months,
the FAA worked closely with Boeing as it developed their roadmap and
plan for the path forward. This plan was required to incorporate the
results of the FAA's special audit as well as the findings and
recommendations from the expert review panel report required by Section
103 of the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act of
2020 (ACSAA). Boeing provided its comprehensive plan to the FAA on May
30, 2024, marking the beginning of the next chapter of ensuring
implementation and a renewed focus on safety at Boeing.
Question 2. Please describe the agency's current telework posture.
Can you detail what you expect it to look like at the end of this year?
Answer. The FAA's telework posture seeks to leverage the
flexibilities and benefits of a workforce with telework opportunities
while simultaneously balancing an in-office presence that meets the
Agency's mission requirements and drives continuous improvement in
organizational health and performance. In January 2024, we increased
our in-office presence with the expectation that most employees would
report to the office an average of four days per pay period. The
Administrator committed to periodically reassess the Agency's posture
to determine if any changes are needed.
Question 3. How is the agency ensuring sufficient on-the-job
training and peer-education is occurring in all FAA offices while using
telework agreements?
Answer. Training managers and supervisors on telework has been a
longstanding practice at the FAA. Most recently, we have focused our
efforts on ensuring success in a hybrid work environment through
enhanced training and performance management initiatives. We
incorporated hybrid performance management learning into the end-of-
year FY23 assessment process and shared best practices across the
organization on employee development and engagement. We have also
developed and launched Managing Hybrid Teams and Leading Organizational
Change trainings for managers, and a comprehensive Future of In-Person
Work webpage to provide resources for employees and managers.
Question 4.a. You have worked for the FAA more than once and spent
time in industry. Can you describe the benefit of seeing both sides and
gaining exposure to being regulated and being the regulator when it
comes to aviation safety?
Answer. This question reminds me of my decision to become a general
aviation pilot while at the FAA. It is one thing to read about planes
and the procedures for takeoff and landing, it is an entirely different
thing to be behind the flight deck; I have seen what works well and
what does not--up close. It is the same with having a multi-sector
approach to aviation. I am better able to lead the agency because I
understand the concerns from the perspective of the regulator and
industry, allowing me to build more bridges toward understanding
aviation safety more broadly and devising effective solutions.
Question 4.b. Does the agency offer or take advantage of
opportunities for exposing FAA staff to the operations of regulated
entities? Does the FAA have any mechanisms to do so? If so, please
describe.
Answer. Yes. In the Aircraft Certification Service (AIR), engineers
and inspectors are provided real-time, on-site experience. These
efforts facilitate on-site immersion with a wide range of applicants
dealing with various products and components, fostering a deeper
comprehension of the diverse stakeholders engaged with the AIR
organization.
Flight Standards (FS) also supports its employees interacting with
regulated entities within budget limitations. FS employees attend and
support industry educational events and industry events promoting
aviation where Aviation Safety Inspectors hear and see firsthand
applications of our policy decisions. FAA inspectors, pilots, and other
employees conduct oversight from the aircraft jumpseat during
operations of transport aircraft, perform ramp inspections during
ground operations, and observe and interact with certificate holders
such as 145 maintenance organizations on-site at their facilities,
among others. Certain offices have budgeted resources to allow
employees to meet with stakeholders for on-the-job training to get
better familiarization with their operations.
Question 5.a. What are the current guidelines for FAA employee
travel?
Answer. The FAA Travel Policy, Version 2, Effective November 1,
2016, establishes the agency's policies for official travel and
relocation for FAA employees.
Question 5.b. Does the agency encourage its inspectors, engineers,
subject matter experts, managers, and others to travel and visit
regulated entities in order to collaborate, share, and discuss? Both at
the regional and headquarters level?
Answer. Yes. FAA employees (managers, inspectors, engineers, and
subject matter experts) regularly interact with regulated entities,
including various types of inspections, surveillance activities, and
meetings. For example, Aviation Safety Inspectors regularly attend
Certificate Holders' Maintenance Review Boards, Safety Review Boards,
and Continuing Analysis and Surveillance System data review meetings.
Additionally, FS Managers, Deputy Directors, and Directors meet
periodically with Certificate Holder Senior Leadership during a variety
of meetings, including visits to the Certificate Holder's facilities.
Question 5.c. Does the FAA limit travel of its personnel?
Answer. Travel is limited to the performance of official business.
Question 6.a. Having served as FAA's Chief NextGen Officer
previously, what are your general thoughts on the successes and
failures of the program?
Answer. NextGen was always an ambitious endeavor, based on the
Joint Planning and Development Office's (JPDO) NextGen Concept of
Operations (ConOps) vision of a technologically advanced NAS and user
community. This vision was based on an understanding of what the needs
would be 15-20 years in the future as well as what the technology of
that future time would enable. As such, NextGen made numerous important
leaps forward (e.g., ERAM, SWIM, DataComm, ADS-B Out, RNAV/RNP, etc.,)
and misjudged the pace of some of the technological advancements that
would enable new capabilities (e.g., NAS Voice Switch). Nonetheless, we
adapted our vision to embrace new entrants that were not a part of the
original vision, such as allowing for the integration of exponential
growth in the civilian drone community alongside commercial space
enterprises at a pace that was not even considered possible 15 years
ago.
Question 6.b. Do you agree the agency should begin to look beyond
the NextGen brand for what is next?
Answer. According to the JPDO CONOPS (2010), NextGen was planned to
be a long-term project. It aimed to consistently improve by adding new
features to a modern framework, incorporating new technologies, and
addressing new mission requirements. Now, we have reached a point where
it makes sense to shift toward a new vision for the National Airspace
System (NAS). Looking ahead, the future NAS will continue to build upon
the progress of NextGen. However, it will also focus on researching,
designing, and constructing a system that goes beyond what was
originally imagined for NextGen, and implementing the NextGen
transition envisioned by Section 206 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of
2024.
Question 7. Please provide an update on all awards that have been
made and funds disbursed under the Airport Investment Partnership
Program since 2018. Additionally, please provide a status update on all
airports currently working with the FAA under this program, including a
timeline for approval for each project, and clarify which office at the
FAA is ultimately responsible for approving Benefit Cost Analysis.
Answer. In 2022, the FAA awarded a grant to Avon Park Executive
Airport (AVO) in Avon Park, Florida to help evaluate the feasibility of
participating in the AIPP. The grant was for $432,000 and the FAA has
disbursed more than $359,000 of the award.
The following airports are currently working with the FAA under the
Airport Investment Partnership Program (AIPP):
San Juan, Puerto Rico, Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport is owned by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority (PRPA). PRPA filed
its preliminary application on December 1, 2009. The FAA approved
PRPA's final application in a Record of Decision on February 25, 2013.
Aerostar Airport Holdings is operating the airport under a 40-year
agreement with PRPA.
Hendry County, Florida, Airglades Airport is a general
aviation airport in Clewiston, Florida. Hendry County owns and operates
the airport. The FAA approved Hendry County's preliminary application
on October 18, 2010. Hendry County and Airglades Airport, LLC submitted
a final application on August 8, 2019. The FAA issued the Record of
Decision on September 30, 2019. The FAA has issued three extensions to
allow the airport to come to a financial close, with the last extension
ending on April 22, 2024.
Avon Park, Florida submitted their preliminary AIPP
application on March 23, 2023. FAA issued a Federal Register notice
asking for comments on September 22, 2023. The comment period ended
November 21, 2023. FAA is developing the Record of Decision.
The Office of Airports works closely with the FAA's Office of
Policies and Plans to review the submitted Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA),
and assesses whether the societal benefits (appropriately measured by
the applicant) would exceed the total cost of the project. The Office
of Airports is responsible for all aspects of the Airport Improvement
Plan/Letter Of Intent program which includes a review of the BCA.
Questions to Hon. Michael Whitaker, Administrator, Federal Aviation
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Hon. Garret
Graves
Question 1. How is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
enabling industry and the public to capitalize on automation
technologies that improve safety, including working with industry and
other stakeholders to update and improve any regulations as needed?
Answer:
Rulemaking--The FAA recognizes that companies, communities, and
industrial sectors are eager to take full advantage of emerging
technologies in aviation. To ensure that the FAA can safely meet these
demands, the FAA often seeks advice and recommendations from industry
and the public on issues that could result in rulemaking from aviation
rulemaking committees and advisory committees. Aviation rulemaking
committees assist the FAA with obtaining a thorough understanding of
the problem being addressed by gathering information and data to
thoroughly evaluate the technical implications and cost impact of the
action under consideration to form recommendations. Similarly, advisory
committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act provide the
FAA with information, advice, and recommendations concerning rulemaking
activity on topics such as aircraft operations, airman and air agency
certification, airworthiness standards and certification, airports,
maintenance, noise, and training.
Automation Efforts--The FAA is an active partner in the evaluation
and assessment of new automation technologies with various
international Civil Aviation Authorities, the International Civil
Aviation Organization, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.
This supports the FAA's goal to set forth a unified and strategic
approach to foster global collaboration on safety oversight, enhance
safety assurance, support technological innovation, and streamline
recognition of bilateral agreements.
The FAA also works with government and industry-collaborative
organizations to learn about new aviation safety technologies,
typically well before they become available for deployment. Many of
these new technologies bring focused, assistive automation to aircraft
and crewmembers. Automation can improve the accuracy and consistency of
decision-making and results, reduce flight deck workload to prevent or
cope with unusual conditions, and enable air traffic to flow more
efficiently and at a higher capacity. The FAA's actions take various
forms to enable safe and effective use of automation. Where
appropriate, we develop guidance and minimum performance standards for
automated functions and undertake certification and operational
rulemaking that enables and encourages the further use of automation.
For example, to improve safety and situational awareness on the
airport surface, the FAA has issued guidance (Advisory Circular: 150/
5220-26) [https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/
150_5220_26_change_3_
consolidated.pdf] encouraging airports with Airport Surface Equipment,
Model X (ASDE-X), and Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC) to
voluntarily equip their vehicles that regularly operate in the airport
movement area with Vehicle Movement Area Transmitters (VMATs), which
use an ADS-B transmitter to broadcast a position which is received by
various ATC ground stations and aircraft on or near the airport and
presented on an ATC or vehicle display. Since 2013, the FAA has made
available grants to airports that cover 75 percent of the purchase and
installation cost of VMATs, for the first 75 units installed. Because
of the specialized nature of this equipment, installation costs are
typically between $6,000-$8,000 per unit. As of April 2024, 33 airports
have equipped all or a portion of their vehicle fleets, totaling 2,102
equipped vehicles. There are airports (e.g., SFO) that have voluntarily
agreed to require that all vehicles in the movement area be equipped
with VMATs. These technologies coupled with infrastructure improvements
under our Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program ensure that we have
a multi-pronged approach to improving surface safety. As of April 2024,
103 RIM locations have undergone site-specific enhancements including
taxiway reconfigurations and changes to lighting, signage, and
markings. The RIM program has achieved an approximate 69 percent
overall reduction of incursions at locations with RIM mitigation.
Question 2. What is the FAA doing around human factors to better
understand the benefits of automation aviation technologies, for the
purpose of informing regulatory efforts and risk determinations?
Answer. The FAA is actively integrating human factors
considerations into aviation safety oversight efforts to inform
regulatory decisions and mitigate risks associated with automated
aviation technologies. Human factors experts in the FAA with a focus on
operations or maintenance are informing the development of guidance and
policy to integrate human factors seamlessly into our processes,
fostering a robust and adaptive aviation safety environment. For
example, in compliance with the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and
Accountability Act, we are currently updating FAA Order 8900.1, Flight
Standards Information Management System (FSIMS), to develop sections on
Human Factors and the Aircraft Evaluation Division Human Factors roles
and responsibilities to ensure a unified approach in operational
evaluations.
Additionally, the FAA is funding multiple lines of research on the
benefits and potential human factors vulnerabilities involved with the
design and operation of advanced automation. For example, one research
study is investigating the impact of automated system behavior, logic,
and limits on pilot performance. Other research is analyzing operations
and safety data to understand the impact of control and information
automation on accidents and incidents. The results of the research will
inform FAA policy and guidance material on how to evaluate these
proposed automated systems for safe implementation. The FAA is also
requiring aircraft type certification applicants to document any
assumptions related to human factors as part of their system safety
analysis and to identify pilot training requirements.
Another example of FAA-funded automation research provided data on
leveraging automation benefits and risks. The results were considered
in the development of FAA Advisory Circular 120-123 Flightpath
Management (11/2022), which includes guidance for pilot training and
operations to fully benefit from automated systems.
Finally, the FAA chairs the Automation Working Group, under the
ICAO Personnel Training and Licensing Panel, which provides
international leadership on leveraging advanced automation.
Question 3. With the evolution of automation technology, how is the
FAA working with industry to ensure that pilots and other stakeholders
are adequately trained and prepared to interact with and manage these
helpful advanced assistive technologies?
Answer. The FAA continues to work closely with industry
stakeholders, including manufacturers, operators, and training
providers to ensure pilots and other stakeholders are well-equipped to
effectively interact with and manage aircraft systems that employ
advanced automation technologies. By fostering a collaborative and open
dialogue with industry stakeholders, the FAA has demonstrated its
ability to stay ahead of the technological curve and ensure the
efficient integration of these technologies, while also prioritizing
aviation safety in the aviation industry.
The FAA utilizes the Flight Standardization Board to determine the
requirements for pilot type ratings, to develop minimum training
recommendations, and to ensure initial flight crew member competency.
The board's activity culminates in a Flight Standardization Board
Report (FSBR). The FAA provides an FSBR for certain entrant aircraft,
which creates the initial pilot training baseline. The FSBR is reviewed
for modifications to the aircraft throughout its lifecycle, which helps
to ensure pilots and crewmembers are aware of and trained on new
aircraft operations. Furthermore, we require the pilot training program
for each air carrier to be FAA-approved to ensure it is robust and
appropriate to the operator's area of operations and the technology
used with their aircraft. The aircraft manufacturers must develop
maintenance instructions before the aircraft receives FAA
certification, and then those instructions are used to train aircraft
technicians. This is an established process that ensures that the
technicians or repair facilities have the correct instructions to
appropriately maintain the new entrant aircraft. The FAA is also
collaborating with industry in an ASTM workgroup with the goal of
developing a new specification for the ``Standard Guide for Advanced
Air Mobility Maintenance Technician Qualification''.
Question 4. Is the FAA properly staffed and resourced to ensure
effective aircraft production oversight, including in its Integrated
Certificate Management Division?
Answer. The FAA has been staffed based on historical models and
assumptions regarding oversight of approximately 1,500 FAA production
approval holders, including those overseen by our Integrated
Certificate Management Division. However, the FAA is seeing a need for
additional Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASI) and Aviation Safety
Engineers (ASE) to achieve an increased presence and engagement with
our production approval holders and their suppliers to account for
changes across the industry, including significant staffing turnover
industry-wide over the last few years. These ASI and ASE resources will
also position us to conduct expanded oversight as these manufacturers
adapt their systems to incorporate safety management systems,
consistent with part 5 of title 14 Code of Federal Regulations.
Question 5. What inefficiencies have you noticed in the
Administration since becoming Administrator? From your perspective, how
do you propose we improve such inefficiencies?
Answer. We recognize some of our internal FAA information systems
use older technology, and we see opportunities to capture efficiencies
if we could modernize our computer infrastructure. The key is to
identify work we could do faster, with fewer steps, and identify the
modern technology that can support it.
We need to streamline our hiring to get new hires onboard, and get
them trained for their new jobs, to help us meet our mission.
Question 6. How is the FAA addressing workforce challenges,
particularly in terms of acquiring and maintaining the expertise
necessary for certifying new technologies, such as unmanned aircraft
systems and advanced air mobility technology?
Answer. In my role as the FAA Administrator, I like to look at
myself as the Chief Recruitment Officer of the FAA. Part of that is
looking at both the short-term and long-term approaches to making the
agency a workplace of choice. Our short-term approaches to address the
agency's immediate need include our robust Minority Serving Institution
Internship Program, and active engagement at job fairs, veteran
partnerships, and social media. We are also looking for new talent at
air shows, industry conferences, technical schools, and more.
Additionally, our Technical Operations Gateways Internship Program
gives college students six months of paid, hands-on developmental
assignments and the opportunity to learn about the national airspace
system that can lead to full-time FAA jobs upon graduation.
To increase the pipeline of new air traffic controllers, we are
working with colleges and universities in the Air Traffic-Collegiate
Training Initiative (AT-CTI) to expand their curriculums so that AT-CTI
schools can offer training that is equivalent to the FAA Academy. Once
implemented, graduates of the FAA-approved AT-CTI programs will still
need to pass the Air Traffic Skills Assessment exam, be selected for
employment by the FAA, and meet medical and security requirements. If
hired as trainees, these graduates will be able to move directly to on-
the-job training at the start of their employment instead of attending
the FAA Air Traffic Controller Academy before being assigned to a
facility as required today.
For the longer-term, we are meeting young people where they are to
get them excited about an aviation career. We have an Adopt-A-School
Program where we connect with fourth graders about STEM. And, we are
capturing the interest of gamers with our Airport Design Challenge,
which engages kids in kindergarten through 12th grade by using
Minecraft video games to design airports. deg.or high school students,
the FAA's workforce development grants aim to develop future pilots and
aviation maintenance technicians.
Additionally, the FAA's Aviation Safety (AVS) organization pursues
a multi-pronged approach to acquire and maintain the expertise
necessary for certifying new technologies. The following are examples
of the various efforts:
The Aircraft Certification Service is focused on
identifying emerging technical areas and specialties where new
technologies are likely to be certified and operationalized, and where
the FAA needs to expand or develop technical expertise to support this
growth.
The FAA's Chief Scientific and Technical Advisors Program
actively recruits individuals who have expertise relevant to emerging
technologies.
The FAA uses authorities such as On-the-Spot and direct
hiring for Engineers and Operations Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs).
We provide incentives such as leave enhancements
(included in job announcements), new hire salary flexibilities,
telework options, and degree completion programs. Specifically for
Operations ASIs, AVS offers incentives including higher entry-level
employee salaries (within the same grade); $10,000 relocation incentive
(with a 1-year service agreement) offered to applicants moving more
than 100 miles to their new duty location; and a $25,000 recruitment
incentive (with a 3-year service agreement) to Operations ASIs who
accept hard-to-fill positions.
The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 addressed drone
workforce challenges by implementing an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)-
Collegiate Training Initiative (CTI) program to ensure that graduates
are prepared for growth in commercial UAS. Additionally, the FAA works
closely with our Center of Excellence for UAS Research Alliance for
System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence (ASSURE) program and
with the FAA UAS test sites to promote STEM and inform the
certification and advancement of new technologies. The UAS-CTI
currently has 136 participating 4-year, 2-year, and technical colleges
and universities, and continues to grow.
Question 7.a. Where is the FAA on the certification of powered-lift
aircraft currently under consideration at the agency?
Answer. The FAA has published the final airworthiness criteria for
the Joby Model JAS4-1 and the Archer Model M0001 powered-lift aircraft.
Additionally, the FAA released Advisory Circular (AC) 21.17-4 Type
Certification--Powered-lift on June 10, 2024. This AC offers guidance
that will form the foundation for establishing certification criteria
for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. We will
continue to publish airworthiness criteria and guidance for other
powered-lift applicants to progress in the Advanced Air Mobility
industry.
Question 7.b. When can we expect the first powered-lift aircraft to
be certified?
Answer. Some powered-lift applicants project their aircraft to be
certified in 2025, however, there are still important certification
milestones for them to achieve prior to certification.
Question 7.c. Have the FAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency
(EASA) come to a final, or at least an interim, conclusion on where
there will be harmonization on powered-lift certification and where
there will be differences whether those differences allow for cross-
country validation or not?
Question 7.c.i. If so, please describe the conclusion.
Question 7.c.ii. If not, please describe why a conclusion, whether
final or interim, has not been reached.
Answer to 7.c., 7.c.i., & 7.c.ii. In June, the FAA released
Advisory Circular (AC) 21.17-4 Type Certification--Powered-lift on June
10, 2024. This AC offers broad guidance that will form the foundation
for establishing certification criteria for electric vertical take-off
and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency
(EASA) also updated their special condition for vertical take-off and
landing (SC-VTOL) reflecting agreements made with the FAA in areas of
performance requirements, including safe flight and landing, handling
qualities, and single point failures. The FAA and EASA will continue to
work together, where possible, to harmonize their certification
requirements. We recognize, however, that the United States and the
European Union have different operational constructs, which affect
harmonization.
We expect more conducive coordination with EASA upon publication of
the final Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), Integration of
Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification and Operations; Miscellaneous
Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Airplanes. In the past, when the
FAA has found that it lacks sufficient experience regarding new
operations, the use of an SFAR has been an effective way to gain such
experience while enabling some degree of limited operations. Such SFARs
have typically temporarily enacted conservative safety approaches to
enabling operations, allowing both the FAA and industry to observe
those operations and then subsequently make safety improvements in a
later permanent change to the regulations. In the powered-lift proposed
rulemaking, the FAA stated that the purpose of the SFAR is to
facilitate powered-lift operations and permit the FAA to gather data
and better understand what a comprehensive permanent regulatory
framework should look like. The agency anticipates it will subsequently
develop permanent powered-lift regulations to safely enable powered-
lift operations by working with industry and international partners.
These efforts are performed in parallel with the FAA's international
partners' efforts and in alignment with international safety
requirements. This is an ongoing project and relies on data-gathering
processes to develop more permanent regulations.
Question 8. As aviation products become more reliant on software
updates versus hardware, is the FAA prepared to deal with iterative
software changes through amended type certificates and supplemental
type certificates? If so, please describe the FAA's preparations.
Answer. Yes. The FAA has been dealing with iterative software
changes to aircraft systems for several decades through the type
certification process, including type certificates, amended type
certificates, and supplemental type certificates, as well as through
the Technical Standard Order process. We have Advisory Circulars (ACs)
written for design approval holders that provide detailed guidance for
modifying software used in airborne systems and equipment. It is
important to note that the most recent ACs are fully harmonized with
EASA and were developed in collaboration with U.S. and European
industry (reference FAA AC 20-115D, Airborne Software Development
Assurance Using EUROCAE ED-12() and RTCA DO-178(), and AC 00-69, Best
Practices for Airborne Software Development Assurance Using EUROCAE ED-
12() and RTCA DO-178()).
Question 9.a. What is the status of the FAA's special Federal
aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift aircraft operations and
piloting?
Answer. On June 14, 2023, the FAA published the Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPRM), ``Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification
and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and
Airplanes'' for public comment. Since the close of the comment period,
the FAA has committed to draft a final rule which is now under review
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The FAA looks forward to
publishing this rule once OMB and interagency review has concluded.
Question 9.b. Has the FAA received any consistent concerns from
powered-lift manufacturers and/or potential operators on the draft
SFAR? Please summarize those concerns.
Answer. Overall, the majority of commenters expressed general
support for the FAA's approach to integrating powered-lift into the
national airspace system through expeditious rulemaking. However, they
also recommended a number of revisions to the FAA's proposal that they
believed would provide greater ability to quickly and safely integrate
powered-lift into the national airspace system. The following provides
a high-level overview of key issues raised by commenters.
Alignment with International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) requirements for powered-lift airman certification category:
Commenters requested the FAA align its requirements with transitional
measures in ICAO Annex 1 which allows for a powered-lift type rating on
an existing commercial pilot certificate with an airplane category or
helicopter class rating (i.e., no powered-lift category rating).
Aircraft dual controls requirement: Commenters sought
facilitation of flight training and supervised operating experience in
a powered-lift with a single functioning control and a single pilot
station, specifically requesting: (1) no requirement for dual controls
regardless of how the powered-lift will be used; (2) 100 percent
simulator training, which would relieve any requirement for dual
controls/in-aircraft training; and (3) non-traditional methods to
accomplish supervised operating experience. However, EASA's comment
supported the FAA's current requirement for a flight instructor to have
access to flight controls while providing instruction. EASA noted that
it considers a single center flight control accessible to both the
student and flight instructor to meet the intent of having dual
controls/access.
Amount of flight simulation training device time allowed
for a powered-lift rating: Commenters requested the use of a flight
training device instead of a full flight simulator, including the use
of a flight training device to perform all 50 hours of pilot-in-command
flight time required for a commercial pilot certificate with a powered-
lift category rating.
Visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules
(IFR) Fuel requirements: Commenters requested different variations of 2
themes: (1) performance-based fuel reserves, and (2) use of fuel
requirements specified for helicopters. Several commenters noted that
powered-lift incorporating innovative power sources could offer greater
operational capability if they were able to use energy reserves lower
than those currently prescribed for airplanes or helicopters. Other
commenters suggested applying helicopter fuel requirements to powered-
lift, asserting that powered-lift, like helicopters, have the
maneuverability and operational flexibility to land in more varied
locations.
Visibility Requirements: Commenters requested to utilize
the helicopter provisions existing in the regulations, as well as the
adoption of a performance-based approach. Several commenters suggested
applying helicopter weather minima rather than the airplane
requirements. Furthermore, several commenters contended that since
powered-lift could operate at speeds and maneuverability comparable to
helicopters, they should be permitted to use the visibility
requirements prescribed for helicopters or a performance-based
visibility requirement.
Minimum Safe Altitudes for operations conducted under
parts 91 and 135: Commenters requested: (1) the use of VFR minimum
altitudes specified for helicopters, and (2) performance-based minimum
safe altitudes. Commenters suggested the FAA consider the operational
capabilities of powered-lift, which are able to operate at low speeds
and have maneuverability similar to helicopters, and therefore apply
the VFR minimum altitudes prescribed for helicopters. Commenters also
suggested the FAA permit a performance-based approach when applying VFR
minimum altitude requirements to powered-lift.
Question 10. What is the FAA doing to ensure the agency is ready to
fully implement the FAA reauthorization bill when it is enacted into
law?
Answer. Prior to enactment, the FAA studied the House and Senate
bills to understand the actions that may be required, identified
resources and funding that could be used to fulfill those requirements,
and started building out project timelines and staffing needs.
Immediately following enactment, the agency began implementing the new
requirements and has achieved many of the milestones required in the
first 120 days.
Question 11. The House-passed FAA bill and the Senate's proposed
bill both include language to help veterans more seamlessly transition
their aeronautical skills and certifications to the civil sector. Is
the FAA willing to work with Congress to identify any barriers that
veterans face in getting an aviation job commensurate with their skills
when transitioning from military service to civilian life?
Answer. The FAA is proud of our support for veterans, who make up
nearly 36 percent of our workforce. We utilize a variety of hiring
flexibilities to transition veterans into civil service including
direct hire authority for veterans and military spouses, as well as
providing a pathway for military air traffic controllers to apply for
FAA Air Traffic Control Specialist positions through an experienced
controllers' bid. We are willing to work with Congress to identify
barriers that veterans face in transitioning from military service to
civil service.
Question 12. How many and which airports regulated by the FAA
currently host temporary or permanent shelters for illegal immigrants
or other persons?
Answer. In June 2023, the FAA received for review and approval a
draft License Agreement for the Temporary Use of Building Number 197 at
John F. Kennedy International Airport (Agreement) between the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port) and the City of New York
(City). The proposed use of Building 197 for asylum services was to
acclimate each asylum seeker for several days, not for long-term
residency, at the City's sole cost and expense. The FAA approved the
Agreement by letter on June 3, 2023, under a limited community use
exception that requires that: (a) the property is not currently needed
for aeronautical use; there is minimal revenue potential; and the
community use will not impact the aeronautical use of the airport. This
agreement expired on September 30, 2023. However, the Port requested
additional time to use the facility on September 25, 2023. The FAA
approved this request, extending the agreement to use the facility
through March 31, 2024. The Port requested an additional extension
through December 31, 2024. The FAA approved this extension conditioned
on the Port certifying its compliance with all federal grant
assurances, providing upon request FAA access to Building 197 for
inspection, terminating the use of Building 197 as a temporary shelter
at the expiration of the extension, and furnishing plans acceptable to
the FAA for the future non-shelter/non-residential use of Building 197.
On October 17, 2023, the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) sent
a letter to the FAA Director of the Office of Airport Compliance
detailing the use of Chicago O'Hare International (ORD) to accommodate
asylum seekers arriving by air and bus transportation. The letter also
confirmed that Chicago Midway International (MDW) airport facilities
were not being used for this purpose. On December 15, 2023, the
Associate Administrator for Airports sent a letter requesting the
status of migrant sheltering operations at ORD and MDW, to include a
plan to minimize overnight sheltering activities and to wind down the
use of airport facilities for these purposes. CDA confirmed again in
January 2024 that MDW was never used for this purpose. As of April 9,
2024, CDA confirmed that the migrant staging areas in the ORD shuttle
bus facility have been fully decommissioned and are no longer needed or
used for migrant processing purposes.
Question 13. Has the FAA received or granted any request from an
airport or a local, state, or Federal agency between January 20, 2021,
and today to temporarily use aeronautical facilities for purposes of
hosting a migrant shelter? If so, which? Has the FAA denied any?
Answer. The FAA has not received any request from an airport or
local, state, or Federal agency to temporarily use aeronautical
facilities to host a migrant shelter between January 20, 2021, and
today. The JFK scenario detailed in response to Question 12 involved
the use of a non-aeronautical warehouse with no access to aeronautical/
airfield facilities.
Question 14. To what extent has the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) consulted with the FAA about the appropriateness of proposing to
house migrants at airports? If DHS has consulted with the FAA, what has
been the FAA's response?
Answer. At this time, the FAA is unable to find any records of
communication between the FAA and the Department of Homeland Security
regarding the appropriateness of housing migrants at airports.
Question 15. What analysis, if any, or assessment of the DHS
housing plan or any other instance of airport migrant housing has been
conducted by the FAA in accordance with FAA's Safety Risk Management
Policy (Order 8040.4B)?
Answer. The FAA has no knowledge of a DHS plan to use airports to
house migrants and therefore has not conducted an analysis or
assessment. Order 8040.4B provides a risk management policy for FAA
lines of business to follow when hazards, risks, and associated safety
analyses affect multiple FAA lines of business. The FAA is unaware of
any on-airport migrant housing scenario impacting airport safety or
multiple FAA lines of business.

Cockpit Voice Recorders
Question 1. The FAA has not yet met the recommendations of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding Cockpit Voice
Recorders (CVRs) in commercial aircraft, resulting in ``unacceptable''
status per the NTSB. The current NPRM increases CVR time from 2 hours
to 25 hours for newly manufactured aircraft, which only partially
satisfies the NTSB's recommendations.
Question 1.a. Why doesn't the NPRM cover existing aircraft?
Answer. The FAA considers many variables when scoping a regulation
change, such as considering the economic impact on the industry and the
flying public weighed against the benefits provided. In some cases, the
cost is easily justified, such as in the case of large commercial
aircraft operating long-haul flights where nothing more than the
replacement of memory modules in existing CVRs is required. However, it
is much more difficult to justify on aircraft that would require an
entirely new recorder system to be certified and installed, or on
smaller aircraft such as business jets that fly relatively short
flights where 25 hours of recording duration provides little benefit.
While developing the 25-hour CVR rule, we determined the economic
impact on operators to retrofit all aircraft currently required to be
equipped with a CVR was substantially greater than the impact of
installing only on newly built aircraft, which could not be
economically justified in the regulatory evaluation process. The
addition of a 25-hour CVR versus a 2-hour CVR has almost no noticeable
impact on the cost of a newly built aircraft, whereas retrofit of
entire existing fleets places a substantial economic burden on aircraft
owners/operators. However, Section 366 of the FAA Reauthorization Act
of 2024 includes a self-executing requirement for certain existing
aircraft to retrofit with a 25-hour CVR. This requirement takes effect
in 2030.
Question 1.b. Moreover, the current CVR NPRM also does not mention
underwater recovery efforts. What plans does the FAA have to address
these outstanding items?
Answer. Underwater recovery efforts are being examined by the
Investigative Technologies Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC). The ARC
includes industry experts to review the current state of several
investigative technologies and related National Transportation Safety
Board recommendations, including improving the recovery of flight data
(Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder) from aircraft
involved in overwater accidents.
Questions to Hon. Michael Whitaker, Administrator, Federal Aviation
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Hon. Greg
Stanton
Question 1. Aviation is crucially important to my home state of
Arizona. Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix is one of the busiest airports
in the world--more than 48.8 million travelers passed through Sky
Harbor last year. However, the community has historically experienced
significant challenges navigating FAA-imposed flight path changes. It
is my understanding that the FAA is currently working with Sky Harbor
and the surrounding communities to study potential changes to some of
the flight paths in the airspace.
Mr. Whitaker, can you briefly explain how the FAA involves the
public in these decisions, and can you specifically explain how the FAA
typically engages local community leaders, tribal leaders, and local
elected officials in this decision-making process? And do you commit to
working with the community to conduct a comprehensive outreach and
engagement process? And do you have a status update on your end on this
specific process?
Answer. The FAA is committed to and continues to work closely with
airport officials, tribal leaders, and city and community leaders on
how to best implement changes to aviation procedures. The FAA is also
committed to a transparent process that involves collaboration with
airports and other aviation stakeholders, and is committed to
communication and status updates for elected officials and members of
the community.
The FAA is proposing to implement new satellite-based air traffic
procedures, as well as updates to the existing satellite-based air
traffic procedures, that will help enhance safety and improve air
traffic efficiency at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
(PHX). These procedures are known as Performance Based Navigation
(PBN). The PHX Performance Based Navigation (PBN) workgroup is made up
of FAA technical subject matter experts, representatives from the local
Airport, and other key aviation stakeholders. This group starts from
the purpose and need statement to address the challenges and
constraints of the airspace and work collaboratively to develop
modernized satellite-based procedures that increase the safety and
efficiency of the airspace.
The FAA ensures compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and exceeds the requirements for public engagement required
by NEPA through its Enhanced Community Engagement policy. The FAA's
Enhanced Community Engagement policy requires public engagement
throughout the project lifespan. Consistent with the FAA Community
Engagement effort, in the preliminary phase of a project where changes
over communities are being discussed, the FAA engages with Airport
Leadership and community leaders to ensure awareness of the project and
allow them an opportunity to bring specific community concerns or
historic noise issues to the relevant workgroup. These concerns are
brought to the Design Kickoff Meeting, and when there is a mature
product the FAA will engage with communities around the airport to gain
comments on any draft proposals during the required environmental
review process. The FAA has been posting updates on our Phoenix
community engagement webpage: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/
community_engagement/phx/.
Questions to Hon. Michael Whitaker, Administrator, Federal Aviation
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Hon. Dina Titus
Question 1. The number of reported unruly passenger cases has
thankfully dropped from nearly 6,000 in 2021. The number is still high,
however. Last year there were 2,075 unruly passenger reports, which is
a nearly 80% increase over 2019.
What is the FAA doing to reduce the number of incidents and impress
on the flying public that not only is it morally wrong to assault
flight crew but it's also illegal?
Answer. The number of reported unruly cases has declined each year
since the FAA implemented its ``zero-tolerance policy in 2021, and we
anticipate that trend to continue. Dangerous passengers put everyone at
risk. Threatening or violent behavior can distract and disrupt
crewmembers from their primary responsibility--to ensure the safety of
all passengers. Accordingly, the FAA continually maintains the zero-
tolerance policy at the forefront of the FAA's public-facing
communications, warning air travelers about the consequences of unruly
behavior through our social media channels and earned media.
As background, on January 13, 2021, the FAA published Compliance
and Enforcement (C&E) Bulletin 2021-1 [https://www.faa.gov/sites/
faa.gov/files/2021-08/Order2150.3C_CHG%204.pdf], which announced a
Special Emphasis Enforcement Program (SEEP) to address the
proliferation of unruly passenger conduct onboard U.S.-registered
aircraft. On March 31, 2021, the FAA published Compliance & Enforcement
Bulletin 2021-3 [https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/
FAA_Order_2150.3C_CHG_6.pdf], which extended the SEEP indefinitely.
These actions implement the FAA's policy for zero tolerance for unruly
passenger behavior. Under this policy, when a passenger engages in
dangerous unruly conduct aboard a commercial flight, the FAA pursues
legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults, threatens,
intimidates, or interferes with airline crewmembers, and can propose
civil penalties up to $43,658 per violation. Additional actions the FAA
has taken in furtherance of the zero-tolerance policy include referring
the most egregious unruly passenger incidents to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for criminal investigation; and beginning an information-
sharing initiative with the Transportation Security Administration to
facilitate the removal of PreCheck authorization for individuals
against whom the FAA pursued civil penalty action for unruly passenger
conduct.
As of 2023, the unruly passenger rate 
has dropped by more than 65 percent since the FAA implemented the zero-
tolerance policy in 2021.
Question 2. From loading and unloading baggage and cargo to de-
icing aircraft, ramp workers play an important role below the wing.
Over the last couple of years, I've read horrifying stories of ramp
workers dying while performing their duties.
What is the FAA doing to ensure that airlines and their contractors
provide adequate training and equipment to ramp workers to ensure their
on-the-job safety?
Answer. To address events where injuries or fatalities have
occurred during aircraft towing or ground handling operations, on
August 23, 2023, the FAA published a Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO
23006) [https://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/
airline_operators/airline_safety/safo/all_safos/SAFO23006.pdf] on the
Review and/or Revision of Aircraft Towing/Ground Handling Procedures
for the Safety of the Wing and/or Tail Walkers. This SAFO serves as a
safety reminder by raising awareness regarding specific accidents
involving ramp workers and recommending operators evaluate their towing
and marshaling procedures to ensure that they include certain
procedures to enhance towing and marshaling safety. We also made
updates to Advisory Circular 00-65A [https://www.faa.gov/
documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_00-65A.pdf], Towbar and
Towbarless Movement of Aircraft to incorporate these recommended
actions and plan a similar update to an Advisory Circular that covers
aircraft ground handling, servicing, and marshaling. In addition, the
FAA's Ramp Safety Task Force is evaluating ramp worker accidents along
with existing rules and guidance regarding ramp safety to determine if
additional mitigations are necessary.
