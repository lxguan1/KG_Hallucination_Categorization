OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, CHAIRMAN OF THE
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
WISCONSIN
Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will
come to order. I note that a quorum is present as Mr. Murphy
arrives.
Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a
recess at any time.
Today, the Committee on House Administration will consider
the Committee's Oversight Plan for the 119th Congress.
The Committee's jurisdiction includes House operations,
Capitol security, and legislative branch oversight.
Our goals for the 119th Congress are to improve Member and
campus security and to increase legislative branch
independence, capacity, and efficiency. Our goals include
cutting costs, eliminating burdensome regulations, and
promoting American ingenuity across the legislative branch.
We know this is an ambitious agenda, but the Committee is
ready to get to work and provide robust oversight of the
legislative branch.
Ensuring the safety and security of our visitors, staff,
and Members on our campus is a top priority. In recent months,
we have seen several critical breaches that raise concerns in
the community about the Capitol Police, access to campus, and
the respondence to threats. We have also seen threats to
Members off campus through instances of swatting and
cybersecurity threats.
In the 119th Congress, we will continue our efforts to
mitigate threats as well as direct the House Sergeant at Arms
to conduct a comprehensive review of House security.
In addition, the Committee remains committed to providing
the House with the resources needed to serve the American
people effectively. This requires us to empower legislative
branch inspectors general to pursue efforts to detect waste,
fraud, and abuse while holding agencies accountable to
implement outstanding recommendations.
We will also encourage the use of emerging technologies to
assist offices. By doing this, we can equip offices with tools
to provide services effectively and efficiently.
As stewards of the people's House, we must take steps to
detect waste, fraud, and abuse while eliminating burdensome
regulations. Many of the regulations, systems, and processes
that govern the House have been in place for decades. These
regulations do not receive proper attention or consideration.
During the 119th Congress, we will look at ways to improve
efficiencies, reduce unnecessary requirements, and cut costs.
According to this oversight plan, we will also conduct
effective oversight of legislative branch entities by
reestablishing regular budget hearings. Additionally, we will
promote the acquisition of American-made products and services
across the legislative branch.
The Chief Administrative Officer adheres to guidelines for
procurement of goods and services for the House to ensure the
most effective use of resources. While frequently updated, the
guidelines should be re-examined to ensure they are meeting our
current needs and utilizing the ingenuity of companies and
their products that are `Made in the USA.'
We have an obligation to the American people to conduct
this critical oversight of our legislative branch.
I am here to discuss all of these and many other important
matters today. I look forward to a thoughtful discussion on the
oversight plan before us today.
I yield back.
I will now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for 5
minutes for the purpose of offering an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM
NEW YORK
Mr. Morelle. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Steil and
all my colleagues, for being here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
calling this meeting to consider the Committee's Authorization
and Oversight Plan and for providing the opportunity to submit
our minority views.
While we do have some major disagreements with one another,
we likely agree on a great deal more. I am looking forward to
continuing to work in a productive, bipartisan manner to
bolster and modernize the House so we can effectively assert
the article I authority vested in us by the Constitution.
As congressional committees go, the Committee on House
Administration may be small, but we punch way above our weight.
We are stewards of this institution and oversee virtually every
aspect of congressional operations.
Every day--and you alluded to this--we make decisions on
how to best safeguard Congress with the Capitol Police and
Sergeant at Arms, facilitate a productive workplace with the
Chief Administrative Officer, consider legislation with the
Clerk and Legislative Counsel, administer elections with the
Election Assistance Commission, and so much more with the broad
array of agencies and offices that reside within the
legislative branch.
We can also have a profound impact on how the House and, as
a result, our Nation addresses our most challenging issues, but
we cannot do that without the work of what I consider one of
Congress' greatest assets, our nonpartisan institutional staff.
In my 2 years as Ranking Member of this Committee, I have
had the good fortune of getting to know the institutional staff
that includes Capitol Police officers, skilled craftspersons,
cybersecurity experts, auditors, food service staff, tour
guides, just to name a few. I want to make sure these public
servants who work so hard behind the scenes know that they are
appreciated and valued here.
The plan we are considering today serves as a roadmap to
help us ensure these institutional staffers, along with all of
us that make up the congressional community, are both put in a
position to succeed and held to the standards befitting the
U.S. Congress.
Once again, I want to thank you, Mr. Chair, for allowing us
to submit our minority views and for convening this meeting.
With that, I yield back.

COMMITTEE RESOLUTION 119-9
GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
Chairman Steil. Do any Members seek recognition for
amendment or debate?
I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
I will just be brief. This Committee has worked really well
in a bipartisan way on the oversight of our legislative branch
entities.
It has been a great working relationship with you, Mr.
Morelle. Not that we do not have our disagreements at times,
but when it comes to the oversight and the operations of this
institution, we have had great cooperation with you and your
team over the past 2 years, and I look forward to continuing
that in the 119th Congress.
I yield back.
Does any other Member seek recognition?
There being no further amendment or debate, the question
now occurs on the resolution.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the
resolution is agreed to.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the
table.
This concludes all the matters before the Committee, unless
any Members have any further comments.
Without objection, the staff is authorized to make
necessary technical and conforming changes.
If there is no further business, I want to thank the
Members for their participation.
Without objection, the Committee on House Administration
stands adjourned.
