FINDING 500,000: ADDRESSING AMERICA'S CYBER WORKFORCE GAP ---------- Wednesday, June 26, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Mark E. Green (Chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Green, Higgins, Pfluger, Garbarino, LaLota, Ezell, D'Esposito, Strong, Thompson, Carter, Thanedar, Magaziner, Ivey, Ramirez, Suozzi, and Kennedy. Mr. Garbarino . The committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time. This hearing is to examine the challenges Federal agencies face in recruiting, developing, and retaining a skilled cyber work force that is prepared to secure, defend the homeland against rapidly-evolving cyber threats. Specifically, this hearing will identify strategies and solutions to bolster and expand a capable cyber work force, including by examining the effectiveness of on-going Federal efforts. Unfortunately, Chairman Green is unable to join us today due to a death in the family, so I'll be presiding over this hearing in his place. I now recognize myself to read Chairman Green's opening statement on his behalf. Experts predict that by the end of 2024, a cyber attack will strike every 13 seconds. That's 6,822 attacks a day, or about 2 million by the end of the year. It's easy to believe those predictions by looking at where we are today. Whether it's Chinese-backed Volt Typhoon infiltrating our critical infrastructure or major ransomware attacks, such as Change Healthcare--the Change Healthcare breach, today's complex and growing cyber threat landscape has brought America to an inflection point. To stay ahead of our adversaries, we must improve our cyber defenses. Throughout our history, America's best defense during any conflict has been its people. Our fortitude, work ethic, and dedication make us resilient in face of any threat. Therefore, increasing competition in cyber space is not and cannot be different. The challenge is too big for the public and private sectors to address alone, and our cyber professionals must be equipped with the right tools and skills and offer the right incentives to succeed. It is alarming, then, that our Nation is suffering from such a major cyber work force gap. We currently need at least 500,000 cyber professionals if we hope to protect and defend our way of life. Now that's not just any 500,000 people. We need 500,000 skilled, talented cyber workers dedicated to contending with the threats of today while preparing for the threats of tomorrow. During World War I, walls were papered with the iconic poster of Uncle Sam pointing his finger at every passerby, declaring, I want you. It was a call to action that was born out of a time of national crisis, and it was a call that Americans answered. We find ourselves in a similar moment today. Our Nation needs a capable cyber work force to defend the digital infrastructure we depend on daily. We need Americans in critical areas like cloud computing, artifical intelligence, machine learning, and zero trust. We need students with fresh skills and bright ideas. We need tenured professionals with deep-seated expertise. We need mid-career individuals who are inspired to enter the cyber field and have the zeal to learn new skills. We need Americans to fill entry-level positions that shouldn't require a 4-year degree. America's need for cyber talent is the greatest within the Federal Government. Agencies are facing some of the toughest threats in recent history, each with mounting sophistication and frequency. While agencies work to protect themselves from threats such as malicious insiders, supply chain exploitation, and commercial spyware, they're also protecting, mitigating, and defending against these threats for State and local organizations, small businesses, and civilians. This is a large mandate for such small ranks. So why are we having trouble bringing talented cyber work force into public service? Defending our networks requires us to examine this question closely. There are a few key issues at play that I hope our witnesses will discuss further today. While cybersecurity positions are coveted and pay above- average levels in many cases, Federal cybersecurity pay is just not high enough to compete with similar private-sector positions and attract the right talent. Additionally, Federal agencies ex--Federal agencies experience an acute skills gap because agencies have historically valued 4-year degrees over practical experience. This has unnecessarily narrowed the pool of prospective hires to those who may not have on-the-paper knowledge but not the requisite competencies. Federal hiring practices compound the issue, often resulting in a bureaucratic burdensome process that misaligns what agencies say they need with what they actually need. Finally, while career pathways into Federal cyber jobs are improving, this simply isn't happening fast enough. The pathways are few and notoriously slow. While much more is needed to be done, both sides of the aisle have recognized that a robust and prepared cyber work force is at the core of protecting our cyber--our cybersecurity interests. In 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, which addressed the growth and sustainment of a skilled cyber work force. In July 2023, the White House released the National Cyber Workforce Education Strategy, which outlines a road map to expand the national cyber work force, including bolstering access to cyber education and training. Federal agencies have also taken this challenge upon themselves. For example, NSA's National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Security collaborates with academia to encourage cyber competency development among students and actively engage in solutions to cyber work force challenges. This program has become the gold standard in cybersecurity education, which is why I think it is important we codify it into law. While my NDAA amendment was not included this year to do just that, I am now exploring other pathways. As an Army veteran--that's Mr. Green, not me--I believe an ROTC-like program would be an effective and rewarding way to build a prepared cyber work force across the Federal Government. Although we have programs that fall under this category today, such as Cyber Corps Scholarship for Service Program, we must maximize and scale these efforts, improve retention, and potentially establish other ROTC-like programs quickly to fill a specific skills gap and critical positions. As Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, I know that protecting the cyber border is just as important as our efforts to secure our physical border. This is why accelerating the United States' efforts to address the cyber work force gap has been my top priority this year, so much so that I will soon be introducing legislation to grow our cyber work force and sustain a steady pipeline each year. I want to thank our witnesses for being here to help us understand the challenges you have experienced, initiatives you have undertaken, and opportunities you see to strengthen our cyber work force. Your agencies have played a leading role in promoting cyber work force efforts, So I have no doubt that your unique perspectives will help us chart the path to cultivate a cyber work force that is prepared to protect and defend our Nation from increasingly complex threats in cyber space.  Statement of Chairman Mark E. Green, MD June 26, 2024 Experts predict that by the end of 2024, a cyber attack will strike every 13 seconds.

Mr. Garbarino. I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mrs. Ramirez, from---- Mrs. Ramirez. Illinois. Mr. Garbarino . Illinois for her opening statement. Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman Garbarino. Good morning. Before I begin, I want to extend my condolences to Chairman Green and his family as they mourn the passing of his mother-in-law. Turning in today's topic, I would like to thank the Chairman for holding this hearing on addressing our Nation's cyber work force shortage. As we see, increased cyber threats from adverse nation-states and criminal gangs, they continue investing and develop--we continue to invest and developing our cybersecurity talent pool, and it'll be essential in defending the Federal Government and its critical infrastructure. This committee has prioritized addressing the cyber work force challenges for years, and it's passed important legislation to ensure that DHS and CISA continue to support cyber work force development. Last Congress, for example, the committee secured the enactment of Representative Swalwell's Industrial Controlled Systems Cybersecurity Training legislation. Earlier this Congress, the committee passed Representative Jackson Lee's legislation authorizing CISA's effort to provide cybersecurity training to DHS employees. I really hope that we can work together to secure passage of Representative Jackson Lee's important bill by the full House this Congress. While these legislative efforts have been helpful, we also know that there's still a lot of work to be done. Fortunately, the Biden administration has released a comprehensive cyber work force and education strategy that sets a road map for how the Executive branch and Congress can better support work force development efforts. Considering the wide range of Federal agencies, State, and local governments, and private entities involved in cybersecurity work force training and education, this is the kind of leadership from the White House that is critical to ensuring that we have a coordinated and we have a whole-of- Government and whole-of-Nation effort. I'm glad to see the administration's new report on the work force strategy implementation, and I do look forward to hearing more today about how the implementation is going and how Congress can support this very critical effort. In particular, I support the administration's commitment to skill-based hiring and efforts like DHS's Cyber Internship Program. I look forward to working with DHS and many of my colleagues here to authorize the Cyber Internship Program available to individuals from high school through grad school so that we ensure the Department continues to develop its next generation of cyber talent. I appreciate if the Federal Government has some unique challenges in recruiting and retaining top cyber talent. When the Federal Government must compete with the private sector that we know offers higher pay and more flexible hiring, we know the Federal Government risks losing skilled cybersecurity practitioners. So I look forward to hearing from the Department of Defense and Homeland Security today on how we can address this challenge. I also hope to hear what authorities Congress can provide to ensure the Federal department agencies responsible for leading our cyber defense have the talent necessary to keep our Nation secure. As we consider efforts to address our cyber work force gap going forward, there are some key points that I want to make sure that we're keeping in mind. First, one key advantage we have over our adversaries, let me say, is our diverse population. To fill cyber work force positions we have to focus on outreach to women, to people of color, to rural populations, and others who are not adequately represented currently in the cyber work force. We can't simply address cyber work force shortage without including everyone and doing so with an intentional effort on the part of the Government and the private sector. That is why Ranking Member Thompson authored legislation to establish a DHS Intelligence and Cybersecurity Diversity Fellowship Program, and I'm glad to see diverse young people who've already participated in the program. We must continue to build and expand on similar efforts to bring more people from all walks of life into the Federal Government's cyber work force. Additionally, we have seen rapid technological advances in recent years with the growth of artificial intelligence, showing how the skills necessary for cybersecurity are constantly, constantly evolving. We must ensure that our cybersecurity training efforts reflect the latest skills and that our cybersecurity work force continues to receive adequate training throughout their careers. AI will not solve our cyber work force shortage, but it will change how cyber defenders do their jobs. So education and training programs have to reflect that reality. Keeping these considerations in mind, I hope that our committee can work together in a bipartisan way to expand and to strengthen our cyber talent pool. Our witness' expertise will help inform our efforts, and I look forward to your testimony. Before I close, however, I do want to extend the committee's well wishes to Congresswoman Jackson Lee as she battles pancreatic cancer. As a long-standing Member of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, Congresswoman Jackson Lee has been a leading advocate for strengthening our Nation's cyber work force. I look forward to her continued advocacy on this important issue. Ranking--Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mrs. Ramirez. I share your thoughts and our prayers with Ms. Jackson Lee. She is a great Member of the subcommittee that I chair. Always has great questions and very thoughtful ones and sometimes ones I wish I came up with myself. So we all wish her a speedy recovery. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record.  Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson June 26, 2024 As we see increased cyber threats from adversary nation-states and criminal gangs, continued investment in developing our cybersecurity talent pool will be essential to defending the Federal Government and critical infrastructure.

Our witnesses' expertise will help inform our efforts, and I look forward to their testimony. Mr. Garbarino. I'm pleased to have our distinguished witnesses before us today. I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise their right hands.  Mr. Garbarino. Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Thank you. Please be seated.

STATEMENT OF ERIC HYSEN, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Hysen. Chairman Garbarino, Congresswoman Ramirez, and distinguished Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. Every day over 8,000 cybersecurity professionals across the Department of Homeland Security put their skills to use defending our Nation. CISA threat hunters search proactively through networks to identify and stop suspicious activities. Secret Service agents investigate complex cyber-enabled financial crimes. Teams from Homeland Security Investigations catch perpetrators of child sexual exploitation through cutting-edge digital forensics techniques. Our IT specialists across the Department work to secure our own networks' systems and data and stay ahead of our adversaries. Our cybersecurity professionals are deeply talented and dedicated to serving their country, but they are too few. The Department has nearly 2,000 vacancies for cybersecurity positions and struggles like every Government agency to recruit and retain talent in an incredibly competitive field. I have dedicated much of my career to this challenge. After working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I left the private sector to cofound the United States Digital Service, which has now recruited hundreds of technologists for Government tours of duty. There, I saw how recruiting and retaining tech talent in Government requires a comprehensive approach: actively recruiting out to communities, particularly those underrepresented in our field, to build awareness of public service pathways, leveraging flexible compensation and hiring authorities, streamlining our hiring and on-boarding processes, and building a culture that fosters innovation and collaboration. Today I will highlight how we are working through each of those things in support of our own work force. In November 2021, DHS launched the Cybersecurity Talent Management System, or CTMS, a transformational effort that offers hiring processes, compensation systems, and career progression that are far closer to what I was used to seeing in Silicon Valley than to traditional Federal HR. Since its launch, we have received nearly 25,000 applications, issued over 345 offers, and currently have 189 employees at all levels working in my office, CISA, and FEMA. While CTMS is delivering significant results, its rollout was not without challenges. It took us too long from receiving the authority to launch the program and begin hiring under it, and our initial rate of hires has been slower than expected. We are learning from these efforts and continuously improving CTMS to position the Department for long-term success. In addition, we've established a variety of internship and fellowship programs to create pathways for students and early career professionals, including the Secretary's Honors Program, Cybersecurity Internship Program, and Intelligence and Cybersecurity Diversity Fellowship. These programs have welcomed hundreds of participants to date and are building the future of our cyber work force. We are also building innovative programs to attract talent in critical cybersecurity-enabling fields, such as AI and emerging technologies. For example, this February, we launched the DHS AI Corps, an effort to hire 50 experts to support the use of AI across the Department. We've seen incredible interest so far and are well on our way toward this hiring goal with new AI Corps members coming from top technology companies and from across Government and civil society. Finally, training and development of our existing work force is also vital. We are building a DHS IT Academy to create standard technical orientations for all new employees, develop a rigorous training and rotation program for entry-level hires, and offer upskilling opportunities for employees to learn new and emerging skills. These programs are just some of the tools we are using across DHS to strengthen our cybersecurity work force. There is no single initiative or policy to address all work force challenges, and every organization that relies on this talent across the public and private sectors is similarly looking at a combination of efforts. I look forward to our continued partnership with Congress to enable us to attract and retain talent in this incredibly competitive market. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.  Prepared Statement of Eric Hysen June 26, 2024 Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and distinguished Members of the committee: thank you for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing, ``Finding 500,000: Addressing America's Cyber Workforce Gap,'' a critical issue impacting our national security. Every day, over 8,000 cybersecurity professionals across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the Department) put their skills to use defending our Nation from all manner of threats and vulnerabilities. Threat hunters at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) search proactively through Federal and partner networks to identify and stop suspicious activities. U.S. Secret Service Special Agents investigate complex, cyber-enabled financial crimes and combat the illicit use of digital assets. Teams from Homeland Security Investigations identify victims and catch perpetrators of child sexual exploitation and abuse by employing cutting-edge digital forensics techniques. And, Information Technology Specialists across DHS and its operational components work to stay ahead of our adversaries and secure the Department's own networks, systems, and data. Our cybersecurity professionals are deeply talented and dedicated to serving their country, but they are too few. The Department has nearly 2,000 vacancies for cybersecurity positions and struggles, like every Government agency, to recruit and retain talent in an incredibly competitive field. As technology and our adversaries are constantly evolving, particularly with rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies, we must ensure our work force continuously builds new skills to maintain its competitive edge. I have first-hand experience when it comes to attracting private- sector workers to careers in public service. After working in Silicon Valley as a software engineer and project manager, I left the private sector to co-found the United States Digital Service (USDS), which has now recruited hundreds of technologists for government ``tours of duty'' and will celebrate its tenth birthday later this year. At USDS, I saw how recruiting and retaining tech talent in Government requires a comprehensive approach: actively reaching out to communities to build awareness of public service pathways; leveraging flexible compensation and hiring authorities; streamlining hiring and on-boarding processes; and building a culture that fosters innovation and collaboration. I am honored to bring this perspective as the DHS chief information officer (CIO) and its first chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO). We have successfully used many of the authorities passed into law under this committee's leadership to strengthen our efforts. Today, I will highlight some of the programs and initiatives specifically designed to address our cybersecurity work force challenges at DHS by bringing more people with diverse backgrounds and experiences into Government service and by strengthening development opportunities to build skills across existing personnel. the department's cybersecurity service Armed with authority passed into law with the strong support of this committee, the Department, through the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), launched one of its most innovative and successful tools for attracting cybersecurity talent in November 2021-- the Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS). CTMS authority offers flexibilities to proactively identify, source, and recruit individuals, even if they are not active job seekers, to create ready- made pools of pre-qualified, selectable talent when needs arise. We now maintain a talent pool of over 1,000 pre-assessed applicants. CTMS offers flexible, capability-focused career paths based upon the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity that promote career longevity, reducing costs associated with on-going attrition and recruitment. The product of CTMS, the DHS Cybersecurity Service, offers a diverse, preeminent team working throughout DHS to protect the Nation's information technology infrastructure and the American people from cybersecurity risks. Employees in the DHS Cybersecurity Service work across our cybersecurity missions and operational components in jobs currently spanning 17 different cybersecurity specializations. Through our authority, the Department can regularly adjust to emerging needs by expanding CTMS hiring across wide arrays of specializations, including those related to AI. Every day, DHS Cybersecurity Service employees are on the front line--protecting the systems, networks, and information Americans rely on. While a Federal employment opportunity may not bridge the salary differentials between Government and private sector, CTMS combines Federal benefits with competitive market-sensitive compensation, meaningful work, and career mobility to attract a unique blend of next generation talent, technical experts, and leaders that collectively advance our dynamic cybersecurity mission. Since its launch in November 2021, DHS received nearly 25,000 applications from persons seeking to join the Cybersecurity Service and fill high-priority jobs in my office, CISA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As of May 2024, the Department issued over 345 initial job offers and on-boarded 189 employees--spanning entry-level to executives and distinguished technical experts. These latest figures represent exponential growth in this program. Employees who participate in the Cybersecurity Service produce significant results. In fewer than 9 months, one DHS Cybersecurity Service employee implemented an enterprise-wide, remote penetration testing capability, resulting in a 70 percent reduction in related costs. Another employee's contributions led to a provisional patent for the Department's Unified Cybersecurity Maturity Model, which helps align cybersecurity spending and new capability requests across the Department. Other cyber employees have expanded capacity-building and threat-hunting capabilities, written CISA's Open Source Software Security Roadmap, and produced a decryptor for an emerging ransomware strain, among other accomplishments. This new pool of talent represents significant geographic diversity, with employees hailing from over 29 States and the District of Columbia. Over half of current employees are at the entry and developmental level, and we are capitalizing on CTMS's flexibilities to enable these employees to move into more senior roles as their careers progress. Our 2-year retention rate is currently 94 percent, compared to an average of 80 percent in the technology industry. Although we are still new and need more longitudinal data, if this rate continues, we will see reduced labor time and costs associated with recruitment and backfilling. While CTMS is a major value-add to the Department, its rollout was not without challenges. It took us too long from receiving this authority to launch the program and begin hiring under it, and our initial rate of hires have not met our aggressive targets. Designing and launching an entirely new personnel system in the Federal Government is an extremely difficult task, and we learned from these efforts. We are continuously improving CTMS in partnership with hiring managers to make it a more effective tool. We knew that simply eliminating a step in the hiring process or adding a pay grade would not do enough to make DHS competitive, so we designed CTMS as a true attempt at civil service reform. It is a complex, transformative, and challenging effort, but necessary to position the Department for long- term success. Additionally, many cybersecurity positions require security clearances at various levels, and this vetting process sometimes sets the pace at which we can on-board new employees to Government service. As one of the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council (PAC) members spearheading the Trusted Workforce (TW) 2.0 initiative, DHS is working on implementing relevant policy changes to benefit from recent gains made in clearance processing. Looking ahead, the Department has committed to expanding CTMS. In fact, one primary objective in my fiscal year 2024-2028 IT Strategic Plan includes implementing CTMS across all operational components and expanding CTMS applicability as a hiring mechanism for a wider array of cybersecurity-related professionals, including those specializing in data science, AI, and other emerging technologies. internships and fellowships In addition to CTMS, the Department has established a variety of internship and fellowship programs to create pathways for students and those early in their career to begin their professional journeys at DHS. In 2021, we established the Secretary's Honors Program, modeled after a long-standing successful program at the Department of Justice, which builds cohorts of new employees in priority fields and provides them with access to training, leadership engagements, and exposure to various mission areas across the Department. To date, almost 80 employees have participated in the first 3 cybersecurity classes of the Secretary's Honors Program. This includes 46 CTMS employees who participated in the third class that ended in April 2024. Last summer, we welcomed the first 16 participants into the Department's new Intelligence & Cybersecurity Diversity Fellowship program, which was authorized by Congress. Fellows worked for 12 weeks in offices across DHS and had an opportunity to engage with leaders across Government, including Secretary Mayorkas and the Ranking Member of this committee. I was impressed by the talent and passion of this inaugural cohort when I met with them last year, and I am looking forward to meeting with the fellows we are welcoming this summer. I am also very proud of the Cybersecurity Intern Program (CSIP) launched in my office in the summer of 2022. CSIP provides internships for students ranging from high school to graduate school to bring diverse talent to fields spanning cybersecurity, data management, cloud services, and network operations. The program grew from 52 interns in 7 DHS offices and operational components in 2022 to 85 in over a dozen DHS offices and operational components this summer. We saw over 1,000 applications in just a single day this year and had to close our application window early given the enormous interest. ai corps In September 2023, the Secretary named me as the Department's first CAIO. As both the new CAIO and the current CIO responsible for strengthening the Department's cybersecurity posture, I immediately recognized the synergies between my two roles. A portion of my focus quickly turned to attracting new talent to harness AI technology in support of the Department's missions. As AI becomes more powerful and widely used, it is evident that the Department needs AI experts to ensure we leverage this technology responsibly and safeguard against its malicious use. To meet this need, the Secretary announced the creation of the DHS AI Corps in February 2024, during a trip to Silicon Valley. Modeled after the USDS, this group will support the use of AI across DHS, working on critical efforts ranging from countering fentanyl and combating child sexual exploitation and abuse to enhancing our cybersecurity. AI Corps members will identify and mitigate safety and security considerations for AI to ensure its responsible use at DHS. Demand for personnel with AI technical skills relevant to missions, such as cybersecurity, is immense across all sectors. When attracting such talent, the Department makes a simple argument: now is the time for technology experts to make a real difference for our Nation by joining the Federal Government. Although the AI Corps and the accompanying hiring sprint to bring it to 50 personnel is still new, our straightforward message has already produced dramatic results. We received over 6,000 applications for this first-of-its-kind program and have already on-boarded 7 individuals with another 19 in the on- boarding process. AI Corps members come from the country's top technology firms and from across Government and civil society, bringing skillsets in data science, machine learning, product and program management, software engineering, and human-centered design to accelerate our efforts. training and development The Department prioritizes attracting, hiring, and retaining top technical talent, but we also understand the need to consistently train our existing work force to confront evolving challenges in cybersecurity and technology. For this reason, the first goal of the DHS IT Strategic Plan is ``Invest in the DHS IT Workforce.'' We are building a DHS IT Academy to ensure every DHS IT and cybersecurity employee is competent in core skillsets and to assist employees in developing new technical skills. The DHS IT Academy will create standard technical orientations for all DHS IT employees, develop a rigorous training and rotation program for entry-level hires, and offer upskilling opportunities for employees to learn new and emerging skills. As a first step, we launched a standardized IT Immersion Program for all new DHS IT professionals. IT Immersion provides new hires with a shared understanding of how IT enables the DHS mission and instructs them in core IT concepts including zero trust implementation, cybersecurity risk management, continuous monitoring and security authorizations, privacy concerns, and customer experience. The inaugural IT Immersion Program included 140 attendees from across the Department, and a second Program held last month for employees who joined the Department after our inaugural session included an additional 72 attendees. We only expect interest to grow as we move ahead. The DHS IT Academy effort also led to the development of role-based training minimum standards for roles with significant cybersecurity responsibility: information systems security manager, information systems security officer, system owner, and authorizing official. These DHS minimum standards are aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity and include minimum specified knowledge standards and typical tasks for each role. We anticipate launching the initial set of role-based trainings by the end of this fiscal year. Finally, we are working to ensure all DHS employees are building basic technical awareness and skills, not just those working in securing technology and cybersecurity. We are redesigning our annual Cybersecurity Awareness Training and have launched regular phishing exercises to keep all employees sharp on their personal contributions to the Department's cybersecurity. Last year, we were the first Department to launch training for employees seeking to use commercially-available generative AI tools in their work. Over 5,000 employees have taken this training and have permission to use these cutting-edge tools responsibly and safely. federal cohesion and coordination To support the administration's effort in modernizing Federal hiring and strengthening the Federal work force, DHS is also aligning its cyber work force effort with the President's Management Agenda; National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy implementation; National Security Memoradum-3 (``Memorandum on Revitalizing America's Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships''); Executive Order 14119 (``Scaling and Expanding the Use of Registered Apprenticeships in Industries and the Federal Government and Promoting Labor-Management Forums''); and Executive Order 14110 (``Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence''). conclusion The programs I have outlined today are just some of the tools we are using across DHS to strengthen our cybersecurity work force. There is no single initiative or policy to address all work force challenges, and every organization that relies on this talent across the public and private sectors is similarly looking at a combination of efforts spanning recruitment, hiring, training, and retention. I look forward to our continued partnership with Congress, and especially this committee, to deliver flexible authorities needed to attract talent in an extremely competitive market. I also urge the committee to take an expansive view of cybersecurity talent. Cybersecurity is a vital part of every stage of the software and technology development life cycle. We must ensure all employees involved in this process are equipped to understand how their role contributes to cybersecurity, from designers and program managers through network operators and help desk technicians. While cybersecurity-focused programs are critical, complementary efforts such as the DHS AI Corps, which bakes cybersecurity into programs for recruiting adjacent talent, also have an important role to play. We acknowledge the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in building a robust cybersecurity team. By actively recruiting from underrepresented communities and ensuring an inclusive work environment, we can leverage a wider range of perspectives and skills, which are crucial in addressing the complex challenges of cybersecurity today. I am proud of the progress the Department has made, but there is still work to be done. As we move forward, we remain dedicated to continuously improving our programs and learning from our challenges so that DHS remains at the forefront of our Nation's cybersecurity protections. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I welcome your questions. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Hysen. I now recognize Ms. Beavers for 5 minutes to summarize her opening statement. STATEMENT OF LESLIE A. BEAVERS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Ms. Beavers. Good morning, Chairman Garbarino and Congresswoman Ramirez and distinguished Members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to address you today on an issue of critical importance to our national security, the Department of Defense's efforts to cultivate and strengthen our cyber work force. As the principal deputy chief information officer, I lead a team dedicated to providing strategic direction, oversight, and technical expertise to secure and modernize the Department's information technology, enhancing warfighting command, control, and communications, and cultivate a digital work force. Each of these missions is critical to our warfighters and would be impossible without the right people. The Department of Defense must adapt to emerging threats and develop a skilled work force to tackle national security challenges in the global landscape. Cyber threats, cloud computing, and software modernization are crucial for safeguarding national interests and supporting warfighters. A skilled work force is needed to innovate, develop, and implement cyber capabilities for sustained superiority. Last year, the Department of Defense released the DOD Cyber Workforce Strategy, developed in coordination with various components: the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Cyber Command, and the military services. This strategy aligns with the 2022 National Defense Strategy's imperative to cultivate the work force we need. The strategy identifies a pressing need for a cultural shift in managing the Department's most valuable asset--our people--and laid the groundwork for a nationwide transformation in cyber education through collaboration among academia, employers, and Government leaders. It also creates an opportunity for innovation in the Department's approach to recruiting, training, educating, and certifying our work force. The strategy aims to achieve success through regular work force capability assessments, talent management programs, cultural shift, and partnerships to enhance operational effectiveness and career growth. A keystone effort within the Cyber Workforce Strategy is the cyber defense work force framework, which is a catalogue of cyber space skills and roles needed across the Department. This framework helps us identify and focus on critical, hard-to-fill specialties, recognizing that it will evolve as it adapts with technology. We are also excited about our newly-established Cyber Academic Engagement Office, which will be the consolidated focal point for cyber-related activities carried out between the Department, academic stakeholders and, in the future, with Federal partners such as the Department of Education, NIST, FBI, and DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, to collaborate on cyber education programs for the benefit of the whole of Government. We also have educational initiatives like the DOD Cyber Service Academy, which offers scholarships and grants to bolster the Nation's cyber work force and grant scholarships to non-DOD students enrolled in National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity, as well as to DOD civilians and service members pursuing master's and doctoral degrees. In 2024, the Cybersecurity Academy awarded recruitment scholarships to 174 nongovernment students, supporting their studies in cyber space-related competencies. To that end, the Department of Defense actively participates in the Office of the National Cyber Director's Federal Cyber Workforce Group. We align our cyber work force strategies in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce to ensure a whole-of-Government approach. DOD understands that interagency collaboration not only establishes standards for cyber across the Federal Government, it also facilitates the development of professional competencies that define future cyber work in the Government and the private sector alike. We're reevaluating cyber education and certification, acknowledging that traditional college degrees are not always necessary. DOD is exploring faster routes to cybersecurity qualifications. With the Department of Labor, we're creating the Federal Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Program to set standards for critical roles. By partnering with the under secretary for acquisition and sustainment, DOD CIO is promoting registered apprenticeship programs to diversify our work force and remove educational barriers. This approach aims to bring in skilled workers through nontraditional paths. The Department of Defense is committed to strengthening our cybersecurity posture through the development and management of a highly-skilled cyber work force. A cultural shift in managing the Department's most valuable asset, our people, is under way. Thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning. I look forward to your questions.  Prepared Statement of Leslie A. Beavers June 26, 2024 Good morning, Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and esteemed Members of the committee. The Office of the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) is charged with securing and modernizing IT, enhancing command capabilities, and fostering a digital work force. Today, I am honored to discuss the strengthening our Nation's cyber work force within the Department of Defense (DoD) with you all. The Department of Defense requires a skilled and motivated work force to stay ahead of evolving risks and latest technologies. The Department is identifying and bridging work force gaps to ensure we are prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. Specifically, the DoD Cyber Workforce Strategy and its implementation plan were designed to further amplify our efforts to secure top talent. Developing and maintaining our skilled work force is critical and the introduction of the Cyber Excepted Service (CES) significantly increased our flexibility in attracting and retaining the specialized skills necessary for our mission's success. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive outreach program aimed at recruiting the diverse abilities needed to fulfill our talent requirements. Together, these initiatives underscore our commitment to fostering a thriving work force that can propel the Department, and by extension the Nation, toward its goals. federal cohesion and coherence As part of the on-going effort to strengthen and empower the Federal work force, especially those with cyber roles, DoD is leading and coordinating with interagency partners to implement priorities in the President's Management Agenda. In addition, the DoD CIO was a crucial partner in helping to shape the content of the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES) released in July 2023. Given this close coordination, DoD can ensure harmonization with Federal cyber work force efforts with interagency partners and the implementation of the NCWES through our active engagement in the National Cyber Workforce and Coordination Group, led by the Office of the National Cyber Director. One key success of this coordination is the growing number of institutions obtaining the National Center of Academic Excellence (NCAE) designation, having increased from 420 to 450. In other words, we have more academic partners at higher education institutions aligning their curriculum in a way that supports the cyber work needed in the Federal Government. The continued collaboration with the interagency ensured Federal Government cohesion that can maximize cyber talent for the Nation. cyber workforce strategy and implementation plan The DoD Cyber Workforce (CWF) Strategy, released in March 2023, and its implementation plan released in August 2023, remains a top priority. Our goals are to address work force gaps by recruiting top- tier cyber professionals, expanding our cyber work force, and enhancing the skills of our existing talent. This initiative is crucial for safeguarding our digital and critical infrastructures, ensuring they are operated securely to defend against cyber risks and protect our data from adversaries. The CWF Strategy outlines four human capital pillars--identifying work force requirements, recruiting talent, developing talent to meet mission requirements, and retaining talent to resolve the department's work force retention challenge. The successful execution of the CWF Strategy, through this Implementation Plan empowers the Department and its components to foster the most capable and dominant cyber force in the world. The CWF Strategy and Implementation Plan is an enterprise-wide talent management program aimed at aligning force capabilities with present and future cyber requirements. As previously stated, this effort directly supports the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy and supports administration's consistent effort to modernize Federal hiring and strengthening the Federal work force starting with the President's Management Agenda. As part of the interagency collaboration and in support of NCWES implementation, DoD is committed to reducing the vacancy rates of its critical cyber positions by 2 percent per year over the next 2-5 years, with the goal to reduce the overall cyber work force vacancy rate to below 15 percent. To accomplish the reduction and bolster cyber readiness, DoD plans to benefit from the newly-established Cyber Academic Engagement Office. Additionally, DoD will reduce vacancy rates by leveraging existing and under-development authorities that support innovative hiring practices (including skills-based hiring), with targeted recruiting, retention, and relocation bonuses and other related pay-related programs. DoD anticipates an additional 2,000 successful cyber work force hiring actions in each year for the next 2- 5 years. We are cultivating a transformation across the Department to enhance personnel management practices on a broader scale and promoting collaboration and partnerships to enrich capability development, operational efficiency, and career advancement opportunities across the organization. development and retention Professional development through education and training plays a vital role in supporting and enhancing our cyber work force capabilities. We have several on-going partnerships and rotation programs to provide professional development opportunities to our work force. The Department recently established the DoD Cyber Academic Engagement Office (CAEO). This office will oversee cyber-focused engagement programs, and enhance coherence, coordination, and management across the enterprise. The primary objective is to streamline processes and establish a clear pathway for academic institutions seeking engagement with the DoD, serving as the consolidated focal point for engagements between the Department of Defense and academic institutions regarding cyber-related matters. The Department offers 2 cyber- and IT-focused rotation and exchange programs that foster innovation and enables the Department to develop and retain our existing cyber talent. We administer Office of Personnel Management's Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program (FRCWP) and the DoD Cyber and Information Technology Exchange Program (CITEP) for the DoD cyber work force. The FRCWP enables cyber-coded Government civilians to hone or develop cyber knowledge and skills through applying for, and serving in, rotational details outside their home agencies across the Federal Government. Rotations promote intra-agency and interagency knowledge sharing, integration, and coordination of cyber practices, functions, and personnel management. The DoD CITEP facilitates a unique opportunity for industry and DoD civilian employees working in the cyber and IT fields to participate in an exchange opportunity between the two sectors. Participants share best practices, gain a better understanding of cross-sector cybersecurity operations and challenges, and gain exposure to a different organization's processes. cyber excepted service (ces) The Department appreciates Congress' recognition of the need for flexibilities in attracting, hiring, and retaining quality cyber personnel. Section 1599f of Title 10, U.S. Code, authorized the CES personnel system for DoD civilians supporting the U.S. Cyber Command, providing pay flexibilities to mitigate recruitment and retention challenges. Similar to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cyber Talent Management System (CTMS), the DoD's CES features a mission-focused occupational structure, qualification-based professional development, and advancement opportunities without time- in-grade requirements, along with agile recruitment and retention strategies, recruitment incentives, and market-based compensation. Tracking the Cyber Workforce through the DoD Cyber Workforce Health Report provides leadership with enterprise-wide insights into the cyber work force through the lens of the DoD Cyberspace Workforce Framework (DCWF) work roles, enabling them to identify work force gaps and timely address recruiting and retention challenges. This platform reports on the state of the civilian and military cyber work force, manage the CES Targeted Local Market Supplement (TLMS) incentive and provides commanders with a means of identifying and mitigating work force health challenges. cyber work force qualifications To provide guidance to the Department on the implementation of our Cyber Workforce Strategy, we released the third publication in the DoD Cyber Workforce Policy series to set the foundation for managing, identifying, qualifying, and upskilling our work force according to the DCWF. The manual plays a crucial role in our work force by setting forth the qualification standards for every DCWF work role, ensuring that personnel assigned to cyber positions possess the capability to meet mission demands effectively. Since the publication of the DoD Manual 8140.03 on February 15, 2023, the Department has been working aggressively to implement the qualification of personnel identified as members of the DoD cyber space work force. The Department has an established time line to ensure existing civilian and military personnel meet the new foundational and residential qualification standards by 2025 and 2026 respectively, across the various cyber work force elements. To address on-going work force challenges, we incorporated 3 DCWF mission-critical cyber work roles (to include Cyberspace Operator, Exploitation Analyst, and Software Developer), with potential for future expansion of the DCWF to ensure qualified personnel are recruited and retained to support the cyber mission across the DoD. In addition, the Department is working concurrently across the Services, OSD, and the 4th Estate to ensure that cyber work force positions are accurately coded. We continue to work with our partners from across the Department to improve the fidelity of our cyber work force coding using key performance indicators, to in turn report and measure the health of the cyber work force. Improving the accuracy of our data will further enable the Department to quickly plan and execute the cyber missions. academic outreach and partnerships As cyber space risks continue to evolve in complexity and frequency, fostering collaboration between the Federal Government and academic institutions becomes imperative. Earlier this month, we established in alignment with fiscal year 2024 NDAA Section 1531, the DoD Cyber Academic Engagement Office (CAEO). My office will use the enhanced authorities granted to serve as a nexus for forging partnerships, facilitating information exchange, and nurturing talent in cyber space work force. Additionally, the CAEO signifies a concerted effort to track data and metrics regarding academic programs and their graduates. By systematically monitoring the performance and outcomes of covered academic engagement programs to include: Primary, secondary, or post-secondary education programs with a cyber focus; DoD recruitment and retention programs for civilian and military personnel, including scholarship programs; academic partnerships focused on establishing defense civilian and military cyber talent, the DoD can identify emerging trends, evaluate the effectiveness of educational initiatives, and strategically allocate resources to areas of critical need. This data-driven approach ensures academic institutions are equipped to produce highly-skilled cyber professionals and enables the DoD to adapt its strategies in response to evolving threats and technological advancements. The DoD CAEO plays a pivotal role in strengthening the Nation's cyber defense capabilities by leveraging the expertise and innovation within academia while fostering a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration. The DoD CIO administers the DoD Cyber Service Academy (DoD CSA), formerly known as the DoD Cyber Scholarship Program (DoD CySP), which awards scholarships to U.S. Citizens pursuing cyber-related degrees at designated institutions. Recipients of these scholarships are afforded experiential learning opportunities through a DoD internship, providing invaluable exposure to DoD cultures and agencies. This approach not only enhances the qualifications and capabilities of our work force members but also initiates the clearance process, ensuring that applicants are pre-cleared before commencing full-time employment. For the 2024 cycle, 95 National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-Cs) submitted proposals to support scholars under the DoD CSA. Of those 95 academic institutions, 6 are Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and 14 are first-time participants and nominating students for the recruitment and/or retention programs. The Department is committed to supporting higher education and to prepare the DoD work force to address threats against the Department's critical information systems and networks. The Department is poised to bring the DoD CSA, to fruition as an additional tool to recruit and retain top cyber talent. The average cost of a DoD CSA scholarship for one academic year is $79k per student. Per law, the scholarship includes tuition, books, fees, stipend, summer internship salary support, a technology and certification allowance, as well as faculty and administrative support. The DoD CSA provided scholarship offers to more than 165 U.S. Citizens in 2024 and aims to maintain this 17 percent increase per year. In order to allow a whole-of-Government approach, we are determining the feasibility of allowing students from other Federal Agencies to take advantage of the DoD CSA on a reimbursable basis. The Department appreciates the opportunity Congress granted the Department to expand the DoD CSA to award 1,000 scholarships per year by fiscal year 2026 and is exploring options to resource this Congressional requirement. This effort will further bolster the commitments from DoD and Congress to support higher education to prepare the DoD work force to combat threats against the Department's critical information system and networks. The Department is currently tracking approximately 450 designated academic institutions that are eligible to participate in the DoD CSA. Each eligible institution is invited to participate in the DoD CSA program and determines, based on their internal manpower, if they can support such a program on campus. Managing a scholarship on campus requires commitment and resources that may not be available. Any institution who achieves their designation by January 15, 2025, will be eligible to participate in the 2025 DoD CSA application cycle. Thank you for your support on this issue. We are committed and dedicated in our combined mission of ensuring that our Nation continues to be a leader in the cyber space landscape and combat any challenges to our national security. We look forward to continuing to work with this committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning, I look forward to your questions. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Ms. Beavers. I now recognize Mr. Petersen for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF RODNEY PETERSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INITIATIVE FOR CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Mr. Petersen. Thank you, Chairman Garbarino and Congresswoman Ramirez and Members of the committee. I am Rodney Petersen. I am the director of the NICE Program Office at NIST, and I'm pleased to testify before you today. I want to briefly share three stories. Devonie Nelson started her journey into the cybersecurity field after experiencing a series of personal and career setbacks as a single mom. She eventually chose to pivot careers, from biology to cybersecurity, and an organization provided her essential financial support along the way to enable her to complete her education and eventually acquire a good job as a junior cybersecurity engineer in a health care company. Jimmy Minhinnett left high school before completing his diploma, and for the next 10 years worked hard, physically demanding shifts as a commercial truck driver. As a result of the impact of the pandemic on the trucking industry, which coincided with the death of his father, who had worked in IT, Jimmy completed a cybersecurity certificate program on weekends while continuing to work. After acquiring that credential, Jimmy received a good job as an information security associate with a financial services company. Shane Wallace, who grew up in a military family, enlisted in the Army as a combat medic. He concurrently pursued a degree in health care administration. He held various leadership roles, oversaw complex logistics operations, and spearheaded crucial medical initiatives. His passion for technology led him to complete a training program on cloud computing for transitioning veterans that led him into a good job as a junior engineer. These are just three stories of individuals who have pursued a career in cybersecurity through alternative pathways, and their journey provide the answer to the question for this hearing, how to find workers to address America's cybersecurity work force gap. NICE is best known for the NICE Framework that provides a common taxonomy for describing cybersecurity work. It's used by employers, education and training providers, and learners, including students, job seekers, and employees. The NICE Framework components of work roles and competency areas are key to navigating the CyberSeek website, a tool that helps career seekers discover cybersecurity careers. NICE also uses its convening power to support a Community Coordinating Council that includes communities of interest on topics such as cybersecurity apprenticeships, competitions, diversity and inclusion, K-12 cybersecurity education, and more. The Council also includes working groups that help achieve NICE's strategic plan, goals, and objectives. The first goal is to promote the discovery of cybersecurity careers and multiple pathways. We hold a Cybersecurity Career Week campaign each fall to help career seekers discover the variety of types of careers in cybersecurity and the multiple learning pathways. The second goal is to transform learning to build and sustain a skilled and diverse work force. We prioritize hands- on learning experiences and performance-based assessments that measure capabilities to perform NICE Framework tasks. The third goal is to modernize the talent management process to address cybersecurity skills gaps. We support the capability of organizations and sectors to more effectively recruit, hire, develop, and retain the talent needed to manage cybersecurity-related risk. The fourth goal seeks to expand use of the NICE Framework. We promote the benefits of standardizing education and work force programs, including alignment to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the NIST Privacy Framework, and other cybersecurity guidance. The final goal in the NICE Strategic Plan seeks to drive research on effective practices for cybersecurity work force development. We use those research results to inform programs, curriculum design, learning opportunities, ensure equity, and much more. NICE hosts several key events throughout the year, and these events bring together stakeholders to showcase best practices, highlight emerging trends, and inspire action. We also produce and share several resources, including a Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Finder and a listing of free and low-cost on-line cybersecurity learning content. In conclusion, the recent 15th Annual NICE Conference served to celebrate the growth and progress toward fulfilling our mission to create an integrated ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and work force development. However, we must continuously strive to prepare, grow, and sustain the cybersecurity work force that the public and private sectors need to safeguard our national security and promote America's economic prosperity. So thank you for the opportunity to testify today on NIST's cybersecurity, education, and work force activities, and look forward to answering any questions.  Prepared Statement of Rodney Petersen June 26, 2024 Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the committee, I am Rodney Petersen, director of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Program Office at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the Department of Commerce. I am pleased to testify before you today on behalf of the NICE program and to illuminate our vision to prepare, grow, and sustain a cybersecurity work force that safeguards and promotes American's national security and economic prosperity. I want to briefly share three stories: Devonie Nelson is a junior cybersecurity engineer who started her journey into the cybersecurity field while a single Mom with significant personal and financial challenges. After graduating with a biology degree, she experienced a series of personal and career challenges as a young adult. She eventually enrolled in a Security Management master's degree program with a concentration in cybersecurity. Along the way, she discovered a philanthropic organization that enabled her to persist in her educational journey and eventually acquire a cybersecurity position at a health care company. Now, she has dedicated herself to sharing with others her experiences and the opportunities available to eliminate some of the initial hurdles faced when entering the cybersecurity field, especially as a minority first-generation student. Jimmy Minhinnett was a truck driver who is now an information security associate with a company in the financial services sector. Although he understood the impact of technology at a young age thanks to his father who worked in IT, life circumstances took him in a different direction. He left high school before completing his diploma and for the next 10 years worked hard, physically demanding shifts as a commercial truck driver. As a result of the impact of the pandemic on the trucking industry--combined with grieving the death of his father-- he decided to pursue a new career and that led to the discovery of a cybersecurity certificate program that he completed on weekends while continuing to work. After acquiring that credential, he received a good job that changed his life. Shane Wallace is the product of a military family, and he enlisted in the Army as a combat medic in 2014. Through his military service, he demonstrated a relentless commitment to excellence, concurrently pursuing a degree in Healthcare Administration. His assignments spanned the globe, where he held various leadership roles, overseeing complex logistics operations and spearheading crucial medical initiatives. As he transitioned from military service in 2023, his passion for technology led him to pursue and graduate from a training program for transitioning veterans where he developed a competency in cloud computing that led to an eventual role as a junior engineer with a private-sector employer. These are just 3 examples of individuals who have pursued a cybersecurity career through alternative pathways--and their stories help to address the focus of this hearing on how to find workers to address America's cybersecurity work force gap. They shared their stories earlier this month at the annual NICE Conference & Expo,\1\ which was held in Dallas. However, their stories represent a growing number of Americans who are getting into good-paying, meaningful careers in cybersecurity through the many different education or training pathways available to them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ https://niceconference.org/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NICE's mission is to energize, promote, and coordinate a robust community working together to create an integrated ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and work force development. This mission aligns with the administration's broader efforts in modernizing Federal hiring and strengthening the Federal work force. As part of this NIST is also supporting broader work force efforts including but not limited to the President's Management Agenda, the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy implementation, the National Security Memoradum-3 ``Memorandum on Revitalizing America's Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships'' and the AI Executive Order. The NICE Program Office also actively promotes and supports the Department of Commerce Principles on Highly Effective Workforce Investments \2\ and the Department of Commerce and Department of Labor's Good Jobs Principles.\3\ Today's testimony will focus on signature programs led by NIST beginning with the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (or NICE Framework). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ https://www.commerce.gov/issues/workforce-development. \3\ https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- federal coordination and coherence As part of the administration-wide effort to connect Americans to Good Jobs in cyber, NICE coordinates with the White House of Office of National Cyber Director (ONCD), Office of Management and Budget, and through the National Cyber Workforce Coordination Group to integrate and align its work with the President's Management Agenda, National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES) implementation, Registered Apprenticeship EO, and Workforce Hub Efforts. For example, NICE is co-chair of the Working Group on Cyber Skills and Awareness as well as the Working Group on Cyber Workforce and Education. nice workforce framework for cybersecurity (nice framework) The NICE Framework \4\ provides a common taxonomy or lexicon for describing cybersecurity work. It is used by employers to assess their work force needs and to shape work force development, including writing job descriptions that are more consistent and effective across organizations and sectors. The NICE Framework is also used by education and training providers to develop content and provide learning experiences to ensure that students or learners can develop skills and acquire credentials that attest to their capabilities. It is also used by learners, including students, job seekers, and employees, to identify the skills and credentials necessary to enter and advance in high-quality jobs in the cybersecurity career. The NICE Program Office released version 1.0.0 of the NICE Framework components in March, which represents a comprehensive update to the core content of the NICE Framework (NIST Special Publication 800-181r1). The recently updated NICE Framework includes 52 Work Roles across 7 categories, 11 new Competency Areas, and over 2,220 Task, Knowledge, and Skill statements. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/ NIST.SP.800-181r1.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- cyberseek: interactive cybersecurity jobs heatmap and career pathway tool Another signature program of NICE is our partnership with CompTIA and Lightcast, which has resulted in the production of CyberSeek. The CyberSeek.org \5\ website is a tool that can help learners discover cybersecurity careers and policy makers, such as yourself, discover the dynamics of work force supply and demand across the United States as well as in States or major metropolitan areas. Lightcast also developed the Quarterly Cybersecurity Talent Report as a commitment to support the NCWES from ONCD. It leverages and expands upon data Lightcast provides to CyberSeek.org. The updates to CyberSeek and the Cybersecurity Talent Report earlier this month revealed that, for the past 12 months in the United States, there were 469,930 cybersecurity job postings, 1,239,018 existing cybersecurity workers, and 85 skilled cybersecurity workers for every 100 demanded by employers. While these numbers suggest modest improvements and indicate that we are making headway, there is still a talent gap of 225,000 cybersecurity workers needed to meet employer demand. In the DC metropolitan area alone, there are 66,775 cybersecurity jobs available and 36,908 across the entire State of Texas.\6\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ https://www.cyberseek.org/. \6\ https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- nice strategic plan (2021-2025) The NICE Strategic Plan \7\ and corresponding implementation plan is another signature program of NICE and establishes our vision, mission, and values. It also sets forth 5 goals with corresponding objectives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\ https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/ strategic-plan. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- promote the discovery of cybersecurity careers and multiple pathways The first goal is to Promote the Discovery of Cybersecurity Careers and Multiple Pathways. As you heard earlier, the learning pathways to a career in cybersecurity can vary from learning experiences in high school or college leading to an academic degree to training programs or bootcamps that result in an industry-recognized certification to a Registered Apprenticeship or other earn and learn experience that culminates in a certificate of completion. However, providing multiple learning pathways is not enough if learners do not understand the variety of types of careers that are available in cybersecurity. That is why during the third week of October each year, as part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we hold a Cybersecurity Career Week,\8\ that is a campaign to promote the discovery of cybersecurity careers and share resources that increase understanding and engagement in the multiple learning pathways and credentials that lead to careers in cybersecurity. The week is typically kicked off with a Capitol Hill event hosted by the House Cybersecurity Caucus and Senate Cybersecurity Caucus and other events throughout the week including the US Cyber Team Draft Day,\9\ webinars, social media campaigns, and workplace events to showcase careers in cybersecurity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/events/ cybersecurity-career-week. \9\ https://www.uscybergames.com/draft-day. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- transform learning to build and sustain a skilled and diverse workforce The second goal is to Transform Learning to Build and Sustain a Skilled and Diverse Workforce. There are many opportunities for innovation in the learning process that will increase the likelihood that job seekers are job-ready to enter employment. Examples include more hands-on learning experiences and the use of performance-based assessments that measure competencies and capabilities to perform NICE Framework tasks. In an era when ``skills-based approaches'' is the mantra of employers and educators, we need to improve the quality and transparency of available credentials that serve to demonstrate and validate the competencies of a learner. We also need to advocate multidisciplinary approaches that integrate cybersecurity across disciplines, recognizing that a basic level of cybersecurity knowledge and skills are increasingly necessary in almost every career field and in every sector of the economy. The Cybersecurity Across Disciplines Conference \10\ is an example of an event that brings together community and technical college faculty from diverse disciplines to explore the intersection of cybersecurity within their specific educational program areas and the critical infrastructure sectors they serve, including but not limited to manufacturing, health care, retail, engineering, and finance. And, building on the NICE value to Model Inclusion, this strategic plan goal emphasizes advocating and enabling engagement of stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and experiences. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \10\ https://www.ncyte.net/about-ncyte/events/cyad-summit- cybersecurity-across-disciplines. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- modernize the talent management process to address cybersecurity skills gaps The third goal is to Modernize the Talent Management Process to Address Cybersecurity Skills Gaps. It fundamentally seeks to enhance the capabilities of organizations and sectors to more effectively recruit, hire, develop, and retain the talent needed to manage cybersecurity-related risks. Building on other foundational NIST publications, such as the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework,\11\ this goal helps organizations to focus on the ``people'' and workplace skills needed in their organizations who work alongside ``technologies'' or ``processes'' to manage cybersecurity risks. A few examples of reforms that are needed include: Establishing more entry- level positions and opportunities that provide avenues for growth and advancement; aligning qualification requirements according to proficiency levels to reflect the competencies and capabilities needed to perform tasks in the NICE Framework; encouraging on-going development and training of employees, including rotational and exchange programs, to foster and retain talent with diverse skills and experiences; and reskilling the unemployed, underemployed, incumbent work force, and transitioning veterans or military spouses to prepare them for good jobs in cybersecurity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \11\ https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- expand use of the nice workforce framework for cybersecurity (nice framework) The fourth goal seeks to Expand Use of the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity or NICE Framework. This goal starts with increasing awareness of the benefits of the NICE Framework to employers, educators, and training providers. This goal goes on to ensure that the NICE Framework is aligned to other NIST resources, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the NIST Privacy Framework,\12\ and other cybersecurity, privacy, and risk management publications or guidance. We are also keenly aware that tasks in the NICE Framework will be increasingly performed by automated techniques and will need to update knowledge and skill statements to incorporate appropriate and ethical use of artificial intelligence in the completion of cybersecurity tasks. Our international partners, especially developing nations, are increasingly looking to NIST resources, including the NICE Framework, as a model for their national efforts. That is why NICE recently partnered with the State Department to bring individuals representing over 20 countries to the NICE Conference & Expo earlier this month to learn more about their cybersecurity work force development efforts and share how the NICE Framework is being widely used across the United States. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- drive research on effective practices for cybersecurity workforce development The final goal in the NICE Strategic Plan seeks to Drive Research on Effective Practices for Cybersecurity Workforce Development. That is why each month, during our NICE Community Coordinating Council Meeting, we feature recent reports or research results that spotlight the most effective and proven practices. Similarly, we use research results to inform programs and curriculum design, foster continuous learning opportunities, impact learner success, and ensure equitable access. Again, supporting the NICE values to Challenge Assumptions, Stimulate Innovation, Act Based on Evidence, and Evaluate and Improve, we are working together as a community to pursue objective and reliable sources of information and using data to inform actions or decisions. foster communication, facilitate collaboration, and share and leverage resources Let me conclude by just highlighting a few other ways in which NICE fulfills its mission--through its convening power and the development and dissemination of resources. On a monthly basis, NICE, convenes an interagency coordinating council of representatives from across Federal Government departments and agencies and the Executive Office of the President to coordinate and collaborate on national cybersecurity education and work force development initiatives. We also convene a NICE Community Coordinating Council that is co-chaired by a leader from academia and industry. The Council includes working groups that correspond to each of the NICE Framework goals and communities of interest on topics such as cybersecurity apprenticeships, competitions, diversity and inclusion, K12 cybersecurity education, and more. To promote and energize a robust community working together, NICE hosts several key events \13\ each year, including the Annual NICE Conference and Expo, the Regional Initiative for Cybersecurity Education and Training Conference for the Americas, a NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference, Cybersecurity Career Week, and a monthly NICE Webinar Series. These events bring together stakeholders to increase awareness and understanding, showcase effective practices and solutions, and expand our horizons by focusing on emerging and future trends. We also produce and share several resources,\14\ most of them developed with input from the broader community, including the NICE Framework Resource Center, the NICE Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Finder, one-pagers on topics such as Cybersecurity Workforce Demand, and a listing of Free and Low-Cost On-line Cybersecurity Learning Content. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/events. \14\ https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary In conclusion, the recent NICE Conference & Expo held in Dallas was our 15th annual conference and served to celebrate the establishment of NICE in 2008 by the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. Over the past 15 years, we've seen considerable growth and progress toward fulfilling our mission to create an integrated system of cybersecurity education, training, and work force development. However, the present and future promises to introduce new challenges and opportunities, and we must remain vigilant to continuously prepare, grow, and sustain the cybersecurity work force that the public and private sector will need to safeguard our national security and promote America's economic prosperity. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on NIST's Cybersecurity Workforce activities, and I look forward to answering any questions. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Petersen. I now recognize Mr. Mo for 5 minutes to summarize his opening statement. STATEMENT OF SEEYEW MO, ASSISTANT NATIONAL CYBER DIRECTOR, CYBER WORKFORCE, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION, OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL CYBER DIRECTOR Mr. Mo. Good morning, Chairman Garbarino, Congresswoman Ramirez, and distinguished Members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today with some of ONCD's closest Federal partners about the critical demand for cyber work force. While this challenge to meet this demand is daunting, this is also an opportunity. Filling these jobs is necessary to advance our national security and our economic prosperity. Whether one serves in the public or the private sector, a career in cyber can put you on the front lines, protecting and defending our digital way of life. There's an abundance of talented individuals in every corner of our country who can help us meet this demand. It's up to us to remove barriers and broaden pathways for them to get into these good-paying, meaningful jobs in cyber. There are a number of challenges we must overcome to build the cyber work force this Nation needs. First, many Americans haven't considered a job in cyber at all. They may assume the jobs are narrow, highly technical, and done by a hacker in a hoodie in a dark room. Oftentimes, they haven't seen anyone like them or they know who has taken a path into a cyber career. Even for those who are interested, there are barriers to entry, even if they have the skills to do the job. Second, while we have good education and work force development systems, they're struggling to keep up with the increasing demand for cyber talent. We need more educators, training programs, and equipment for hands-on learning of critical cyber skills. Third and finally, we know that many of the best solutions are unique to each community and its partners. Right now, there are not enough locally-driven efforts to connect individuals to training, to jobs, and services. We call this the locally- driven ecosystem model. The administration is driving a whole-of-Nation approach to connect Americans to these good-paying, meaningful jobs in cyber. First, the foundation of this effort is the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy that ONCD developed in collaboration with 34 Federal agencies and hundreds of key external stakeholders. Second, the Federal Government cannot solve this issue alone, and stakeholder collaboration is critical to success. Over a hundred organizations have made voluntary commitments to grow and hire cyber talent. Third, our approach recognizes that the jobs we need to fill are not just in IT but across industry and within companies both large and small. That's why we're making cyber an integral part of our work force and education priorities to unlock resources and new partnerships to grow the Nation's cyber work force in utility companies, agriculture, energy, health care, education, manufacturing, and more. As a result, we can report on our initial actions to date. To open up cyber careers to all Americans and remove unnecessary barriers, we are focusing on skills. The administration is leading by example by modernizing the Federal hiring process and fully embracing skills-based approaches for IT positions. Furthermore, the pivot extends to Federal IT and cyber contractors across the country. To strengthen education in work force development systems we are identifying Federal investments to expand opportunities through quality hands-on training and learning programs, such as cyber clinics and earn-and-learned registered apprenticeship programs. The National Security Agency provided grants to launch cyber clinics in Louisiana, Minnesota, Nevada, and Virginia. The Department of Labor is now serving more than 13,000 cyber apprentices across the country as a result of the work initiated under the 120-Day Cybersecurity Registered Apprenticeship Sprint with partners and continued through the Registered Apprenticeship Executive Order. To increase the use of locally-driven ecosystem models, we have convened stakeholders across the country to establish or expand ecosystems and to share best practices. Most importantly, we know that the best solutions come not solely from Washington, DC, but from the innovative partnerships and ideas we find in communities across the country, just like in each of your district. We made a lot of progress, and there's a lot more work to be done. The demand for cyber talent will continue to grow as the world becomes increasingly digitized. We are committed to be working with Congress to connect Americans to good-paying, meaningful jobs in cyber that advance our national security and economic prosperity. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions.  Prepared Statement of Seeyew Mo June 26, 2024 Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and distinguished Members of the committee, thank you for holding this important hearing to address the challenges facing the Nation's cyber work force. The White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) is leaning in to tackle persistent cybersecurity challenges, protect the Nation, and foster economic prosperity. One of these persistent challenges is the dire need for cyber talent. The problem is clear--we need more talent, not only in the Federal Government, but also in State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector. The number of open cyber jobs-- approximately a half-million Nation-wide--is enormous and the trend line must improve. With this challenge, there's an opportunity--we have an abundance of talented individuals in our country who can help us meet this need. They can enter a career field that--whether they work in Government or in the private sector--helps secure our Nation. A career with purpose. A career that offers a good-paying, meaningful job. We must remove barriers and broaden pathways for these individuals to get into cyber careers. Many stakeholders, from Congress and this administration to industry, academia, and civil society, have been working diligently to solve the cyber work force challenge. Throughout our 3-year history, we in ONCD have acknowledged that we are not the first to tackle the challenges to grow the cyber work force, nor are we alone in our efforts. As the assistant national cyber director for cyber work force, education, training and awareness, I am honored to lead a team of cyber work force experts to coordinate the implementation of the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES), released by ONCD last July, and to align that effort with priorities such as the President's Management Agenda, recent investments in Workforce and Technology Hubs across the Nation, and efforts to strengthen the work force for in- demand industries, just to name a few. I am pleased to testify with some of ONCD's closest Federal partners here today. The diligent work of these and many other Federal agencies is helping to expand and strengthen our Nation's cyber work force throughout every sector of the economy, including Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments. Although the problem we have is clear, the solutions are complex, and I look forward to updating the committee on how the administration is advancing both our national security and our economic prosperity by working to connect more Americans to good-paying, meaningful jobs in cyber. I will describe, from ONCD's perspective, the challenges we face meeting the cyber work force demand, articulate the administration's whole-of-Nation approach, and highlight some initial implementation successes. the challenges facing our cyber work force The United States is completely reliant on a digital backbone that facilitates everything from the power, gas, and water coming into our homes to the systems that keep our roads, bridges, airports, banks, schools, hospitals, businesses, and military facilities functioning. This connectivity comes with risks, including the vulnerability of systems and networks to attacks on that digital foundation. There's a lot we need to do--and are doing--to better protect our Nation and its critical infrastructure in cyber space. One thing that is certain is that we need the talent to do the job. That means that we must find, hire, develop, retain, empower, and inspire more people to help us fill the approximately half-million open positions across the Nation, across different industries and sectors, that are important to the security of our Nation's critical infrastructure. We need cyber talent not just in information technology (IT), or finance, but also in manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, energy, health care, and other sectors and industries. There are a number of issues facing our work force: First, many Americans don't see opportunities for themselves in cyber, often assuming that jobs in cyber are narrow or highly technical. Further, even when we have individuals that are interested, willing, and ready to serve, there are barriers that keep them from these opportunities, such as degree requirements that may be unnecessary when job seekers have the skills and experience to fill the need. Next, demand for cyber workers exceeds the current capacity of work force development and education systems. We need more opportunities and pathways to train workers to be cyber-ready. We also need educators, from K-12 to faculty with doctorates, with the knowledge to teach cyber, and support to expand hands- on learning opportunities on the latest technologies and facilities. Additionally, the training and education infrastructures that exist today need to adapt to the changing cyber skills and demands presented by the rapidly-evolving technological landscape. Finally, there are not enough locally-driven ecosystems to develop the pipeline for cyber talent. We can't meet demand unless academia, Federal and local government, and the private sector work together to build a pipeline for cyber workers. Connecting individuals to training, helping them find jobs, providing wraparound services, and more, requires leadership and investment from a variety of local stakeholders. This challenge is compounded by the dynamic nature of the national security environment and the rapid acceleration of global crises, new technologies, vulnerable software and systems, and novel threats. Artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and technologies that have yet to be invented, will require an agile and dynamic work force with foundational cyber skills in every industry, sector, and occupation that can understand, leverage, develop, maintain, and protect the next generation of advanced cyber capabilities. The only way we can defend the digital foundation of our modern way of life is to ensure that everyone has a pathway into a cyber-based career and our work force is equipped with the skills to meet any future demands. That's why ONCD is focusing on removing barriers and broadening pathways. national cyber workforce and education strategy development To address these enormous challenges, ONCD undertook a comprehensive approach to develop a national strategy that addresses educating, training, and employing the cyber work force. ONCD acknowledges that the Federal Government, working alone, cannot adequately address the many challenges we face in filling current and future cyber work roles with a skilled work force. Consequently, in the development of the strategy, ONCD collaborated with 34 Federal agencies, Executive Office of the President (EOP) components, and hundreds of key external stakeholders to identify current challenges and best practices, and grasp the true root of the issues we are facing. These NCWES guiding principles address the challenges mentioned above: First, broaden the appeal of cyber careers to more Americans.--In order to achieve the best mission outcomes, we need the best possible team. One of the most effective ways to grow our supply of cyber talent is to attract people of all ages, all demographics, and all backgrounds especially those that are underrepresented in the cyber work force today. Second, focus on a skills-based approaches.--We must expand access to cyber skills training and education to all Americans. When individuals have the skills and abilities to learn new technologies, it creates a dynamic work force that meets the demand of new developments and disruptions, like the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence we are seeing today. We must encourage the adoption of skills-based approaches to open up pathways to good-paying jobs for Americans with the skills to do them, regardless of how they acquire those skills. Third, encourage ecosystem development.--The strategy aims to encourage partnerships between public and private stakeholders that can meet specific regional and sector-based talent needs. For example, this includes employers communicating with school systems, academia, and training programs on the skills needed to fill open jobs and meet the demand for cyber skills in the future. To meet these cyber work force challenges, we know that the best solutions come not solely from Washington, but from the innovative partnerships and ideas we find in communities such as those in your districts across the country. I have seen some of the best solutions come from among local government, employers, school districts, higher education institutions, and non-profits coming together to solve cyber work force and education demands. These partnerships create pathways for potential job candidates to consider a cyber career and connect them with learning experiences to gain the skills to meet their communities' needs. coherence and cohesion in implementation To advance and coordinate Federal Government cyber work force and education activities, ONCD established the National Cyber Workforce Coordination Group (NCWCG), composed of ONCD and Senior Executive Service-level leadership from Federal agencies that supported the development of the NCWES. The NCWCG is chaired by ONCD and oversees 3 subordinate working groups--Federal Cyber Workforce Working Group (FCWWG), the Working Group on Cyber Workforce and Education (WG-CWE), and the Working Group on Cyber Skills and Awareness (WG-CSA)--pursuing the objectives in the NCWES. Each of these working groups is co-chaired by ONCD and one or more Federal agencies. Through these working groups, agencies are actively participating in the implementation of the NCWES by leading initiatives and producing deliverables that respond to the challenges facing cyber education and work force development. This ensures that NCWES implementation activities are coordinated and cohesive to maximize progress and the impact of taxpayer investments. In addition, ONCD is synchronizing its activities with the goals in the President's Management Agenda; the directives of National Security Memorandum 3, ``Revitalizing America's Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships''; and ensuring that its strategy for growing and strengthening the cyber work force is in harmony with other Federal initiatives, including Workforce Hubs, Tech Hubs, and Technology and Innovation Partnerships. ONCD is also synchronizing activities in support of President Biden's Executive Order 14119--``Scaling and Expanding the Use of Registered Apprenticeships in Industries and the Federal Government and Promoting Labor-Management Forums,'' and Executive Order 14110--``Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.'' The progress we have made thus far is bringing a more unified and collaborative approach at the national level and laying stronger groundwork for the development of the cyber work force. By linking cyber work force development with other work force and education efforts, this approach is poised to yield a more diverse array of skilled cyber professionals through consistent and focused education and training offerings. ncwes initial implementation progress Over the past year, this interagency collaboration has yielded significant progress toward investing in cyber education and work force development to fill jobs, and consequently have more defenders to protect our Nation's most critical systems. Strengthening the Federal Cyber Workforce On April 29, 2024, the national cyber director announced that the Biden-Harris administration is modernizing the Federal hiring process, fully embracing skills-based approaches for information technology management positions. Aligned with broader strategic hiring objectives, this modernization effort will include use of registered apprenticeships programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is leading the transition of the Information Technology (IT) Management job series, numbered 2210, to skills-based hiring and talent development practices. The 2210 job series includes nearly 100,000 IT workers across all Federal agencies and represents a majority of the Federal IT work force. This effort is a critical step in removing barriers that prevent qualified job seekers from entering the Federal cyber work force. Furthermore, the effort extends to contractors that also play a role in our Federal cyber work force. The Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced an effort to pivot to a skills-based approach in IT and cyber contracts. ONCD is also working with OMB to encourage wider adoption of Section 39.104 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which states that when acquiring information technology services, solicitations must not describe any minimum experience or educational requirements for contracted personnel. To continue bringing cyber talent into the Federal Government, the Tech to Gov Working Group (TTGWG), a workstream of the FCWWG led by OPM, held a second Tech to Gov Job Fair on April 18, 2024. More than 1,700 attendees from all 50 States registered and met with over 100 agency representatives. Since the first Tech to Gov Job Fair about a year ago , approximately 150 tentative job offers have been made and more are under way. Another Tech to Gov job fair is tentatively scheduled for the fall of 2024. Some cyber roles require clearances, which can be a barrier to timely hiring and can cause candidates to accept other job offers due to clearance delays. Under the Trusted Workforce 2.0 initiative led by the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council (PAC), some gains have been realized: The average amount of time needed to complete a security clearance background investigation has fallen from 411 to 155 days for a Top Secret clearance and from 173 to 53 days for a Secret clearance. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, over 27,000 new hires were cleared using preliminary determinations, a practice by which agencies clear personnel with clean records for on- boarding based on the highest-value background checks. The PAC is working to expand this practice by implementing ambitious targets of 45 days for Top Secret clearances and 25 days for Secret clearances. Expanding and Enhancing America's Cyber Workforce To promote cyber work force growth opportunities, ONCD continues to hold outreach events across the country. Over the past year, events have been held in collaboration with State and local stakeholders to expand the cyber work force in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. These events help amplify the Biden-Harris administration's work force growth priorities; highlight needs, solutions, and progress in these communities; and engage and promote cyber work force and education ecosystems of stakeholders across all industries and sectors. Over the course of these travels, ONCD has learned about innovative and proven best practices from local leaders, which can be shared and scaled to further enhance and expand the cyber work force across the Nation. One of these practices is hands-on, work-based learning, primarily through apprenticeships and paid internships consistent with the Good Jobs Principles--an initiative to uplift Americans into good- paying jobs, including cyber jobs. To further increase access to registered apprenticeships in fields such as cybersecurity, in 2023 the Department of Labor (DOL) awarded approximately $108 million in grants and contracts to expand Registered Apprenticeships in high-growth and in-demand industries. DOL also worked with other Federal agencies to conduct a registered cyber apprenticeship sprint and has served more than 13,000 cyber apprentices to date. To build on this effort, earlier this year, DOL also announced the availability of nearly $200 million in grants to continue to support public-private partnerships that expand, diversify, and strengthen Registered Apprenticeships in education, care, clean energy, IT/cybersecurity, supply chain, and other in-demand industries. Many private-sector organizations are conducting their own voluntary initiatives in support of the NCWES. This private-sector engagement has created a groundswell of additional commitments to support cyber career growth opportunities in various sectors spanning from health care to manufacturing, water and wastewater systems to K-12 education, agriculture and transportation to the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and more. Investments from both public and private sectors are key to our success. For example, the National Security Agency (NSA), through grants to National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C) institutions, launched Cyber Clinics in Louisiana, Minnesota, Nevada, and Virginia. Cyber Clinics support communities and small governments that would otherwise not have access to cyber risk assessment and planning assistance and provide an opportunity for over 200 students to develop competencies while in a supervised learning environment. The Cyber Clinics model has garnered private-sector investments of over $25 million that enabled the opening of clinics at 45 more institutions. moving forward Though significant progress has been made, more work needs to be done to continue to deepen and broaden our cyber talent pool to strengthen and defend our national cyber space. To advance NCWES implementation, we will work with our partners and stakeholders to: Explore innovative solutions to engage the public at different education and career levels to learn cyber skills and consider a career in cyber. Encourage the adoption of skills-based approaches by employers and increase work-based learning opportunities. Facilitate a hiring surge to fill open Federal cyber positions by conducting cyber hiring sprints to generate job offers and continue to support CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service. Seek to expand foundational cyber skills learning opportunities and increase the capacity of K-12 systems and higher education institutions to provide impactful cybersecurity learning experiences. Look into boosting participation of students and educators in cyber scholarship programs. Leverage the collective strength of all Federal agencies to increase participation and promote the value of veterans, separating service members, and military spouses in the cyber work force. Encourage the development of locally-driven or sector- specific systems nationwide. Continue to support Federal coordination of broader talent initiatives involving tech, cyber, and AI. The administration will strive to lead by example as we work to expand the use of skills-based hiring and talent development for Federal cyber positions and contracts. In addition, Federal agencies will work with academia to expand concurrent, credit transfer and articulation opportunities for academic credit, further integrate cyber across academic disciplines, and increase the availability of low-cost and no-cost cyber training and education curricula. closing Let me close by quoting National Cyber Director Coker on the importance of our mission. ``We defend cyber space not because it is some distant terrain on which we battle our adversaries. We defend cyber space because it is interwoven into our very lives--because it underpins the critical systems that enable us to work, live, and play--because it is a matter of national security.'' We need more Americans to join the cyber work force so that all Americans can benefit from the enormous potential of our interconnected future. That's why growing and strengthening the cyber work force is a key pillar of the President's National Cybersecurity Strategy. The administration will continue to execute the whole-of-Nation approach conveyed in the NCWES to drive change in the public and private sectors through engagement and collaboration. The Federal Government is pursuing activities to respond to the critical need for cyber workers; encourage more Americans to consider cyber careers, increase skills-based hiring, talent development, and education nationwide; address barriers faced by Federal and non-Federal stakeholders; proactively analyze and monitor the changing labor demand for cyber skills; and continue to advance our cyber posture, national security, economy, and society. And ONCD will continue to monitor and report on the progress of these actions. We are committed to working together with Congress and other partners to connect Americans to good-paying, meaningful jobs in cyber. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Mo. I'll just say the committee's not going to hold it against you for stealing some of our cyber talent. They did call votes like they said they would. We're--so we're going to now take a short recess, and we'll reconvene 10 minutes after votes, which will probably be in about a half hour or so. So we are in recess.   Mr. Garbarino . The committee will come to order. Thank you all, for the witnesses, for waiting. Members will now be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 minutes of questioning. I remind everyone to please keep their questioning to 5 minutes. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questions. While we often discuss the work force gap, we overlook those who are currently in our work force. They may not possess the right skills to keep up with cyber threat landscape even though they fill critical roles. Mr. Petersen, what does it mean to be a qualified cyber professional today? Mr. Petersen. So we would turn to qualifications based on our NICE Framework that identifies work to be performed and knowledge or skills that a worker would need. As we've said through our testimony, that can be acquired through a variety of different ways: through education, through training, through on-the-job experience, work-based learning experiences. So for us, qualifications start with something like the NICE Framework as a standard. Then I think, second, to your point, it doesn't always have to come externally. It could be existing workers who can be reskilled or upskilled into cybersecurity. Mr. Garbarino. Mr. Mo, how do we professionalize the cyber work force while we move away from 4-year degrees? Mr. Mo. I think that's why we want to focus on skill-based approaches. When you think about skills, once we sort-of, like, figure out how to map out the skills that we need, then match it with, you know--you know, assessment on how someone have the skills, that's how we can do it. The reality here is that you don't need a cyber in your job title to actually be doing cyber work these days, right. So that's like the key point here. So as we are trying to kind-of map out the professionalism--to professionalize the whole cyber work force, we have to think about broadly the whole cyber--the whole work force in itself. Mr. Garbarino. So I have spoken to countless CISOs from Fortune 400, Fortune 500 companies. They are all moving to skills-based hiring, away from degree-based hiring. So for the Federal Government, what are--what are some of those effective pathways you've--or for skills-based training and hiring that you've seen or explored? Mr. Mo. Yes, I appreciate that question. When we travel around the country, we see things like registered apprenticeships. It's one of the models. Work-based training is another model that we really like. You know, again, when you take a skills-based approach, we need a fundamental shift in thinking about, not only individual basis but more of a creating a team with complementary skills. So some of the successful companies, they're trying to build teams with skills of advanced--people with advanced cyber skills and people with early--early entry career skills. Then you kind-of, like, map out and have a team that can do the job and deliver on the mission. Mr. Garbarino. So do you work with--you know, you said you were traveling across the country, you know, working with some of the registered apprenticeships. Has there been any work with community colleges or technical schools---- Mr. Mo. Yes. Mr. Garbarino . For talent? Mr. Mo. Absolutely. The very first visit that the National Cyber Director did was to the Community College of Baltimore County to, essentially, elevate cyber to make sure that people with 2-year college degrees understand that there's a pathway into cyber career. Then we also went to Fayetteville Technical Community College because they kind-of have a pathway for veterans and their spouses to get into cyber as well. The key here, though, is it's more than just one institution. This only works if the 2-year colleges are working with the 4-year colleges and universities and they are also working with the K-12 school districts locally and the private- sector employers are involved in telling the schools what they need, so that all of them come together to figure out how to build the pipeline. That's the approach we're pushing here. Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate that. I can ask you all questions for a while, but I only have a minute left. I do want to focus on harmonization. Mr. Mo, at a HSGAC hearing on regulatory harmonization earlier this month, your colleagues stressed how harmonization requires leadership from ONCD and Congress. Blog posts from Director Coker this month also called for Congress to work with the administration to help craft cyber regulatory standards. None of this acknowledges Congress has already done this by passing CIRCIA. I'm concerned that the White House is not pushing back enough against duplicative regulation at odds with Congressional intent, particularly as the SEC since introduced its cyber incident disclosure rule which only adds to compliance, leads to public disclosure of sensitive information, drives talents away. I have heard people say that their cyber teams have plenty of burnout and CISOs are leaving because they are now possibly facing personal liability. Why is ONC urging Congress to act on cyber harmonization when we already have done so? Mr. Mo. Thank you for that question, Congressman. Harmonization is definitely a big part of what ONCD is working on right now, but my remit in the office is implementing the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy. I'm happy to--happy to work with you and our legislative team to find you the right person to get the answer that you deserve. I will take that on the record and get back to you. Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate that. Just repetitiveness, back to the administration, no more cyber rules. Harmonization, please. I now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. At the outset, let me, in the Chairman's absence, express my condolences to his family. Let me welcome our witnesses to the hearing today. We have Rhode Island, Michigan, had Louisiana, and myself. If my accent doesn't give me away, I'm from Mississippi. As a top Democrat on the committee, one of the things that we've been interested in is not only diversifying the work force but also saying, if you leave the beltway, you can find a lot of talented people. We have a hundred-plus historically Black colleges in America, some of the finest kids that I know. But you got to recruit at their schools just like, you know, you do inside the beltway, so to speak. So I'd like each one of you to kind-of give me a snapshot of what your agencies are doing to build relationships, especially with smaller historically Black colleges across the country, and how the Office of National Cyber Director promotes outreach to smaller HBCUs. We'll start with Mr. Hysen. Mr. Hysen. Thank you, Ranking Member. I completely agree with you on the need to expand our outreach far outside the beltway. We have launched programs and built recruiting partnerships with organizations all across the country, including many HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. That has helped populate the ranks of the Intelligence and Cybersecurity Diversity Fellowship Program, our Cybersecurity Internship Program, and our entry-level cohorts in the Cyber Talent Management System with a wide range of individuals. I'll also add that we can't just focus on bringing talent from around the country into the District of Columbia. We have to meet talent where they are. Not everyone wants to work in the National Capital region. We have stood up offices in other areas, including one in Mississippi where we have our legacy data center. But as we have moved to the cloud, we have focused on expanding our cybersecurity hiring out of that center in Stennis, Mississippi. Have another one in Arizona as well and are looking to build on that effort. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Ms. Beavers. Ms. Beavers. Thank you, Ranking Member. Department of Defense has over 450 schools as part of our national cybersecurity academic excellence program. They are primarily State schools, and we have expanded that into including the 2-year nondegree programs--the 2-year degree programs, I should say, as well as a number of scholarships that we have been promoting to bring in nontraditional work force. We also have a pilot under way that is promising. It's a little early to report too much detail, but we started with about 50,000 nontraditional cyber potential employees. Got that curated down to about 6,000 that were qualified and interested. The most exciting part is this was from populations that had not been part of the DOD pipeline before. So there is work to be done, but we have been very aggressive in expanding our recruiting over the years and building out that academic cooperation, to include the recent stand-up of our Cyber Academic Engagement Office that I just signed last month per the NDAA from 2024. So we will be having more information on this in the future, and I can take for the record to bring back specific numbers if that is what you're looking for. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Petersen. Mr. Petersen. Yes, thank you for that question. So at NIST we have a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program, called SURF, and I'm pleased to report that one of those SURF students is with me today from Hampton University, an HBCU. It's one of many ways that we actively recruit and try to involve students from minority-serving institutions. We also have a program called Professional Research Experience Program, or PREP, and that is a grant program with several different institutions, including MSIs. I, again, currently have a couple students working with us from Morgan State University that are Ph.D. students. Then, finally, because of our commitment to diversity and inclusion and the very question that you asked, this fall in October as part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, our Cybersecurity Career Week will be doing an event targeted particularly at HBCUs to make sure those students are career- ready, and faculty and advisors are available to support them. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Mr. Mo. Mr. Mo. Real quick is that, for us, is that we're trying to remove barriers and broadening pathways, which means we have to meet people where they're at. So we've been to Norfolk University, which is an HBCU in Virginia, and then we invited about 10 to 12 HBCUs to learn about how to become and get designation for this NCAE program. On top of that, we are also leaning heavily with our ecosystem stakeholder partners. Those are the ones who engage with the 450 NCAE schools, the 104 SF--Scholarship for Service schools who would actually get the students be interested in cyber, and some of those commitments are about getting hands-on experience and learning to those students in those minority- serving institutions. Last week, National Cyber Director was just in Tulsa, and a few weeks before we were in Tucson at Piedmont Community College. Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to submit into the record a statement from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers on AI and work force. Mr. Garbarino. Without objection.  Statement of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) Wednesday, May 22, 2024 The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (or IFPTE) represents 90,000 professional employees in the private sector, and public sector, including NASA, the Boeing Company, Navy shipyards, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Social Security Administration, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Pacific Gas and Electric. We thank Chairman Green and Ranking Member Thompson for the opportunity to submit a statement for the record. Many of our members are STEM workers, some of whom work directly with Artificial Intelligence and data science, develop and deploy AI technologies, manage cybersecurity in their organizations, and utilize tools and work processes that involve AI. Many more of our members are professionals whose job is to design, engineer, research, maintain, and innovate. Our members working in Federal, State, and local government agencies provide essential public services, support critical infrastructure operations, and contribute to homeland security and national defense. Our Members are keenly interested in tools and technologies that improve their productivity and the work they do. Like many Americans, our members are also deeply concerned about the risks and uncertainty that evolutionary AI technologies will bring. AI has the potential to replace human discretion in decision making with algorithmic decision making in instances that introduce new and significant risks to national security and the rights of Americans. As AI technologies proliferate in the critical infrastructure and national security realm, law makers and policy makers need to prioritize the public interest and make sure that Americans' rights and national security are prioritized in the development of AI over the profit-making priorities of the private sector. Congress and the Executive branch should also ensure that the Federal procurement process for AI services and technologies does not result in the commodification of public data, the privatization of inherently Governmental duties and functions, or the loss of Federal oversight of contracted services. IFPTE strongly supports a worker-centered approach to AI research, development, and deployment. Where workers are represented by unions, employers should be engaging with those workers, through collective bargaining and through labor-management partnerships to make sure these technologies are solving problems, not creating new risks, inefficiencies, and vulnerabilities. Involving the front-line work force in decisions on designing and deploying technology, whether it's AI technology or other automated decision making that impacts how work is done, so we can ensure the solutions address actual problems, provide real remedies, and are implemented in a manner that accounts for risks, protects the public interest, and helps verify that technology and tools are working as intended. Workers can help determine the validity of data and whether the veracity of data is suitable for AI applications. For example, IFPTE members who operate locks and dams under the Army Corps of Engineers are urging caution as the Corps of Engineers begins to implement remote off-site operations of these critical infrastructures and reduce or eliminate on-site operators who are the eyes and ears on the inland waterways. Front-line Federal workers operating and maintaining locks and dams and the vessel operators using the inland waterways understand that removing on-site personnel and human decision makers creates numerous risks for the continuity of command over this national transportation asset. Remotely operating the navigational lock and dams would leave this national transportation asset vulnerable to cyber intrusions, physical security threats, breakdowns, or failures that would otherwise be addressed by trained on-site operators. Lack of on-site human operators could imperil the transportation of critical supply chains, including wheat and grain, energy products, and other major commodities, as well as material to support our armed forces. While modernization of these critical infrastructures can improve safety and reliability, these dynamic and unpredictable environments require communication, human judgment, and situational awareness and cannot be reduced to algorithmic models, remote sensors, and automated controls. When it comes to creating guardrails for innovative and breakthrough technologies, legislators and policy makers must not be guided by the notion that technology can replace workers. The risk of displacing or subordinating human discretion to analytic modeling in a crisis can lead to the loss of knowledge and understanding of critical systems and processes, flawed failure analysis and incorrect assumptions, and disastrous consequences for critical infrastructure. If implemented with transparency and accountability, with well-defined and enforced civil rights protections and safety standards, with good governance and the public interest in mind, and with worker engagement--AI has the potential to provide valuable tools for how Americans will work. America's AI policy needs a clear policy goal that puts worker engagement and bargaining over AI before implementation and ideally, before design. Workers can bring their intimate familiarity with work processes into the AI design process to reduce risks, catch problems upstream where they can be addressed, and produce better outcomes. Workers can also help pinpoint instances where human judgment and situational awareness should not be displaced by algorithmic models, and where AI-driven automated decision making might miss information, creating security risks or threatening civil rights. Our Nation's AI policy should commit to investing in training workers to understand how to responsibly use AI and make sure that workers and authorities responsible for providing oversight of AI are empowered to do so. Mr. Thompson. I yield back. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Strong, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Beavers, as you know, employers in defense industrial base prefer applicants with experience and a security clearance. The Cyber Force Incubator program at the University of Alabama in Huntsville recruits hundreds of students per year, nominates the students for security clearances, and places the students into internships on Redstone Arsenal and within the defense industrial base. Ms. Beavers, how does your office leverage university-based work force development programs like this one at UAH? Ms. Beavers. So we partner very closely with organizations to bring in students into our scholarship programs, as well as internships. Through our Cyber Academic Engagement Office, we will be expanding that partnership to make better use of the opportunities out there with education to bring our supply side even all the way back into the K-12 and grow the cyber talent starting earlier. So it has been a work in progress for a number of years for the Department of Defense to partner with various academic institutions. It is primarily through our academic engagement program--or excuse me--our scholarships and our National Centers for Academic Excellence. So we're looking forward to really building out our academic engagement, because we think of the--the defense industrial base is a great feeder for capabilities into the Department of Defense. We need a similar type of very robust feeder to bring talent into the Department of Defense from the cybersecurity perspective as well. Mr. Strong. I'd agree with you 100 percent. We actually have a State-wide cyber high school in Huntsville, Alabama, that's been very successful. Then if you go back just to the local schools there, having science and starting at the high schools and doing internships has proven very beneficial to our industrial base. Mr. Petersen, I understand that the National Institute of Standards and Technology's National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence has a requirement to develop guidance related to the cybersecurity and privacy of genomic data. Universities and other technical organizations, including my district, are meaningfully contributing to the NIST's program progress in establishing the standards and best practices for cyber protection and genomic data. With the increasing demand for cybersecurity work force across the Nation, would this effort be expanded to include the involvement of more students? Mr. Petersen. Thank you for that question. I should add that I'm also the interim chief of the Applied Cybersecurity Division, which includes that NCCoE facility. Mr. Strong. Great. Mr. Petersen. I know the director of the NCCoE as well; Cheri Pascoe's relatively new. Because of our partnership and relationship, we've certainly talked about more academic engagement with the center, both faculty and students as well. We have a pretty robust set of summer interns there this summer and plans to work throughout the year. MITRE is the FFRDC for the center. They, likewise, have a number of students. So we'd be happy to explore that with you as well, and have personally spent a lot of time in Huntsville recognizing the excellent work that's happening in that community. Mr. Strong. Thank you. My family recently moved there 8 generations ago and has never left. As you know, Huntsville is the tip of the spear. We want to be sure that we get the right folks working in the environment, and cybersecurity is a critical situation. We also have the cyber piece of the FBI currently under construction in Huntsville, where we'll be adding another 2,500 jobs that will do nothing but make Huntsville even stronger. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Louisiana, a Member of my--the Subcommittee on Cyber, Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  face significant shortages in trained personnel. Given this, it's clear that none of our protective systems, whether standards, technologies, or regulations, can be effective without well-trained work force. Isn't it imperative to address this critical gap? Can you tell us measures that you're taking, particularly with HBCUs across the country, junior colleges, and community colleges that have a plethora of individuals that may or may not be aware of the opportunities in cyber space? Mr. Hysen. Mr. Hysen. Thank you, Congressman. We are actively focused both on training and developing our existing work force, as well as building and strengthening partnerships with academic institutions, including HBCUs. We also know that it starts earlier than entering college, that we are, through CISA building partnerships, to support K- 12 curricula for cyber education across the country, and have trained thousands of educators this year to date there as well. As we are partnering with academic institutions, we've been focused on expanding our entry-level pathways, knowing that it is more important to bring in talent that is committed to growing and learning and then building out robust training programs through the IT academy that we are establishing at DHS to rotate entry-level talent throughout the Department, give them those experiences and new skills to help them become productive members of our work force. Mr. Carter. Thank you. If everyone could just hit it real quickly, we've got a little bit of time, but I'd like to just hear if you have something to add. That's fine if you don't. Mr. Mo. I'll go. So ONCD is working on increasing the number of HBCU to get the designation for a National Cyber Center of Excellence in Cybersecurity. So we're doing that in partnership with the White House Initiative on HBCUs. So what we're doing is we're trying to share some of the information with the HBCU administrators so that they know how to kind-of get that designation. Mr. Carter. Do we actively have recruiting job fairs on colleges campuses across the country to encourage young people? A hundred years ago when I was in undergraduate school, I remember there was always some type of job fair going on, whether it was the FBI or whatever. Different agencies would come in and meet with juniors and seniors to encourage them to potentially---- Mr. Mo. We absolutely do, and I will absolutely defer to my colleagues here on some of the examples of what we are doing. But the key here is that most people, when they see the word ``cyber,'' they just don't see themselves doing those jobs, right. So a---- Mr. Carter. But it's weird, because our children--I know my kids can put a computer together and take it apart and do all kinds of programming, but somehow that still has a little bit of fear associated with it. But we know that kids are super bright, particularly when it comes to technology. Mr. Mo. Which is why it's even more important to--you know, a hearing like today elevates the cyber career and jobs, right. So I think it's up to all of us to be able to go to each and every single individual, even talk to some of the parents about this type of opportunities for them. Mr. Carter. Ms. Beavers, how are candidates for State and local offices utilizing AI tools to enhance their campaigns despite concerns from experts and lawmakers about potential generative AI attacks on elections? Equally as important is, how are we combatting against the nefarious actors who are using AI to portray something that isn't real in the way of someone's likeness or voice? Ms. Beavers. Congressman, I'd like to defer to my distinguished colleague, Mr. Hysen. Mr. Carter. Certainly. Mr. Hysen. I'm happy to take that, sir. Mr. Carter. Yes, sir. Mr. Hysen. So, Congressman, I agree with your concerns on generative AI and elections. It's an area that CISA is working on actively with State and local election administrators. We need to better train our election administrators on how to reach out to their electorates. We are--we provide no-cost training to thousands of State and local election administrators across the country. Overall, generative AI today I look at as a problem of scale. There--video and voice impersonation was possible before generative AI. It is just easier and faster with the tools that are available. One of the areas that I think is particularly promising is looking at content authenticity and making sure that, as Government officials, as candidates, we can label the information we are putting out as authentic to make sure that it's more difficult to impersonate. Mr. Carter. Thank you. My time has expired. Thank you, sir. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pfluger, for 5 minutes. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the witnesses for being here and talking about this issue. I represent Angelo State University. It's a cyber center of excellence. They've taken steps, in partnership with NSA and other Government agencies, to start developing the work force in a way. Here's why this is important to me. When we think about the areas that provide that type of work force, I think one of the big areas that is really missing is rural America. That's why I'm passionate about what president Ronnie Hawkins is doing, former retired three-star general from the Air Force, led DOD in its effort to transform the cyber side of our warfighting domain. I'd like to hear, really from each of you, how can a school like Angelo State, a rural-serving institution with 12- to 14,000 students throughout the entirety of its programs, how can they be successful and what do they--what's the advice or what's the vector that they need to go and other institutions like them, to provide this work force for our country? We'll just start and go down the line. Mr. Hysen. Absolutely. Thank you, Congressman. I strongly agree on the importance of building relationships with rural communities and pathways into public service. Participating in the NSA Centers for Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity is a great start. We're a proud partner with the NSA on that program. I would also say, for any training institution right now, recognizing the pace of new developments in this field and ensuring that we are training our work force not on any one specific technology that may be out of date very quickly, but on how to stay current, how to leverage increased automated and AI-based systems, and how to really stay on top of new and emerging threats is the most important thing these organizations can be doing. Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. Ms. Beavers. Ms. Beavers. So the--I think leveraging the great work that's being done on the cyber work force frameworks that have been built that actually identify the qualifications and the skills, and then also exploring opportunities for outreach and fun events that the DOD sponsors, like hackathons and things like that, to really increase the--the student body's excitement about getting involved. So I think--and encouraging internships would be my recommendation. Mr. Pfluger. Which I know that they have focused on that. By the way, they're a minority-serving institution, mostly Hispanic population that comes from our area in West Texas, and they really are proud of that work, because they're sending good young men and women into the work force. Mr. Petersen. Mr. Petersen. Yes. So I'm a product of rural America, so I have a soft spot for what it means. I would just add to the discussion about community colleges, most community colleges are in rural areas or serving rural populations as well. In addition to the focus of this hearing on the demand, the 500,000 cybersecurity workers, there are a lot of other demographics that are working against us, like declining birth rates and, you know, the aging of Americans and then the like. So we've run a series of webinars this year really focusing on underserved and underrepresented populations, starting with rural America. Because there's lots of universities--we had the chancellor of the University of North Dakota system speaking about what they're doing across their vast State that is very rural, and a lot of Tribal organizations as well. But specifically to the point, I think there's also a statistic about people tend to stay where they go to college or where they grow up. So the pandemic has opened up opportunities for remote work and telework and more flexible opportunities where they may be able to stay in their rural community but work, you know, for a company or a Government organization across the country. So I think part of the challenge and opportunity is to open up also more of those remote opportunities that maybe previously didn't exist. Mr. Pfluger. That's a great point. Something that we're also working on, which is extending broadband and access to these communities, and there are several committees doing that. We'll leave you the last word. Mr. Mo. Well, I actually met Charlotte from Angelo State. She invited me to join the Mayor's Cup---- Mr. Pfluger. That's fantastic. Mr. Mo . In San Angelo. I would say I was one of the people who sent her congratulation in a email when the program got a CA designation. The key thing here is that we need to start elevating people's work. A lot of people are doing good work. I think the role of ONCD in the White House is to elevate some of this work so that we can plug them into the ecosystem that they need, right. It's not about just one institution. I don't want folks at Angelo State to think that they are the only one that has to do it all on their own. Want to plug them into the ecosystem, get private-sector employers involved, get the State and local government involved so we can all do this together. Mr. Pfluger. That's a great point. I hope that if you have not made contact with President Hawkins at Angelo State, that you will, because they are doing an amazing job. They're not the only ones, but they also have an Air Force base there, Goodfellow Air Force Base, that does intelligence, and a lot of that intelligence has to do with the issues that you're talking about. I know my time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Thanedar, for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Thanedar. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member, for this important hearing. Thank you for witnesses. Mr. Hysen, you mentioned about 2,000 or so cybersecurity positions being opened. How many independent contractors does the Department currently hire? Mr. Hysen. Congressman, I don't have an exact number, but it would be, certainly in our IT contractors number, in the many thousands. Mr. Thanedar. On an average, what is their compensation? Mr. Hysen. We compensate our contractors for services, not individuals. In some cases, though, individual IT and cybersecurity personnel can make more working on a contract, in some cases they are making more in Government. Mr. Thanedar. So any attempt made to recruit these independent contractors on a long-term employment basis in public service? Mr. Hysen. It's a great point and something we're actively focused on. We're leveraging the cyber talent management system to look at areas where we need more Federal technology expertise in our work force. We've done that with our network operations and security center where we have been rebalancing what was predominantly a very contract-heavy work force and are now adding in additional levels through these new hiring authorities of Federal personnel. It's something we're looking to expand. Mr. Thanedar. OK. Now, I understand United States has a shortage of cybersecurity experts. Is that the case with other countries, especially--what do we know about China? Are they hurting for cybersecurity experts like United States is? Mr. Hysen. I can't speak to that in particular. I will say, in my conversations with our allies and my peers in those countries, they have similar challenges. But we also, through DHS, are looking at expa---and committed to expanding pathways to high-skilled immigration so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest around the world to our country. Mr. Thanedar. Yes, I want to pick up on that high-skilled immigration a little bit, because looks like a lot of good programs have been initiated by--and certainly we must provide these trainings to, you know, candidates in the United States domestically, to train and develop these skills, encourage Americans to enter into these jobs. But while we do that, is there any interest in either special visa programs, immigration programs to encourage expertise that is available across the world? Mr. Hysen. Absolutely, Congressman. I'll give one particular example with artificial intelligence. In his Executive Order, President Biden directed the Department to take a number of steps to streamline our high-skilled immigration pathways to attract the best in AI and related fields. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has completed or is on track for all six of the taskings they were given in that Executive Order. That includes simplifying and streamlining our processes, as well as publishing standard information to make it easier for AI talent around the world to understand pathways into the United States. Mr. Thanedar. Currently, our immigration system is so--so broken, many skilled work force--and I have spoken with many CEOs of technology companies, and their frustration is that it takes forever through the country quotas and the long lines that getting the skilled work force to get the right visa, whether it is a H-1B visas or their green card, this process is taking years, if not decades, and that's hampering our ability to hire talent. What can be done to streamline some of this broken immigration system? Mr. Hysen. I completely agree. Fundamentally, we at the Department look forward to continuing to work with Congress where, ultimately, we need to see many of these reforms. We are doing everything we can to streamline processing within the bounds of current law. With H-1Bs, for example, this year for this H-1B cycle, we launched new technologies and a new on-line process that makes it easier and faster for companies and individuals to apply for those visas and for us to process them. So we're doing everything that we can within the confines of law. Mr. Thanedar. Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this very important meeting, and thank you all for being here today. My district is home to several community colleges and higher education institutions that are leading the charge and bringing students into the cyber work force. Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College hosts the Mississippi Cyber Initiative, which is a group of public and private organizations that support over 15 law enforcement agencies and Keesler Air Force Base cyber-related activities. I think we can learn a lot from these similar programs, and I know there's been some discussion about that today. Mr. Petersen, despite these programs and similar programs that you mention in your testimony, we're still facing a severe shortage of cyber workers. With the current programs in place, do you have any estimate how long it's going to take to fill 500,000? I know that's a big question. Any idea how long it's going to take for us to fill that gap? Mr. Petersen. So, unfortunately, I don't have the crystal ball to tell you how long. I think sometimes the answer is not how long or how many, but what are enterprises doing to managing their risk. That's something certainly NIST is very committed to, to giving cybersecurity and privacy risk management frameworks that allow organizations to take the combination of technology processes and people to minimize their risk. I think the numbers, in and of themselves, don't really indicate the activity that's happening at the organizations or how new and emerging technologies may help to fill that gap. So the estimate is really not in time but really in focus on what's going to minimize the risk of an enterprise. Mr. Ezell. Thank you. I'd kind-of like to focus a little more on our national security implications. Even though cybersecurity jobs are well- paid and offer high levels of job security, I think the lack of public awareness plays a role in our current work force shortage. Mr. Petersen, what can Congress and institutions like this one in my district do to enhance public awareness, encourage students to see cybersecurity as a vital role in defending our country? Mr. Petersen. Well, Congressman, I'm pleased to say I actually visited Gulfport Community College last year, and they were hosting an event, along with the Department of Commerce and the Department of Education, on raising the bar. What was impressive to me is how they brought together the stakeholders, not only locally, but across the State and across the region, to really focus on the opportunities that exist, not only at community colleges, but in local communities, to help individuals who are, quite frankly, below the poverty level, have a career and opportunity in cybersecurity. Some of the stories I shared at the beginning are just one of the many ways that individuals can come into a cybersecurity career thanks to the efforts of community colleges like the one in your district. Mr. Ezell. Yes. We've really worked hard to try to get that off the ground and keep people interested, you know. So, Ms. Beavers, with the current gap, I imagine that the Department of Defense, DOD, has to hire independent contractors. Do you have any idea how many independent contractors DOD has hired to alleviate the gap, and how much do they get paid? Ms. Beavers. Congressman, we have in the neighborhood of about 60,000 contractors within our cyber work force within the Department of Defense. Like my distinguished colleague mentioned, it's under a contract. Mr. Ezell. Right. Ms. Beavers. So I would have to get back to you for average income. Mr. Ezell. Sure. I understand that. But, you know, I know we could save some money if we could get regular folks hired, working full-time doing that and, you know, let's all try to do our part. I want to do everything I can to support you. You know, being my background in law enforcement is working in partnership with the community colleges, and the military is just very important to us. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Magaziner, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses. A robust cybersecurity work force is vitally important to our national security, our homeland security, and our economic security as well. Because, of course, in the private sector, billions and billions of dollars are stolen a year from average Americans because of cyber breaches to private companies as well as to Government agencies. Cyber is also an opportunity to provide good-paying jobs for young people in a very promising and growing field. Cybersecurity jobs pay well, they're available, there are job openings all across the country, and we have to train the work force to meet that need. Before I go any further, I just want to recognize my predecessor, former Congressman Jim Langevin, for his work on this committee, a long-time champion of cybersecurity, and continues to do that cybersecurity work now in the private sector, including in his leadership at the Rhode Island College Institute for Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies, which is a really exciting hub that we are building in Rhode Island under Jim's leadership, to do our part to meet these emerging work force needs. So for young people who are interested in cybersecurity, we have to promote pathways into careers, we have to provide educational opportunities at the K-12 level, at colleges and universities, and also alternative credentialing programs as well. We need to grow the pipeline of cyber workers for the Federal Government and the private sector as well. Let me start with Mr. Mo. Can you speak specifically to the K-12 arena and what we as a Congress can be doing and should be doing to better support school districts, particularly in underresourced communities who may be interested in creating pathways and curricula to get young people introduced to cybersecurity at an early age? Mr. Mo. I appreciate that question. Thank you so much. One of the things that we push for in the strategy is to make sure that we are teaching cyber concepts earlier in one's education. In middle school, when they're exploring career and whatnot, we want them to be able to know that cyber is a pathway. So there are a couple of programs I would just pay--you know, bring it up. It's CTE CyberNet. It's one way that we are teaching educators so that they can teach students about the cyber skills. We also have GenCyber camps that, you know, NSA and others have run. Then the other thing is because we--you know, K-12 education policy is generally run out of State governments, we have been partnering with private sector and various organizations to make sure that we're pushing some of those cyber education. There are commitments to gamified cyber, for example, to make sure that kids play some gamified games. There are also commitments to teach more cyber skills to girls and kids in K-12. So those are how we are going about it in terms of making sure that we're bringing some of the cyber stuff along in the K-12 arena. Mr. Magaziner. Terrific. Mr. Petersen, as has been discussed already, good jobs in cybersecurity don't necessarily require a 4-year degree, but they do require training. Can you speak specifically about the role of community colleges and what we could be doing to better support cybersecurity programs at those institutions? Mr. Petersen. Yes. Earlier a question was asked about what are we doing to support community colleges, and I'm really pleased and proud that the National Science Foundation has regularly invested in a national center, currently is the National Cybersecurity Training and Education program run out of Whatcom Community College. They're a national resource to community colleges. They convene them, they prepare them, they actually mentor them to become national centers of academic excellence as well. So we need to raise and elevate the importance of community colleges, not only because of their accessibility, but, quite frankly, they are very skills-focused. They're hands-on, they're performance-based. A lot of students can leave those programs either with a degree or a certificate or some type of credential and go directly into the work force. Many of them go on to a 4-year school. But the 2-year colleges play an absolutely essential role in helping address the work force shortage we're talking about today. Mr. Magaziner. Thank you. Finally, you know, we're the Homeland Security Committee, and the Department of Homeland Security has the need to attract cybersecurity talent as well. I'd just flag, I love, you know, the bipartisanship that's been exhibited in this hearing. I think we are all concerned about the need to attract and retain cyber talent. I will flag that in the Homeland Security appropriations bill that we are going to be considering on the floor later today, my colleagues across the aisle are proposing a $2 million cut to Mr. Hysen's office relative to last year and $6 million below the administration's recommended amount. So I'd just suggest that perhaps we revisit that. This is a time to be doubling down on these recruitment efforts. Mr. Hysen, if you can just talk about what you need in order to be able to recruit cyber talent to DHS. Mr. Hysen. Thank you, Congressman. The President's budget for fiscal year 2025 does include those investments in my office and across DHS. There is some specific funding we've requested there in artificial intelligence to help us build out our core capabilities to train our work force to be ready for AI and to leverage and bring AI expertise into the Department for cybersecurity and other purposes. Mr. Magaziner. So perhaps we can all work together to try to plus-up that funding as we go through the appropriations process. I'll yield back. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins, for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Petersen, according to your background, sir, you are our education specialist here. We are clearly facing a challenge in filling the roles that our Nation needs in cybersecurity and the cyber tech performance realm. The work force challenges across every industry are quite significant, including health care and manufacturing. I mean, we can't get enough welders. So it should be no surprise in a Nation that's--that is noted for its work ethic, if we can't get enough welders, we're probably going to have problems getting enough cyber workers. Are you familiar with the terms being called the disconnected youth or the disconnected generation? For the benefit of Americans tuning in, we're talking about an alarmingly large percentage of what's referred to as Gen Z that is neither working, nor in school. Traditionally, historically, that was the deal. As you became a young adult American, you went to work or you went to school; some cases did both. So if this is the generation that--that's the demographic that we would seek to fill cyber positions from, and if that generation of Americans is not interested in working or going to school, how are we going to pull them into training? Do you have some insight into that? Then I have a follow-up question for you, sir. Mr. Petersen. Thank you for the question. I am very familiar with that demographic, also known as opportunity youth. They're 18- to 25-year-olds who, as you said, either didn't complete their education or are currently unemployed. I think that is one of many populations that we consider underserved or underrepresented that we need to target and lift up. You know, this is not a problem that's solved just by, you know, getting rid of 4-year degrees. We need people with 2-year degrees, 4-year degrees. But we also need to address the needs of that population you described who need mentoring, they need opportunities. Registered apprenticeships, as we've already talked about, may be a great foot in the door for them to get some workplace experience and have a job opportunity. But that is a very much critical population, not only for cybersecurity, but for other skilled trades that we need across the country, to make sure we're helping support those individuals. Mr. Higgins. So with your background in education and your position with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, what would you recommend to Congress, sir, and to this committee, how could the Legislative branch use Article I authorities to--to work with our sovereign States and our educational institutions at every level, certificate and collegiate level, educational opportunities for this generation of Americans that we're going to have to rely upon to get engaged in the cyber work force? What would you recommend? Mr. Petersen. Yes. So I would start with think locally. You authorize NIST to give these grants called Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to stimulate cybersecurity education and work force development in your communities. We gave out 18 grants this past year. We're about to announce 15 more community grants. Mr. Higgins. Say that again, please, sir. You gave out what? Mr. Petersen. Eighteen grants this past fiscal year, and we're about to announce 15 more based on an appropriation from the Congress. But this really brings local communities together, local schools, local community colleges, universities, training organizations, nonprofits, economic development organizations, even individuals like yourself, to make sure you're addressing the needs of local employers in your locality or region. So a lot of what we're talking about is at the national level, which is great resources, but where the rubber really meets the road is in your districts and your communities. That grant program, much like the ecosystem work that's described in the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy, is about strengthening local ecosystems. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, sir, for your very insightful answer. I concur, Mr. Chairman. We have to work at the sovereign State and local level within the States to address the cyber work force challenge. Thank you, sir. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Ivey, for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me pick up where you just left off, Mr. Petersen. My district is Prince George's County, sort-of the inner part. I'm between D.C. and Steny Hoyer. It goes all the way up to--I call it the research triangle area, where you have the University of Maryland, we've got NASA at one corner, we've got the Agricultural Research Center, we've got NOAA there. Just a few miles up from that triangle area, there's NSA Fort Meade and FDA. Naval Academy also is huge on cyber. So, you know, the regional grants piece that you just mentioned, I was wondering if that's something that is available in my immediate area. If so, tell me about it. Mr. Petersen. Yes. So as I said, we recently funded 18. We're in the process of merit reviewing applications for 15 additional awards. This is money appropriated by Congress that may be available for additional grants in the future. So that is absolutely one opportunity that could be available to your constituents. Mr. Ivey. All right. This would be an application piece that's going to be coming in the near future? Mr. Petersen. Yes. A notice of funding opportunity that would be publicly announced. Mr. Ivey. What's the time line, roughly, for when the next 15 are going to be coming available? Mr. Petersen. Well, the current 15, the deadline occurred in May. So we're currently reviewing and will award those later this summer or late fall. Whether there's future awards is dependent on appropriations. Mr. Ivey. All right. Mr. Mo, I wanted to follow up with you. I think Mr. Magaziner asked you about teaching, what cyber skills are being taught. You mentioned that they are--you want to make sure that they're available. I'm looking at sort-of the--I was going to say K-12, but it's probably more realistically middle school and high school. What specific cyber skills are we talking about that public schools should be making available, say, at the high-school level? Mr. Mo. What we are pushing--thank you so much for the question. What we are pushing in the strategy is the idea of the foundational cyber skills. So it's not a skill on a particular technology. It's about a skill in which you know how to use technology. You can put your skills from one technology to another. It's about things like pattern recognition, understanding abstraction, as well as problem solving. The reason why we're pushing for those foundational skills in K-12 and middle school is because, once you have those skills, you can use those skills to learn other technical skills, right. So I've seen school districts that actually go the route of certifications, I've seen school districts that go the route of hands-on learning on some of those curriculum that we have on-line. But for us to be able to future-proof our work force and make sure that we build a dynamic work force, that can use any sort of technology in the future, we need to push foundational cyber skills. Mr. Ivey. All right. So those would be coming through--just to really try and narrow this down--math and science classes that are offered? Mr. Mo. Career--yes. Math, science, career technical education curriculum sometimes, depending on the pathways of the schools locally. So those are where those skills are generally taught. Mr. Ivey. OK. Are there particular programs that are available, maybe not in my district, but anywhere in the country where they actually are--they were put together with this in mind, to prepare students to be able to go into this line of work and develop these specific skills? Mr. Mo. Right now, a lot of those are done through like-- you know, CTE CyberNet has a way to kind-of teach some of those cyber skills, and they--by the time they get to the student, it's about, like, problem-solving with technology or something like that. Mr. Ivey. The CTE, is that available at the high school level, or is that the---- Mr. Mo. Middle school and high school level. Mr. Ivey. Middle school, OK. Then I did have a question about the contractors' piece. Because I think somebody said there are 60,000 contractors. Is that you, Ms. Beavers? Ms. Beavers. Yes, Congressman. Mr. Ivey. OK. So I'm looking at a document here--this is put out by the State of Maryland--that says that cybersecurity and information security jobs do not yet have a defined standard industrial classification number. I wanted to know if that is the case for the Federal Government or not. Ms. Beavers. So the Department of Defense has been on this journey for nearly 15 years now to actually categorize and classify---- Mr. Ivey. I've got 40 seconds. Ms. Beavers. So I will have to take that for the record. I think that our best estimate---- Mr. Ivey. OK. Let me tell you why I'm asking. In part, because I want to make sure that, from a contracting standpoint, we want diversity about students and the like who are--get a chance to obtain these skills. Also want to make sure there's diversity with the opportunity to get the contracts. So if you have the codes in place, that's one of the ways that the Government monitors and can track how the contracts are being made available and whether they're being done in a diverse way or not. So if you can get back to me, if you can give me a written response on that, and if you can give me a general sense too of--you're with DOD? What--she nodded, for the record. Ms. Beavers. Yes, Congressman. Mr. Ivey. Flashback to trial. If you can give me a sense too of what the Department of Defense is doing to make sure that it's doing--making outreach efforts to make sure that there are diverse opportunities for contractors and that there's a diverse field of contractors that are providing the work for the Federal Government. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. D'Esposito, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here this--I guess now this afternoon. I guess right now almost 85 percent of Federal cyber positions are telework-eligible. While I don't always agree with everyone working from home, obviously it's a reality that we are all dealing with. Obviously, it's something that has leverage. So, Mr. Hysen, how does DHS ensure that there are strong cybersecurity practices upheld for the remote work force? Mr. Hysen. Thank you, Congressman. It's been something that has been a new and evolving challenge since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have updated our annual required cybersecurity trainings for all employees to make sure that they are--that they are incorporating safe cybersecurity practices for telework and remote work. Among other things, that includes things like thinking about and being aware of smart devices that are in your work space that may be recording, as well as looking at the security of your home network. We will continue to do that. Mr. D'Esposito. Now I'm going to take it a little bit closer to home. Unfortunately, on Long Island, where both Mr. Garbarino and myself and Mr. LaLota and Mr. Suozzi represent, we have witnessed successful cyber attacks that have greatly disrupted not only local government but, obviously, the quality of life for the people that we serve. It's clear that both the public and the private sector are having issues with filling all of the cybersecurity roles that are currently open. So this is really for any of you. How do these work force issues extend to and impact, like I mentioned, local municipalities, and leave them open to an attack such as the one I referred to? Mr. Hysen. I can say I think we see that--those challenges every day through our work, largely through CISA, with State and local governments. It's one of the reasons why, when we developed our new State and local cybersecurity grant program, which launched 2 years ago, we made developing State and local cybersecurity work force a key element that we are looking for municipalities and State governments to apply for funding for. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. I was also excited to see the newly- released Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. There was funding that I requested for an updated IT system for the Nassau County Police Department to help them prevent from future cybersecurity attacks. Bolstering our systems is obviously one thing that, again, those local municipalities can do to guard against cyber attacks. What are some of the--and this is, again, for any of you. What are some of the short-term solutions for these localities that us as Congress can work toward to help our cyber work force? Mr. Mo. Thank you so much for that question. I think registered apprenticeship is one way to do it because it allows people with the potential to do the work to also learn on the job. One of the things that we want to make sure is that we have those quality pathways. Then we also have--we can then match folks who are interested to do the work where we need it to be. The other option, it's cyber clinics. We have funded 4 cyber clinics so far in the Federal--from the Federal Government. Cyber clinics, you know, as a clinic model, allows students who are in college today to also practice those skills and have those hands-on experience, while helping the public, in this case, private and local government as well. Mr. D'Esposito. The cyber clinics that you referenced, how do you do the outreach, or is that funding that's provided to an organization, or how does--how is the outreach to get individuals on to those clinics? Mr. Mo. Right now, it's done on a cyber-clinic-by-cyber- clinic basis. Mr. D'Esposito. OK. Mr. Mo. Then--you know, that's why--that's where we kind-of come in. We're trying to kind of make sure that everyone is coordinated and, you know, make sure that, as part of the cyber clinic, they reach out to their students---- Mr. D'Esposito. OK. Mr. Mo . To get more students, as well as each cyber clinic sort of have their own mission. For us, it's to kind-of influence the mission, make sure that they, you know, serve a particular constituency that we need them to be. Mr. D'Esposito. How has the attendance, so to speak, been to the first 4 clinics that you supported? Mr. Mo. We just started that funding. So, you know, I can take that back for the record and perhaps provide your office with that information. Mr. D'Esposito. That'd be great. With that, my time's expired. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I'm going to start a second round, because I can, of questions. Mr. Hysen, I want to follow up. My colleague from New York just asked you about this. You talked about the State and local grant program. Has that money--the first round of that money gone out yet to the States? Mr. Hysen. Chairman, my understanding is that it is the $185 million that we allocated in fiscal 2022, that that has started to go out. But it's a program that my office doesn't directly administer, so I would have to follow up for more details. Mr. Garbarino. Let's follow up, because I know--I believe the money has gone out to the States, but I don't know how much of the actual grants have gone to State--to the localities, the counties, the towns who really face the problem. They can't afford to have a CISO. My county in Suffolk County in Long Island got hit with a major cyber attack. If you can follow up and let us know where that money is, how far it is in going out to the actual people it's supposed to go to, that would be great--greatly appreciated. Mr. Hysen. Absolutely. Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. I also, Mr. Hysen, I want to focus on--your testimony highlights the strides DHS has made in hiring through Cybersecurity Talent Management System, or CTMS. The Department announced yesterday that the first 10 hires for its AI--its first 10 hires for the AI corps. In this committee's February hearing with Secretary Mayorkas, I sounded the alarm over CISA's lack of operational technology or OT staff. A GAO report in March found that CISA has only 4 employees and 5 contractors on hand to respond to attacks on OT infrastructure. I believe you have made some hires since then specifically for OT, but can you tell me what DHS is doing specifically to attract OT technical staff? Mr. Hysen. Absolutely. It's an area that CISA has been very significantly prioritizing. We developed, I believe, specific positions under CTMS to specifically reach out to talent with expertise in OT security and industrial control systems and related fields. I know we've had several rounds of solicitations, and I do believe we brought some staff on board. Mr. Garbarino. Now, you have CTMS, which was meant to streamline the hiring of cyber workers--through exemptions from--that many of the other Federal hiring go through. Can you tell me under the CTMS how many employees have been hired under CTMS and how many are still going through--still going through the traditional process? I have a number here that says, by 2023, CISA had only hired 80 people through CTMS, while still making majority of its 516 hires through the traditional process. What is DHS doing to make sure that CTMS is being utilized more so we can get people on-boarded? Mr. Hysen. Thank you. Yes. That number is for CISA's own hiring. We're at 189 across my office, CISA, and FEMA today. CTMS is not going to be the answer for every position. Traditional Title 5 hiring will still play an important role. That's why we're looking to streamline through leveraging direct hire authority from OPM and other sources of traditional hiring, but we are pushing to aggressively expand CTMS. We have--are working to bring it on board with additional components. We are also looking across the offices that are already using it to expand utilization for some of their existing hires. Mr. Garbarino. OK. This is for anybody who really wants to answer it. We've talked about moving away to--move away 4-year degrees, even some away from 2-year degrees, focusing on skills-based, maybe some certifications. Is there a role for the Federal Government to come up with--for coming up with a approved list of certification courses or programs or curriculum, so not just the Federal Government but States can use it, companies can use it, as a basis for, all right, these are the type of certifications, these are the type of skills that we want to see? Is that something that the Federal Government should be coming up with, that we should be coming up with, or is that really not the role for the Federal Government? Anybody just jump in. Mr. Mo, you want to go? Go ahead. Mr. Mo. Yes. I appreciate that question. What I would say is that technology is changing so fast. By the time--you know, if it go through some form of process, the skills that we'll be looking for, as well as the type and the curriculum, would have changed, right. So that's why one thing about skills-based, it's not about--sometimes it's not even about the specific skills, right--it is about the specific skills, which is what the framework is providing us. But the approach itself give us a new way of thinking about this. That is, we just want to make sure that folks have the basic skills to learn new additional skills. Mr. Garbarino. I know I don't want to be the be-all, because passing legislation or doing regulations takes forever, and this moves very quickly. But, you know, a lot of people don't know where to start. Not everybody has a CISO. I mean, is it worthwhile for us to come up with, you know, a base minimum standard? Maybe not legislatively but, you know, offer--have CISA come up with a minimum standard or minimum you should--these are the things you should be looking for, these are the certifications you should be having. Mr. Hysen, you can jump in. Mr. Hysen. Chairman, I believe that aligning to the NICE Framework is the right way to do that. As my colleague said, I think the specific certifications are changing so rapidly, but I do think saying that we need certifications or other demonstrations that candidates meet baseline skills with some flexibility to apply that in different ways would be most valuable. Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate it. My second 5 minutes is up. I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Thompson, for 5 minutes of questions. Mr. Thompson. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Kind-of in line with the Chairman's questions, historically, the Federal Government's long, cumbersome hiring process has undermined its ability to recruit cyber talent. Clearance processes and suitability assessments, in particular, created unacceptable delays between offers and on-boarding. Sometimes by the time you make the offer, that person's no longer available. So what are your agencies doing to expedite on-boarding of cyber talent? I guess as a second piece to it is, how is ONCD supporting these efforts? So, Mr. Mo, I'll kind-of see if you can backfield the answers. Mr. Hysen. I'm intimately familiar with those challenges, Ranking Member. It starts with administration-wide initiatives, like the Trusted Workforce 2.0 effort that is streamlining suitability and security clearance processes. Government-wide, we're seeing great results through the early stages of implementation. But we're also actively looking to streamline which positions actually need a clearance. If you're not going into a SCIF looking at Classified material, we shouldn't be holding up your hiring on that. So we have been looking to reduce requirements, expand the use of interim clearances at both the Secret and Top Secret level, which can be issued faster as well. Another key element of CTMS is that it keeps candidates in a ready talent pool so that when we have vacancies arise, we can reach out to candidates that have gone through the first stages of their assessment process already and then just start from there, which is significantly--can significantly reduce time to hire. Mr. Thompson. So, technically, it's not one size fit all? Mr. Hysen. Absolutely. Mr. Thompson. OK. Ms. Beavers. Ms. Beavers. The Department of Defense has a similar program, the Cyber Excepted Service, which has some direct hire authorities, which enables us to bring folks in quicker. We've also revised our hiring policies to eliminate the time and grade requirements and the previous grade requirements, so it's skills-based. But there are--there is additional work that could be done to help us expedite that with greater flexibility in salaries and things like that. So we are still continuing to work on reducing the time to hire, particularly within this valuable work force. Mr. Mo. So we have made a little bit of progress in terms of the security clearance times, right. So the average numbers for Top Secret went from 411 to 155 days, and for Secret went from 173 to 53 days. PAC has set a very aggressive target that they're executing on for Top Secret to be 45 days and Secret to be 25 days. But if you take a step back in terms of like the whole hiring process, you know, there's a clearance, but there's also like how we can move faster to get an inner agency. One of the things that ONCD is coordinating with our partner at Office of Personnel Management and OMB is the idea of a pool hiring process so that we have like one certificate that multiple agencies can jump on. So we have found that that has sort-of-like reduced the time for folks to be on-boarded in terms of--there are others such as like Tech to Gov hiring event that we do. We have--we have at least 2 of those events already with about 1,700 people being interested in jobs, and we have offered 150 tentative job offers. So we're doing, you know--like a lot of things in Federal hiring, there's a lot of like--there's no one single solution, there's no silver bullet. We're keeping to--we are fixing a lot of these similar processes along the way. Another effort that ONCD is driving is to make sure that we have job descriptions that are more focused on skills that are sort-of-like usable by, you know, multiple different agencies. Obviously, this is done in conjunction through the working groups that we have and which all the partners here are a part of, so that that is something that will, you know, slim down on the hiring process from job posting to candidates on-boarding. Mr. Thompson. You know, one of the challenges that I find as a Member, and very rarely do I not come in contact with somebody who is looking for a job, but they say, I go to these fairs, they give me the brochures, but there's nothing between the job fair and the brochures that hold me. I think somewhere, if we can give people hope that this jobs fair is not just a check-the-box kind of deal, we might get some good people. But the confidence that it's not more than a check-the-box event for that staffer to meet whatever their numbers are--help me out--how do--are we changing that perception? Mr. Hysen. Ranking Member, I think it's a shift from strictly thinking about hiring to thinking about talent and recruiting. There's a key difference in applying for a Government job versus a private-sector job where, if you apply for a Government job, you get automated emails from USAJOBS when you hit different stages. In many private-sector roles, particularly in cybersecurity, you have a recruiter who is actively talking to you and working with you through that process, which can still in some cases be longer. That's why there's been some efforts from OMB to build out Federal talent teams that go beyond just H.R. specialists in hiring and build those relationships with candidates throughout the hiring process. I do think that's something we need to expand. Ms. Beavers. I would like to highlight that the Department of Defense is also pursuing that type of a hiring pipeline development. So we are maturing the Cyber Excepted Service to be more aligned with the civilian hiring practices. Hence, the pilot that I mentioned earlier. Mr. Mo. I just think that we have to meet people where they're at. A lot of times, you know, some of the success stories that we've heard is because the professors told the students that, yep, the process takes longer, but once you kind-of get the job and get the clearance as you're an intern, that's how we kind-of pull some of the people in. So a lot of times it's about educating our stakeholders and partners on the ground that this is real, right. Then there's some accountability that some relationship and partnerships are being formed, and that's what ONCD is trying to do when we kind-of go around the country to talk to those folks. We're trying to establish those real relationships that will make sure that they will tell their students that these are real opportunities and with some more explanation that they know what to expect. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. In closing, I just want to say thank you to all the witnesses for coming today. This--sorry about votes screwing up, and I wish we had some more participation. I do know that this committee takes this issue very seriously. I know the Chairman takes this issue very seriously, as I said in his opening--when I read his opening statement. He will be submitting legislation soon to help address the shortfall both on the--specifically in the Federal agencies. We definitely take this issue very seriously, and I thank you all. Be ready to expect some questions for the record to be submitted. I know I have some that--I could have gone another 4 or 5 times, and I'm sure my colleagues could have as well. But I do really want to thank you all for being here today and for your patience during votes. So the Members of this committee, like I said, may have some additional questions for witnesses, and we would ask witnesses to respond to these in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will be held open for 7 days. Without objection, this committee stands adjourned.  A P P E N D I X I ---------- Questions From Chairman Mark E. Green, MD for Eric Hysen Question 1. How can the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) leverage its existing relationships across the public and private sectors to better coordinate U.S. cyber work force efforts? Answer. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) works to enhance coordination by fostering partnerships, promoting diversity, and learning from successful models. Simply put, CISA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) understand that collaboration with the private sector is at the heart of our cybersecurity mission. In regard to work force efforts, CISA's Cyber Innovation Fellows Initiative allows some of the Nation's most skilled and experienced practitioners and experts to bring their perspectives to CISA on a short-term basis to advance our national mission to reduce cyber risk at scale. The initiative seeks to innovate the agency's approach to cybersecurity while also providing awareness of CISA's mission to enhance participants' skills and knowledge. As of September 2023, CISA on-boarded all 6 individuals selected for the initiative. DHS also believes it is essential to focus on outreach efforts to underrepresented groups, including women, people of color, and rural populations. By actively engaging with these communities, CISA plays a key role in translating that belief into reality by attracting diverse talent to the cybersecurity field. Question 2. What aspect of the cyber talent pipeline--training at specific skill levels, upskilling, or reskilling--is CISA best-suited to help, based on its existing expertise? Answer. CISA is best-suited to upskilling individuals within the cyber talent pipeline. Leveraging its existing expertise, CISA can enhance the skills of current professionals by providing targeted training and specialized knowledge. This approach helps bridge the gap between existing capabilities and the evolving demands of the cybersecurity field. The most prominent example of this approach in action among existing Federal employees is the Federal Cyber Defense Skilling Academy. The Academy provides full-time Federal employees an opportunity to focus on professional growth through an intense, full- time, 3-month accelerated training program. This includes a variety of pathways tied to various cyber work roles, including pathways for employees interested in becoming cyber defense analysts, cyber defense forensic analysts, cyber defense incident responders, and vulnerability assessment analysts. Question 3. How has the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) benefited from the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program, and how can the program be improved to better meet the Department's work force needs? Answer. The CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) program recruits and trains IT professionals, industrial control system security experts, and security managers. These graduates contribute directly to DHS's mission of safeguarding critical information infrastructure. DHS is proud to be among the top 10 agencies that hire CyberCorps SFS students. In fiscal year 2023, DHS hired 67 total SFS participants. SFS provides scholarships covering up to 3 years of support for cybersecurity undergraduate and graduate (MS or PhD) education. The scholarships are funded through grants awarded by the National Science Foundation. Recipients receive tuition and fees, an annual stipend, and other financial incentives. Students engage in well-established cybersecurity programs, hands-on experiences, cyber competitions, and opportunities for professional development. Regarding improvements, DHS will continue to work with CyberCorps SFS to: Tailor SFS programs to specific DHS needs to better align graduates with agency requirements; Strengthen outreach efforts to underrepresented groups to diversify the talent pool and address work force gaps; and Enhance job placement assistance to help SFS graduates continue to find relevant positions within DHS. Question 4. How does DHS coordinate with other Federal agencies to fill its cyber work force gaps, if at all? Do you think that DHS would benefit from closer collaboration with other agencies? Answer. The DHS Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer actively collaborates with other agencies to address its cyber work force gaps and acknowledges closer collaboration would likely benefit efforts to strengthen the Nation's cybersecurity work force. Current efforts include participation in the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy, published by the White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). This strategy encourages coordination at the White House level to meet cyber work force demands, focusing on skills-based hiring, talent development, and the creation of cyber work force and education ecosystems. DHS also plays a key role in the Interagency Federal Cyber Career Pathway Working Group, established by the Department of Defense, DHS/CISA, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This group collaborates to advance cyber work force development. Some other examples of interagency working groups that DHS collaborates with include the ONCD and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Federal Cyber Workforce Working Group, and along with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), DHS participated in the Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint to expand pathways into the cyber work force. More broadly, DHS supports the Workforce Priority and Cybersecurity work of the President's Management Agenda. Question 5. Given the cyber work force gap continues to grow every year, and threat actors continue to evolve, do you think that we need to change who we consider to be in the ``cyber work force''? Please explain. Answer. Yes. As mentioned in my testimony, I am an advocate for an expansive view of cybersecurity talent. Cybersecurity is a vital part of every stage of the software and IT development life cycle. We must ensure all employees involved in this process are equipped to understand how their roles contribute to cybersecurity, from designers and program managers through network operators and help desk technicians. While cybersecurity-focused programs are critical, complementary efforts such as the DHS AI Corps, that bake cybersecurity into enabling an adjacent talent, also have a role to play. The cyber work force encompasses a wide range of Information Technology (IT), Cybersecurity, Cyber Effects, Intelligence, and support/enabler work roles as codified by my colleagues in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in the DoD Cyber Workforce Framework (DCWF). DHS and DOD will continue to evolve to address operational, technological, and work force driven requirements for digital talent. Question 6a. DHS is currently sprinting to hire 50 new employees in its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Corps. What skills is DHS looking for, and how is it assessing candidates? Answer. DHS is looking for AI professionals who can leverage recent technological advancements to harness the benefits of AI and significantly expand its responsible use to improve delivery of services and operational effectiveness at DHS. These AI professionals will have experience in: applying advanced technical or policy knowledge in AI/Machine Learning (ML); delivering or integrating technology or products using AI/ML; making decisions or providing recommendations, and securing leadership buy in and/or stakeholder consensus, to influence policies, projects, or programs; defining effective objectives and product goals and formulating/tracking measures of success; developing and refining digital interfaces and services using user-centered design principles to enhance the experience and accessibility; and leading cross-functional teams. DHS is expediting the hiring for AI-related positions using Government-wide direct hire authority, as authorized by OPM with additional support from the AI and Tech Talent Taskforce to address critical needs and increase AI capabilities in the Federal Government. Evaluation methods include multi-hurdle assessments including reviewing, relevant experience, technical skills, and interviews. DHS assesses candidates based on their technical knowledge and practical experience as DHS is in support of skills-based-hiring and approaches as led by OPM with support from OMB and ONCD. Interviews, technical discussions, and scenario-based assessments help evaluate suitability for the AI Corps. Question 6b. Is the AI Corps a scalable model, and can we replicate it for cybersecurity? Why or why not? Answer. The AI Corps leverages best practices from successful hiring processes like those I helped build at the U.S. Digital Service that is also an example of scaling what works across Government. We are eager to share these practices with other agencies. As such, it can be replicated for cybersecurity. However, successful replication to cybersecurity--or any domain--depends on adapting the model to specific needs while considering the unique challenges and skill requirements in the cybersecurity domain. The current process requires a significant amount of administrative effort covering hiring, preparation, recruitment, and on-boarding all led by agency leadership, hiring managers, H.R. specialists and agency talent teams. Any successful replication and scaling will require more efficient processes, supported by Government-wide implementation of the Hiring Experience Joint M-Memo M-24-16 recently released by OMB and OPM. This guidance summarizes flexible hiring authorities and expanded recruiting opportunities that enable the use and integration of industry standard applicant tracking and assessment tools. Such recruiting and tool modernization is dependent on availability of funding. Finally, increased cross-agency collaboration across talent teams, specifically with Government subject-matter experts, is essential to both the current model and any replica. Question 7a. How can AI improve our ability to recruit, train, and equip cyber talent? Answer. AI can enhance recruitment, training, and equipping of cyber talent by identifying potential candidates through analysis of large datasets, automating initial screening processes to save time for human recruiters, and providing AI-driven simulations and training platforms. These platforms allow cyber professionals to practice real- world scenarios and improve their skills within virtual environments that simulate cyber threats, enabling hands-on learning and skill development. Additionally, use of AI to automate completion of mundane and repetitive tasks provides measurable amounts of time back to DHS personnel, further improving our ability to recruit, train, and equip cyber talent. Essentially, AI can make our personnel more effective and efficient to further improve our staffing goals. However, as we seek to leverage AI in these processes, we must be mindful of potential bias in AI systems and ensure AI use does not lead to disparate impacts across any factor. Any serious consideration in using AI tools for personnel policy should follow the governance guidance set forth by AI M-Memo M- 24-10: Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of AI. Question 7b. How can AI improve our ability to detect critical infrastructure vulnerabilities? Answer. AI algorithms can analyze network traffic, system logs, and other data sources to detect anomalies and potential vulnerabilities. ML models can learn from historical attack patterns and identify suspicious behavior. Predictive analytics can help prioritize vulnerabilities based on potential impacts, allowing organizations to allocate resources effectively. Question 7c. Are there common skills across cyber and emerging technology fields, such as AI, that can help fill work force gaps across disciplines, and ensure U.S. workers remain nimble to work force needs? Answer. Skills such as data analysis, programming, and understanding complex systems are valuable across various technology domains, including AI and cybersecurity. Cross-disciplinary training programs can help bridge gaps and create a more versatile work force. Encouraging continuous learning and adaptability ensures employees remain agile in response to evolving work force needs. Question 8. What are some of the cyber threats DHS has observed at our physical border? Answer. DHS employs a wide range of software systems and operational technology involved in border security and faces numerous cyber threats that pose significant risks to operations and data integrity. Data breaches and unauthorized access are critical concerns, as malicious actors aim to infiltrate databases containing sensitive information related to border operations, immigration, and travelers. Unauthorized access could lead to compromise of personal details, surveillance footage, and operational plans. Our border infrastructure relies heavily on technology, including surveillance cameras, sensors, and communications networks, which if vulnerable could be exploited to compromise operations. Additionally, our adversaries have attempted to jam U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) detection technologies. Additionally, disruptions to communications equipment deployed at remote sites, and communications capabilities of CBP sensors deployed in austere environments, remains a cyber threat. Risk of cyber attacks at our physical detection sites is very real and remains a concern when managing the integrity and survivability of domain awareness capabilities along our physical borders. The complexity of supply chains for procuring technology and equipment for border security exacerbates these risks, as adversaries may compromise hardware or software components during manufacturing or distribution, and in doing so compromise security. Sophisticated threat actors, including nation-states, may target border security infrastructure for espionage, disruption, or cyber-espionage activities. In response to this threat, Executive Order 14116, issued on February 21, 2024, addresses cybersecurity risks to our port infrastructure. This underscores the importance of monitoring and addressing diverse threats across all areas of border security infrastructure: To ensure effective border security at land, air, and seaports, DHS must continuously monitor and address these evolving threats, in consultation with appropriate interagency partners, implement robust cybersecurity measures, and maintain vigilance against both external and internal threats. Question 9. How has DHS leveraged the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity? Answer. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework provides standardized language to describe cybersecurity work and workers, ensuring consistent communication across organizations, regardless of where or for whom the work is performed. The Department adheres to OPM guidance, systematically assigning NIST NICE Framework Cyber Work Roles to all IT, cyber, and cyber-related positions. This approach facilitates comprehensive tracking and categorization of the entire cyber work force, including both filled and vacant positions, thereby enhancing organizational oversight and strategic planning. Furthermore, the Department's Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS) relied upon the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework to develop its technical capabilities library. Each of the 17 technical capabilities is mapped to the NICE Work Roles, and every individual assignment (i.e., billet) is aligned with those roles to identify specific cybersecurity needs across the Department. The CTMS Technical Capabilities Learning Menus are also aligned to the NICE Framework Work Roles. The NICE Framework is valuable for training and education. DHS works closely with the NICE Interagency Coordinating Council. DHS aligns its training programs with the framework to ensure they address necessary skills and competencies. This framework serves as a reference source for work force development, planning, and education. By leveraging this framework, DHS ensures a more effective and coordinated approach to cybersecurity education and work force development. Question 10. How is DHS thinking about recruiting cyber workers under the age of 30? More broadly, what incentives or opportunities do you think would attract younger professionals to join the Federal work force? Answer. DHS actively addresses historical challenges in recruiting and retaining cybersecurity talent by offering competitive compensation, leveraging CTMS, and creating targeted programs. By addressing these challenges, DHS is better-positioned to attract younger professionals to join the Federal work force and contribute to national security efforts. Through CTMS, DHS implemented several strategies for recruiting young talent. CTMS uses innovative marketing and branding capabilities to promote and amplify DHS careers within the new DHS Cybersecurity Service, resulting in a continued increase in visitors to our unique application portal and apply clicks. CTMS is designed to effectively recruit, develop, and retain top-tier cybersecurity professionals. CTMS screens applicants based on technical capabilities and streamlines the hiring process for hiring managers by establishing talent pools. Applicants in the talent pool completed hurdled assessments and are added to relevant match lists. This saves applicants from having to apply multiple times. Talent Pools also enable CTMS to more closely compete with industry time-to-hire for highly sought-after talent, which is often a key consideration in recruiting younger talent. CTMS has statutory and regulatory flexibilities to offer market-sensitive salaries and advanced compensation for DHS Cybersecurity Service employees based on expertise and mission contributions. On-going professional development and training are specifically budgeted for each Cybersecurity Service employee and are critical factors of their performance expectations and their ability to advance the DHS mission. CTMS offers flexible, capability-focused career paths which incentivize career longevity and reduce costs associated with on- going attrition and recruitment. By offering salaries commensurate with the private sector and opportunities to continue developing cybersecurity knowledge and skills, DHS is better-suited to recruit and retain young professional cyber talent. I believe we also succeed in recruiting younger professionals into the Federal cybersecurity work force through a more expansive view of cybersecurity hiring. For example, Secretary Mayorkas established the Secretary's Honors Program to recruit talented recent graduates, providing opportunities for young professionals to contribute to critical missions within DHS. Along with the Intelligence & Cybersecurity Fellowship Program championed by this committee and my office's Cybersecurity Internship Program, the Department casts a wide net in targeting this specific demographic. Most recently, we also have sought services from fellows through the General Services Administration's U.S. Digital Corps Program. This program serves as one of the premier programs to attract early career technology talent, including talent with skills relevant to a variety of cybersecurity disciplines, into the Federal Government. Question 11. As nation-state actors increasingly target our critical infrastructure, do you believe the current DHS work force has the right skillset and training to fulfill its Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA) responsibilities? Why or why not? Answer. It is necessary for our work force to possess essential skills and training to fulfill our Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA) responsibilities, and DHS will continue to ensure our personnel are appropriately trained. Each SRMA is tasked with coordinating and collaborating with relevant Federal departments, agencies, critical infrastructure owners, operators, and other stakeholders. Their sector- specific expertise is crucial for implementing National Security Memorandum 22 and managing activities pertinent to their sectors. SRMAs provide sector-specific expertise to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within their sectors. Their on-going training and skill development are essential for effective incident mitigation. SRMAs support the Secretary of Homeland Security by providing annual sector- specific critical infrastructure information, ensuring transparency and accountability in safeguarding critical assets. Overall, the continuous development and alignment of SRMA skills are crucial for adapting to evolving risks and challenges in cybersecurity. Question 12. What changes or improvements can we make to the training of our cyber work force to ensure that they instinctively prioritize security in their product development? Answer. As mentioned in my testimony, I agree with the intent of this question and believe the answer is to take an expansive view of cybersecurity talent. Cybersecurity is a vital part of every stage of the software and technology development life cycle. Cybersecurity programs are critical, and I believe complementary efforts focused on emerging technologies need to bake cybersecurity into their recruiting efforts because the skills are adjacent. It is also true that non-adjacent employees in DHS must now build basic technical awareness skills in security technology and cybersecurity. As mentioned in my testimony, we are redesigning our annual Cybersecurity Awareness Training and we launch regular phishing exercises to keep all employees sharp on their personal contributions to the Department's cybersecurity. The message to our cybersecurity work force and our overall work force is that cybersecurity is the responsibility of all DHS employees. In turn, this message ensures cybersecurity will become part of all programmatic development long before front-line employees reach out to my cybersecurity personnel for assistance or approvals. Similarly, my Defense partners are working to ensure a trained and capable cyber work force through the use of the DCWF. These work roles identify core knowledge, skills, abilities, and tasks that specify cybersecurity requirements regardless of the type of cyber or cyber- related work performed. Like DOD, every DHS employee has a responsibility to identify and report potential cyber risks. Questions From Chairman Mark E. Green, MD for Leslie Beavers Question 1a.

Green, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, H2- 176 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515. The Honorable Bennie G. Thompson, Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, H2-117 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515. Dear Chairman Green and Ranking Member Thompson: In light of the subcommittee's June 26, 2024, hearing, Finding 500,000: Addressing America's Cyber Workforce Gap, attached please find Western Governors' Association (WGA) Policy Resolution 2022-05, Cybersecurity. The resolution recommends supporting civilian cybersecurity reserves to bolster the National Guard and enhancing education programs like CyberCorps, the National Institute of Standards and Technology's National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, and the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity to address work force shortages. I request that you include this document in the permanent record of the hearing, as it articulates Western Governors' collective and bipartisan policy positions and recommendations on this important issue. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information. ______ Policy Resolution 2022-05 cybersecurity a. background 1. In the age of automation, digitization, big data, artificial intelligence, and machine-to-machine learning, the United States' capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks are of ever-growing importance to our society. The cybersecurity of our Nation is an all-of-Government and industry-wide endeavor. 2. Aging information technology (IT) infrastructure and systems pose serious cybersecurity risks and increase vulnerabilities for Government and organizations. Due to the long-standing financial and national security implications of prior cybersecurity breaches resulting in data theft and other adverse outcomes, modernizing these systems to help prevent successful cyber attacks and better safeguard our data is imperative. 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed society and accelerated the shift to a virtual environment, further increasing vulnerabilities across systems as threat actors become more complex and wide-spread. Ransomware attacks, a type of malicious software attack that threatens to publish sensitive information or impedes access to data or computer systems until the victim pays a ransom to the attacker, have grown by 148 percent due to the rise in remote activities. These attacks can shut down public and private-sector operations, posing particular challenges to critical infrastructure functions. 4. Cybersecurity is especially imperative for critical infrastructure, which includes the Nation's electric grid, energy resource supply and delivery chains, finance, communications, election systems, the chemical industry, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing, defense industrial base, emergency services, food and agriculture, Government facilities, health care and public health, information technology, transportation, and water and wastewater systems. Large-scale cyber incidents, including the SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline attacks, demonstrate the risk cyber crime now presents to national security. 5. Addressing cybersecurity needs across critical infrastructure sectors is further complicated by the increasing interdependency and interconnectedness of our Nation's data systems to a myriad of non-critical infrastructure systems and a dynamic threat environment. Effective cybersecurity programs require strategic and functional relationships and information sharing between Federal, State, and local levels of government, and the public and private sectors. 6. The cybersecurity of their States and the Nation is a high priority of Western Governors. State governments are responsible for securing public networks, the State's digital assets, and citizen data, as well as coordinating their cybersecurity efforts with Federal agencies and potentially affected private entities (e.g., utilities, financial institutions, transportation, and health). Governors lead efforts to plan and implement State cybersecurity programs, respond to cyber attacks, and investigate intrusions. 7. National Guard cyber protection teams, serving in 59 cyber units, provide invaluable assistance to States across the country with threat assessment and cyber incident response and remediation. Currently, States can mobilize Guard members through State Active Duty (SAD) and Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Supported by State funds, Governors can activate SAD for disasters or homeland defense, although State constitutions or statutes often constrain deployment of the Guard to State emergencies. Title 32 gives Governors the authority to order the Guard to duty, using Federal funds, with the approval of the President or the Secretary of Defense. However, this process can create barriers to rapid and nimble action in the face of cyber attacks. While both of these functions are vital resources, potential exists to further leverage the capabilities of the National Guard for the cybersecurity posture of States. 8. Although State and local governments remain significant targets for cyber attacks, they often lack adequate funding to address these issues and modernize their systems. According to a study by Deloitte and the National Association of State Chief Information Officers, State cybersecurity budgets comprise less than 3 percent of their overall IT budgets. 9. Prior to the passage of Public Law 117-58, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Homeland Security Grant Program was the primary Federal mechanism to provide cybersecurity funding to State, local, territorial, and Tribal governments. Over the years, less than 4 percent of that funding was allocated to cybersecurity. Such low levels of funding have been insufficient for States to meet their pressing, and rapidly growing, cybersecurity needs. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act sought to address this issue by establishing a much-needed stand-alone cybersecurity grant program for State and local governments, marking a huge increase in Federal support for State and local cybersecurity efforts. 10. The $1 billion program will be administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for 4 years, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) serving in an advisory role. Funding will be distributed to States, Tribes, and territories, who must allocate about 80 percent to their localities. States must also meet varying match requirements to share the financial burden and account for cybersecurity costs in their budgets. 11. State election systems remain targets of foreign interference. As Governors, we remain committed to protecting our States' election systems. There is nothing more fundamental to the enduring success of our American democracy, and we take seriously our responsibility to protect the integrity and security of our elections. This is an imminent national security threat that transcends party lines. This is a matter of protecting and preserving fair elections--the underpinning of our democracy. 12. The Office of Management and Budget and Department of Homeland Security May 2018 Federal Cybersecurity Risk Determination Report and Action Plan concluded that 71 of 96 Federal agencies are at risk or high risk of cyber intrusions. It also determined that Federal agencies are not equipped to determine how threat actors seek to gain access to their information. This deficiency results in ineffective allocations of the agencies' limited cyber resources. 13. Currently, there is a severe deficit of cyber workers, especially in Government. Our Nation cannot defend itself without a well-trained, experienced cyber work force. The public sector must dedicate resources to ``K through gray'' cybersecurity education, training, work-based learning and apprenticeships, and recruitment programs and encourage the private sector to do the same through effective policy. 14. While investments in work force development and human capital are a key component in addressing work force shortages, States can leverage other tools to meet the scale of these challenges. Technology and innovation will be needed to alleviate work force strains and keep pace with a wide range of attacks while also reducing burdens associated with operational functions. b. governors' policy statement 1. Western Governors urge Congress to improve coordination of Congressional oversight and legislative activity on cybersecurity, including by reducing the number of committees in Congress that have jurisdiction over this issue. 2. Western Governors support modernizing our systems to be more resilient to minimize vulnerabilities and protect against unauthorized access to information and data theft. We request that FEMA and CISA work collaboratively with Governors in executing the newly-created State and local cybersecurity grant program to ensure the funds are administered in a flexible and measurable manner to all States, Tribes, and territories. Designated, flexible, and measurable cybersecurity funding would help ensure that States, Tribes, and territories have resources to build resilient systems and meet growing cybersecurity challenges. 3. The Federal Government has a responsibility to provide adequate funding for States to meet election security needs. Western Governors encourage Congress and the administration to work cooperatively with States in developing election security legislation and mandates, and to fully fund implementation. 4. Federal agencies must engage in early, meaningful, substantive, and on-going consultation with Governors or their designees on all aspects of cybersecurity. Western Governors advise the Federal Government to clearly define the roles for State representatives in CISA's recently-established Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative. 5. Western Governors recommend that the Federal Government continue the DHS State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Engagement Program, which provides cybersecurity risk briefings and resources to Governors and other officials. The Governors also support CISA Central, with which State chief information officers regularly interact. 6. The Federal Government must continue to clarify the roles and responsibilities of Federal agencies in preventing, preparing for, and responding to cyber attacks. Centralized authority, points of contact, and formalized communication pathways are necessary to address increasingly complex threats. In addition, these pathways must occur at each level within government and other organizations. 7. The Federal Government must also improve agency coordination to use often-constrained security resources more efficiently and harmonize disparate regulations that put an unnecessary burden on State governments. Western Governors urge Congress to provide appropriations for the Office of the National Cyber Director commensurate with the importance of the office's position in leading Federal coordination efforts. 8. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and other standards can facilitate effective, consistent, and risk-based decision making in Government and industry. Real-world simulations of attacks on critical infrastructure are essential to prepare our Nation for potential threats. 9. The Federal Government should build a stronger international framework for cyber crime and use the full range of economic tools, including travel and financial sanctions, to deter cyber attacks organized, supported, or harbored by nation-states. 10. Western Governors recognize the need for States, Tribes, and territories to work together to address gaps or vulnerabilities in these systems to reduce disruptions. The public sector, particularly the Federal Government, must take steps to mitigate global supply chain and national critical infrastructure risks (e.g. ransomware) in collaboration with the private sector. 11. Western Governors implore Congress and the administration to reduce bureaucratic burdens and change restrictive guidance related to deploying the National Guard under USC Title 32 for cybersecurity prevention, detection, and response activities. Clarifying the use of the National Guard for these purposes and streamlining the approval process would improve State capacity to confront cyber attacks, contain threats, and help protect neighboring jurisdictions. Western Governors also support efforts to develop civilian cybersecurity reserves, which help alleviate work force shortages and augment National Guard forces. 12. The administration should propose, and Congress should provide, long-term authorization and sufficient appropriations for high- quality cybersecurity education and work force development programs to grow and sustain the cybersecurity work force, including those that target underrepresented populations, those that include rotational components to retain personnel, and work-based learning opportunities such as apprenticeships. The Federal Government should also expand the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program and continue to support educational initiatives, such as NIST's Initiative for Cybersecurity Education and National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense. 13. Government and industry should increase the cybersecurity awareness of Government and private employees through training and education. Western Governors encourage the Federal Government to develop a national cybersecurity literacy and awareness campaign to educate citizens about how to stay safe on-line and prevent effective cyber attacks. 14. Western Governors support incentives for the creation of and participation in programs that encourage information sharing across all levels government, industry verticals, and regions. We also support other policies that incentivize the private sector to improve cybersecurity and share information regarding cyber threats as early as possible, including policies to improve access to information or create common standards for information sharing. The Federal Government should emphasize the benefits of information sharing, while alleviating private- sector concerns with this essential communication. The Federal Government and States should continue to investigate liability protections, such as safe harbor provisions, for entities that report cyber intrusions. 15. Our Nation requires innovation in detecting, preventing, and responding to continually-evolving cyber threats. More research is required to understand the use of blockchain and encryption by perpetrators and its utility for defense against cyber threats, and address vulnerabilities of other emerging technologies, including connected vehicles and internet of things devices. The Federal Government should provide funding and technical assistance for these and other types of cybersecurity research and development. c. governors' management directive 1.
