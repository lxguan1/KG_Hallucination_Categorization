MARKUP OF H.R. 7593 AND H.R. 7592
----------
April 11, 2024
Subcommittee on Modernization,
Committee on House Administration,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in
room 1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Stephanie Bice
 presiding.
Present: Representatives Bice, Carey, Kilmer, and Morelle.
Staff present: Annemarie Cake, Professional Staff and
Deputy Clerk.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEPHANIE BICE, CHAIRWOMAN, A U.S.
REPRESENTATIVE FROM OKLAHOMA
Chairwoman Bice. The Modernization Subcommittee will come
to order. I note that a quorum is present.
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a
recess at any time.
The Subcommittee meets today pursuant to notice to consider
two bills, H.R. 7592 and H.R. 7593.
As required by House rules, copies of both measures have
been made available to the Members and the public at least 24
hours in advance.
I now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening
statement.
A few weeks ago, on March 20, the Modernization
Subcommittee held its first legislative hearing. Today, the
Subcommittee is holding its first markup.
I would like to also note that this is the first markup
that a Subcommittee on House Administration has held in 31
years. It is a lot of firsts in the span of a few weeks. I
certainly want to thank Ranking Member Kilmer, Mr. Carey, Mr.
Morelle for all of the time and effort they have put into
getting us here today.
Subcommittees can play an important role in the legislative
process, and we are demonstrating that through our work here.
All four Members of this Subcommittee worked together to
introduce the bills that we are marking up today. These
measures will help streamline processes and improve the way the
Congressional Research Service works on behalf of Congress.
By prioritizing a more efficient Congress, we are saving
taxpayer dollars.
H.R. 7592 would eliminate the Constitution Annotated, or
CONAN, printed requirement and replace it with a digitized
version. This will eliminate the cost associated with printing
a hardbound version, which according to CRS and GPO, would save
just over a million dollars. The digital version is regularly
updated, and CRS is prepared to continue improving its user
features.
For those that may be watching, this is what the
Constitution Annotated looks like. It is printed every 10
years, and the minute it is printed, it is almost completely
out of date because it is being updated so frequently. We are
trying to move this online.
H.R. 7593 would modernize CRS' access to Federal agency
data and information, also creating efficiencies.
In order to provide timely and accurate research and
analysis to Congress, CRS needs quick and reliable access to
data. While CRS' work is held up by bureaucratic processes and
procedures, our work is held up. That is unacceptable, and our
constituents deserve better.
CRS brought these costs and time-saving measures to the
Subcommittee's attention, and we were happy to work with the
agency to support their ongoing modernization efforts.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DEREK KILMER, RANKING MEMBER, A U.S.
REPRESENTATIVE FROM WASHINGTON
Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Madam Chair and my colleagues, for
joining us here for our first Modernization Subcommittee
markup. As the Chairwoman mentioned, we have not had a House
Administration Subcommittee markup in over 30 years. I know
that we are now tearing it up on C-Span 8, The Ocho.
Today we are not focusing on the past. We are reviewing two
bills that bring the Congressional Research Service and, by
extension, this institution further into the future. Both bills
we are considering tackle problems we identified on the Select
Committee on the Modernization of Congress. I want to thank
everyone on the Subcommittee for partnering with Chair Bice and
me and for cosponsoring both bills.
As the Chairwoman mentioned, H.R. 7593, the Modernizing the
Congressional Research Service's Access to Data Act, speaks to
the Select Committee's recommendation that states that
congressional support agencies should report on challenges and
potential solutions for accessing Federal data.
CRS statute, developed in the 1970's, states that Federal
agencies need to comply with data requests from Congress to
serve Congressional Committees. However, given the lack of
explicit statutory reference to personal offices, CRS
leadership has indicated that they at times have struggled to
access necessary information from Federal agencies to execute
their mission.
CRS should be able to update reports on nationally
significant issues proactively and respond to specific Member
office requests, and their access should be on par with that
provided to other leg branch support agencies, like the CBO,
for example.
As I mentioned before at this Subcommittee previously, my
team and I utilize CRS regularly. Thankfully, they have not put
a restraining order out against my staff for how regularly. The
legislative work that our office puts forward is better because
CRS engages with us. It matters that they have access to the
Federal data that they need to do their jobs.
Furthermore, the Select Committee recommended that
Congressional Committees, including this one, should examine
support agency authorities and determine if they need to be
updated. In this spirit, CRS brought the CONAN issue to our
attention. As the Chairwoman mentioned, under existing law, the
Library of Congress is required to produce terrifically heavy
hardbound copies of the Constitution with annotations, which is
awesome for arms day if you are looking for a little exercise,
not super for taxpayers.
That is why this bill, if it passes, can save valuable CRS
staff capacity, as well as nearly a million dollars for
taxpayers, continuing to ensure that the American people have
access to the information that they need.
Thanks again to my colleagues, to the Subcommittee
Chairwoman, and our Subcommittee colleagues. I look forward to
moving these bills to modernize CRS forward and to continuing
the Subcommittee's vital work to improve Congress' ability to
serve the American people.

With that, I yield back.
Chairwoman Bice. Thank you, Representative Kilmer.
Do either Mr. Carey, Rep. Carey, or Rep. Morelle wish to
make an opening statement?
Representative Morelle, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, RANKING MEMBER, A
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK
Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Not so much an opening statement. Two things that occurred
to me. First of all--not one of the two things, but I thought
CONAN was just that you had to be Conan the Barbarian to be
able to lift this thing.
Just two things I want to point out. First of all, these
are substantive changes, and they may not set the world on
fire, but making substantive, positive changes that make the
place more efficient is something we should all be interested
in.
Secondly, I just want to thank the Members, particularly
the Chair and the Ranking Member. This is really the way we
ought to be doing things in Congress; Subcommittees meeting,
talking about substantive issues, trying to find common ground
and commonsense solutions to challenges and moving along.
Just wanted to thank you both for your leadership and
getting this to the Subcommittee and, hopefully, to the full
Committee for consideration.
I yield back.
Chairwoman Bice. Thank you, Representative. I appreciate
the comments.
First item on the agenda today is H.R. 7592. The clerk will
please report the bill.
The Clerk. H.R. 7592----
Chairwoman Bice. Without objection, the first reading of
the bill is dispensed with.
Also, without objection, the bill shall be considered as
read and open to amendment at any point.


Chairwoman Bice. Do any Members seek recognition to offer
amendments or speak on the bill?
Seeing none, if not, the question now occurs on reporting
H.R. 7592 favorably to the full Committee.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the bill
is reported favorably to the full Committee.
The next item on our agenda is 7593. The clerk will please
report the bill.
The Clerk. H.R. 7593----
Chairwoman Bice. Without objection, the first reading of
the bill is dispensed with.
Also, without objection, the bill shall be considered as
read and open to amendment at any point.


Chairwoman Bice. Do any Members wish to seek recognition to
