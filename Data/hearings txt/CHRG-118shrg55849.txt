WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES PAY, BY FAR,
THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD
FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS?
----------
Thursday, February 8, 2024
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room
430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Bernard Sanders,
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.
Present: Senators Sanders , Murray, Casey,
Baldwin, Murphy, Kaine, Hassan, Smith, Lujan, Hickenlooper,
Markey, Cassidy, Paul, Collins, Braun, Marshall, Romney, and
Tuberville.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SANDERS
The Chair. The Senate Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions will come to order. Today is a busy day. As
we all know, a very important vote is going to be taking place
and Republicans Democrats will be meeting in their caucuses.
So, people are going to be coming in and out.
I also think that this hearing is important enough that we
extend the time for questioning from the usual 5 minutes to 7
minutes, if that is okay with folks. Let me begin by welcoming
the CEOs of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Chris--Chris Boerner. We
thank you for being here. CEO of Merck, Robert Davis. We thank
you for being here. And the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, Joaquin
Duato, for being with us this morning, thanks very much.
There is a lot of discussion in our Nation about how
divided our people are on many issues, and that is absolutely
true. But on one of the most important issues facing our
Country, the American people, whether they are Democrats,
Republicans, Independents, Conservative, Progressive, could not
be more united, and that is the need to substantially lower the
outrageous price of prescription drugs in this country.
According to a recent poll, 82 percent of Americans say the
cost of prescription drugs is too high and 73 percent say that
the Government is not doing enough to regulate drug prices. As
a Nation, we spend almost twice as much per capita on health
care as do people of any other country--$13,000 for every man,
woman, and child.
One of the reasons that we spend so much is the high cost
of prescription drugs in our Country. The outrageous cost of
prescription drugs in America means that one out of four of our
people go to the doctor, get a prescription, and they cannot
afford to fill that prescription. How many die as a result of
that, how many suffer unnecessarily, nobody knows. But my guess
is it is in the millions, and I have talked to many of them in
Vermont and around the country.
Meanwhile, our insurance premiums are much higher than they
should be, and hospital costs are soaring because of the high
cost of prescription drugs. Further, the cost of prescription
drugs in this country is putting an enormous burden on
taxpayers and seniors by raising the cost of Medicare and
Medicaid. Medicare alone spends at least $135 billion a year on
prescription drugs.
This is not only a personal issue. It is an issue of the
Federal budget. Meanwhile, as we pay by far the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs, 10 of the top
pharmaceutical companies in America made over $110 billion in
profits in 2022. They are doing phenomenally well while
Americans cannot afford the cost of the medicine they need and
the CEOs in general receive exorbitant compensation packages.
This morning, we are going to hear a lot from our CEO
panelists about how high prices are not their fault, and that
the PBMs are forcing Americans to pay much higher prices than
they should be paying.
But let us be clear, in 2022, Johnson & Johnson made nearly
$18 billion in profit, paid its CEO over $27 million in
compensation, and spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and
dividends. That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profits,
handed out over $7 billion in dividends in their--to their
stockholders, and paid its CEO over $52 million in
compensation.
Bristol-Myers Squibb made $8 billion in profits last year,
while recently spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks and
dividends and giving its CEO over $41 million in compensation.
Now, why did a majority of Members of this Committee invite
these three pharmaceutical CEOs to testify today?
The answer is pretty simple. Mr. Boerner, we will want you
to explain to the American people why Bristol-Myers Squibb
charges patients in our Country $7,100 a year for ELIQUIS, when
that same exact product can be purchased for just $900 in
Canada and $650 in France.
Mr. Duato, we are going to ask you why Johnson & Johnson
charges Americans with arthritis $79,000 for STELARA, when that
same exact product can be purchased for just $20,000 in Canada
and just $12,000 in France. Mr. Davis, please tell us later why
Merck--why Merck charges Americans with cancer $191,000 a year
for KEYTRUDA, when that same product can be purchased for
$112,000 in Canada and $91,000 in France.
Let's be clear, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol-Myers
Squibb are not just charging higher prices in the United States
compared to other countries. They are also charging Americans
much higher prices today than they did in the past even
accounting for inflation.
From 2004 to 2008, the median price of innovative new drugs
sold by these three companies was just $14,000, inflation
accounted. From 2019 to 2023, where we are today, the median
price of new drugs sold by these three companies was $238,000.
In other words, Americans are forced to pay higher and
higher prices for the drugs they need to survive. And let's be
clear, the overwhelming beneficiary of these high drug prices
is the pharmaceutical industry.
How do we know that? Well, that is precisely what they tell
their investors. According to their own shareholder reports,
Bristol-Myers Squibb made $34 billion selling the blood thinner
ELIQUIS in the United States, compared to just $22 billion in
the rest of the world combined. Make their money in the United
States.
In other words, the U.S. accounts for nearly two-thirds of
all global sales of ELIQUIS. Not a single dollar of this
revenue is going to PBMs. 100 percent of it is going through
Bristol-Myers Squibb. Johnson & Johnson has reported to its
shareholders that it made over $30 billion in revenue selling
the arthritis drug STELARA in the United States since 2016,
more than twice as much as the rest of the world combined.
Nothing to do with PBMs. Merck has reported to its
shareholders that it made $43.4 billion selling the cancer drug
KEYTRUDA in the United States, compared to $30 billion in the
rest of the world combined.
Now, our CEO panelists from the drug companies will tell us
this morning how much it costs to develop new drugs and how
often the research that they undertake for new cures is not
successful. And they are right. We appreciate that.
But what they have not told us in their written testimony
is that 14 major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson &
Johnson and Merck, spent $87 billion more on stock buybacks and
dividends over recent 10 year period than what they spent on
research and development--more on stock buybacks and dividends
than in research and development.
In fact, Bristol-Myers Squibb spent 3.2 billion more on
stock buybacks and dividends in 2022 that it spent on research
and development. Johnson & Johnson spent $46 billion more on
stock buybacks and dividends than it spent on research and
development since 2012.
In other words, these companies are spending more to enrich
their own stockholders and CEOs than they are in finding new
cures and new treatments. Now, the average American who hears
all of this is asking a very simple question, how does all of
this happen? What is going on? How could your companies charge
us, in some cases, ten times more than they charge Canadians,
people around the world for the same drug?
How did they get away with this when so many of our people
cannot afford the high prices of the drugs that they need? How
can it be uniquely among industrialized countries that these
companies, not just these companies but the pharmaceutical
industry in general, can raise prices any time they want to any
level they want--want to raise double prices, do it any way
they want. How do they get away with all of that?
Here, in my view, is the answer. The U.S. Government does
not regulate drug companies. With very few exceptions, the drug
companies regulate the U.S. Government. That is the sad state
of affairs in a corrupt political system. Over the past 25
years, the pharmaceutical industry, not just these companies,
the entire industry, spent over $8.5 billion on lobbying and
more than $745 million on campaign contributions.
Let me be fair here. I don't want to misspeak. They are
bipartisan. They give to Republicans. They give to Democrats. I
am especially impressed by the Pfizer drug company--Pfizer is
not here this morning contributing $1 million to the Republican
Party in Kentucky to expand its headquarters named after
Republican leader Mitch McConnell.
But again, it is not just Republicans. It is Democrats as
well. Unbelievable, this is an astounding fact. Last year, drug
companies had over 1,800 well-paid lobbyist here in D.C. to
make sure that Congress did their bidding. There are 535
Members of Congress and 1,800 well paid lobbyists, over three
for every Member of Congress.
If you want to know why you are paying the highest prices
in the world, America, that is why. Now, here is some good news
in the midst of all that. We are beginning, beginning to take
on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.
As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act passed several
years ago, Medicare for the first time ever is beginning to do
what every major country on Earth does and what the Veterans
Administration has been doing for over 30 years, and that is to
negotiate the lower prices of drugs, including JANUVIA,
STELARA, and ELIQUIS.
Let me conclude by saying this, I am proud of what this
Committee up to this point has accomplished. Last year, as you
will all remember, the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP
Committee hearing that his company would make certain that no
one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out-of-
pocket.
We appreciated that. In a separate health Committee hearing
last May, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed that his company would
not raise prices on existing insulin products after having, in
fact, lowered them.
But let's be clear, much more needs to be done. I look
forward to hearing from our CEO panelists this morning as to
how they are going to go forward to substantially lower the
cost of prescription drugs in this country.
Senator Cassidy, you are now recognized for your opening
statement.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CASSIDY
Senator Cassidy. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Sanders. Let's
just be clear, everybody on this panel cares about the high
cost of prescription drugs and wants to work on real solutions
to address this.
But it is also clear that this hearing is not about finding
legislative solutions. It is kind of following a formula.
Republicans--we publicly attack private--I don't but others,
publicly attack private citizens for being successful under
capitalism. We grossly oversimplify our problem and blame
corporations.
We demand CEOs come before the Committee for public verbal
stoning. We reject the offer to send top executives with
subject matter expertise and responsibility regarding issues at
hand, and threaten a subpoena when CEOs are suspicious that
they won't get a fair shake. Hold the hearing, get sound bites,
then pick another set of CEOs for a show trial, but we don't
pass meaningful legislation.
That sounds familiar. That has been the hearing of
Starbucks founder Howard Schultz, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel,
and now this hearing with the same formula. I would have gladly
joined the Chair in explore exploring solutions to address the
high cost of prescription drugs. I am a doc. I worked in a
public hospital for the uninsured for 25 years. I did my best
to get care to those who otherwise would not have received.
I am aware of this. I am also aware of the perverse
incentives. The kind of like, my gosh, it shouldn't be high,
but it is high. Bad actors game the system and we need
solutions that benefit patients and improve access. But the
majority was not interested in working with this side of the
dais to hold a serious hearing to inform serious legislation.
They didn't seek Republican input. The goal was to haul you
guys in, decry capitalism, and blame these corporations for the
high cost of drug prices. Now, by the way, of course, drug
companies play a role, and hopefully we will get answers today
to legitimate questions about how drugs are priced.
But the problem is far greater and more complex than
individual companies or even a set of companies within an
ecosystem, which is incredibly complex. Why do Americans pay
more for certain drugs than patients in other countries? To
understand, we need to have a serious effort to navigate the
network of perverse incentives throughout the health care
system.
I lived in it for 25 years. I am very kind of aware of it.
Taking a substantial look at insurance benefit design, price
transparency, regulatory barriers, intellectual property
barriers, the perverse effect Government discount programs have
upon prices charged to commercial patients, etcetera.
One example, just to say again a little bit of complexity
here. The 340B drug program resulted in a $54 billion in drug
discounts in 2022, but we actually don't know if those
discounts lowered prices for the patient who bought the drug.
There are reports that patients paid cash when the
intermediary took the full price, even though 340B should have
lowered it. That is a serious investigation being conducted by
this side of the dais that the other side of the dais was not
interested in participating in. That is an understanding of an
ecosystem.
I understand there is no one more eloquent than Chair
Sanders on Medicare for all, and we can cherry pick examples of
how other countries are doing something better. I can cherry
pick the opposite. Canada is struggling--just to show you that
there is a complexity here. Let me just take an example. Canada
is struggling with specialty care.
In May of last year, the Canadian government began to send
4,800 Canadians from British Columbia to Washington State to
``ensure people have faster access to life saving radiation
treatment.'' They can afford their system because we are right
next door.
Relatedly to this hearing into that, Alison Decliso, a
Canadian woman paid for her own treatment in the United States
after the provincial health authority in British Columbia
denied her access to life saving chemotherapy.
Canada had a lower cost drug, SOLO. They didn't carry the
chemotherapy, so she paid for it out of pocket in the United
States so she could have lifesaving chemotherapy. The United
States is not perfect, but if we cherry pick from other
countries, we have to do a more thorough investigation to see,
is there a balance there?
Now let's return to prescriptions. Canadians pay less than
we do. Let's figure out why. But let's also point out the
public health insurance in Canada only covers 21 percent of
newly developed drugs.
Now, maybe that is a tradeoff, but I can tell you, you tell
an American that they can't have access to a lifesaving court--
a lifesaving drug, they are going to see you in court. They are
going to sue, and they are going to say, I want that access.
The UK only covers 48 percent of newly available drugs.
Americans just would not tolerate that. It is fair to say that
Ms. Decliso, all those radiation treatment patients, are those
not getting the newly developed lifesaving drugs as quickly
might die in those countries that don't have access to the same
treatments as do we in the U.S..
These are serious questions. One more time, I am a doc. I
am aware of this, but we need to fully consider all these
issues and then maybe bring you in at the end, but we will
bring you in with a context which is complete as opposed to
isolated. As I said at the start, it would be best if this were
a genuine exercise.
I am so willing to do the work on this, as are my
colleagues. We have shown that willingness on work on PBM
reforms and generic drugs. And even though the Chair and I got
off to a rocky start, we did some pretty good work on that, Mr.
Chair. I think we got some good bipartisan legislation.
This Committee, I agree with you, can accomplish that. But
I don't want the Committee to devolve into a CEO whack a mole,
ends up with no serious legislation as a result. Further proof
of what I consider the unserious and cynical nature of this
hearing is that the minority asked the Chair to have a witness
on the panel that could actually explore some of these issues
side by side these CEOs.
That was turned down. We wanted an academic expert in drug
pricing who could provide unbiased and substantial input to the
issues at hand. Our witness was not allowed. He will be on the
next, but the way this works is this get all the publicity and
the next one gets crickets.
We have not had that opportunity. And I will also point out
we didn't split the majority of minority witnesses into
different panels during several hearings, which promoted kind
of labor union issues. I can think of no reason to not allow
our witness to be here now except perhaps ruining the optics.
As I said at our last markup, what ends up being hollow
messaging gives D.C. a bad reputation. Folks want real answers.
They want relief from high prices. It is in part what we are
going to hear today, but it will be separated from a context
that would have made it a lot more productive.
If you are telling voters you are going to do something
when you know at the get go you have no legislative solution
which emerges, and that is why folks don't trust.
If we are just looking for a social media clip, then I
suppose we have accomplished something, but let's make a
difference for the people whom we represent--for those patients
in hospitals who I once treated who otherwise would not have
access to care.
We have the ability to craft meaningful legislation. Let's
do it. With that, I yield.
The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cassidy. Our first witness
will be Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson.
Mr. Duato has served as Johnson & Johnson's Chairman since
2023, and Chief Executive Officer since 2022. Mr. Duato, thanks
very much for being with us.
STATEMENT OF JOAQUIN DUATO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, JOHNSON &
JOHNSON, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ
Mr. Duato. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be
here today.
Johnson & Johnson has collaborated with this Committee over
several decades to advance health care solutions for patients,
including on diversity in clinical trials, nursing and health
care workforce, pandemic preparation, mental health, and
regulatory pathways for novel cell and gene therapies.
I applaud this Committee for your commitment to such
critical priorities. I have been with J&J for more than 35
years and have held roles in Europe and in the U.S.. I
understand the global challenges and complexities of health
care innovation and delivery, and today I look forward to
discussing our approach to pricing and the work we do to
advance health care for all Americans.
Fundamentally, our decisionmaking is guided by the values
set forth on our credo, which states that our first
responsibility is to the patients. Our drug pricing decisions
reflect our commitment to bringing forward innovative medicines
for patients today and for patients tomorrow.
First, our prices are based on the value our medicines
bring to patients, the healthcare system, and society. We take
into consideration that our medicines improve patient's quality
of life and show revival rates, while often reducing health
care costs. And for context, in 2022, the average net price of
our medicines declined for the sixth year in a row by 3.5
percentage points.
Over those 6 years, prices have declined by almost 20
percent, and the real inflation adjusted price decline was more
than 40 percent. Second, we price our medicines to support
patient access.
In 2022 alone, we paid $39 billion in rebate discounts and
fees, almost 60 percent of the average list price of our drugs,
with the intent that patients benefit from these substantial
cost savings. We also support patient affordability and access
by funding patient assistance programs.
In 2022, these programs helped more than 1 billion--1
million underinsured patients. And we donated $3.8 billion in
free medicines, another support, to help patients with no
insurance.
Finally, we price our medicines to meet our commitment to
innovate and develop different novel medicines for patients.
The investment required to do so is massive. The average cost
of bringing a drug through clinical trials in our industry is
more than $2 billion.
However, more than 90 percent of the drugs that enter
clinical trials do not make it to patients. Consequently, our
R&D investment is enormous and totally--totals near $78 billion
since 2016.
Despite the tremendous investment required to bring drugs
to patients, drug costs in the U.S. have not increased
significantly as a percentage of total overall health care
costs. In fact, the largest spending in the U.S. is about 14
percent of health care spending, slightly below the average for
the rest of the world.
While total U.S. health care spending is higher than other
developed nations, this spending allows American patients to
receive cutting edge health care earlier than any other country
in the world.
However, the burdensome co-pay obligations imposed in the
U.S. are hard for patients to meet and undermine access and
health equity. Remarkably, the GAO found that patient co-pay
obligations often exceed payer costs for their drugs. This
means that patients sometimes pay more for their medicines than
their insurers.
Clearly, this part of the system is not working as
intended. We support proposals to reconcile this inequity and
to ensure patient access. As outlined in my testimony, Congress
should stop middlemen from taking for themselves the assistance
that pharmaceutical companies intend for patients.
Finally, it is essential that we reject the price caps and
controls that exist in other countries which stunt innovation.
Our nation's robust biopharmaceutical industry was created by
policy choices that prioritized earlier patient access to
breakthrough medicines and incentivized investment in medical
innovation.
Thank you for the bipartisan efforts of this Committee and
for the opportunity to engage in today's discussion. I look
forward to your questions.

prepared statement of joaquin duato
Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Senators of the
Committee, I am the Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson and
the Chairman of the Board of Directors, positions I assumed in January
2022 and 2023. I joined Johnson & Johnson in 1989, and for the first 13
years of my tenure, I held various executive positions with the company
in Europe. Over my thirty-five years with the company, I have held
roles in both our Innovative Medicine sector and MedTech sector. As I
have practiced and witnessed throughout my career, Johnson & Johnson's
decisionmaking is guided by the values set forth in Our Credo, first
adopted in 1943, which states that our first responsibility is to the
patients, doctors, nurses, parents, and all others who use our products
and services. This responsibility extends to both the patients who need
our innovative medicines today to treat some of the most challenging
and life-threatening diseases, and to the patients of tomorrow, who
need us to continue to research cures and treatments for the unmet
medical needs that they will face in the future.
Johnson & Johnson has collaborated with this Committee over several
decades to advance the important work of pursuing novel healthcare
solutions that benefit patients. Our engagement with the Committee has
contributed to the efforts to address the mental health crisis,
modernize the biopharmaceutical and medical technology regulatory
pathways, provide critical access to affordable medicines and medical
technologies, examine frameworks for use of artificial intelligence in
health, enhance diversity in clinical trials, ensure pandemic
preparedness, and support frontline healthcare workers and their daily
challenges. I have long admired this Committee's ability to find common
ground and deliver solutions for patients. Having held roles in the
United States and Europe, and as a dual citizen of the United States
and Spain, I understand well the global challenges and complexities of
healthcare innovation and delivery.
I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss these issues, and Our
Credo values that shape Johnson & Johnson's approach to pricing for our
innovative medicines. I look forward to sharing with you our
perspectives on how we may collaborate to improve access to and
affordability of medicines for all Americans, while continuing to bring
to patients the life-changing and life-saving medicines that are the
hallmark of American healthcare.
Introduction
Johnson & Johnson's drug pricing decisions integrate our commitment
to bringing innovative therapies to the patients who need them today,
and our dedication to continuous research, innovation, and development
of the next generation of medicines across dozens of diseases for the
patients of tomorrow.
In furtherance of those objectives, we price our therapies, first
and foremost, based on the value that our therapies bring to patients,
the healthcare system, and society. Johnson & Johnson focuses on
developing transformational therapies that address challenging and
complex unmet medical needs. Our drugs improve patients' quality of
life and survival rates, while also reducing overall healthcare costs,
for example, through fewer surgeries and hospital admissions. The
pricing of our medicines reflects these important life-saving, life-
enhancing, and financial benefits.
Second, we price our medicines to further our commitment to patient
access. To that end, Johnson & Johnson pays significant rebates,
discounts, and fees to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), payors, and
other ``middlemen'' in the healthcare system. It is our intent in
making those concessions that patients benefit from these cost savings,
not these intermediaries. To foster an open dialog regarding the
appropriate recipients of these savings--PBMs, payors, or patients--we
started publishing information about our pricing 6 years ago in our
annual Transparency Report, available online for all to review. As
detailed in the most recent issue, the average net price of our
medicines declined for the sixth year in a row, and cumulatively by
almost 20 percent over that period. During that same timeframe,
consumer prices rose by more than 20 percent, which equates to a
decline in the real, inflation-adjusted pricing for our drugs of more
than 40 percent. The decline in our average net price is due in large
part to the increased amounts paid to these middlemen. In 2022 alone,
our average net price declined by 3.5 percent, attributable to our
payment of $39 billion in rebates, discounts, and fees to others in the
healthcare system--constituting almost 60 percent of the average list
price of our drugs.
In addition to these price reductions, Johnson & Johnson furthers
patient access by funding patient assistance programs designed to help
manage copay obligations and provide free medicines to underinsured
patients. As the Transparency Report details, in 2022, these patient
assistance programs helped more than one million underinsured patients
access Johnson & Johnson therapies their doctors prescribed. We also
donated $3.8 billion in free products and other financial support
through independent programs and foundations to help uninsured patients
obtain the therapies they need.
Third, we price our products to allow us to meet our commitment to
innovate and develop new and novel medicines for the patients of today
and tomorrow. To do so, we must price our existing medicines at levels
sufficient to cover the investment required to pursue the development
of broad portfolios of new drug candidates. The requisite investment is
massive, as the average cost of bringing a drug candidate through
clinical trials to patients is $2.6 billion over 10 years, across the
industry. Moreover, we must pursue numerous drug candidates on parallel
tracks because, across the industry, approximately 90 percent of the
drugs that enter clinical trials (and 92 percent of cancer drugs) fail
before they can make it to market. Even after a drug is approved and
reaches patients, only around 20 percent to 30 percent of new drugs
recoup the significant investments necessary to bring them to market.
Consequently, Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical research and
development spending is enormous, with an investment of $77.7 billion
since 2016, $11.6 billion in 2022, and $12 billion in 2023. To our
knowledge, this is one of the largest annual investments in research
and development made among any of our biopharmaceutical industry peers.
Accordingly, we must price our drugs both to recover funds for the
investments made and to allow us to continue these efforts--including
investments in promising drug candidates that ultimately fail and
therefore generate no revenue.
Despite the tremendous investment required to sustain the flow of
new medicines, drug costs in the United States have not increased
appreciably as a percentage of overall healthcare costs in over a
decade. Moreover, the level of drug costs as a percentage of total
healthcare spending in the United States is about 14 percent, slightly
below the average for other major markets. In some instances, the
prices of drugs in the United States are higher than in other
countries--and so are the costs of other healthcare services in the
United States. This spending allows patients in the United States to
receive cutting-edge healthcare as compared to patients elsewhere in
the world, including obtaining markedly earlier and broader access to
breakthrough innovative medicines.
Conversely, there is one notable attribute of the U.S. healthcare
system that differentiates it from other countries in a way that is
detrimental to patients. The United States healthcare system alone
imposes onerous copayment obligations on patients, which are becoming
harder for patients to meet and are undermining access and health
equity. There is broad agreement among experts and policymakers that
the copayment obligations imposed by both government programs and
private insurers is a primary reason for patients' failure to complete
prescribed courses of drug therapy, even with regard to cancer and
other life-threatening diseases. Remarkably, as the Government
Accountability Office found when analyzing the most highly rebated Part
D drugs, patients' copay obligations often exceed payors' net costs for
those drugs because rebates and other incentives paid by manufacturers
to payors are not passed on directly to patients. The diversion of
those price reductions from patients to middlemen is one reason that
copayment obligations are neither an equitable nor effective means for
controlling drug prices. We support the following proposals that have
been advanced to address this inequity and to ensure patients receive
the full course of drugs prescribed by their physicians.
First, we agree that patient copayment obligations should be
reduced. The imposition of lower caps on out-of-pocket costs for
Medicare patients under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a good
first step. But access problems remain across multiple markets.
Policymakers should closely monitor the effect of these changes to
ensure they improve patient access in practice and, in addition,
consider ways to reduce cost sharing in the commercial market.
Second, Congress or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) should stop payors, PBMs, and their agents from taking for
themselves the copayment assistance that Johnson & Johnson and other
companies intend for patients by eliminating the economic incentive to
do so. As 19 Senators recognized in a recent letter to CMS, certain
payors and PBMs have been capturing for themselves the benefits of
copay assistance by excluding the patient assistance payments when
assessing whether patients have met the copayment caps imposed by law.
The economic effect of these programs--with benign-sounding names like
``accumulators,'' ``maximizers,'' and ``alternative funding
programs''--is to divert the patient assistance from patients to
payors. These programs should be barred, and patients should be allowed
to receive the intended benefits of the assistance.
Third, Congress should require that PBMs and payors pass on to
patients the rebates and other concessions they demand that
manufacturers pay. Overall, in 2022, almost 60 percent of the list
price of our medicines went to rebates, discounts, and fees, in many
cases as a result of the financial demands of payors and others in the
healthcare system. While the amount of these concessions is significant
and increasing each year, studies show that the majority of these
amounts is retained by these intermediaries and not passed along to
patients. No other healthcare system tolerates the diversion of
discounts intended for patients to these middlemen.
Fourth, Johnson & Johnson supports pending legislation--such as the
Pharmacy Benefit Manager Reform Act passed by this Committee last
year--designed to address certain PBM practices that distort the
healthcare delivery system by ensuring transparency to the payors that
utilize PBM services. This legislation, especially if expanded to
require delinking of PBM fees from list prices, would be an important
step toward aligning incentives for lower net costs and improved
patient access.
Finally, it is essential that the United States reject the price
caps and controls that exist in other countries and serve to stunt
innovation and deprive patients of life-saving medicines. Our nation's
robust biopharmaceutical industry was created and fostered by
deliberate policy choices that prioritized and incentivized investment
in medical innovation in exchange for a period of patent and regulatory
exclusivity that enables innovators to price at levels required to
recoup their investments and reinvest in the future. As reflected in
the Constitution, this nation's founders recognized as a fundamental
tenet, and a cornerstone of a free and capitalistic economy, that the
award of exclusivity promotes progress. We can only make the
significant research and development investments we do because U.S.
policy has respected manufacturers' patent rights and afforded periods
of market exclusivity for innovations. Those exclusivity periods are
limited and often curtailed because they run from the date of
invention, not from the date of market entry, which can be years
thereafter. Moreover, as part of the laudable social bargain, upon
expiry of patent and regulatory exclusivities, generic drug and
biosimilar manufacturers are legally authorized to rely upon and
leverage the innovator's investment in safety and efficacy studies to
bring competitive drugs to the market. That social bargain is one
reason that--over time and on average--drug costs in the United States
are only 14 percent of total healthcare costs, which is below the
average for other major markets. We support policies that encourage
other countries to do more to foster innovation, rather than misguided
approaches that would result in the United States doing less. This is
critical not only to the health of the United States, but also to our
Nation's financial and national security.
The remainder of my testimony contains additional details regarding
each of these important subjects.
Investment in Innovation Leads to Treatments and Cures
For more than a century, Johnson & Johnson has created breakthrough
scientific innovations that address some of the nation's most important
medical needs. We are proud of our proven history of pharmaceutical
innovation. Since 2016, our total investments in pharmaceutical
research and development have reached $77.7 billion. In 2022 alone,
Johnson & Johnson committed $11.6 billion to the discovery and
development of medicines. In 2023, we invested $12 billion in
pharmaceutical research and development (and $15.1 billion in research
and development across the company).
Since 2016, our investment in the next generation of transformative
medicines resulted in eight new drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and an additional fifty-two approvals for expanded
indications or new product formulations. Johnson & Johnson may achieve
eight more significant approvals by the FDA in 2024. These medicines,
if approved, will offer treatments for serious diseases, including
multiple myeloma and lung cancer. Johnson & Johnson has an additional
11 significant FDA regulatory submissions that are planned for later
this year. In addition, we expect to obtain important data this year
from eight Phase III trials and three Phase II trials, which will
inform the clinical and regulatory strategy for these significant
programs in our pipeline. These figures do not include our entire
clinical development portfolio, nor the substantial investment in drug
discovery, including internally, in incubator settings and in stand-
alone companies.
These significant investments by Johnson & Johnson--and other
innovators in the biopharmaceutical industry--have had dramatic effects
on the lives of Americans: people live longer and achieve a better
quality of life. From 1990 to 2015, biopharmaceutical drugs accounted
for at least an estimated 35 percent of the increase in U.S. life
expectancy. Over that same period, pharmaceuticals accounted for 76
percent of the mortality reduction achieved for HIV, 60 percent of
mortality reduction in cerebrovascular disease, 60 percent of mortality
reduction in malignant breast tumors, 52 percent of mortality reduction
in ischemic heart disease, and 27 percent of mortality reduction in
colon, rectal, and related cancers.
The industry continues to invest in new and life-changing
medicines. Across the healthcare sector, the biopharmaceutical
industry's spending on research and development accounts for 75 percent
of all U.S. investment in medical and health research and development.
The biopharmaceutical industry has a robust pipeline of more than 8,000
medicines in clinical development, including more than 800 treatments
and cures for diseases that disproportionately affect minority
communities.
The medicines that the Committee has identified, and that we are
discussing today, are illustrative of the benefits that Johnson &
Johnson's investment in medical innovation brings to patients and their
providers, and I would like to address each one briefly.
Stelara. Stelara is an innovative treatment for certain chronic and
debilitating immune-related diseases. Stelara is approved for the
treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis,
active psoriatic arthritis, moderately to severely active Crohn's
disease, and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, as well
as the treatment of pediatric patients ages 6 years and older with
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.
These debilitating diseases can cause inflammation, ulcers, pain,
bleeding, and serious complications in the intestines; painful itching,
burning, and scaling of the skin; and painful swollen and tender
joints. Patients living with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
at increased risk for hospitalization and surgery, which both carry
risks for patients and cost burdens for the healthcare system.
Stelara was the first significant therapeutic advancement over the
prior generation of treatments, TNF-inhibitors. Stelara can have a
significant positive impact on patients. For Crohn's disease, a
majority of patients were in remission 1 year after responding to the
initial treatment with Stelara.
Xarelto. Xarelto is a type of blood thinner called a direct oral
anticoagulant that helps patients facing conditions that put them at
risk of blood clots, which can lead to thrombotic events such as heart
attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolisms. Initially invented by Bayer
in Germany, Johnson & Johnson partnered with Bayer to bring the
medication to patients in the United States.
Xarelto is a therapeutic advancement over other blood thinners,
such as warfarin. Xarelto's benefits include fewer food and drug
interactions, easier standardized dosing, and the elimination of
invasive and costly blood tests required with some other therapies.
Medical treatment guidelines provide that direct oral anticoagulants,
including Xarelto, are preferable to warfarin for certain serious
conditions such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous
thromboembolism. Moreover, in about half of its FDA-approved
indications, Xarelto is the only approved direct oral anticoagulant.
Imbruvica. Imbruvica is a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other blood cancers, including
small lymphocytic lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. It has
helped evolve the standard of care for adult patients living with B-
cell malignancies, who until about a decade ago had poor prognoses and
had to rely largely on chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy as the main
treatment options available. Imbruvica is the only medicine in its
class that has demonstrated a statistically significant overall
survival benefit in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia and an
established safety profile gained through clinical studies, long term
follow up, and safety monitoring.
Symtuza. Symtuza is the first complete, darunavir-based single-
tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in adults and children who
weigh at least 40kg. Developed by Johnson & Johnson, in collaboration
with Gilead Sciences, Inc., Symtuza combines the proven high barrier to
resistance of darunavir with a formulation designed for improved
tolerability and the convenience of a single-tablet regimen. Symtuza
offers an important treatment option for patients. Symtuza has been
studied and used in patients who have never been on medications to
treat HIV, as well as in those patients who have previously been well
controlled on HIV medications and are not known to have any viral
resistance to the components of Symtuza.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Access to Johnson & Johnson Medicines
Johnson & Johnson's approach to pharmaceutical pricing balances our
commitment to bring innovative therapies to the patients who need them
today, and our dedication to continuous research, innovation, and
development of the next generation of medicines across dozens of
diseases. We strive to understand and address the serious health
problems of today and create the potential medicines of tomorrow. In
setting the prices of its drugs, Johnson & Johnson follows three
guiding principles:
1. Value to patients, the healthcare system, and society. In
setting drug prices, a primary consideration is the value that the drug
brings to patients, the healthcare system, and society as a whole. For
patients, these considerations can include improvements in health, an
extended lifespan, and an improved quality of life--such as the ability
to take a pill rather than travel to a health center for an infusion,
or conversely, to take a long-acting, twice-yearly injection rather
than a daily pill. For the healthcare system, pharmaceutical
innovations can significantly reduce other costs, such as surgeries and
hospital admissions.
2. Affordable access to medicines. Our approach to drug pricing
reflects our commitment to making our innovations available to patients
who need them. First, we negotiate with insurance companies--and the
pharmacy benefit managers they engage to negotiate on their behalves--
to encourage insurance plans to cover our medicines. These entities are
gatekeepers to patients. We work with these companies to demonstrate
the value that our products bring to their policyholders, and we engage
in negotiations on discounts and rebates that reduce the costs for our
drugs. Second, we seek to ensure that a patient's financial situation
is not a barrier to access through a variety of programs and approaches
that promote patient access. For example, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen
CarePath patient support program provides options for underinsured
patients with commercial or private health insurance through solutions
like copay assistance and medications free of charge.
3. Investing in future cures and treatments. As demonstrated by our
robust pipeline, Johnson & Johnson is dedicated to bringing the next
generation of treatments and cures to patients. Drug development is
costly and uncertain. Our approach to pricing therefore must include
the ability to invest in innovation for the patients of tomorrow.
Developing a new medicine requires, on average, a $2.6 billion
investment over 10 years. Pharmaceutical pricing must allow for and
fund research into potential innovations that ultimately fail. In fact,
most promising drugs do not succeed, whether due to unacceptable side
effects, limited efficacy, or other factors. Across the industry,
approximately 90 percent of candidate medicines that show sufficient
promise to warrant a Phase I clinical trial do not eventually result in
a new FDA approval. This reality means that the revenue from only about
10 percent of all drugs investigated for therapeutic potential in
clinical trials must fund the research and development of all failed
drug candidates and the research and development of all innovative
treatments and cures of tomorrow. Even more, only around 20 percent to
30 percent of new drugs recoup the significant investments needed to
bring them through approval and to patients.
With this understanding of the framework for Johnson & Johnson drug
pricing, it is essential to consider the significant and substantial
rebates, discounts, and fees that reduce Johnson & Johnson's revenue
and result in a much lower effective price of our medicines than may
seem apparent from the list price of our drugs. Because pricing trends
and the extent of the diversion of discounts and patient assistance
away from patients are, unfortunately, hidden from the public by our
Country's byzantine drug pricing system, Johnson & Johnson has
committed to transparency in its drug pricing and has issued a
transparency report every year since 2016.
In Johnson & Johnson's most recent Transparency Report, issued in
mid-2023, the company reported that the actual price of its medicines
had declined for the sixth year in a row. In 2022, the average net
price of Johnson & Johnson's medicines declined 3.5 percent.
There is a striking gap between the list price of medicines--often
misleadingly cited in the media and by some in Congress--and the actual
amount that Johnson & Johnson receives for its medicines. In 2022,
Johnson & Johnson recorded $39 billion in rebates, discounts, and fees
to commercial insurers, government programs, and others in the
healthcare system. Overall, in 2022, Johnson & Johnson received well
under half of the list price of its medicines--almost 60 percent of the
list price instead went to rebates, discounts, and fees, in many cases
as a result of the financial demands of payors and others in the
healthcare system.
These middlemen also put financial pressure on patients, as
insurance companies have continued to impose higher deductibles, higher
copays, and higher coinsurance requirements--even for patients who
thought they were well insured. Nearly a quarter of Americans are now
considered underinsured, meaning that they are open to significant
financial risk from a healthcare necessity or find that the care they
need is financially out of reach because of the requirements imposed by
their insurance provider. Since 2014, commercially insured patients
with deductibles have experienced a 50 percent increase in out-of-
pocket costs for brand medications due to these tactics.
Johnson & Johnson has sought to address these challenges to access
with a variety of robust patient assistance programs. For example,
Johnson & Johnson's Janssen CarePath Program is a patient assistance
program that supports eligible patients on commercial, employer
sponsored, or government insurance, regardless of income. Patients with
commercial insurance can apply to the program, which includes a number
of solutions such as copay assistance and free product. In 2022, more
than one million patients were helped with support provided by Johnson
& Johnson's Janssen CarePath Program. Also in 2022, we donated $3.8
billion in free product and other financial support to the Johnson &
Johnson Patient Assistance Foundation and other independent programs.
Commercial insurers and PBMs have responded to these programs with
a variety of tactics designed to thwart manufacturers' patient
assistance programs. For example, they impose prior authorization
requirements and cost sharing models to control or restrict a patient's
ability to access a medicine prescribed by a doctor. They impose
exclusion lists that prevent a patient from accessing a prescribed
medicine, given these are lists of products determined in the sole
discretion of an insurer not to be covered. Exclusion lists have grown
nearly 1000 percent since 2014 and now include more than 1,350 drugs.
PBMs' newest tactics are designed simply to divert manufacturers'
patient assistance funds to their own pockets. These tactics have
opaque names like ``accumulators,'' ``maximizers,'' and ``alternative
funding programs,'' but they share a common purpose of undermining
manufacturers' access programs. As one example, PBMs improperly inflate
patients' copay amounts to astronomical amounts and then seek
``support'' from the assistance programs for this inflated copay. The
patients quicky exhaust the available support, and the assistance
programs' funds are effectively diverted to the PBMs. Johnson & Johnson
brought suit against a company leading this practice in 2022.
The medications we are addressing today exemplify our approach to
pricing, the downward trajectory of our prices due to discounts and
rebates, and our commitment to patient access. Stelara, for example,
has experienced a declining price in six of the last 7 years, once
rebates and discounts are included. From 2017 to 2023, the average
yearly price decline for Stelara was 5.9 percent. Xarelto similarly
experienced a declining price in six of the 7 years between 2017 and
2023.
Each of these medicines also exemplifies the support that Johnson &
Johnson provides in our patient assistance programs. Under the benefits
provided by Johnson & Johnson's Janssen CarePath Program, eligible
patients can pay as little as $5 for each dose of Stelara, $10 per fill
of Xarelto, $0 per prescription of Imbruvica, and $0 per prescription
of Symtuza.
U.S. Policy Supports and Fosters Innovation
The robust biopharmaceutical industry in the United States--
currently the world's leading investor in innovation and developer of
breakthrough treatments and cures--did not occur by accident. Instead,
it was intentionally created and fostered by the policy choices of this
Committee, Congress more broadly, and the many generations of
policymakers that preceded those of us here today. Through thoughtful
policy choices reflected in bipartisan legislation, in many cases
emanating from this Committee, the United States created a medical
innovation environment that is unique in the world.
For example, in the 1990's, Congress enacted the Prescription Drug
User Fee Act to ensure that the FDA had the resources needed to remain
the world's leading drug review agency. The law provided the FDA with a
new funding stream to ensure that the FDA could hire and train the
staff needed to review drug applications with predictable timeframes.
For many new drugs treating serious medical conditions, the statute and
associated funding allow the FDA to perform priority review. Patients
and their families who were waiting for help and hope in the face of
difficult and worrying diagnoses were the great beneficiaries of these
policies. This Committee has advanced reauthorizations of the program
every 5 years since 1992, including most recently in 2022, to help
ensure that critical new, safe, and effective medicines reach American
patients as quickly as possible.
Moreover, when the country has confronted challenges in healthcare,
it has repeatedly looked for ways to spur private sector research,
development, investment, and innovation. For example, when faced with
concerns that diseases affecting smaller patient populations were not
receiving sufficient attention in medical research, Congress enacted
the Orphan Drug Act, which provided incentives such as market
exclusivity and reduced taxes to spur investment in research and
development. According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases,
since the passage of the law, more than 7,000 rare diseases have been
identified and more than 1,100 orphan indications for treatments have
obtained FDA approval. Similarly, when families and pediatricians
identified a need for more pediatric research, this Committee advanced
the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which created an incentive
of additional marketing exclusivity to innovators that voluntarily
complete pediatric clinical studies. When Congress found that federally
funded research grants were producing promising early stage research,
but this research was not being developed into products that benefited
the public, Congress enacted the Bayh-Dole Act, creating a path for
private sector pharmaceutical companies to make the significant
investments required to transform this early stage research into new
medicines with the knowledge that privately developed intellectual
property would be protected.
More recently, when the Nation and the world faced the threat of a
global pandemic, Congress's actions supported the development of
multiple Covid-19 vaccines in an unprecedented timeframe. It is no
coincidence that the three leading vaccines developed most swiftly--
Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson--were ultimately developed by
U.S. companies. That result would not have been possible if the United
States had made different policy choices along the way that stifled
biopharmaceutical companies' investments in researching and developing
innovative treatments and cures.
Against this backdrop, the country again faces policy choices,
particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act. Unfortunately,
that statute diverges from the decades of U.S. policies that helped
create the robust biopharmaceutical industry that the Nation and its
patients have come to expect. Instead of adhering to those principles
and ensuring that companies that invest and succeed in discovering and
developing innovative new treatments that benefit patients receive
appropriate and time-limited protections for their innovations, the IRA
forces Johnson & Johnson and other manufacturers to provide innovative,
patent-protected inventions to the government on pricing terms that, by
law, must be significantly below market-based prices. As a result, the
IRA's pricing provisions will constrain medical innovation, limit
patient access and choice, and negatively affect the overall quality of
patient care. For that reason, last summer, Johnson & Johnson filed a
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the statute, as did every
other manufacturer with a drug subject to the IRA's pricing provisions.
We recognize that not everyone agrees with our decision to challenge
the law. That is their right, just as it is our right to challenge in
court a law that we believe violates the Constitution, upends decades
of U.S. policies that have made the United States the center of medical
innovation, and will inflict long-lasting damage to the American people
by discouraging investment in future innovations.
The unique strengths of the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry, driven
by decades of U.S. policies specifically designed to foster the growth
of that industry in order to support patients, are also the reason that
comparisons between U.S. drug prices and prices abroad are particularly
inapt. The United States is unique in the world in the policy choices
it has made to spur innovation and invention. Although it is true that
there are certain disadvantages associated with these policy choices,
including that the United States pays a disproportionate share of the
costs of such innovation, the upsides far outweigh the downsides.
Americans access new medicines years earlier than other nations,
including other wealthy nations, and sometimes have access to medicines
that are never available at all in other countries. One study found
that patients in Europe wait 2 years longer, on average, for new cancer
treatments than patients in the United States. Fully 85 percent of new
medicines are available in the United States, more than any other
country. New medicines launch first and fastest, on average, in the
United States compared to other G20 countries. Where Germany, France,
and the United Kingdom, on average, face delays between 11 and 20
months to access new medicines, new drugs are available in the United
States within 4 months of global launch, on average.
Finally, much of the debate about drug pricing outside the United
States uses deceptively selected figures that do not reflect the true
nature of drug pricing in the United States and abroad. For example,
some critics ignore that about 90 percent of prescriptions in the
United States are filled with generic drugs and biosimilars that are
often cheaper in the United States than abroad. Lower cost generic
drugs and biosimilars are enabled by the research and development of
innovative drugs, and as a result of this framework, the United States
spends roughly the same share of healthcare spending on medicines as
other countries, on average. Additionally, some critics compare U.S.
list prices of drugs--which do not reflect the discounts and rebates
provided to middlemen--to the prices charged abroad.
Johnson & Johnson supports solutions to address affordability and
access to our innovative therapies. Imposing arbitrary price
constraints on U.S. drug manufacturers, however, will harm innovation
and deprive American patients of life-saving and life-extending
therapies.
On behalf of the dedicated Johnson & Johnson employees around the
world who work tirelessly to bring innovative medicines to patients in
need, thank you for the opportunity to engage in today's discussion. I
look forward to your questions and comments.
______
The Chair. Thank you very much, Mr. Duato. Our next witness
will be Robert Davis, Chairman and CEO of Merck.
Mr. Davis has served as Merck's Chairman since December
2022 and CEO since 2021. Thank you very much, Mr. Davis, for
being here.
STATEMENT OF ROBERT DAVIS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MERCK,
RAHWAY, NJ
Mr. Davis. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be
here with you today.
As the CEO of Merck, I am here to offer concrete policy
suggestions to address the barriers American patients may
encounter as they attempt to access our medicines and the
current pricing system, while also ensuring Merck may discover
and develop the next generation of lifesaving medicines and
vaccines.
Based in Rockaway, New Jersey, our company is one of the
world's most advanced, research intensive biopharmaceutical
companies--an organization at the forefront of providing
innovative health solutions that advance the prevention and
treatment of disease in people and animals.
I have worked in the health care industry for the entirety
of my 34 year career. I joined Merck 10 years ago in large
measure because the company was on the precipice of its first
approval for KEYTRUDA, a revolutionary oncology treatment.
At the time, people close to me were battling cancer, and
unfortunately, they were not able to benefit from this amazing
discovery. Following that first approval, Merck has
demonstrated the efficacy of KEYTRUDA in 39 indications and
reached nearly 2 million patients, with many of the most
widespread cancers afflicting Americans.
The impact of KEYTRUDA and other recent advances is
difficult to overstate. With a recent American Cancer Society
report finding that cancer mortality in the United States has
fallen 33 percent from 1991 to 2021, representing an estimated
4 million Americans whose deaths have been averted, and our
work continues as we advanced KEYTRUDA into even more tumor
types and earlier stages of cancer.
Remarkable progress like this does not come cheaply. For
KEYTRUDA alone, between 2011 and 2023, Merck has invested $46
billion in development, and we expect to invest another $18
billion into the 2030's.
Oncology is just one of Merck's many areas of discovery.
Right now, we have nearly 20,000 researchers seeking
breakthrough treatments for immune disorders, infectious
diseases, Alzheimer's, and other ailments threatening the
health of millions of people.
To advance this critical work, we have invested more than
$159 billion in R&D since 2010, including $30 billion in 2023
alone, and have invested more than $10 billion in capital in
the form of both investments in manufacturing and R&D over the
last 5 years in the United States, creating more jobs for
Americans.
We do not hesitate to make these investments because they
are necessary to further Merck's mission to serve patients. At
the same time, many Americans are struggling to afford health
care, including prescription medicines, and we are eager to
find solutions to these access and affordability challenges.
That is why we supported changes to the Medicare Part D
program to create an out-of-pocket cap that allow beneficiaries
to pay their cost over time. We have also publicly disclosed
our U.S. pricing data, including the average rebates and
discounts we provide.
In addition, we offer coupons and support a patient
assistance program for those who cannot afford the medications
they need. In the past 5 years, this program has helped nearly
800,000 patients to obtain Merck products free of charge, with
an estimated value of $7.8 billion.
But the reality is that Merck's efforts alone are far from
sufficient. They do not and cannot address the underlying
systemic and structural issues underpinning our system. As more
power and control has been concentrated into the ever smaller
number of vertically consolidated players, their negotiating
strength has increased dramatically.
In contracting with them, Merck continues to experience
increasing pressure to provide even larger discounts, and the
gap between list and net price continues to grow. And patients
are not benefiting from the steep discounts we provide.
These problems could be addressed if other actors' revenue
streams were de-linked from list prices, thereby removing
incentives for the system to favor high list prices. This would
also ensure that less value in the system flows to these
middlemen who do not create these medicines, who do not
discover, or develop, or manufacture them.
In addition, the substantial savings provided by Merck and
other manufacturers should be required to be passed through to
patients to lower their out-of-pocket costs. We firmly believe
that reforms like these will create a drug pricing system that
incentivizes the discovery of new and important medicines,
while at the same time ensuring patients can afford those
lifesaving medicines and innovations.
Future treatment breakthroughs hinge on what we do now. We
must hold on to a U.S. pharmaceutical market that is free,
competitive, and predictable. One that encourages and rewards
investment, one that drives the American economy and creates
jobs, and one that continues to deliver innovation and new
treatment discoveries.
I am here today to pledge our support and cooperation in
these efforts. Thank you for your time and your consideration
of these important perspectives.

prepared statement of robert davis
Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here with you today.
As the CEO of Merck, I am here to share the steps we are taking to
ensure that American patients can afford our medicines, explain the
barriers to our efforts that we encounter in the current pricing and
access system, and offer concrete policy suggestions to both address
these barriers and ensure our Country continues to have the world's
best climate for pharmaceutical innovation, so that Merck may discover
and develop our next generation of lifesaving medicines and vaccines.
On behalf of everyone at Merck, I want to thank you for your
interest in working to ensure that safe and effective medicines are
broadly accessible to all Americans who need them. As people who go to
work each day to help protect and improve the health of others, my
Merck colleagues and I share your desire to make today's medicines more
widely available--even as we work to discover tomorrow's best
treatments.
At Merck, our mission is to use the power of leading-edge science
to save and improve lives around the world. We develop and bring
forward breakthrough medicines and vaccines and then make those
treatments available to patients in the United States and worldwide.
Based in Rahway, New Jersey, our company is one of the world's most
advanced research-intensive biopharmaceutical companies, an
organization at the forefront of providing innovative health solutions
that advance the prevention and treatment of disease in people and
animals.
With a focus on scientific discovery, our company exists to help
solve the world's toughest medical challenges. Indeed, we have a long
history of taking on urgent health needs, stretching back more than 130
years to Merck's founding in 1891. Over the decades, Merck has
developed essential childhood vaccines; introduced the first protease
inhibitor, which helped transform AIDS from a death sentence to a
chronic disease; and developed the first statin, markedly reducing the
negative health impacts of high cholesterol.
Merck's groundbreaking work on the treatment and prevention of cancer
Today, our journey of discovery continues. I have worked in the
health care industry for the entirety of my 34-year career. I joined
Merck 10 years ago in large measure because the company was on the
precipice of its first approval for Keytruda, a novel programmed death
receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor that had shown effectiveness in preventing
cancer cells from suppressing the immune system. At the time, people
close to me were battling cancer, and, unfortunately, they did not live
long enough to benefit from this amazing discovery.
Following that first approval, Merck has demonstrated the efficacy
of Keytruda in 39 indications, in 17 tumor types and 2 tumor-agnostic
indications, and reached nearly 2 million patients battling many of the
most widespread cancers afflicting Americans: non-small cell lung
cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. The
impact of Keytruda and other recent treatment advances is difficult to
overstate, with a recent American Cancer Society report finding that
cancer mortality in the United States has fallen 33 percent from 1991
to 2021, representing an estimated 4 million Americans whose deaths
have been averted. \1\ And our work continues, as we advance Keytruda
into even more tumor types and earlier stages of cancer.

Merck's breakthrough contributions in vaccine development have also
played a critical role in the prevention of cancer. Our product
Gardasil is the first-ever vaccine to guard against the human
papillomavirus (HPV) that is the leading cause of nearly all cases of
cervical cancer, which is the fourth most common cancer among women
globally. A study of real world evidence published in the New England
Journal of Medicine looking at Swedish girls and women between 10 and
30 years of age found a substantially reduced risk of invasive cervical
cancer among those who had been fully vaccinated with Gardasil. \2\ The
American Cancer Society report found similar transformative public
health outcomes in the United States, with a 65 percent decrease in
cervical cancer rates in women in their early 20's, following the
widespread adoption of HPV vaccines in the United States. \3\

These remarkable advances, and the others we are making in our many
other oncology programs, have not come cheaply. Taking just Keytruda as
an example, between 2011, when our focused Keytruda research program
began, and 2023, Merck has invested $30 billion in our own internal
clinical development efforts, $14 billion in research collaborations
and acquisitions to further the study of Keytruda with other compounds,
and $2 billion in capital expenditures to scale up our processes and
facilities to manufacture the drug in large quantities. And we expect
to invest another $18 billion in Keytruda clinical studies into the
2030's. This is likely now the largest and costliest pharmaceutical
research and development program ever undertaken. Over 2,200 clinical
trials have been publicly disclosed to study Keytruda alone and in
conjunction with other compounds in pursuit of new lifesaving and life-
extending applications for this revolutionary medicine.
Merck's substantial investments across our research and manufacturing
efforts
Oncology is just one of Merck's many intense areas of discovery and
development. Right now, we have nearly 20,000 researchers seeking
breakthrough treatments for immune disorders, infectious diseases,
Alzheimer's, cardiometabolic disease, and other ailments threatening
the health of millions of people. To advance their critical work, we
have invested more than $159 billion in research and development since
2010, including $30 billion in 2023 alone.
In support of these and other efforts, we are also making
infrastructure investments, many of which are here in the United
States. In fact, over the past 5 years, Merck has made capital
investments across the United States totaling more than $10 billion,
increasing our domestic capacity for R&D and manufacturing while
creating hundreds of new jobs in our U.S. operations. For example,
we've invested $3.6 billion in our Pennsylvania facilities since 2018,
with plans to invest another $700 million this year. And in the past 5
years, we have invested $1.4 billion in our manufacturing facility in
Elkton, Virginia--about 2 hours from here--to increase domestic
production capacity for our Gardasil HPV vaccine.
We do not hesitate to make these investments because they are
necessary to further Merck's mission: to serve patients--and not just
the patients of today, but those who will need the new treatments and
cures we have yet to discover. But we know that many Americans are
struggling to afford health care, including prescription medicines,
despite the best efforts of leaders in government, industry, academia,
and the nonprofit community. Even though medicine costs are growing at
the slowest rate in years, thanks in part to market competition,
patients are too often being asked to pay more out-of-pocket for their
medicines. And for some, that burden is simply too much to bear. As has
often been observed, a lifesaving drug is not effective if the patient
who needs that drug cannot afford it.
Thus, I am here today to share our perspective about the structural
elements in our Country's complex system of pricing, distribution, and
insurance that have impeded Merck's efforts to bring our medicines to
the American patients who need them. And I would humbly ask for your
help and partnership in addressing these obstacles.
Merck's efforts to address patient access challenges
Merck has worked hard to help patients overcome access and
affordability challenges. That work continues. We believe our company
and our industry have a duty to act responsibly in our pricing
practices and contribute to affordability solutions. That is why we
supported changes to the Medicare Part D program to create an out-of-
pocket cap and allow beneficiaries to pay their costs over time. And we
have a history and heritage of responsible pricing. We are also
committed to transparency in our pricing practices. Merck publicly
discloses U.S. pricing data, including the average rebates and
discounts we provide across our U.S. product portfolio to payers such
as insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and the
government.
We also have programs designed to help patients who cannot afford
their medicines. To reduce patient out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy
counter, we provide coupons and other co-pay assistance for our
products. Last year the value of this aid totaled $130 million. And
through our support of a separate charitable organization that
administers our patient assistance program, we provide free medicines
to Americans of limited means who do not have insurance coverage or
have some other hardship and cannot otherwise obtain their prescribed
medications. In the past 5 years, this program has helped nearly
800,000 patients to obtain Merck medicines or vaccines free of charge,
with an estimated value of $7.8 billion.
Structural challenges and Merck's suggested improvements for the U.S.
system
But the reality is that Merck's efforts alone are far from
sufficient. They do not and cannot address the underlying systemic and
structural issues underpinning our system, which do not allow patients
to benefit from the substantial discounts that manufacturers are
providing on the medications they sell.
As more power and control has been consolidated into an ever-
smaller number of vertically consolidated players, their negotiating
strength has increased dramatically. In Merck's efforts to contract
with them, we continue to experience increasing pressure to provide
even larger discounts, and the gap between list and net price continues
to grow. But patients are not benefiting from the discounts being
negotiated by PBMs. Instead, their insurers often base their cost-
sharing on the list price, even when PBMs and insurance companies are
paying a heavily discounted fraction of that price.
Our diabetes treatment Januvia is a great example of this
phenomenon. Today, the weighted average net price for Januvia
represents a 90 percent discount off its list price; with the price of
Januvia being 33 percent lower than its price when we launched it in
2006. This is, in part, a result of significant discounts and rebates
in a highly competitive market over the years. But these discounts and
rebates are not being passed along to patients in a way that reduces
their out-of-pocket costs.
Simply reducing our list prices is not a solution because patients
often experience reduced access to their drugs when they are either not
included on or are dropped from PBM and plan formularies. For example,
in 2016, Merck introduced our Hepatitis C medicine, Zepatier, at a list
price 42 percent below that of the standard of care at the time. Yet,
we had difficulty getting plans and PBMs to add the product to their
formularies. The situation did not improve in July 2018, when we
further reduced the list price by 60 percent and found no increased
uptake. More recent efforts by other manufacturers to offer products
with lower lists prices have resulted in similarly poor PBM and plan
coverage compared to their high list price competitors. Thus, lower
list prices can result in reduced access for patients.
Rather than passing the steep savings they obtain through to
patients to lower their out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, we
understand that insurance plans retain them to cover overhead costs and
reduce insurance premiums for all their insureds. When they do this,
rather than reducing medicine costs for those that need them, it means
sick people end up effectively subsidizing healthy people. This dynamic
is contrary to the basic idea of insurance, which should use the
premiums of healthy people to help fund the care of those who are
struggling. This is yet another way in which our current system is
fundamentally flawed.
From 2010 through 2023, Merck's annual average net price increase
across our U.S. portfolio has been in the low-to mid-single digits. In
2017, our average net price actually declined nearly 2 percent. In
2022, the average discount for our medicines and vaccines was 40
percent off the list price. This money is flowing in part to middlemen,
not to the innovative manufacturers that would reinvest that money to
find tomorrow's cures. And, by and large, patients did not receive the
financial benefits of these substantial discounts. Instead, their out-
of-pocket costs continue to rise.
Though the issues I have described are complex and impossible for
one company--or even the pharmaceutical industry collectively--to
address, legislative solutions may not be difficult to implement. If
Congress were to require that other actors' revenue streams be delinked
from the list price of a medicine, it would remove incentives for the
system to favor high list prices. This would also ensure that less of
the value in the system flows to these middlemen, who did not discover,
develop, or produce the medicines for which they contract.
Another critically important fix is to require that the substantial
savings provided by Merck and other manufacturers be passed through to
patients to lower their out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter,
rather than allowing insurance plans to retain them. Reforms like these
are necessary and will help provide long-term solutions for patients'
out-of-pocket costs and ensure they can take advantage of the full
breadth of innovative medicines available to keep them healthy and
alleviate their suffering.
We firmly believe that it is possible to have a drug pricing system
that incentivizes the discovery of new and important medicines and at
the same time ensures patients can afford those lifesaving innovations.
But reform of our current system is desperately needed to ensure that
patients in the United States continue to have the greatest access, to
the best medicines, faster than anywhere else in the world. I would
encourage you to support legislative or administrative remedies that
would address these systemic problems.
Fostering innovation alongside patient access solutions
These are exciting times in the biopharmaceutical industry and the
wider world of health care. Decades of research investment are
producing discoveries of increasing promise and impact. Life-
threatening diseases like cancer are being conquered. Patients are
living longer, healthier lives, even with serious conditions.
But let me be very clear: today's investments drive tomorrow's
discoveries of breakthrough treatments. If we disrupt an ecosystem that
incentivizes robust investments in research, we put at risk not only
the foundation of American leadership in pharmaceutical development but
also the health and lives of countless people who would have benefited
from future discoveries.
We do not have to go down that path. In fact, we have examples of
efforts that are already working. For instance, the Medicare Part D
program facilitates actual negotiation, effectively holding down costs
and broadening patient access without threatening to injure or destroy
the innovation ecosystem that fosters future treatment breakthroughs.
The most important positive contributions Merck makes in the
world--impacting economies, health care systems, and the well-being of
countless patients and their families--are pharmaceutical innovations
that save and improve lives. Achieving such innovations requires us to
invest billions of dollars a year in the often unsung work of thousands
of brilliant researchers sitting at lab benches and striving, with all
they have, to create transformative breakthroughs.
The odds are stacked against these scientists, but they keep
trying, and we keep investing. Even with all the advantages of modern
technology, discoveries are few and far between. And, even among those
discoveries that spark clinical trials, nine out of ten compounds will
fail.
Of course, our Country needs to contain health care costs and
reduce out-of-pocket costs to patients. And Merck is committed to being
part of the solution. But we must pursue greater affordability and
accessibility for medicines--and health care more broadly--in ways that
preserve and strengthen our innovation ecosystem across academia,
smaller biotech firms, larger pharmaceutical companies, government
agencies, insurers, providers, and other stakeholders.
Ultimately, I believe we need to work together across these
stakeholders to overcome the access and affordability challenges faced
by today's patients without damaging our ability to innovate and
discover new treatments for tomorrow's patients. Future treatment
breakthroughs hinge on what we do now. We must hold onto a U.S.
pharmaceutical market that is free, competitive, and predictable, one
that encourages and rewards investment, one that drives the American
economy and creates jobs, and one that continues to deliver innovation
and new treatment discoveries.
I am here today to pledge our support and cooperation in this
effort and other measures to help Americans live longer, healthier
lives with improved access to effective and affordable drug treatments,
and in ways that protect incentives for future innovation.
Thank you for your time and your consideration of these
perspectives, and thank you again for the opportunity to share them
with you today.

Summary
Merck's mission is to use the power of leading-edge science to save
and improve lives around the world.
Merck conducts groundbreaking work to treat and prevent cancer.
Keytruda treats cancer in 39 indications, including 17 tumor types
and 2 tumor-agnostic indications.
Since 2011, Merck has invested: $30 billion in
internal clinical development; $14 billion in research
collaborations and acquisitions; $2 billion in capital
expenditures for Keytruda alone.
We expect to invest another $18 billion in clinical
studies into the 2030's.
Merck has made substantial investments across our research and
manufacturing efforts.
Merck is making infrastructure investments in the United States. In
the past 5 years we invested:
$3.6 billion in Pennsylvania, with an additional $700
million expected this year.
$1.4 billion in Elkton, Virginia.
More than $10 billion total across the United States,
creating hundreds of new jobs.
Merck works to address patient access challenges.
We have a duty to act responsibly in pricing practices and
contribute to affordability solutions. We:
Supported changes to the Medicare Part D program to
create an out-of-pocket cap and to allow beneficiaries to pay
their costs over time.
Publicly disclose U.S. pricing data, including the
average rebates and discounts we provide.
Provide coupons and other co-pay assistance for our
products, totaling $130 million last year.
Created a patient assistance program providing nearly
800,000 people with an estimated value of $7.8 billion.
Structural challenges increase prices for patients.
The savings Merck provides to PBMs and insurers are not passed on
to patients.
Payors retain the savings to cover overhead and
reduce insurance premiums for their insured.
Sick people end up effectively subsidizing the
healthy, contrary to the basic idea of insurance.
When list prices are reduced, medicines are dropped
from formularies, limiting patient access.
Merck has a history of cost reductions.
From 2010 through 2023, Merck's annual average net
price increase across our U.S. portfolio has been in the low-to
mid-single digits.
In 2017, our average net price actually declined
nearly 2 percent.
In 2022, the average discount for our medicines and
vaccines was 40 percent off the list price.
Unfortunately, middlemen absorbed some of the
benefits from this price reduction--benefits that should have
gone to patients.
Merck urges Congress to consider the following solutions:
Require that other actors' revenue streams be
delinked from the list price of a medicine, which would reduce
incentives for the system to favor high list prices.
Require that substantial savings provided by Merck
and other manufactures be passed through to patients to lower
their out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, rather than
allowing insurance plans to retain them.

The Chair. Thank you very much, Mr. Davis. Our third
witness will be Chris Boerner, CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Dr.
Boerner has served as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb since
November 2023. Thanks for being here, Mr. Boerner.
STATEMENT OF CHRIS BOERNER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BRISTOL
MYERS SQUIBB, PRINCETON, NJ
Mr. Boerner. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and
Members of the Committee, thank you for having me here today. I
am proud to be representing Bristol-Myers Squibb, an American
company that is committed to transforming patients' lives
through science.
I have spent more than 20 years in this industry, the
majority in smaller, science driven biotechnology companies. I
joined BMS because we have a similar focus on driving leading
edge scientific innovation, and our scale allows us to bring
more medicines to more patients faster.
To help illustrate the type of work that we have been doing
for more than 150 years at BMS, let me provide two
illustrations of how our innovative medicines have helped
patients and provided tangible benefits to society. Our work in
HIV/AIDS transformed this disease from a death sentence into a
chronic condition.
Similarly, our pioneering immuno-oncology treatments,
OPDIVO and YERVOY, harness the body's immune system to fight
cancer and have contributed significantly to improved outcomes
across a number of tumors, including metastatic melanoma, where
the combination of these two medicines has changed the median
life expectancy from less than 9 months to over 6 years. I am
proud that our record of innovation continues today.
We have invested more than $65 billion in research and
development over the past decade. This has resulted in truly
novel and transformational medicines, like Camzyos in
cardiovascular disease, our cell therapy platform in cancer,
and we are working toward bringing to patients the first
medicine for the treatment of schizophrenia in 30 years.
These medicines are but a few examples of the innovation
that results from an American health care system that not only
accounts for the majority of new medicines launched each year,
but also one that delivers those medicines to U.S. patients
faster than anywhere else in the world. This isn't by chance.
The United States has built a health care system that
prioritizes patient and physician choice, as well as the broad
and rapid availability of cutting edge medicines. This is in
stark contrast to many systems outside of the United States,
which while they may deliver lower prices, carry an often
overlooked tradeoff, that patients often wait longer for new
medicines that are sometimes never approved or reimbursed.
For example, Canadian patients have access to approximately
half of the medicines available in the United States, and
patients in other countries face a similar reality. Despite its
benefits, we know our American system is far from perfect.
Patients bear the brunt of a complex U.S. system that
results in increasing health care costs and a lack of
affordability. We have to make the system work better for them.
After all, innovation that does not make it to patients is no
innovation at all.
While prescription medicines account for a relatively small
portion of overall health care spending, we believe we have an
important role to play in prioritizing the development of
medicines that will bring savings to the health care system,
and as an industry, we should set a higher bar for doing just
that.
Similarly, we have a role to play in addressing
affordability and stand ready to partner with Congress and
others to address this issue for patients in a holistic manner.
But in developing those solutions, we should not abandon our
system for one that denies U.S. patients the broad and rapid
access to vital medicines that they appreciate today.
We support policies that lower patient out-of-pocket costs
without ultimately harming innovation. The need to strike this
balance should not be abstract. I expect many of us in this
room have lost a loved one to cancer or another devastating
disease.
In my case, it was one of my best friends and it happened
as he awaited a medicine that I believe could have saved his
life. This is an almost daily reminder to me that making
patients wait for weeks, months, or years can be the difference
between life and death.
Thank you again for having me here today. On behalf of BMS
and the more than 30,000 employees who share my passion for
delivering new medicines for patients, I look forward to
answering your questions.

prepared statement of chris boerner
Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of
Bristol Myers Squibb (``BMS''). I appreciate the chance to speak about
BMS's groundbreaking work and efforts to enhance access to our
innovative medicines for patients. I am proud to testify on behalf of a
company that is committed to transforming patients' lives through
science.
At BMS, our mission is to discover, develop, and deliver medicines
that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Our record of
innovation has changed the outlook for countless patients.
Groundbreaking BMS therapies helped transform HIV/AIDS from a death
sentence into a chronic condition. Today, our medicines allow people
with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders to live
longer and healthier lives.
We are not content, however, to rest on our more than 150-year
legacy of scientific innovation and are dedicated to developing the
next generation of breakthroughs. We are pushing the boundaries of
science to treat debilitating diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's,
and multiple sclerosis, where unmet needs remain. As we look ahead, we
are focused on introducing novel treatments in areas we know best:
oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular disease, and
neuroscience.
We are also focused on increasing access to our medicines. Patients
in the United States get new medicines sooner than any other country in
the world. That's a significant benefit. But we recognize that patients
must be able to afford our medicines to achieve the clinical outcomes
those medicines bring. BMS has long worked to enhance access to our
innovative medicines for patients, while maintaining an environment
that enables investments in cutting-edge science to deliver life-
changing treatments, and we remain committed to working with Congress
to do so.
Our commitment reaches beyond our medicines. BMS supports programs,
initiatives, and organizations that improve health, broaden research
opportunities, bolster STEM education, and bring essential human
services to our communities. We also promote health equity and strive
to increase access to life-saving medicines for populations
disproportionately affected by serious diseases. From 2020 to 2023, BMS
provided more than $118 million in grants and donations to non-profit
organizations and independent medical educational partners for more
than 750 health equity projects.
Having spent more than two decades in the biopharmaceutical
industry, I joined BMS 9 years ago because of its dedication to
improving the lives of patients. I became CEO in November 2023 and am
honored to be leading this great company through its next chapter.
During my tenure, I have developed a deep admiration and respect
for the over 30,000 dedicated BMS employees in the United States and
around the world who harness their intellect, expertise, hard work, and
passion on behalf of the patients we serve. From our scientists in the
lab, to our manufacturing teams in our facilities, to our patient
outreach teams in the field, I am proud to work alongside my BMS
colleagues, who are dedicated to creating and delivering life-changing
medicines to patients in need.
BMS's Emphasis on Expanding Patient Access
The United States has built a healthcare system that prioritizes
the important role of patient choice and broad, rapid availability of
cutting-edge medicines. Patients and their physicians in this country
have access to more unique medicines than in any other country. This
access is critically important because different medicines can have
different side effects or safety profiles, different mechanisms of
action, and different efficacies at stages of disease, such that the
leading or most obvious therapy may not be the most appropriate. By
providing physicians in the United States with more options, we give
them the ability to choose the best treatment for their patients and
offer potentially better outcomes.
Despite the many benefits of the United States system, we
acknowledge that patient affordability is a significant issue. It is
also one of the least understood. The United States has a unique and
complex healthcare landscape, replete with conflicting pressures and
perverse incentives driving the system. Many of these factors exert
strong influence on patient access and the price patients actually pay
for their medicines.
Manufacturers give significant rebates, discounts, and payments to
intermediaries between us and patients in the pharmaceutical supply
chain. BMS has provided these intermediaries with over $96 billion
dollars of rebates, price concessions, and other discounts and fees
over the last 5 years across our portfolio. But patients are not seeing
the financial benefits of the sizable discounts because intermediaries
are not required to pass on discounts to patients when they fill their
prescriptions at the pharmacy counter.
Additionally, the United States healthcare system has not yet
evolved to account for the economic benefits of highly specialized
innovative medicines that contribute substantial value to patients and
the system. For example, a patient on the right medicine may avoid
serious or life-threatening medical interventions. This in turn also
provides cost savings to the healthcare system by reducing expensive
and high-burden hospital stays and conserving capacity.
We share your concerns about what patients pay for prescription
medications, and we appreciate your work to examine this key public
policy issue. It is our collective--and critical---- responsibility to
ensure that patients receive the medicines they need. BMS invests
billions in patient support programs with that objective in mind.
Although patient support programs are an imperfect solution to these
challenges, I am proud of our efforts to help patients access our
medicines. Over the past 5 years, we have spent more than $2.5 billion
on copayment assistance for commercially insured patients, helping
patients receive medicines such as Eliquis, which treats and prevents
blood clots. We broadened our existing patient support programs to help
eligible patients in the United States without health insurance due to
pandemic-related job loss.
We also contribute to organizations that help support patients in
need. For instance, over the last 5 years, BMS donated over $12 billion
in free medicines to the Bristol Myers Squibb Patient Assistance
Foundation. The Foundation is an independent organization that promotes
health equity and improved health outcomes for populations
disproportionately affected by serious diseases. It supports community-
based programs that promote cancer awareness, screening, and care among
high-risk populations. In addition, BMS made cash donations to
independent charitable organizations to support patients in the United
States.
BMS also supports comprehensive efforts across the continuum of
care, including projects to train community health workers and patient
navigators to help underserved patients navigate the healthcare system.
In March 2023, we announced $10 million in grants to be made that year
to 17 United States organizations that address social determinants of
health. These grants support organizations striving to improve health
in the United States, including through healthcare access and literacy
and by integrating social care and healthcare to reduce health
disparities.
BMS's Commitment to Bringing More Innovative Medicines to Patients
Through Research and Development
We are proud to have a promising pipeline of innovative medicines
that will allow us to continue delivering cutting-edge treatments to
patients. BMS is investing in leading scientific programs, including in
our core areas of oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular
disease, and neuroscience. Over the past 10 years, BMS devoted over $65
billion--more than 21 percent of our total revenue--to research and
development (``R&D''). \1\ In 2022, we conducted more than 460 clinical
trials.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Based on non-GAAP calculations.
In fact, our investment in R&D as a percentage of total revenue
consistently ranks among the highest of any large company in any
industry globally. In the 2023 EU Industrial Research and Development
Investment Scoreboard, BMS ranked 15th for total R&D spending among all
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
companies worldwide.
Our investment in R&D has resulted in vastly improved outcomes for
patients. For example, BMS is a pioneer in the field of immuno-oncology
through the development of three medicines: Yervoy, Opdivo, and
Opdualag. Prior to the development and introduction of immuno-oncology
treatments for metastatic melanoma, outcomes were generally quite poor,
with a median life expectancy of only 6 to 9 months after diagnosis.
Today, thanks to these therapies, survival rates have significantly
improved among patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow-up
studies have demonstrated a median life expectancy of over 6 years with
the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy.
Our investment of over $65 billion in R&D over the past decade is
fueling the next wave of new treatments for areas of high unmet need.
Our R&D pipeline includes potential treatments across a range of
platforms, including those that harness the frontiers of genomics to
translate that knowledge into gene therapies, cell therapies, RNA
oligonucleotides, and other novel modalities. With our CAR T cell
therapies, for example, we can now target cancer with a type of
immunotherapy that works with a patient's own immune system by
reprogramming their T cells. With a single treatment, CAR T cell
therapy has been effective at producing durable responses in patients
where other treatment options stopped working. BMS is the only company
with two cell therapies approved against two distinct targets, and we
are pursuing opportunities to bring them to more patients who may
benefit.
Overall, we have more than 45 novel compounds in development, with
more than 40 disease areas under study. We are conducting late-stage
studies for medications to treat various solid tumors, multiple
myeloma, Crohn's disease, lupus, and atrial fibrillation. And we are
leveraging our expertise in protein homeostasis, immunology, and
inflammation to tackle neurological and neuromuscular diseases with new
approaches.
Our R&D efforts are not limited to discovering new compounds. We
are constantly researching how we can use existing products to provide
additional benefits to more patients through new indications and
formulations. We are currently running and partnering with other
innovators in more than 15 late-stage studies involving existing
products.
Our commitment to innovation and to patients also includes
establishing strategic partnerships with other biotechnology leaders
and acquiring companies that benefit from our global scale and
expertise to bring medicines to patients faster. We offer deep
scientific leadership, resources, and abilities to invest in research
and development programs and highly developed commercial,
manufacturing, and supply chain operations. This global scale and range
of expertise enables us to reach the greatest number of patients
worldwide. Our recently announced plans to acquire RayzeBio and Karuna
Therapeutics demonstrate this commitment. We are excited about the
potential of Karuna's KarXT, a late-stage developmental medicine with a
novel mechanism of action aimed at schizophrenia and other
psychological disorders. If approved, KarXT would represent the first
new pharmacological approach to treating schizophrenia in several
decades.
R&D is complex and resource-intensive, often lasting 14 years or
more for a particular compound. Results are far from guaranteed. In
fact, the majority of our R&D efforts do not result in a medicine that
we can deliver to patients. For instance, last year we had to
discontinue two late-stage clinical trials into which we had invested
multiple years and many millions of dollars. One was a phase-three
trial that evaluated one of our existing medicines, Opdualag, for
treating colorectal cancer. We invested more than $80 million and
devoted thousands of hours of employee time to this research, which
ultimately failed. In another case, after more than 6 years of
research, we had to end a study evaluating a combination of our
medicines, Opdivo and Yervoy, for advanced treatment of renal cell
carcinoma. We invested over $130 million in that study alone.
Because we pursue a wide range of possibilities on the cutting edge
of science, we know that some of our research will not culminate in new
treatments. Failures are an inevitable part of the process by which we
develop new treatments, and we learn from them along the way. Our
successes allow us to try. Those successes are a critical engine in our
ability to continue to invest in new medicines, allowing the United
States to lead the world in bringing new treatments to patients.
The Disadvantages of International Pricing Systems
Rules and regulations regarding the pricing of medicines vary
widely by country. Some countries, such as Canada, the U.K., Germany,
France, and Japan, essentially allow the government to set
pharmaceutical prices. In effect, governments in those countries make
choices for patients--choices that often result in patients having
access to fewer innovative medicines, and waiting much longer for new
medicines as compared to patients in the United States. These delays
can be attributed to a variety of factors, including waiting for the
government to complete reimbursement assessments, challenges with
subpopulation coverage, or a failure to appropriately value innovation.
In Canada and most European Union countries, the government
regulates the pricing of a new medicine at launch through some
combination of clinical and economic assessments, price negotiations,
and international reference pricing. Prices are often reevaluated and
further controlled after a medication has been introduced. Patients pay
a significant price for these pricing schemes in the form of delays to
access. For example, only about 45 percent of new medicines available
globally have been introduced in Canada--compared to 85 percent in the
United States. In France, Italy, and Japan, this figure is below 55
percent. The United States launched 94 percent of new cancer medicines
from 2012 through 2021, while the same figure for the average OECD
country was 49 percent. These figures are startling, reflecting
dramatic differences in access to medicines around the world.
Patients outside the United States also often face longer wait
times and obstacles before getting the medicines they need. According
to a report published last week by the United States Department of
Health and Human Services, medicines launch in the United States an
average of 1 year before they launch in other major OECD markets. Other
studies found that on average, there is an 11-month delay from a
medicine's first launch globally to its availability and reimbursement
in Germany, a 17-month delay in Japan, a 27-month delay in the U.K.,
and a staggering 52-month delay in Canada. Patients with multiple
myeloma in the U.K. waited 4 years after the United States launch for
BMS's medicine, Revlimid--a medicine that significantly improves
outcomes. Canadian patients did not gain access to Opdivo and Yervoy
for melanoma until more than 3.5 years after patients in the United
States. Patients in Spain, Japan, Denmark, Australia, and other
countries are still waiting for access to Camzyos, the first new
treatment in decades for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which
was approved in the United States in 2022.
By contrast, the United States is generally first in the world for
launching new medicines, and patients usually benefit from access to
new medicines within days of regulatory approval. The United States
healthcare system has allowed Americans to have access to more new
innovative medicines sooner than any other country.
This access generally translates into better outcomes to save and
extend lives. For example, while it is challenging to precisely
quantify and compare across different countries the impact of delayed
access to anticancer therapy on survival outcomes, there is broad
agreement that prompt access to effective treatments is a fundamental
necessity, and it yields positive outcomes on patients, healthcare
systems, and society in general. These outcomes include: lower
mortality and avoidable deaths; gains in quality of life for patients,
family members, and caregivers; lower healthcare costs; and avoidance
in loss of productive employment for patients and caregivers,
ultimately lowering costs to the national economy.
BMS's Value-Focused Pricing Philosophy
We believe the prices of our medicines should reflect their benefit
to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and society--both at launch
and in future years. Guided by this belief, we price our medicines
based on three primary factors, including aligning to the value of
scientific innovation, investment into research and development, and
our ability to provide rapid and sustainable access for patients, among
other considerations. That means we look at longevity gains, clinical
outcomes, and quality of life, as well as economic impact and
productivity gains generated by a healthy population with more options
to treat illnesses. We also consider our ability to sustain our
research and development investment and to work with payers to secure
access, so patients can have coverage for our medicines when needed.
Our product Eliquis, an oral medicine that inhibits a key blood-
clotting protein, provides a good example of our approach to pricing.
Over the past few years, Eliquis has become the standard of care for
decreasing blood clot formation in patients--it is prescribed millions
of times each year, and is the most prescribed branded medicine in
Medicare Part D. However, it ranked 540th in Medicare spending per
patient in 2021. Eliquis can lower the risk of a stroke and prevent
deep vein thrombosis and embolism, and it is commonly used to prevent
blood clots following certain surgeries. Because Eliquis can help
prevent very serious medical conditions that require hospitalization or
other expensive medical treatments, numerous studies have demonstrated
that Eliquis provides substantial savings to our healthcare system,
such as reduced hospitalization and institutional costs. Without the
benefits of Eliquis, many patients would have substantially worse
medical outcomes, and the healthcare system would face dramatically
higher costs. For every 100,000 patients, we estimate that Eliquis
offers patients and healthcare systems a $4.9 billion consumer surplus
over older, generic products. This value to patients and to the entire
United States healthcare system is reflected in the price of this
medicine.
Path Forward
The United States healthcare system prioritizes patient choice and
access in a way other healthcare systems do not, but it is far from
perfect. The system is mired in complexities and incentives that
frustrate our efforts to meet patients' medical needs. These hurdles
range from complex rebates, to high copays and deductibles, to Federal
rules that restrict our ability to assist patients in Federal
healthcare programs. I welcome the opportunity to work with your
Committee and others in Congress to resolve these issues in our
healthcare system. Ensuring access to medicines involves more than just
the companies that discover and develop them--it requires the active
engagement of the entire ecosystem of governments, payers, healthcare
providers, pharmacies, and hospitals. BMS supports policies that remove
barriers and perverse incentives in the system and focus on patient
out-of-pocket costs. We believe we can do this without harming
innovation. BMS stands ready to work with Congress to address
affordability and eliminate barriers in the system that fail to pass
discounts and rebates to patients, but this cannot be done in a vacuum.
The measures we support include: expanding value-based contracting for
which there are regulatory impediments today; incentivizing competition
and production of biosimilars and generics to ensure a steady supply in
the United States; and passing rebates on to patients at the pharmacy
counter to address the incentives in a complex system that drive up
list prices.
As BMS continues to strive to enhance patient access, we are also
committed to ensuring that we have the resources to fund cutting-edge
R&D and to attract the private capital needed to do so. We also believe
that policymakers should adopt and defend policies that promote
innovation. Government policy should encourage innovators to take big
risks and invest substantial sums, by promising a return on those
efforts for a reasonable period of time. Such policies are the reason
that the United States is a leader globally in medical innovations and
developing new therapies. At BMS, we are eager to continue driving
these efforts.
Again, I am proud to speak here today on behalf of BMS, where we
believe patients in the United States should not be deprived of their
choice to access the best, most recent technologies and advancements in
medicine. I look forward to answering your questions about how we can
meaningfully address healthcare costs and patient access.
______
The Chair. Mr. Boerner, thank you very much. Before I begin
the first round of questions, let me remind our witnesses that
while the HELP Committee does not swear in our witnesses as a
general rule, Federal law at 18 U.S. Code Section 1001
prohibits knowingly and willingly making any fraudulent
statement to the Senate regardless of whether a person is under
oath.
I would also say, in response to many of your testimonies,
we are aware of the many important lifesaving drugs that your
companies have produced, and that is extraordinarily important,
I think, is all of those drugs mean nothing to anybody who
cannot afford it, and that is what we are dealing with today,
that millions and millions of our people cannot afford the
outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in this country.
Now, my time and the time of all of the Members is limited,
so we are going to just--I am going to ask--so my time is
limited, so I am going to start by asking all of you a number
of questions and I would appreciate it if you could respond
with a yes or no answer.
It turns out that a dysfunctional and extraordinarily
expensive healthcare system, hundreds of thousands of Americans
have gone to GoFundMe in order to raise money to pay for their
health care needs and for their prescription drugs.
Let me ask Mr. Davis if I might, have you ever searched on
GoFundMe for your cancer drug, KEYTRUDA?
Mr. Davis. No, I have not.
The Chair. Okay. We have, I and my staff have, and we have
found over 500 stories of people trying to raise funds to pay
for their cancer treatments.
One of those stories is a woman named Rebecca, a school
lunch lady from Nebraska with two kids who died of cancer after
setting up a GoFundMe page because she could not afford to pay
for KEYTRUDA.
Rebecca had raised $4,000 on her GoFundMe page but said the
cost of KEYTRUDA on a cancer treatment was $25,000 for an
infusion every 3 weeks. Mr. Davis, and please yes or no, is it
true that the list price of KEYTRUDA is $191,000 a year in the
United States?
Mr. Davis. That is close to being true, yes.
The Chair. Thank you. Is it true that same exact drug can
be purchased in Canada for $112,000 a year, and $44,000 a year
in Japan?
Mr. Davis. Generally, yes.
The Chair. Mr. Davis, even though the price of KEYTRUDA is
one quarter of the price in Japan compared to the United
States, does your company, does Merck make a profit selling
KEYTRUDA in Japan?
Mr. Davis. We do.
The Chair. What I understand is you make a profit selling
KEYTRUDA in Japan for one quarter of the price that you sell it
for in the United States. My question to you is a pretty simple
one. Will you commit to lowering the price of KEYTRUDA in the
United States to the price of Japan?
Mr. Davis. Well, Senator, I think--first, I acknowledge the
prices in the United States are higher than they are in many of
the countries you said, and not for all drugs, but for many
drugs.
That is the reality we face. But I think it is also
important to point out that you get access in the United States
faster and more than anywhere in the world. We have 39
indications for KEYTRUDA across 17 tumor types in the United
States. If you look across Europe, it is in the 20's.
If you look across Japan, it is in that number or a little
bit less. So, there is a reason why the prices are different,
and we need to be careful because we are also seeing in those
markets that they are unwilling to support the innovation and
we are very hardly--working hard to try to get them to
understand the need to help funding the innovation we have----
The Chair. I apologize for cutting you off.
Mr. Davis. That is fine.
The Chair. There are two other witnesses--but I did want to
make this point.
Again, we all appreciate the breakthrough and important
drugs that you and other companies have produced that save
lives. No debate about that.
But I do want to point out that after all is said and done,
and after all the money we spend on the prescription drugs and
health care in general, the life expectancy in Japan is 9 years
longer than it is in the United States. Senator Cassidy talked
about Canada. Life expectancy in Canada is 6 years longer than
the United States.
Life expectancy in Portugal is 6 years longer. Life
expectancy in the UK is 4 years longer. Let me ask the last
question to Mr. Davis, because I understand that you made $52
million in total compensation in 2022.
Will you commit to not accepting a single dollar more in
compensation until there is not a single GoFundMe page for
KEYTRUDA?
Mr. Davis. Well, I can tell you at Merck we are very much
sensitive to what is happening with patients. That is why we
have very important patient assistance programs.
We commented on the fact that we have over 800,000 patients
benefiting where we provide free drug for those who can't
afford it, as well as other assistance programs that help with
co-pay and other.
We are very committed as a company to doing what we need to
do to try to help alleviate the challenges patients face that
you are focusing on, and that is my focus as the CEO.
The Chair. Thank you. Mr. Boerner with Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Carolyn from Florida says that she cannot afford
ELIQUIS, and so she will, ``stop taking it, though I need it to
prevent the risk of having a stroke.''
Mr. Boerner, again yes and no please, the list price of
ELIQUIS is $7,100 a year in the United States. Dr. Melissa
Barber, an expert at Yale University, has estimated that it
cost just $18 to manufacture a year's supply of ELIQUIS. $7,100
what we pay, $1,800 to manufacture.
Is it true that the same exact drug, ELIQUIS, can be
purchased in Canada for $900 a year?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, that is roughly correct.
The Chair. Let me ask you this, even at 13 percent of the
cost in the United States, does Bristol-Myers make a profit
selling ELIQUIS for $900 a year in Canada?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we do make a profit.
The Chair. All right. So, you are selling the product for
13 percent of what--in Canada of what we pay in the United
States.
Obviously, you sell it there because you make money. So,
Mr. Boerner, will you commit today that Bristol-Myers Squibb
will reduce the list price of ELIQUIS in the United States to
the price that you charge in Canada, where you make a profit?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we can't make that commitment
primarily because the prices in these two countries have very
different systems that prioritize very different things.
In Canada, medicines are generally made less available, and
it takes oftentimes considerably longer for those medicines to
be available. On average, roughly----
The Chair. I apologize--I do apologize. Just life
expectancy in Canada is 6 years longer than it is in the United
States. Mr. Boerner, your company spent over $12 billion on
stock buybacks in 2022. Given that reality, can you tell
Carolyn why you can't lower the price of ELIQUIS?
Mr. Boerner. First, Senator, let me say no patient should
have to go through the types of choices that the patient you
just described go through. It is our commitment to continue to
bring down the price of medicines in the U.S., and I would love
the opportunity to bring down the price of ELIQUIS in the U.S..
Our net price, is what we are compensated, have actually
over the last 5 years declined. At that same time, the list
prices have increased. Why is that? Because of the complexity
of this system and the billions of dollars in rebates that we
have provided to intermediaries that unfortunately do not go to
lowering the price of medicines like the patient you just
described.
The Chair. Again, I apologize. I want to get very briefly
to Mr. Duato, who is with Johnson & Johnson. Mr. Duato, is it
true that the list price of STELARA is $79,000 here in the
U.S.? Is that roughly right?
Mr. Duato. It is roughly right, but it is also true that
the average discount of STELARA in the U.S. is 70 percent.
The Chair. All of that, and we have dealt with PBMs, and we
are going to get to that I am sure in--this morning. Is it true
that while charging $79,000 in the United States, that the
exact same product is sold in Spain for $18,000?
Mr. Duato. I don't know the price in Spain. I can tell you
that the average discount in the U.S. is 70 percent. So, the
price that you quote, it is 30 percent of that.
The Chair. Okay. Mr. Duato, is it true that it costs less
than $15 a year to manufacturers STELARA?
Mr. Duato. The manufacturing cost is only a component that
goes into our pricing. When we price our medicines, we are
looking at the value that the medicine brings to the healthcare
system. Our ability to continue to invest in research.
We invested $15 billion last year. And also, we look at
affordability. The average copay, if they use our copay
assistance programs in the U.S., for a patient using STELARA,
it is $10 to $15 per month.
The Chair. I apologize. I am over my time. I am going to
give Senator Cassidy the same time that I had.
Senator Cassidy. Thank you all. Mr. Duato, the--in 2021,
Janssen constructed an exclusionary contract with their PBMs to
protect REMICADE, their blockbuster drug, a treatment for
ulcerative colitis. Very familiar with it. A wonderful drug.
Changed the outcome for people with UC.
But this deal protected REMICADE from competition by new
biosimilar, Inflectra, which was launched at a 16 percent lower
cost than REMICADE. Now, I understand this is confidential in
terms of the settlement with the courts but--and by the way,
let me just say this involves a rebate wall.
For the sake of those who are watching, a rebate wall is an
anti-competitive tool which can be used to restrict a
competitor's entry into a formulary. A manufacturer would offer
more significant rebates to a health plan through a PBM for
access to the formulary contingent upon the PBM blocking a
biosimilar.
Now, we have been discussing the promise of biosimilars to
lower the cost in a market oriented, competitive way. So, we
are not going to have Government regulation, we have got to
have a market situation, and the market would be a biosimilar,
but this sort of arrangement blocked the biosimilar from
entering.
In the full support of a market oriented approach, do any
of your current contracts employ rebate walls to prevent lower
cost biosimilars from formulary access?
Mr. Duato. We welcome biosimilars and generics. We believe
it is an integral part of the system.
As a matter of fact, in the U.S., 90 percent of the
prescriptions are biosimilars and generics, and that is one of
the reasons pharmaceutical expenses have remained flat or
increased single digit during the last years.
We believe that biosimilars and generic foster patient
access, and we care deeply about that. And we don't----
Senator Cassidy. But let me ask because my specific
question, do any of your current contracts employ rebate walls?
Mr. Duato. Our current contracts do not employ any
technique to avoid biosimilars and generics to have uptick in
the market.
Senator Cassidy. Okay. Thank you. Now, I think at least two
of you, maybe all three of you, are working on gene therapy. I
have been concerned that we don't really know how we are going
to price those.
I think one of the concerns is that there will not be a
market for us to lower the cost of an initial gene therapy,
which are incredible. It is amazing the lifetime of benefit
that gene therapy can create. But I was speaking to a medical
director of Medicaid CMO, and he was telling me that the
pharmaceutical costs related to Medicaid is now 35 percent were
formerly it was like 25 or 30 percent.
He says this is being driven by gene therapy. And when
sickle cell comes widely spread, it is going to--I don't know
how it is going to be priced, but my state has a lot of
sicklers. I don't know how my state is going to be able to
afford giving it to everybody who should have access.
Very concisely, how are we going to show restraint on the
price of some of these new gene therapies, which already is
driving up Medicaid? So again, 35 percent of Medicaid is now
pharmaceutical cost. Mr. Boerner, I will start with you.
Mr. Boerner. Senator. We actually don't work in gene
therapy----
Senator Cassidy. Oh, then let me go to Davis. Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. We actually do not work in gene therapy.
Senator Cassidy. Oh, I thought I saw you at a press release
that you all were doing so. You had a vector or something.
Mr. Davis. No, we are--well, we are doing some very basic
research, but we have nothing in advanced stages.
Senator Cassidy. Mr. Duato.
Mr. Duato. We do have a gene therapy served for treating
inherited retinal diseases. And we support legislation in order
to be able to do value based contracts in the case of gene
therapy. So, we welcome legislation in order to be able to have
value based contracts.
Senator Cassidy. That is a really--that is good. Value
based contract will be important, but it still doesn't address
the opening cost. Because of the opening cost of sky high, you
still--you see where I am going with that.
Now, what would you give to us who believe in markets, a
solution to an opening price that would be so much it would be
difficult for society to afford the gene therapy. And I can put
in any other drug, but let's just start with gene therapy.
Mr. Duato. We have to look at the value of these therapies
and the fact that gene therapy for inherited retinal diseases
may affect only less than 1,000 people in the world. So, we
have to understand that.
You can rest assured that if we are fortunate enough to
bring the solution that people that have diseases that can lead
to blindness, we will sit down and evaluate very thoroughly our
pricing in order to make sure that patients, all patients that
need this therapy, are able to afford it.
Senator Cassidy. I think I recall a couple of years ago
there was a study that was shown, respected, and you probably
know it better than I, that $2 million for gene therapy for
ultra-rare diseases was a reasonable sort of--it would cover
the cost. It would create the incentive to produce more.
That would be for the ultra-rare, where presumably you
wouldn't have the ability to produce more. You know, obviously,
the more you produce, you get a little bit extra profit. You
know where I am going with that. So, but that shows restraint,
if you will, on the behalf of the manufacturer.
Now we want to create incentive, but we want to be able to
provide access, and without access, it is as if the drug has
never been invented. So, is there any other thoughts you have
on how society, if that is ultra-rare, $2 million, presumably.
If it is not ultra-rare, it would be less. How can we have
a market oriented approach to this? Because I truly am
concerned about the ability of a Medicaid program to be able to
afford some of these gene therapies.
Mr. Duato. We care deeply about our medicines getting to
the patients that are need it, especially in these, as you have
mentioned, ultra-rare diseases that have therapy can have life
changing consequences.
We will always sit down and make sure that the way we price
is reflective of the value of the medicine, but also
importantly, it enables affordability, and it makes it possible
that every patient that needs it in America, can get it.
Senator Cassidy. Now, the affordability though, we are
defining affordability for the patient. So, if Medicaid covers
it, it is by definition affordable for the patient, or if the
insurance does. But then that doesn't necessarily make it
affordable for society. And society has got to pay for it.
Obviously Medicaid is taking more and more of a state's
budget and frankly, more and more the Federal budget. I am not
sure there is an answer there but let me just challenge you
because we want market oriented solutions.
We want to create incentives so that good companies like
the three of you and others are making these new things. But if
my state goes bankrupt paying for a new gene therapy, then my
state's--the taxpayer, we all are tough--in a tough shape.
Let me just go to one more thing. There is evidence that
pharmaceutical companies will do lifecycle management kind of
to prolong the sort of exclusivity of a drug. And some have
argued that actually defeats innovation because as opposed to
making profit from innovation, you can make profit from
lifecycle management. Any thoughts about that, Mr. Boerner?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, I think lifecycle management, if you
think about the extension of new indications for a product, is
incredibly important to really being able to deliver additional
benefits to patients.
Obviously, the patents associated with any product will
dictate when a generic enters. We have been in favor of a
robust generic entry primarily because our focus is on
innovative products.
But think, for example, in cancer where typically you start
the treatment of cancer very late in disease, learn more about
how the drug works, show it is safe, but ultimately you can
bring that into early stage cancer, where you have the
potential to potentially cure patients.
Now, that takes quite a bit of time, but that is an example
of a lifecycle management where you are actually showing the
true potential of a medicine. I would hate for us to cutoff the
opportunity to show those benefits.
At the same time, we should be, as an industry, welcoming
of generic competition, because ultimately our focus as a
company is to take resources as we get close to generic entry
and focus those resources on the next wave of new product
innovation, which is where I think we ultimately want to go for
patients.
Senator Cassidy. Mr. Davis, you have got 20 seconds. How
would you do it?
Mr. Davis. Well, the short answer is, as I look at it, one,
we very much support generic drugs and biosimilar drugs. I
think it is the core of how our system works. We have a period
where we are protected.
We are able to recoup our investment, and then society
benefits in perpetuity beyond that. As we look at life cycle
management, we always are asking, are we bringing value to the
patient? I will give you a live example.
If you look at KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA now, as I mentioned, is
in 39 indications across 17 tumor types. It is revolutionizing
the care of patients facing cancer. The reality of it is still
only 30 percent of people show overall response.
As great as it is, patients are still suffering. And what
we are doing is investing in combination therapies to be able
to extend and go beyond that 30 percent, which means much
better benefit and value to the patients that will--that
ultimately use those drugs.
Senator Cassidy. Thank you.
The Chair. Senator Murphy.
Senator Murphy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you for holding this really important hearing. Mr. Duato,
looking at your arthritis drug, and we have talked already a
little in this hearing about the difference in price between
the United States and other countries.
Annual cost around $80,000 in the United States, $20,000 in
Canada, $12,000 in France. Are the prices that you receive from
a country like Canada or France, which look to me to be about
one quarter of the price that you get from the United States,
are those prices covering your costs?
Mr. Duato. Yes they do. To clarify, Senator, the price in
the U.S. is discounted by 70 percent. So, the appropriate
comparison would be $25,000 in the case of STELARA, if you are
considering that price.
Senator Murphy. Are the prices you are receiving from these
other countries, so let's say France--but I will give you the
benefit of your argument. France is still 20--it is still 50
percent of the U.S. cost that you are claiming. Are those
countries' prices covering your costs?
Mr. Duato. They do. The difference is that, for example, in
Canada, which was the first country you quoted, STELARA, which
is mainly indicated for inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's
disease, and ulcerative colitis, not for arthritis, is not just
reimbursed in the public system.
Canadian patients that want to access STELARA, they cannot
do it in the public system because 8 years, 8 years later is
not yet reimbursed there.
Senator Murphy. You don't identify any free rider syndrome
today in which the United States is paying higher prices,
allowing other nations to receive lower prices?
Mr. Duato. I agree with you that the prices in the U.S. are
generally higher for medicines, more aligned than what you are
describing, as the rest of the healthcare system prices are.
The percentage of pharmaceutical expenses over the total
healthcare expenses in the U.S. is 14 percent, and that is
lower than most of the advanced economies. The real difference
is that in the U.S., patients get access to therapy, lifesaving
therapy years before they do in the countries that you
mentioned.
Senator Murphy. If the United States were to restrict the
prices we paid, would that create a different negotiating
dynamic in countries that right now, for instance, are paying
50 percent of what the United States pays? Would it allow you
in your negotiations to get higher prices from other nations
that right now are paying far less than the United States?
Mr. Duato. We believe that price caps are not the way that
innovation is going to be fostered. We have worked with the
United States Trade Department and with U.S. embassies around
the world to try to reject the price caps that some countries,
as the one you to mentioned, impose.
We welcome the support of the U.S. Government in avoiding
that these Governments that are ultimately imposing price caps
on those that are not benefiting their patients neither.
Senator Murphy. What do you say to Americans who look at
the way that you allocate revenue and wonder why, in your case
for instance, you are spending $6 billion on stock buybacks,
$11 billion on dividends, and $14 billion on research and
development.
You spend all of your advertising time talking about the
research and development spend, but I think most Americans
would be pretty surprised, given how much the industry talks
about research and development, that you are actually spending
more money shelling out money to investors and buying back
stock than you are on research and development.
What do you say to folks who look at that and come to the
conclusion that you care much more about keeping your investors
happy and keeping your executives happy than you do in
researching and development the next class of drugs that is
going to help regular Americans?
Mr. Duato. We care deeply about patients, Senator, and we
care deeply about being able to discover the next medicines
that are going to address major problems like Alzheimer's. What
we----
Senator Murphy. But explain to me how you justify that
division of dividends and stock buybacks versus research
development. You could just choose instead of using $6 billion
to buy back stock to put that into more research and
development, but you don't.
Mr. Duato. Our level of R&D investment in the 2-years that
referred to the $6 billion program buyback, which were 2022 and
2023, is six times higher.
In that period, we invested $30 billion in R&D and $6
billion in stock buybacks. So, we spent six times more in
developing cures for patients than we did in the stock buyback.
Senator Murphy. Well, I am looking at 2022 profits and
spending by Johnson & Johnson, and it shows me $11 billion in
dividends, $6 billion in stock buybacks, $45 million in
executive compensation, and $14 billion in research and
development.
Can you understand--let me ask a different question, do you
understand that one of my constituents in Connecticut would
look at those numbers and think that you care more about
padding the pockets of the folks that work for you and invest
in you than in research and development?
Mr. Duato. Our priority is investing in R&D. We have spent
$77 billion since 2016. And yes, we have to pay dividends
because it is the only way that the company can remain
operational and sustainable.
Otherwise, if we are not operational and sustainable, we
are not able to do--fulfill our mission of developing medicine
for patients and making them affordable.
Senator Murphy. Mr. Boerner, you talked in your testimony
about, the United States has a health care system that
prioritizes the important role of patient choice.
I just want to present you with the case of one of my
constituents and ask you about the choices that she faces. So,
I have a constituent who needs ELIQUIS. This is a blood thinner
that is critical to her survival.
She has priced the Medicare plan that gets her the best
possible price. And that price is $350 a month. The average
Social Security benefit in Connecticut is about $1,700 a month.
And of course, somebody who is on ELIQUIS is likely on other
drugs as well.
Here is her choice. Her choice is to pay the $350 and go
without food or pay her rent late, or not take the drug and
risk heart attack or stroke. Is that the choice you are talking
about when you refer to a health care system that prioritizes
the important role of choice?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, absolutely not. And in fact, I would
say on behalf of all of our employees at Bristol-Myers Squibb,
that is a choice no patient should have to make.
Senator Murphy. But she makes it. She makes it because you
have chosen to price a drug at a point that is not affordable.
Mr. Duato. Senator, we have priced ELIQUIS in the U.S., in
our in our estimation--in fact, we try to do this for all of
our medicines, consistent with the value it brings. And we are
very happy with the fact that ELIQUIS is the leading anti-
stroke drug----
Senator Murphy. Why not take--why not--you put $8 billion
into stock buybacks. Why not do $4 billion and instead take the
rest of the money and bring the price of the drug down?
The Chair. I am going to keep people to seven.
Senator Tuberville.
Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for
being here today. It is pretty well known where our Chairman
stands on this--his worldwide view. Pretty clear that he
believes you guys are setting drug prices and it is all about
corporate greed.
I am a true believer of capitalism. I believe that we have
the best health care system in the world. Problem is we have
got the Federal Government involved in it and it is not
implemented the way probably it should be. That being said, I
just got a few questions here on a couple of things.
Mr. Davis, can you explain to me something, the Biden
administration has two huge priorities, dictate prices of
prescription drugs, specifically small molecule drugs, and cure
cancer. Can you walk me through how those priorities might be
in direct contradiction of each other?
Mr. Davis. Well, Senator, I think what you are referring to
is what is called the pill penalty----
Senator Tuberville. That is correct.
Mr. Davis. Underneath the IRA. And what that does is
effectively--it says that at 9 years, post your first approval,
your price for your drug will be negotiated, and if it is a
small molecule--it is $13, if it is a large.
The issue that raises is that it disfavors small molecule
development. And the reality of it is if you look across the
majority of cancer treatments, they are still small molecules.
And, as Chris pointed out earlier, the development of cancer
drugs usually starts in a phase starting at the very, most
sickest patient, the last stage of disease, and then you work
forward into earlier stages of disease where in fact you can
start to maybe talk about cure.
To do those studies in early stage disease, often called
adjuvant or neoadjuvant care, and we have nine approvals in
that space, those studies can take 7 to 9 years to do so.
Obviously if at 9 years I have to significantly reduce the
price of that drug to a point that it is potentially at
basically no profit, my incentive to do those follow on studies
is not there.
That is our worry that if you look at cancer care, you are
going to see patients suffer because we can't get to really
talking about cure, which is in earlier stages disease. I would
also point out you didn't ask about Alzheimer's and
neuroscience diseases, but most CNS diseases also require small
molecules because large molecules, biologics can't penetrate
the blood brain barrier.
We are disincentivizing some of the largest areas of
sickness and chronic need in our society through that pill
penalty you are referring to.
Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Mr. Boerner, we hear a lot
about how health care costs are ridiculous high. I think all of
us would agree to that some degree. I want to peel back the
onion here a little bit.
Today, we are being led to believe that these costs are due
to corporate greed. I want to know if we are going to talk
about some additional drivers of health care costs. When the
Federal Government dumped trillions into various industries
during Covid, we upended our markets and drove prices through
the roof.
You know, when I talked to health care folks back in
Alabama, labor cost is one huge problem. But there are other
costs, including supplies and raw materials. What impact are
these having on the drug development and how drug cost?
Mr. Boerner. Certainly, Senator, when we look at the cost
bases for us doing what we do as a company, which is to bring
forward new medicines for patients, we have to factor in all of
those costs.
I will give you an example. In cellular therapy, which is
really transforming very late line hematologic diseases. These
are very complex medicines. You are taking patient cells,
manufacturing them and re-engineering them to really target and
hone in on cancer cells, and then you are inject them in the
patients. This is really a first generation technology.
Unfortunately, it has very high labor costs because this is
one that is very manual. It is a multi-step process to
manufacture these products. There are transportation costs,
their raw material costs.
All of those factors go into a cost of these first
generation medicines. Now we are very focused on trying to
innovate to get to a second and third generation quickly so we
can bring those costs down, not only because it is important
for us to be able to funnel additional research into
development, but also so that we can bring ultimately the cost
down to patients.
They are absolutely a factor, Senator.
Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Mr. Duato, I am going to ask
you this. With your accent and mine, we will probably have a
tough time. But I know you are probably aware in 2021, you
weren't CEO, I don't think, at that time, but the Biden
administration announced a mandate that U.S. troops and
personnel must take the Covid vaccine in order to serve in the
military. Are you familiar with that?
Mr. Duato. I am familiar, sir. Thank you.
Senator Tuberville. Are you aware that more than 8,400
troops were kicked out of the military for declining to take
the Covid vaccine? These were mostly young, healthy Americans
for whom Covid risk was low. Are you aware of that?
Mr. Duato. No, I was not aware of that, sir.
Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Did you or did anyone at
Johnson & Johnson encourage the Biden administration to mandate
this Covid vaccine to the military? Are you familiar with that?
Mr. Duato. We did not, sir.
Senator Tuberville. Okay. How much did Johnson & Johnson
benefit financially from the administration's military Covid
vaccine mandate? Could you have any kind of guess to that?
Mr. Duato. Our effort in the Covid vaccine that we
collaborated with the Government, it was a time of a global
emergency, so we thought that as a healthcare company that
cares for patients we needed to collaborate with the U.S.
Government on that, was entirely non-for-profit.
Senator Tuberville. Do you think the soldiers who were
expelled from the military was a right thing to do, and should
they be reinstated?
Mr. Duato. I was not aware of the situation, sir. I am not
aware of these circumstances, so I cannot comment on that.
Senator Tuberville. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chair. Thank you, Senator.
Senator Murray.
Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And
thank you all for being here. We really appreciate it. I think
we hear from our constituents constantly, and frighteningly,
about the cost of some of the drugs that they take.
This is really an important hearing. And I continue to
hear, as many have said, that sky-high drug costs are forcing
many people, including in my home, State of Washington, to
choose between filling their prescription and paying for other
things they need, essentials like groceries or rent, and I
often talk to people who are skipping their prescription
altogether because they can't afford it and it puts their life
at risk.
I really believe that Congress does need to do more here, I
have for a long time, and I also think pharmaceutical companies
need to do much more to put patients first. And that doesn't
mean that private companies can't make a profit, and I think we
all have a really sincere appreciation for the cutting edge
research that happens at each of your companies.
But when you say you are in the business of saving lives
and curing disease, you have to think about putting patients
over profits, because, as we all know, lifesaving drugs don't
do anyone any good if people can't afford them. So, I want to
ask you about affordability. And I have heard the numbers. I
was listening in my office.
Mr. Duato, your drug company makes product to treat
arthritis, STELARA. It costs $79,000 annually here in the U.S.,
$12,000 in France. Mr. Davis, your company makes a drug to
treat cancer, KEYTRUDA. You have been talking about it.
Annually, the cost here is $191,000. $44,000 in Japan.
Mr. Boerner, your company makes a drug, ELIQUIS, to treat
the risk of stroke that costs $7,100 in the year, and $770 in
Germany. So, I mean, either you think that the same
prescription drugs sold around the world work better here in
America, or we are getting something more for it.
I mean, I don't think that is the case, but I wanted to ask
each one of you, explain to us why it costs more in terms that
we can tell our constituents and they understand. And, Mr.
Duato, let me talk to you.
Mr. Duato. We share your concerns about what patients have
to pay at the pharmacy counter for medicines. In the case of
STELARA that you mentioned, the net price in the U.S. is 70
percent lower than the price that you refer, so it would be
$24,000. It is still higher than in France, but it is more
aligned than here.
The difference is that patients with inflammatory bowel
disease, which is the main indication with STELARA, were able
to afford STELARA years earlier than they did in other
countries. As a matter of fact, in Canada, after 8 years that
STELARA was approved, STELARA is not reimbursed in inflammatory
bowel disease, nor in Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis.
What are we doing for that? We have strong patient
assistance programs. A patient that has commercial insurance
pays $10 to $15 a month for STELARA, and if they are not
insured or underinsured, we have free medicine program. We
distributed $3.9 billion in free drug in 2022.
Senator Murray. Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. If you look at KEYTRUDA and the example you are
bringing up between the U.S. and Japan, first of all, like all
of us, we are trying to focus on making sure that patients
everywhere in the world get access to our medicines. Each
market operates differently. Japan is a unique market in that
the way they price their drugs, and we have been working hard
to get this to change.
I think maybe we have successfully gotten some of it to
change. Is that after you initially launched your drug, for
every indication that comes afterwards, they treat it as a
different drug. And in addition, if a competitor launches a
drug, then you also still take a price decrease because of the
competitor drug.
We are in a strange situation and one that is a very
concerning situation to me in Japan, where in reality we as the
most innovative, we have the most indications, we were driving
the market fastest, we have by far the lowest discounted price
in Japan, and the levels in Japan would not be sustainable to
support the $46 billion, $40 billion we spent on KEYTRUDA.
We are working hard to help those markets and we could use
Government help there to understand that we need to, across the
globe, share in making sure we can invest to support
innovation.
Senator Murray. What would Congress do that would make a
difference to lower prices here?
Mr. Davis. I think. Well, on one hand it is a different
question on lowering prices here. I think that is a question I
am assuming we are going to get to, but this is, how do we
focus on what is the really large discrepancy between the list
price and the net price, which I believe we need to focus on is
the out-of-pocket cost to the patient.
That is really the core. We need to address that. But in
addition, we need to continue to work together on--we can work
on trying to drive innovation clauses into trade agreements, we
have had some success with that, to also help us in those
markets outside the United States as well.
Senator Murray. Mr. Boerner.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, there is no doubt that patients are
going to pay less for our drug ELIQUIS, or frankly most of our
drugs outside of the U.S. than in the U.S.. That,
unfortunately, comes at a fairly significant cost for those
patients outside of the U.S..
In Canada, patients will wait roughly three and a half to 4
years to get access to a medicine that is available in the
U.S.. You see similar sort of stats in virtually every European
country and in Japan. What we can do more in the U.S. to do is
try to bring out the pockets down--out-of-pocket costs down.
For ELIQUIS, for example, the average out-of-pocket is
roughly $50, $55 in the U.S.. Most patients will pay less than
$40. However, there are still patients for whom this drug is
absolutely not affordable. That is not acceptable.
Medicare, in particular, is a space where we can't provide
those types of copay support programs that we do in the
commercial setting, so we would love to work with Congress on
that. But probably the most important thing, and ELIQUIS is a
great example of this that we can do, is try to bring down the
list cost of ELIQUIS----
Senator Murray. Do you set the list price?
Mr. Duato. We set the list price, but that lowest price for
ELIQUIS is driven up by the incentives of intermediaries. And
let me give you an example, order of magnitude. Over the last 5
years, we have, as a company, paid almost $100 billion in
rebates and discounts to intermediaries.
The majority of those were on ELIQUIS. And our ability--
that is unfortunately what patients pay is a co-pay on that
list price. We would love to work with Congress to bring that
down.
The Chair. Senator Marshall.
Senator Marshall. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Boerner, I will start with you. Bristol Myers makes this new
miracle drug, ELIQUIS, relatively a miracle drug.
When I was in residency treating patients, I was using
Coumadin--Heparin and then Coumadin. It might take three or 4
days to get someone heparnized, and then we switch them over to
Coumadin.
They might be in the hospital for 10 or 14 days. So, in its
own right, ELIQUIS saves money. It saves that length in the
hospital and prevents hospitalizations as well. So, I want to
point that out.
As we think--talk about rationing care, we have discussed
how we are rationing care in foreign countries. But I want you
to speak about rationing care in this country. How do PBMs
ration care when they take a drug like ELIQUIS and don't allow
it on their formulary? Does that ever happen?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, I am glad you raised that point. We
have had absolutely that case happen on multiple drugs. We have
had it happen on ELIQUIS. We have had it happen where when we
have not been able to reach an agreement with an intermediary
on a rebate, that they have taken ELIQUIS off of formulary.
When that happens, those patients no longer have access to
ELIQUIS and they have to go on to another branded or in many
cases, they may go on to Warfarin, as you say. ELIQUIS is the
No. 1 product in the oral anticoagulant space----
Senator Marshall. Okay, so I am going to--sorry. So, they
have to go back to Warfarin, the Coumadin, the drug that I was
using in medical school in the 1980's. A drug with significant
complications.
Hassle factor, the patient has to go get blood testing done
maybe twice a week as well. But with your drug the miracle, one
of the miracle parts of it is that a, they don't bleed into
their brains anymore. And two, they don't have to go get their
blood testing done once a week as well.
It is a huge amount of innovation. And it is just--it
amazes me how much power these PBMs have obtained. Let's go to
Mr. Davis next.
I want to talk about de-linking. And you have, at the time,
a pretty--a miracle drug of your own to treat diabetes with.
And there is a list price. How much of that--what percentage of
that list price does typically Merck get at the end of the day?
Mr. Davis. Senator, if you look at JANUVIA, which is the
drug you were speaking to, the list price is $6,900.
Senator Marshall. Per year?
Mr. Davis. Per year, for Merck. We recognize $690 on that
drug per year.
Senator Marshall. Of the list price, you are only getting
10 percent.
Mr. Davis. It is a 90 percent discount.
Senator Marshall. 90 percent discount. Where does the rest
of that money go?
Mr. Davis. Into the middlemen. Into the system as a whole.
Senator Marshall. If we had the time and the energy and a
chalkboard, would you be able to explain to me and show me all
the little places that goes?
Mr. Davis. I could, but I think you appreciate it is highly
complex and so complex that at times even learned people who
play in the space can't understand it.
Senator Marshall. Well certainly, I can't explain it, and
that is my point. Is it is so nontransparent, we don't know
where this money is going, but certainly, we know that pharmacy
benefit managers are taking $0.50 to $0.75 of that dollar, and
you are only getting 10 percent of it.
I would like to know where the rest of it goes. Then I will
go back to Mr. Boerner. Similarly, with your drug, with
ELIQUIS, what type of--what percent of that list price do you
think that you all are taking home?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, it is a relatively smaller
percentage. As I mentioned before, we have paid over the last 5
years about $100 billion in rebates and discounts, and the
majority of that go to one product and that is ELIQUIS.
Senator Marshall. Okay. Go back to Mr. Davis. Let's talk
about, you all have an antiviral drug that has been approved.
How many drugs did you go down--when Covid hit, you were trying
to develop multiple drugs. How many have made it across the
finish line? What did you spend on R&D as you look at those all
together?
Mr. Davis. Yes, so we--when the COVID situation hit, we
drove two--or four key programs, two in vaccines, two in
antivirals. Only one of those succeeded, which is the drug
LAGEVRIO. The total spend across those four programs is a
little over $2.5 billion.
Senator Marshall. You spent $2.5 billion. You got one
across the finish line, an antiviral. Is that being used in the
United States?
Mr. Davis. Very little. It has emergency use authorization.
It never got to full approval. And so, we are actually seeing
it being used much more outside the United States.
Senator Marshall. In actuality, you spent $2.5 billion and
got nonsignificant market share in the United States despite
that. Mr. Duato, I will talk to you for a second.
In my 25 years taking care of patients, we were always able
to find a solution for their drugs that they needed, 340B
programs, rebates. There is always exceptions to the rules, but
what type of efforts has J&J made to work with 340B programs
and to help some of these people that need help?
Mr. Duato. Thank you, sir. We care deeply about patient
affordability, but also we care about the sustainability of the
rural hospitals and the small hospitals that take care of
patients that are underserved.
We believe that the 340B program, it is an important
program to support those hospitals and we are fully, fully
looking forward to collaborate with them in any way we can to
support patient access on those hospitals.
Senator Marshall. I am going to point out once again, it is
just not rural hospitals, it is our community health centers
are taking great advantage of the 340B program as well, trying
to make sure that every patient in America has access to
primary care--true affordable access to primary care, plus
having access to affordable drugs as well.
I might make a couple quick points. The people of Kansas
sent me here to save Medicare. To save Medicare, I need a
miracle drug to treat Alzheimer's. It seems to me that
Americans bear the burden of most of the R&D in this world, and
other countries benefit from it.
That impacts the price in many ways as well. Mr. Davis, am
I wrong? Why does it feel like to me that Americans are feeling
most of the brunt of the R&D cost, or is that not accurate? I
don't know.
Mr. Davis. Well, I think, Senator, it gets down to, as you
look across the globe, different markets and I appreciate what
the U.S. does. I think the U.S. favors innovation. It values
it. It values access for our patients, fast access, most
access. Many markets around the world don't do that.
What they focus on more is their budget and how do they
meet those budget needs, and we appreciate the budgetary
constraints that everyone faces. But as a result of that, often
patients aren't getting access to meds. They don't get them as
fast, which we have commented on today, and it is harder to see
how you can support the innovation we need to do in that
situation.
The Chair. Thank you. Senator Baldwin.
Senator Casey.
Senator Casey. Thanks so much, Senator Baldwin, for
allowing me to jump ahead. Mr. Chairman, thanks for the
hearing. I want to start with a sense of what I hear back home.
When I talk to people in Pennsylvania, and a lot of your
companies have a lot of interest in Pennsylvania, I hear over
and over again this problem, the cost of prescription drugs, is
like a bag of heavy rocks.
It is when been people have been carrying this around their
shoulders every day, year after year, and they are tired of it.
And they don't believe that any player in this is doing enough.
I think most Pennsylvanians are happy that I could vote for
a bill in 2022 that allowed Medicare to negotiate for lower
prescription drug costs and that we could cap the cost of
insulin $35 bucks a month for Medicare Part D beneficiaries.
They are happy that we could cap the out-of-pocket cost.
That will go into effect about a year from now. But they
are not happy--they are not satisfied that even Congress is
doing enough, House or Senate, or either party. But they are
certainly not happy with the level of work that you have put
into this. Look, I hear all this talk about rebates and cost
reductions you are trying to put in place, but it is not
cutting back home.
When I talk to people that see what PBMs are doing, they
know that they are not meeting the obligation that they would
expect them to. So, there is no question that your companies
and big pharmaceutical companies are playing a role in this.
You bear a measure of responsibility in this.
I wanted to ask you a couple questions about that. First
and foremost, tell me what concrete steps, very specific steps,
that each of you are taking and your companies are taking to
make sure that we can get these costs down. And even by way of
repetition, you may have already said it.
I'm not worried about you repeating yourself, but we need
to know specifically what you are doing to lowering costs so
that no one, especially someone who needs a lifesaving
intervention, a lifesaving treatment, is going to be denied
that solely, solely because of cost. And I will start on the
left, Mr. Duato, going left to right.
Mr. Duato. Thank you, Senator Cassidy. We absolutely want
to be part of the solution. We understand that co-pay
obligations for U.S. patients are burdensome, and it does
create health inequities.
What are we doing for that? We have a very extensive
patient assistance program that, for commercial patients,
enables them to be able to pay low co-pays, $5 to $15 per
month. We supported more than 1 million patients in 2022 with
our copay assistance programs. If a patient is underinsured or
not insured, we provide free drug.
We gave $3.9 billion in free drug in 2022. But I think we
can do more, and we can work together in order to lower out-of-
pocket costs for patients even in Medicare, as you mentioned,
because that is a real need that we are committed, all our
employees are committed in order to make sure that our
medicines get to the patients that did deserve it.
Senator Casey. Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. Well, Senator, very much like J&J, we have
tiered levels of patient assistance programs because we want to
make sure that patients who need our drugs can access them. If
you have insurance but you fall below certain means where you
are not able to handle your copay, we will give copay
assistance to those patients through a program we run.
If you are someone who doesn't have insurance, is not able
to qualify for Government programs, we have a patient
assistance program that basically provides the drugs for free.
So, we are very much focused on this and making sure that we
can do everything we can, and we are investing a lot of money
on it.
But something I would like to add, because I think it is
important to the discussion. We are focusing on prices today,
but we also need to think about innovation as a way to fix the
problem. And something we are focusing on as a company is a new
technology called micro cyclic peptides that allow us to
potentially take what historically has been large molecules
difficult to make, expensive drugs difficult to deliver, and we
are starting to show the capability to convert those into
cheaper, small molecule forms, oral forms.
If we are able to do that, we have one in late stage
development now called an oral PCSK9, which is for heart
disease. But we are looking to do that for others. We are
investing millions, billions behind that effort.
I think we need to also think about how can innovation
solve the problem. We need to address the price challenges
today. We have to lower out-of-pocket costs. But innovation
ultimately is what is going to help us fix this.
Senator Casey. Sir.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, maybe I would highlight three things.
First, we obviously have a very robust, on the commercial side,
copay assistance program that brings out-of-pocket costs down
in many cases for certainly our oral oncologists, for example,
almost to zero.
They are complex at times, so we are working very hard to
make those more universally available. That is step one. Step
two, we would like to work with this Congress to find ways in
which we could apply the same sort of programs in Medicare.
There are some complexities.
We want to make sure we are not diverting from the use of
generics, for example, but we think there are potential ways
that we could do that, and we would love to explore those
opportunities with Congress to bring out-of-pocket costs down
for Medicare patients.
The second thing I would say is we are looking at doing
more innovative work, innovative contracting work where we can.
For example, if our drug works, we get paid. If it doesn't
work, we get paid less and in some cases maybe even not get
paid at all. There are technicalities in the U.S. that prohibit
us from doing that more in the U.S..
We want to work to get those removed. The third thing, just
building on what Rob was saying, is we do believe that
innovation plays a role here. Cellular therapy, while not gene
therapy per the previous question, those are expensive
therapies.
We have got to bring those costs down, and the way we will
do that is we will innovate to the next generation, which
hopefully is way less complex than what I described previously.
Senator Casey. Well, I will be submitting some more follow-
up questions for the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chair. Thank you.
Senator Paul.
Senator Paul. I am not an apologist for big pharma. In
fact, when corporations manipulate Government to their
advantage, crony capitalism, I am an unfettered critic. But in
defense of capitalism, I am a consistent, unapologetic
advocate.
Milton Friedman once wrote that if you want to create a
shortage of tomatoes, just pass a law that retailers can't sell
tomatoes for more than $0.02. Instantly, you will have a tomato
shortage. I might also add that is true of prescription drugs.
Virtually every shortage of drugs that we have seen in the last
few years involves price controls that drive out production of
the drug.
One reason the United States leads in pharmaceutical
innovation is because while the U.S. adhere to more--a more
market based pricing and rewarded innovators, Europe adopted
stringent price controls in the 1980's and 90's. It is not
surprising that we lead the world in innovation and Europe does
not.
But unfortunately, this Committee in this hearing is not
here to celebrate American success. Instead, the majority drags
us to conduct a show trial to harangue companies challenging
the Inflation Reduction Act price controls in court.
They have simply brought forward people who question their
partisan legislation. Ten years ago, the 5-year survival rate
for patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer was 5
percent--terrible. Since Merck introduced the cancer drug
KEYTRUDA in 2014, the survival rate has grown nearly fourfold,
5 percent to 20 percent.
We should be celebrating that instead of castigating people
and telling them how to run their business, and why are you
buying your stock back. I have a friend with a genetic
predisposition to cancer. He is alive today because of
KEYTRUDA. We should be celebrating that. Johnson & Johnson's
REMICADE was the first monoclonal antibody approved for
treating chronic conditions like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid
arthritis.
Since its approval, Remicade has revolutionized treatments
for inflammatory disease, made remission a reality for patients
with debilitating conditions, and paved the way for development
of other autoimmune treatments. When I began in medicine,
virtually all patients with rheumatoid arthritis you could see
from a distance had crippling, disfiguring arthritis in their
hands.
Now, today, it is rarely seen because of the advances of
American companies under an American system that allowed profit
to occur. In 1987, Merck pledged to donate the entire stock of
its drug, Ivermectin, to those suffering from river blindness.
Nearly 37 years later, Ivermectin Donation Program treats 300
million people annually, with over 11 million treatments
shipped to endemic countries.
This is charity, my friends, from capitalism. You don't get
this under socialism because there is no profit under
socialism. They have no money to give. They make extraordinary
profits. Do they keep some of their investors? Yes, that is
what they are supposed to do. But they also have some left over
for charity and you don't get that under socialism.
Because of Merck's donation, seven countries eradicated the
transmission of the No. 1 cause of blindness in the world.
Pharmaceutical innovation has improved cancer rates, cured
hepatitis C, doubled the life span of patients living with
cystic fibrosis. It goes on and on.
We have tried price controls in general here. We did in the
1970's under a Republican President, under Nixon. It was a
disaster, and it led to lines at the gas pump. It was an
ultimate disaster. A study at the University of Chicago, found
that 254 fewer drug approvals over the course of 18 years would
happen under price controls.
Under communism, they knew this. Socialism, communism, and
the economic system of socialism from price--it became a
running joke. In Poland during the Soviet era there was a story
of the guy who went to the store, he was looking for eggs, and
he asked the clerk, is this a store with no eggs? And they
said, no, this is a store with no toilet paper. The store with
no eggs is across the street.
That is the story of socialism. That is the story of price
controls. Scarcity and empty shells are the inevitable result
of price controls. Those who understand and appreciate
capitalism do not need a show trial to dupe them into
forgetting that price controls have never worked and never
will.
Let's get back to profitability. I don't think you guys did
a very good job on answering this. Did you add into your
estimate of whether it is profitable in Canada, whether or not
it cost you $2.6 billion on average to develop it? You are
talking about manufacturing costs. You are talking about how
much it cost to make KEYTRUDA and how much you sell it for, and
say you have a profit in Canada.
Do you think it would still be a profit, Mr. Davis, if you
added in all the R&D, the $2.6 billion to get it through this
system, all--the apparatus of your company and you divided all
of that out for profitability, would it still be profitable in
most of these other countries?
Mr. Davis. I have not done that analysis, but I would say
that the profitability would be marginal at best.
Senator Paul. Do you think you would have as much R&D if
the whole world were Canada? Do you think you would be
developing dozens of new drugs every year if the whole world
were Canada?
Mr. Davis. No, I do not.
Senator Paul. This is what we are arguing against, you
know. Sure, you can make it for pennies now, but it didn't
start that way. And then people were like, oh, my it costs so
much in the beginning. That is capitalism. That is the way it
works in capitalism. Joseph Schumpeter talked about this, and
he said, this is an old anecdote, but he said, the miracle of
capitalism is not the queens have silk stockings, but that
factory girls ultimately do.
But in the beginning only the queen has silk stockings.
Rich people get stuff in the beginning. Rich people drive the
innovation. The first calculators that came out, $300 for
adding, subtracting, and dividing machine.
Now they are like pennies or free. But you have to allow
the price to be higher in the beginning and the market brings
it down as you have more widespread market. That is capitalism.
We don't know what the correct price is. There is no moral
price. There is no moral amount of profit.
There is no business of any of you all telling them how
much stock to buy back. Their job is to make a profit. It is
actually against the law for them not to maximize their profit.
For you to sit in judgment of how much profit they should make
and how they should run their companies, you know nothing of
running companies.
You know, nobody up here, maybe some, but almost nobody up
here has run big companies, billion dollar companies and you
presume somehow to say you are going to tell these people how
to run their company. List price versus net price. List price
means absolutely nothing. I charged $1,800 for cataract
surgery.
The Government paid me $600. Two-thirds of it, nobody stole
that. It disappeared because it never existed. So, if I build
$1 million in charges, I really was only building $300,000
because that is what I was getting paid. But because of the
confusing nature of the system, the list price is much
different than the net.
But to quote list price and then compare it to net price in
other countries is completely and profoundly unfair. The list
price means absolutely nothing. All of these fallacies need to
be addressed before we begin haranguing American CEOs. Thank
you.
The Chair. Thank you for your questioning.
Senator Hassan.
Senator Hassan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.
The Chair. Senator Baldwin. I am sorry.
Senator Hassan. She----
Senator Baldwin. I yielded to Senator Casey.
Senator Hassan. I know, but I was next----
The Chair. All right. Senator Hassan, go in then Senator
Baldwin.
Senator Hassan. Thank you. So, I just wanted to say, at the
outset that the last time I checked, when a buyer and seller
negotiate for a price, that is capitalism.
I wanted to talk with all three of our distinguished
witnesses today, because one of the things that strikes me that
we are struggling with is I think at various times in each one
of your statements, you talked about your price reflecting the
value of your product. And the thing is, human health and life
is priceless.
If that is the metric here, you will always have an excuse
for charging increasing prices for these lifesaving drugs. And
what we are trying to do here is figure out how you can
continue the innovation that Senator Paul just so eloquently
spoke about. I would suspect that every Member up here has a
family member whose life has been saved by innovative
medications are greatly improved.
But at the end of the day, we have to find a way to allow
you all to innovate but also to make sure that the market here
and the system here works for the very people whose lives you
are helping to save.
I want to start with a question to you, Mr. Davis. While
families in New Hampshire and across the country struggle to
afford these lifesaving medications, pharmaceutical companies
are doing everything that they can to keep their prices and
their profits sky high. And I know you both talked about that
not being the case, but let's just look at one thing here.
One way that companies do this is by filing dozens, even
hundreds of frivolous patents that lock in their exclusive
right to sell their drug for decades.
By playing games like this with the patent system,
companies block low cost alternatives like generics from coming
to market. Mr. Davis, the list price for Merck's cancer
medication, KEYTRUDA is, as we have talked about, $190,000 per
year. Can you tell us how many patents have been filed on this
medication?
Mr. Davis. I don't have the exact number, but I would focus
you on probably the most important patents, which are the
composition of matter patents. In addition to that, the
formulation and manufacturing patents.
There is one suite of composition of matter patents that we
have and those are what allow us to continue to have
exclusivity.
Senator Hassan. Well, I don't think it would surprise you
to learn that I do know how many patents you currently have. It
is 168. This is what this looks like. Sheet after sheet after
sheet.
Patent office records show that not only do you have 168,
but half of them relate to the process Merck uses to
manufacture the drug, not the way that the drug is used to
treat patients. Merck is using patent gimmicks and loopholes to
delay other companies from selling lower cost versions of this
medication, all while raising the price of KEYTRUDA in the U.S.
year after year.
It would be good if Merck would just stop blocking patient
access to low cost medications by using the patent system in
this way. It is clear that Merck and other pharmaceutical
companies, you are not alone, won't stop abusing the patent
system to keep their prices high.
It is clear we also need to take action on that. And that
is something we can do. Senator Braun and I have a bill called
the Medication Affordability and Patent Integrity Act, which
would help break up these patent rules. And I would urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support that.
Now, Mr. Duato, in your testimony, you mentioned that
Johnson & Johnson provides financial assistance to uninsured
patients in the United States. However, the barriers to access
these programs are unreasonably high.
For an expensive medication like your company's arthritis
drug, STELARA, what does a patient have to do to get assistance
from the Johnson & Johnson program?
Mr. Duato. Thank you. We care deeply about patient access,
and we put a lot of work in developing well and wide patient
assistance programs. And we have mechanisms for patients to
connect with us via--mechanisms like a website called Johnson
Care Path, in which patients can access patient assistance. We
supported 1.1 million people with patient copay assistance last
year.
Senator Hassan. Well, let me just talk a little bit about
that. The initial application, which I have here, is six pages
long, and it requires pages of additional documents for income
verification.
In the fine print, this document even requires the patient
to consent to a credit report check and other financial
disclosures. Mr. Duato, everyone on this dais wants you to
charge a fair price for your company's medications.
But if someone does need assistance paying for their
medication, this process has to be streamlined and easily
available to anyone who qualifies. So, I would urge you to look
personally at this application.
When somebody is dealing with a serious illness, the last
thing they need to do is read the fine print and decide that
they have to disclose a credit report, the relevance of which
kind of escapes me. Mr. Boerner and Mr. Duato, we could also
increase competition by making it easier for generic drugs to
get approved.
Mr. Boerner let's turn to the BMS stroke prevention drug
ELIQUIS. The list price, as we have talked about, is $7,100 per
year. How many generics of this drug could a patient in the
United States get at the pharmacy today?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, in the U.S., there are not yet
generics available.
Senator Hassan. Right. There are zero generic versions of
ELIQUIS available to patients, even though the original patents
on the medication began to sunset in 2019. Because your company
has sued to block two approved generics from the U.S. market
until 2028 at the earliest, isn't that right?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we have allowed for generic entry in
2028. That is correct.
Senator Hassan. Right. So, we have two generics ready to
go. Your original patent is well past expired, but you still
are actively trying to prevent generics from coming to market.
Mr. Duato, the list price of Johnson & Johnson's autoimmune
arthritis medication STELARA is nearly $80,000 annually.
Similar to ELIQUIS, there are currently zero low cost
biosimilar versions of STELARA available to U.S. patients.
There are zero biosimilars for STELARA available in the United
States today because Johnson & Johnson has also sued to delay
the launch of a low cost biosimilar drug.
We need--you know, you have all talked about the need to
have speed of access--and Mr. Chairman, I am wrapping right up.
Speed of access getting drugs to market, but then you are
actively working to block the less expensive biosimilars and
generics to come to market, and that is something we should
address. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
The Chair. Senator Romney.
Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate
these executives taking time away from your responsibilities at
your respective companies to be here and to inform us, and in
some cases, to get berated by us and give us an opportunity to
pontificate on our various topics, which I am about to do.
One is that I fully concur with Mr. Paul or Senator Paul
indicated just a moment ago, Rand Paul, and that is that a free
enterprise system works marvelously. And I know we keep asking
you what are you doing to try and reduce the prices of your
products?
The answer is that is not what happens in free enterprise
and capitalism. I hope it doesn't come as a shock to my
colleagues. In capitalism, if you are running an enterprise
where you have a fiduciary responsibility to your owners, you
try and get as high a price as you can. That is what you try
and do.
You try and make as much profit as you can. That is how
free enterprise works. You think Chevrolet sits back and says,
gosh, how could we get the price of the Chevrolet down? No, it
is like, how high price can I get and maximize the profit for
my shareholder? What price does McDonald's charge for a
sandwich?
As high a price as they can get. But the amazing thing
about free enterprise is that someone figured out that if
everybody does that and you have competition among all the
players, that somehow the prices come down, and the quality
goes up, and the access to the product is broader. It is the
marvel, it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but it is the
marvel of capitalism.
Now, obviously wise companies say, well, you don't just
raise prices to the roof and do things that are going to harm
your credibility and the trust in the marketplace, and have
your employees not want to work there because they are going to
figure they are working for bad people. So wise enterprises
don't just do all the things I just mentioned.
They also say we are going to do other things and care for
the poor and care for people who want to come work in our
company. We do those things too. But recognize free enterprise
is about enterprises battling each other with higher prices in
many cases, and then they get pushed out by people who develop
new products and put them out of business. It is how it works.
But let me turn to--and I know, as Senator Paul indicated,
there are some who would like price controls. There are some
who would like socialized medicine. And it is like, have you
seen what that produces? It doesn't produce new drugs. It
doesn't produce cures. It sounds great.
We are going to--price controls is just another name for
capitalism--excuse me, socialism lite. Our system works, but
there are ways to improve it. And I am very concerned that this
disparity between list price and what you actually get paid is
a problem.
I don't know why it is a problem or what we can do about
it, but do you have PBMs and getting prices of discounts like
this in other countries that you compete in? Yes, Mr. Boerner,
yes.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we do not. This is a unique element
of the U.S. health care system.
Senator Romney. Is that true for you also, Mr. Davis?
Mr. Davis. That is true for us as well.
Senator Romney. Mr. Duato, is that also true?
Mr. Duato. This is unique. The inequity that exists in the
U.S.. It is because of that we have higher out-of-pocket costs
for patients than anywhere else in the developed world.
Senator Romney. I hope we focus on this. We may not have
the right bad guys here, all right. These are the guys
developing cures and helping people solve diseases.
But we have something here they don't have in the rest of
the world, these PBMs that want higher and higher prices
because they get paid based on how high the list price is,
because they get a percent of the list price.
I am not sure where all the money goes. Some of it goes
back to patients, some goes to the companies if they are self-
insured. I don't know where it all goes, but I think that is
the issue.
Let me ask each of you, if you were in our shoes knowing
what you know, what should we be doing to try and get the cost
of products down to our--to the people in the country and to
the country at large, to the Government that buys a lot of
goods, a lot of drugs--what should we be focused on?
I know that you sell to PBMs, so you got to be careful not
to step on their toes too hard because they might punish you.
But what advice would you give us? What should we be looking
at? Where is the problem in this mess? We will start here, Mr.
Boerner.
Mr. Boerner. Maybe three things I would offer, Senator.
First, to the complexity that you just described, No. 1,
dealing profits from intermediaries from the list price of the
drug, and the rebates rather that are provided. If you could
delink that, that would be important.
Alternatively, require that those rebates be passed on to
lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. That is No. 1. No. 2, I
firmly believe we have the ability to help lower out of patient
cost in Medicare if we could provide the same types of copay
support that we do on the commercial side to Medicare patients.
That would be a second thing. And the third thing, we have
referenced it before, we do innovative contracting outside of
the U.S. where we get paid if our product works. There are
constraints on our ability to do that in the U.S.. I would like
to see those removed. That would be very helpful.
Senator Romney. Right. Thank you. Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. I would say that I--Chris, basically covered all
of the things we would also look to do.
Senator Romney. Great. Thank you. Mr. Duato.
Mr. Duato. Yes. Three things. As Mr. Boerner, I would make
sure that the rebates and discounts that we pay to PBMs go back
to patients to reduce out-of-pocket costs. I will make sure
that as we are trying to do, and I know these Committee is
looking into that, would delink the compensation of the PBMs
from the list price. And finally, I would sit down to see what
we can do to provide, a, patient assistance program for
patients in Medicare Part D, but also look to further lower the
out-of-pocket costs for patients that the IRA is bringing.
Senator Romney. Thank you. You did mention the fact that
the PBMs are largely owned by the insurance companies.
Senators, we think PBMs are going to be lowering our costs
as an employer, let's say, and you hire a PBM to lower your
cost. But it might lower your cost, but then it is passing on
their profit to the insurance company. Is that a problem?
Is the fact that the PBMs are owned by the insurance
companies, is that a problem here? Is that something we need to
look at as well? Do any of you have any comment on that?
Mr. Duato. The three PBMs are owned by the three largest
insurance companies, and together they control about 80 percent
of the market of the prescriptions in the U.S..
Senator Romney. Yes. I am a big believer in free
enterprise, as you can tell by my opening comments. At the same
time, I am concerned that we have got some structures here that
are anti-competitive and make markets less effective, and we
probably ought to focus on some of those. Thank you. I
appreciate your testimony.
The Chair. Thank you.
Senator Baldwin.
Senator Baldwin. Thank you. It has been very interesting to
listen to the back and forth.
Senator Romney, your points about support of the free
market, but understanding that there are times when there is
market failures.
We also have an obligation, I think, to oversee because our
Committee with the--along with the Finance Committee, oversee
and the need to have good stewardship of Medicare and Medicare
dollars.
But the point that Senator Romney just made about
basically, I don't know--I can't follow the dollars and it is
complex, is a real issue. I want to start just by sharing some
of my constituents' struggles.
I have a constituent who literally turns down the heat in
the winter, because that is how she is able to afford the
prescription drug she needs for her wellness. There are choices
that people are making. People are rationing their medication.
People are forgoing their medication because of affordability.
I think we need more transparency. And I think we need more
transparency to inform the policies that we adopt. I was
pleased this last May that this Committee advanced my
bipartisan Fair Drug Pricing Act, which I lead with Senator
Braun.
Our bill would require basic transparency from your
companies at any juncture in which you want to raise the price,
list price of a prescription drug by more than a certain
amount, a certain percentage.
Asking questions like, what is the cost to manufacture the
product? What do you invest in R&D, something we really
support? How much are you spending on marketing and
advertising? What are you doing in terms of stock buybacks? Is
there excessive executive compensation?
I agree that we also have to have that transparency within
the PBMs. I remember, under the last President, when we were
having our confirmation hearing for the--his Secretary--
Secretary Azar, who came out of the pharmaceutical industry,
and I shared with him a letter from a constituent who has two
diabetic sons who is talking about the costs every month, not
just the insulin, but the test strips, etcetera.
I said, what do I tell this, dad about the high cost, which
had just by the way, increased significantly. And he just
responded, it is complicated. I can't tell my constituent, well
we can't address this because it is complicated. I remember,
when--this is years ago now when the EpiPen doubled in price
overnight, went from $100 basically to $200.
My constituents certainly told me what a burden that was. I
asked if you could show me--follow the money, a chart, follow
the money. Nobody could. We need additional transparency to
inform our policies.
Mr. Duato, the price of STELARA in the U.S. is $79,000 a
year. And by the way, in Wisconsin, the median household income
is $72,000. Your company has made twice as much selling this
arthritis treatment in the U.S. than it did in the rest of the
world combined. This is going back to 2016.
Under the Fair Drug Pricing Act, you would need to account
for this exceptionally high cost. So, just to look at one
component of what I am talking about, how much does Johnson &
Johnson spend on marketing and advertising for this particular
drug?
Mr. Duato. Senator, thank you for the question. We publish
every year since 6 years ago a report that we call it
transparency report, and we explain our pricing practices and
we give transparency also to the different intermediaries that
play into the model. We disclose our advertising expenses and
our R&D expenses.
What I can tell you is that in 2022, which was the last
year that our report was published and is available, we spent
double in R&D, 110 percent more in R&D that we did in sales and
marketing.
Senator Baldwin. Do you know what that dollar figure is for
sales----
Mr. Duato. I don't have it on my hand, but I will be sure
to follow-up with you to bring it to you. But it was double the
amount in R&D than we did to spend in sales and marketing.
Senator Baldwin. Well, let's look at, Mr. Boerner, the
price of ELIQUIS is--in the U.S. has increased by $4,000 since
its launch. In other countries, the cost of this drug is
decreasing. How much did your company spend on R&D last year?
Mr. Boerner. Our company spent just over $9 billion last
year on R&D.
Senator Baldwin. Then how much did your company spend on
stock buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation last
year?
Mr. Boerner. I don't have that exact figure, Senator. But
we----
Senator Baldwin. Does $12.7 billion sound right from the
health study?
Mr. Boerner. That is roughly correct.
Senator Baldwin. Okay. For the first time, thanks to the
Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare will negotiate the price of
drugs, including ELIQUIS and STELARA, and this is really
welcomed news for families in Wisconsin.
But the truth is, it is really not enough, and my
constituents should not be forced to decide if they should turn
the heat on in winter or buy the medication they need, all
while companies are raking in literally tens of millions of
dollars or billions. We have more work to do.
The Chair. Thank you.
Senator Collins.
Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think
all of us could agree that when a doctor prescribes said needed
medication, that cost should not be an insurmountable barrier
to the patient using it.
Yet for more than half of the adults in my state, according
to a survey, it is a barrier. They are worried about affording
the cost of prescription drugs. And in the last year, nearly
one out of three Maine adults reported skipping a dose of
medicine, cutting pills in half, or not filling a prescription
because of cost.
I talked to a young woman with type 1 diabetes who, after
she aged out of her parents' insurance, started cutting back on
her insulin. She ended up in the emergency room and was gravely
ill because of that.
She felt she just couldn't afford it and took a very unwise
chance. So, this is a huge problem. But another aspect of this
discussion is that many new medications represent true
breakthroughs, disease modifying therapies, or even cures. And
the other part is that literally billions of dollars are
invested in developing drugs that end up to not be successful.
I think we have to balance all of these concerns.
These new drugs often cost more, but they have the
potential to reduce the number of unnecessary hospitalizations
that lead to better patient outcomes. They may be worth it for
disorders like Alzheimer's.
The breakthrough drugs can help keep patients healthier and
active longer, benefiting society as well as their families.
For example, I heard of a patient being diagnosed with mild
cognitive impairment early enough that the patient was able to
benefit from the newly available treatment and actually
returned to the workforce.
That is quite an accomplishment. Now, last year, the
Chairman criticized this particular company for a list price of
$26,500 per year, even after the company, in a really
unprecedented fashion, issued a lengthy analysis of the process
by which they arrived at the price. Still, sticker shock around
list prices and speculative claims that certain therapies will
bankrupt the Medicare program have contributed to restrictive
coverage policies, patient confusion, and limited uptake.
I would like, Mr. Davis, you to discuss how we can balance
the need to have affordable medications without hampering
innovation, and how access to the next--what would be the
impact on access to the next generation of medications if price
controls like those in Europe are implemented? How do you see a
solution to the balance between affordability and innovation?
Mr. Davis. Yes. Senator, thank you for the question. You
know, I would start with at Merck and what are the principles
we apply when we think about how we price drugs, because I
think it also gets to some of the other questions that have
been asked about what stops you from just raising your price.
I can tell you that, as a company, and this goes back to
the core of who we are over 130 years and is truly the purpose
we live by, and that is we look at several elements. We look at
what is the benefit to the patient. But equally we do look at
what is the benefit of the cost to the system. We look at
access and affordability.
I can tell you, for instance, when we launched KEYTRUDA, we
launched at parity to market price, even though we knew we had
a better product, in part because we wanted to ensure access.
We look at all of that, and then we look at what does it
take to absorb the cost of all the failed drugs. We know 90
percent of all drugs we will bring into the clinic fail. The
reality of it is the drugs that make it have to fund that
failure. In the case of Merck, it is just interesting, I think,
to point out.
Since 2014, the minority of drugs we have launched have
actually even returned their cost of R&D. The minority--I am
sorry, the majority have not returned their cost of R&D. So, it
means that when you do get the rare drug that succeeds, it has
to help cover that. So that is what we are facing in the
system.
But as we look at how can we fix this, I think we have to
get to the out-of-pocket costs and we have to find a way to
really drive that down, and then continue to find ways to bring
better access through the types of access programs we have all
talked about here, whether it is through patient assistance
programs, copay assistance, all of the ways we can help the
individual person address that affordability challenge, which
we all know someone who has faced that, and I don't want to see
anyone face that.
Senator Collins. NIH provides a lot of assistance in the
research that--and sometimes partners with pharmaceutical
companies. How is the fact that there has been Federal help,
for example, in the development of the Covid vaccines, how does
that factor into the pricing?
Mr. Davis. Well and obviously, as we look at the system,
the ecosystem we live in, it is important to understand that
all players are important. So, the role of NIH is important.
But the NIH basically does the basic research, if you will.
They provide the lock but they don't have the key. We provide
the key. We take that basic research. We sculpt it into a
molecule.
We are able to say, now that we know a target of disease to
go after, how do we do it? And then we spend our resources in
the most expensive part of the development and the riskiest
part, which is the clinical development, to ensure safety and
efficacy, to bring the drug to market. So, we need all players
in the ecosystem----
Senator Kaine. If I could ask you to start to wrap up for
Senator Smith----
Mr. Davis. Yes. And it is important that we do that. And
so, I think as you look in the Covid vaccine situation, we
didn't have--we did not receive any Federal funding for what we
did. We spent all of our own resources at risk.
We commented, it was $2.5 billion. We did that at risk. But
one of the programs we did do, LAGEVRIO, did have some basis
from the NIH, and they were compensated for that.
Senator Kaine. On behalf of the Chairman, Senator Smith.
Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to all of you
for being with us here today. I appreciate it. I am going to
start with you, Mr. Davis. Could you tell us how much Merck
spends on advertising every year?
Mr. Davis. If you look in the United States, our direct to
consumer advertising is about $350 million.
Senator Smith. Then also direct to medical providers?
Mr. Davis. I don't have that. I wouldn't know that. We can
come back to you on that one.
Senator Smith. Okay. I think it is approximately $2 billion
overall is what I think--is what--worldwide. That is worldwide
number. Pardon me for that.
Mr. Davis. I don't recognize that number, but we can come
back to you.
Senator Smith. Okay. okay. And so one thing I bet most of
us on this panel could agree with is that nobody likes that
advertising. Doctors don't like it. Patients don't like it.
Apparent--I know that the American Medical Association has
called for a ban on direct to consumer advertising.
Could you just address this issue? And I think it is also
true that you sued to prevent regulations that would require
you to disclose the list prices in that advertising. Could you
address that?
Mr. Davis. Yes, I am happy to do that, Senator. So, direct
consumer advertising serves an important purpose.
There has been studies that have shown that it drives
better adherence. It drives patients to understand the use of
their medications. And it overall will bring benefits to the
health system. I do believe there is a valid educational piece
to direct to consumer advertising.
I also believe we need to be full and fair and transparent
in helping people understand the cost of drugs. The reason we
brought suit, the one you are referring to, was our concern
that the specific request that was in that was that you show
the list price of the drug.
Our concern, based on all the conversations we have had
here this morning, is that can often be very misleading, and in
fact, could cause patients not to seek the drug when in
reality, take JANUVIA as an example.
If we put on an advertisement that it is $6,900, when in
reality, if you take the total in the system, it is $690, I
would hate to think someone doesn't show up to get that
medicine because they don't understand the price.
What we supported instead, which is what we do today, in
all of our directing consumer advertising, we drive you to a
site that gives our list price, it gives all of the rebates we
provide so that you can see it, and we get further information
and education.
We think that is a more effective tool and a more accurate
tool to stop the misperceptions that exist. That is why we
raised that concern.
Senator Smith. One of the things that I think is really
confusing for patients is to try to figure out what--you know,
how much things cost in the health system overall, including in
prescription medications.
Let me just ask you, I am going to ask you about this, Dr.
Boerner, how much would acute myeloid leukemia patient, how
much would that patient pay every month for your drug IDHIFA,
the cancer treatment. That if let's say they had a 20 percent
coinsurance responsibility.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, I don't have that exact figure off
the top of my head. What I can say is that for most of our
world oncologic drugs, we are able on the commercial side to
bring copays down to a very low amount and in many cases to
zero.
Now, to a point that was raised earlier, we have to do more
to make that more widely available and an easier process to
actually get into those programs, and we are working on that.
We have been doing that since I became CEO in November, and
that is something we are committed to. And again, I would like
to be able to provide that same benefit on the Medicare side.
Senator Smith. But if you have a list price that is--and I
get what you all are saying about the list price is just the
list price. That isn't necessarily what people pay. But if you
have a list price and then you have a co-insurance
responsibility that is a percentage of the list price, that
could still be quite a significant amount of money. I mean, I
think it could be in this case $6,800 a month for this
medication.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, what you are pointing out is
absolutely why we believe we have got to also look at ways to
bring that list price down.
We have been discussing at length this sort of the
complexity the intermediaries play in this system that lead to
incentives to drive those list prices up.
But unquestionably, because out-of-pocket costs and co-
insurance, for example, are typically tied to that list price,
we have to find ways to bring that list price down.
Senator Smith. Well, I would agree with that. I think that
is a really significant issue, particularly as I think some of
my colleagues have pointed out that when you get to these
patient assistance programs, they are quite confusing and hard
to navigate through.
I think that, sometimes that is only available if you have
commercial insurance. And if you don't have commercial
insurance, then you could really be flat out of luck.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, that is correct. And in fact, I
reference that since I became CEO, one of the things we have
done on the commercial side is really begun to look at how many
hoops do patients have to go through to get access to these
copay support programs?
You know, we have provided $2.5 billion in copay support
programs over the last 5 years as a company, provided $12
billion in free product. But we have got to make it easier and
more universally available for commercial patients to get
access to that.
Again, there are some constraints to us being able to
provide those services on the Medicare side. There is some very
legitimate concerns to providing those on the Medicare side,
because you don't want to obviously be diverting patients from,
for example, generic products onto these as a result of the--
onto branded products as a result of this, but we would love to
work with Members of Congress to find ways to do this
constructively.
Senator Smith. Is it true that the cost of those patient
assistance programs, you can then turn around and deduct on
your taxes, to lower your tax liability?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, I don't know the answer to that, but
I can follow-up.
Senator Smith. Okay. I want to get at the question--I just
have a minute left and so let me see if I can do this really
quickly.
One of the challenges that we have are some pretty--often
pretty severe shortages in medications. And I have heard so
many stories about this from Minnesota folks who, they have a
preferred treatment for a disease and then the drug is not
available.
I want to ask you all--I will just, I will cut to the chase
on this, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski and I have a
piece of legislation that would require reporting of supply
chain disruptions that could lead to shortages in medications,
and I would like to know whether you all would support that
concept to help people understand where these shortages are and
where the route chemicals for their medications are coming
from.
Mr. Duato. We work--excuse me, we work very closely with
the drug shortage office at the FDA, and we are constantly
doing all efforts to dual source the entire supply chain of our
medicines so there is no discontinuation in our supply.
Mr. Davis. I am not familiar with the specifics of the
bill, but I would say in general, the more we can continue to
help understand what are the shortages, we should address that.
But I think we got to get at the fundamental issues of why
do we have a shortage in the first place. I can tell you in our
example, we make a drug called----
Senator Kaine. Again, you are over time. So, could you take
those answers for the record, Senator Smith?
Senator Smith. I would be happy to, Senator Kaine.
Senator Kaine. Great. On behalf of the Chair, Senator
Braun.
Senator Braun. Thank you. I am going to start with Mr.
Davis. What would your definition of a free market be?
Mr. Davis. One where you are able to bring goods, and if
those goods bring value and the system sees value in them, you
are able to bring those at a value you think is fair and
reasonable and negotiate with the other sides, in a world where
you have free competition.
Senator Braun. So right there you said negotiate. Most free
markets are typified by this. And I would like y'all to listen
to this because I think the big challenge, if I were in your
seat running your companies, is that it is not a free market.
A free market means you have got a lot of choices, you have
got vibrant competition, no barriers to entry, and you have got
an engaged consumer. Now, do any of those apply to your
business?
Mr. Davis. I think all of those apply. But I think one
thing we need to understand in our--in the way our business
functions, for a period of time, we have exclusivity. That is
during the patent protection period. Thereafter--and in that
period, we must reap a return on the investments we make to
fund the R&D we do. Thereafter, drugs are freely available and
there is total competition in that space.
Senator Braun. But yet you would sue to keep transparency
in terms of what the consumer price would be or the list price,
or you do things like tweak patents. That doesn't happen
anywhere else. And you are not alone there. Hospitals and
insurance companies do all this stuff behind closed doors as
well.
I would think if I were in your shoes, you have got maybe a
few years before--so none of that stuff really applies to you
guys as I listed it. You might try to spin it that way, but it
is not the case. I fixed it in my own business back in, oh,
probably 15, 16 years ago by creating health care consumers, by
trying to avoid the system through wellness and prevention,
which you don't hear much about.
But when you do need it, it has got to be there where you
have got a lot of options. And I understand you are a little
different in terms of the R&D that goes into it. Then many
years ago, you created a monster called the PBM that now is
sucking all kinds of money out of the market.
Why can't you fix that in terms of doing alternative ways
that would just smother the market with transparency and get it
into a different channel of distribution? You got a guy like
Mark Cuban that is trying to start a company, Cost Plus.
You are going to probably need to find things like that or
you are going to be appearing more often here, and it is going
to be where you are going to be regulated like a utility would
be. Because in my opinion, you operate more like an unregulated
utility kind of cloak yourselves behind free enterprise, and
now it is up to 18, 19 percent of our GDP. Something has got to
give.
Senator Sanders talked earlier about things costing 10
percent to 25 percent overseas, and I think I heard the excuse
was, well they have price controls. Well, I think I would be
smart enough to know that sooner or later that will occur here.
It is going to be up to the industry to fix it, and you are
probably just 15 to 20 percent of the problem.
You could fix the part that you get the most heat for by
maybe trying to get more customers like the business Mark Cuban
is putting out there that is based upon transparency. If not,
you are going to get all the people that don't own health care
businesses finally saying, we are not going to pay through the
private side, the insurance system, three to four times what it
costs through Government.
I will let you complete the logical chain. You are going to
have Government as your business partner. So, why would you
persist in a paradigm that looks like you are going to be
headed toward what you definitely don't want, and that is doing
more business with the Federal Government? Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. Well, I don't want to speculate on the system as
a whole. I think what I focus on is what do we need to do to
drive the mission of our company, which is in the near term,
bring access and affordability.
Make sure that when we bring affordability, we don't
sacrifice access. Often patients lose access when we try to
address affordability. And that we fund innovation. And that
is--whatever ultimately we come to as a solution, if we can
protect those elements, I think we will both help patients of
today and we can make----
Senator Braun. Have you ever looked at having some other
system of distribution, like almost any other manufacturer
would have when you make something? You do a pretty good job
making the pill.
You completely default on how it gets from where you make
it to who uses it. You are putting independent pharmacies out
of business because the PBMs and other kind of peculiarities in
the industry.
Have you thought about, at least in the place where most
people confront the health care system with a prescription,
about trying to restructure that, smother it with transparency
and options to where people can get their stuff, and then apply
that to biologics and the entirety of a spectrum, and don't
tweak the patents and try to preserve a broken system.
Mr. Davis. Yes. So, we have considered should we look at
going direct.
The reality of it is, as a single company, when you have
now today three PBMs controlling 80 percent of the lives in
this country, the ability to do that takes a portfolio of
characteristics that we don't currently have.
I don't believe any one company can do that. That is why we
continue to believe we need free market, but we----
Senator Braun. I bet if you collectively got together with
the other drug companies and encouraged others like a Cost Plus
that Mark Cuban has done to where you are going--I think you
have got it under your control not to perpetuate a bad
situation that was created by you. I mean, you make it.
You don't have to necessarily use PBMs. Why don't you
encourage an alternative structure? At least show us that you
are wanting to compete. Because all I can tell you is that if
you don't take it--take the bull by the horns, do something
different, you are going to be like all other countries.
You are going to be dealing with the Federal Government as
a regulated entity, and I think we could lose some things. But
in the meantime, Senator Sanders pointed it out, it costs a lot
more here, the health care outcomes are better there, and
pharma, hospitals, and insurance better figure it out before it
is too late.
The Chair. Senator Hickenlooper.
Senator Hickenlooper. First, I will echo what Senator Braun
said. Second, I will thank each of you for taking the time. And
I know how busy you are, and I appreciate you coming in and
answering questions.
You know, I grew up like most of us, I think, looking at
our pharmaceutical companies as treasures, as companies that
America could be rightfully proud of as innovators. But that is
slipping away.
When I am back in Colorado, I hear much--let's just be
generous--let's be gracious and say a wider diversity of
opinion. According to a recent YouGov survey, more than a third
of Americans report that cost has prevented them from filling a
prescription they need.
A separate Kaiser Family Foundation poll, this one just
from last year, said that 83 percent of Americans rated profits
made by pharmaceutical companies as the overwhelming
contributing factor to the high cost of prescription drugs.
You have all talked about the R&D, the innovation, which
there could be no question about that, but what is the value of
these cutting edge drugs and therapies if so many people can't
afford them?
I think that widespread belief that Americans feel your
companies are too focused on profits, it damages your
credibility and I think the culture of your businesses and the
culture of your customers.
I want to see how you feel about that in terms of the
importance of people believing in your mission again, or
believing as strongly that you are good leaders of the mission.
Why don't we start with you, Mr. Duato.
Mr. Duato. Thank you, Senator. I can assure you that the
50,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson in the U.S. wake up every
day thinking what they can do for patients, and I can represent
proudly that sentiment.
What can we do to address the real inequity that exists in
the U.S., which is that seniors and patients that need the
medicines the most pay higher out-of-pocket costs. In my view,
that is the real problem.
There are other things that are positive in the U.S.
healthcare system, like the access to breakthrough, cutting
edge treatments earlier than any other country in the world,
but it is true, we have a real inequity there.
I think we have to work together in order to address that
inequity, and there is multiple ways that we can work on that.
One is to make sure that----
Senator Hickenlooper. Just give me one, because I want to
make sure--I have got a couple more questions.
Mr. Duato. One is to make sure that the discounts and
rebates, we paid $39 billion in 2022, that we pay to the
middleman, are passed to the patients, so we can lower the out-
of-pocket costs.
Senator Hickenlooper. Got it. That is a good one.
Mr. Davis. Senator, I appreciate the question. And I can
tell you at Merck, we have lived by the statement our founder
put out, that medicines are for the patients not for the
profits. But so long as we have remember that, the profits
follow.
It really says we can both do good and do well for our
shareholders together. And there is a balance. And I think what
you are talking about is where is the balance? And we are
always trying to find that balance.
I am very much focused on it as the CEO of the company,
because the legacy of Merck, the pride of our 70,000 employees
and what we do matters to me, and a strong belief in the
mission of the company.
It is why I came to the company, and it is why I am in this
industry. So, we are very committed to that. But I do think the
challenge we continue to face is the structural issues in the
system that are creating the problem.
Senator Hickenlooper. We have heard that. I get it.
Mr. Davis. Yes.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, the challenge that we are facing in
this Committee today and what we have been discussing is, how
do we ensure affordability today without sacrificing tomorrow's
innovation? That is what we were focused on.
We have got to make sure we do what you have heard from all
of us, are bringing highly innovative medicines to patients,
but we also have to do a better job of ensuring that we are
bringing drugs like ELIQUIS to market, which save the health
care system money.
For every 100,000 patients on ELIQUIS, we estimate we save
the health care system $5 billion. We have got to place a high
bar on the medicines we bring to patients and stick by that as
an industry.
Senator Hickenlooper. All right. Well, and I appreciate
that. And I do--health is so precious to people that they will
pay almost anything if it is serious, so that in a funny way,
sometimes we see increasing costs based on that calculus of how
much money we are avoiding, which I think can be a false
pathway sometimes.
But certainly, as a user of ELIQUIS and grateful
recognizing what the old system was and how better ELIQUIS is,
I salute that. The higher cost and the lower cost in other
countries, you have all answered that.
I understand there is some price setting there. But I think
the solution--I mean, we are paying double. Even when you take
out the PBMs and the list price from the net price, we are
paying double what Europe or Canada and Australia are paying,
and somehow that has got to be a negotiation that the rest of
the world probably has to pay more, and you guys are going to
have to figure out a way to do that.
I am not saying it is easy, but it is one of those things.
I want to--it is one of those things we have to address as a
country and as an industry. I want to ask, earlier there is
some mention of river blindness, of issues in underserved
countries.
I want to see if each of you have a--just a quick example
of something where your company has gone in there, obviously we
have heard about Merck, but done something in a country like
that where it really was philanthropic.
Mr. Duato. Thank you, thank you. We dedicate billions of
dollars every year to treat diseases that do not have an
economic counterpart. For example, one of the diseases that we
have contributed to its treatment and eradication is intestinal
worms.
You know, we donate billions of pills every year in order
to treat intestinal worms. We have programs to support
frontline health care workers in the developing world that have
supported more than a million frontline healthcare workers.
We develop a medicine for multidrug resistant tuberculosis,
which is widely used in every single protocol and which we are
not enforcing our patents as we speak. So, we have made
significant contributions.
Senator Hickenlooper. That is impressive, but we most
people don't know about that stuff. Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. Well, you mentioned Dymethazine donation, where
we have $4.6 billion. I would add another one we did. You know,
recently--and we were very focused on COVID now, we forget
about Ebola and the scourge of Ebola that hit in 2014, 2016, in
Western Africa.
We actually--and no profit to us, developed an Ebola
vaccine. Have distributed that, continue to distribute that
drug to address that devastating disease.
Senator Hickenlooper. Mr. Boerner.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we had as a reference to large
presence in HIV, and I am incredibly proud that in the late
90's, our foundation worked with governments and local
communities to set up the core infrastructure to deliver HIV
medicines to sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on children.
The President of Botswana recently congratulated the--or
thanked the BMX Foundation for saving a generation from
extinction, his words. We are now leveraging that same
infrastructure, partnering with Baylor College of Medicine, to
reverse something in childhood cancer----
The Chair. Mr. Boerner, thank you. I am sorry. His time has
expired. Apologize.
Senator Hickenlooper. Anyway, thank you all. And I think
those stories need to get out. But we also have to solve this
issue of the price disparity.
The Chair. Senator Kaine.
Senator Kaine. Thank you. Since I have 7 minutes, I am
going to do 2 minutes to celebrate innovation and then 5
minutes to go after the cost question.
On the innovation side, there is an article that came out
in the Health Affairs Journal in September 2020, and I would
like to put it in the record, Contributions of Public Health,
Pharmaceuticals, and other Medical Care to U.S. Life Expectancy
Changes, 1990 to 2015.
[The following information can be found on page 110 in
Additional Material.]
Senator Kaine. The article looked at the fact that between
1990 and 2015, life expectancy in the U.S. increased by 3.3
years, and the authors of the researchers and authors of the
study were able to say 44 percent of that increase was because
of public health measures, 35 percent of the increase was
attributable to pharmaceutical innovation, and 13 percent of
the increase was attributable to other improvements in medical
care, with 7 percent unknown.
But the fact that pharmaceuticals led to more than a third
of that increase in life expectancy is something that we need
to acknowledge as a context to this discussion.
In a Virginia example--Mr. Davis, you will know this
example very well. In Elkton, Virginia, there is a plant that
produces GARDASIL, which your company developed and began to
market in the mid 2000's--2006, 2007.
It is a vaccine against a virus, the HPV virus, that
create--that leads to a lot of cancers, especially cervical
cancer and other as well. And that has just been revolutionary
in terms of cervical cancer.
We were one of the first states to put a vaccine mandate in
place for HPV vaccine, and cervical cancer among vaccinated
populations has dropped 70 plus percent just in the last 15
years. I mean, it is truly remarkable.
I have been to that plant, and I know how proud people are
to work there and believe that they have been at the vanguard
of a revolution that has helped so many Americans, but people
all around the world. So, that is the good side.
Okay, now we got to get to the reality for the hearing
which is, people here still pay too much out of pocket.
Together with my colleagues here who voted for the Inflation
Reduction Act, we said for a long time that we ought to be
negotiating on prescription drug prices and we did it. And it
passed by only one vote in the Senate.
Each of us who voted for it, we were the deciding vote. And
I know not everybody likes that, but it is working. We put the
cap, the out of pocket cost cap on seniors under Medicare.
We did the $35 insulin for seniors on the Medicare. And
thank goodness that sent such a strong market signal that many
of the companies that were reducing insulin cost to $35 a month
said, we will just do it for not just Medicare patients, but
others. And they wouldn't have done that had we not taking that
step in the IRA.
But there is more that we can do. And I really want to
focus on one thing, because I think it is just right before us.
This Committee took strong bipartisan action about 9 months ago
on this PBM reform bill that is sitting on the floor of the
Senate right now.
I don't expect you to be the masters of all the details of
that bill, but if we were to pass a meaningful PBM reform
bill--and much of the conversation today has been about this
weird difference between list prices and actual net prices.
If we were able to pass a meaningful PBM reform bill, what
would that do to the cost that American patients are paying out
of pocket for pharmaceuticals? Please, and I will ask each of
you to address that. Mr. Duato.
Mr. Duato. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, and thank you for
recognizing the value for patients of pharmaceutical
innovation.
If we were able to pass meaningful reform, meaning a reform
that would delink the revenues of the PBMs and insurance
companies from the list price, and that would pass rebates and
discounts to the patients, I would anticipate two things. One,
it would affect list prices.
Two, it would significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost
for the patients. So, I welcome the bipartisan efforts of this
Committee to go through PBM reform. It is a linchpin of
lowering the cost for patients.
Senator Kaine. Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. Yes. You know, I also believe that in the
provisions that are in the bill, at least some of the big ones
around transparency and also de-linking are definitely steps in
the right direction. I think we need them.
There are a lot of what we have all been focusing on in our
testimony and in the question and answers, and I do think it
will--it can benefit patients if we move in that direction, so
I am very supportive of what you are trying to do.
Senator Kaine. Mr. Boerner.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, if we could do that and we could
reduce the significant amount that we are paying in rebates to
intermediaries who are not passing those rebates on to lower
out-of-pocket costs, speaking on behalf of Bristol-Myers
Squibb, we could work almost immediately to begin to bring down
list prices, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with
this Committee to do that.
Senator Kaine. Well, I know that in conversations with the
Chair, the intent is to move on that bill pretty soon,
potentially with some other health items as well. And I think
that the opportunity is right before us.
That bill passed out of Committee overwhelmingly
bipartisan. I think it was an 18 to 3 vote, and that tells us
that we would have some amendment on the floor. The de-linking
provision was not in the bill.
The Chair and Ranking were supportive of the concept, but
at the time we marked it up, the CBO hadn't given us the score,
and so we agreed that we would wait on that until we got on the
floor. But the CBO has now scored the de-linking bill that
Senators Marshall, Capito, Braun, and I, and Tester have co-
sponsored, and the CBO says that it would save about $650
million over 10 years.
That is in addition to the savings for patients. So, I know
we would try, hopefully on the floor to add that in. My
colleagues have all talked about the reality of what they hear
from constituents, and I hear the same thing.
I know, I think the complexity of the system and the fact
that list price is different than net price, and the fact that
we have rebates, ``rebates,'' that never show up in people's
pockets. And you have programs to try to assist folks who can't
afford medicines, but they have a six page application form,
and both a sticker price might scare them off or a six page
application might scare them off.
We just have to simplify this and cut out a lot of the
middlemen in this instance. I have long said to the Chair that
I am very concerned about PBMs because we might fight with you
about whether you are researching enough or should your
research be more than your stock buybacks.
PBMs aren't doing a single bit of research. They are not
producing a single product. And yet, they seem to me to be the
ones that are scooping up the most of money that is just
sloshing through the system right now, so I hope we can address
that soon. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
The Chair. Senator Lujan.
Senator Lujan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to
everyone who is here today. Biosimilar competition is one way
to drive down drug costs for patients and increase access.
Would you all agree with that?
Mr. Davis. Yes.
Mr. Duato. Yes.
Mr. Boerner. Yes.
Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Now, one of the concerns
I have is we often see competition stifled in this particular
area with biosimilars.
The concern that I have is tactics and delay that lead to
entry of the lower cost biosimilar drugs keep patients from
often having a choice, but also being able to afford their
prescription drugs.
Now, Mr. Davis, yes or no, will you commit to not blocking
other drugmakers from entering the market when the primary
patent on KEYTRUDA expires?
Mr. Davis. Well, Senator, at Merck--and we do believe that
biosimilar competition and generic competition is core to the
system. We need the patent protection, and then we need a
robust biosimilar and generic market.
I can tell you that, when the composition of matter patents
expire on our drug KEYTRUDA, I fully expect, and I will not try
to stop a biosimilar IV version of KEYTRUDA coming on to the
marketplace.
Senator Lujan. Is that a yes?
Mr. Davis. That is a yes.
Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Mr. Boerner, yes or no,
will you commit to not blocking other drugmakers from entering
the market when your primary patent on ELIQUIS expires?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we have a number of patents on
ELIQUIS, and we have certainly anticipated that when the
patents that are most relevant for that product expire, we will
have generic competition in this case, not biosimilar, but
generic competition, and that would be around 2028.
Senator Lujan. When the primary patent expires on ELIQUIS,
will you commit to not blocking other drugmakers from entering
the market?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, I don't--I am not a patent attorney,
so I am not entirely----
Senator Lujan. You are the CEO.
Mr. Boerner. Senator, I would say that when the most
important, the most relevant patents expire on ELIQUIS, we will
welcome generic competition.
Senator Lujan. Is that a yes or no?
Mr. Boerner. That is a yes, Senator.
Senator Lujan. Mr. Boerner, I have the same question on
OPDIVO. Yes or no, will you commit to not blocking other
drugmakers from entering the market when your primary patent
expires?
Mr. Boerner. When the most relevant patents for OPDIVO
expire, we would fully expect biosimilars to enter the market.
Senator Lujan. Your answer is yes when--the words you are
using are relevant patents, not the primary patent. Is that the
clarification that I can--?
Mr. Boerner. Yes, Senator. I am just not certain exactly
what the most--what you are referring to is the primary patent,
but when we--when those patents expire, we welcome generic
company.
Senator Lujan. First patent, primary, the initial one. The
one that was filed when you got this drug done. Look, I am not
a lawyer. I am not a CEO. I don't work at all. If I am not
using the wrong words, please help me a little bit. You know
what I am talking about here.
Mr. Boerner. Yes. When the composition--generally it is
when the composition of matter patent expires.
Senator Lujan. That doesn't sound like a yes. I hear what
you are saying. I am going to move on. Mr. Duato, we know that
J&J entered into settlement agreements to delay the launch of
some STELARA biosimilars in 2025.
This will prevent competition in the drug market and
Medicare negotiation, the way I read it. Will you commit to
lowering the price of STELARA in 2025?
Mr. Duato. Senator, thank you for the question. I
anticipate that the price of STELARA will actually be lower in
2025, as it has been lowering during the past decade. The path
of STELARA has been a steady decline in the net prices, and I
anticipate that the biosimilars in 2025 will further decrease
the price of STELARA.
Senator Lujan. Are you answering yes to my question?
Mr. Duato. Yes.
Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Now, we have heard over
and over that Medicare drug pricing negotiations will kill
innovation.
Mr. Boerner, I want to get a few things clear. Yes or no,
is it BMS's position as stated in its lawsuit against the
Health and Human Services that, ``the IRA's real victim is
innovation, and in turn, the millions of patients who are
counting on the pharmaceutical industry to develop new
therapies, will save lives, and improve health and well-
being.''
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we have serious concerns about
elements of IRA, specifically the fact that this isn't an
actual negotiation. We obviously like some elements of IRA,
notably the out-of-pocket costs, but----
Senator Lujan. I appreciate that, but do you stand by this
statement that was filed in the lawsuit to the United States
Health and Human Services Department?
Mr. Boerner. We have very serious concerns about the
implication of IRA----
Senator Lujan. Do you stand by this statement?
Mr. Boerner. Yes, sir.
Senator Lujan. Yes or no, is it also true that you said in
your Q4 earnings call, ``we see a legacy portfolio of well-
established products facing headwinds such as IRA.'' Through
this portfolio--``or though this portfolio is declining, it is
expected to continue to generate strong cash-flows to enable
investment in our future growth drivers.'' Do you stand by
that?
Mr. Boerner. Yes. We actually have a legacy product
portfolio that will continue to provide the necessary funds to
innovate and bring the next wave of innovation to market, yes,
Senator.
Senator Lujan. Based on that, can I interpret that cash-
flows were generated even though the IRA went to place, and
they are sufficient to support new innovations, as was reported
to the investors?
Mr. Boerner. Senator, we don't yet have IRA having been
fully implemented negotiation. That process is ongoing. But we
are generating cash-flows off of our existing products to fund
innovation, sir.
Senator Lujan. The statement in the same filing to Health
and Human Services, what that case said, this portfolio--though
the portfolio is declining, it is expected to continue to
generate strong cash-flows to enable investment in our future
growth drivers. So, is it generating cash?
Mr. Boerner. Our legacy portfolio products is continuing to
generate cash, yes, sir.
Senator Lujan. So even in the face of IRA, you are
generating cash?
Mr. Boerner. Again, Senator, we haven't actually finished
negotiation yet on our first drug, which is----
Senator Lujan. I will move on. I appreciate that very much.
This is one of--look, I grew up on a small farm in Northern New
Mexico. When a cow does its business in the barn, there is a
pile of stuff I have got to go clean. That is what it is. It is
manure. It has other a lot of other languages, but that is what
it is.
I don't understand why this is so complex. The people in
the room make these darn things so complex when no one
understands them. I am beside myself, Mr. Chairman, that when a
question was asked, can you break down where the money goes in
this particular drug?
The answer is, well, it is complicated. We don't know. I am
hoping it is included in the filings for investors that people
know where the money--well, I will follow-up with more
questions.
I have several, Mr. Chairman, but you all, help me and
other laymen across the country and around the world to be able
to understand what the heck is going on. You all have some good
lawyers.
Maybe 1 day I will go to law school and try to get a gig
with one of you. I don't know, but this is just frustrating.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
The Chair. Senator Markey.
Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.
Research is medicine's field of dreams from which we harvest to
the indings to give hope to families that a cure can be found
for the disease which has been running through their family's
history. That is what it is all about. That is what we all hope
for.
That is what I represent in Boston, in Kendall Square, two
miles from my house, and I have been for 47 years in Congress
trying to help that industry to be able to grow and to be able
to get the resources from NIH, all the resources to make the
breakthroughs, to give hope to ordinary families, like my
father who drove a truck for the Hood Milk Company.
The companies have done great work over the years, but that
funding, which I was on the Health Committee in these--in the
House for 36.5 years, and I fought very hard for NIH funding,
and those NIH dollars delivered results. For example, between
2010 and 2016, every drug approved by the FDA was in some way
based on biomedical research funded by the NIH.
My father, the truck driver at the Hood Milk Company one
mile from Kendall Square, he paid his taxes to make sure that
the funding would go to NIH so that research could be made in
order to make the breakthroughs that would help him and help
his families.
Merck's former president, and you have already quoted him,
Mr. Davis, he said we never try to forget that medicine is for
the people--you know, my father--it is not for the profits. And
Merck's website states that this philosophy is embraced by
their leaders and the employees to this day.
FDA approved the cancer drug KEYTRUDA in 2014, based on NIH
research that my father helped to pay for as a truck driver at
the Hood Milk Company. And last year, the list price was
$191,000 for this cancer drug that helps patients with lung
cancer and other cancers, $191,000 a year.
The annual meeting and proxy statement of 2023, says that
it brought in $21 billion in revenue for the company, and it
was driving key growth for Merck's business. And at the same
time, patients are also straining under insurance premiums,
struggling to afford this drug, taking on debt, or skipping
treatments altogether.
Merck has now filed a 168 patents on this cancer drug,
KEYTRUDA. And as we know from this early discussion when we
discuss this, we can be talking about primary patents or
secondary patents.
What I heard earlier was that the witnesses in general just
want all the secondary patents to also be exhausted. Now, to a
very large extent, of course, 168 patents then bring at least
168 lawyers into the room.
How do we use this patent in order to thwart another
smaller company, hundreds of smaller companies from now making
the breakthroughs that advance even further the breakthroughs,
innovating, discovering. 168 new patents extend further, using
lawyers, you know the time at which there can be a lower price
drug made available to people so that they can get the
treatment, which they need for lung cancer.
Yes, we believe in competition, and we really believe in
competition. In Massachusetts, we believe in Darwinian paranoia
inducing competition. But when there is a monopoly on a drug,
which is the key drug, there is no competition.
There is no paranoia if 168 patents just extend and extend
the ability to have new companies, smaller companies, smarter,
new scientists to make the additional breakthroughs. And that
is the play. We understand the play.
That is how lawyers get into it, not scientists. You keep
the lawyers, keep the smarter new 25 year old out with the new
insight just by extending and extending. I do believe in
research.
Adam Smith hated monopolies. It was the No. 1 thing he
hated the most, monopolies. And so, in this particular
instance, my father died from lung cancer. And my father was--
drove a truck. So, the list price for KEYTRUDA is more than his
entire pension. That is what he got from the Hood Milk Company.
One year of his entire pension would have paid for 1 year,
and he died from lung cancer. And I don't think that Judge
Merck really intended that, that would be what the result of
research, ultimately did.
Mr. Davis, would it have been consistent with Judge Merck's
philosophy to take research funded by my father's tax dollars,
to invent a lifesaving lung cancer drug, charge him hundreds of
thousands of dollars of his hard earned retirement for it,
manipulate the market using patent law to block out competition
that could have brought in new scientists that could have
improved it and lowered the cost, and as a result, the costs
are unaffordable.
Then use the income you got from him to brag to your
investors about the drug as a key growth area for your
business. Do you think that is what Judge Merck intended when
he had that high minded philosophy, which he used to describe
Merck's----
The Chair. In 17 seconds.

Mr. Davis. Are you looking for the answer now?
Senator Markey. Yes.
Mr. Davis. Okay. Well, I would say, the quote was, medicine
is for the patients, not for the profits. But so long as we
remember that the profits have always followed.
What he was capturing was if you focus on bringing new
medicines to benefit patients today and make sure you have an
investment and a return to bring medicines for the future--
because we are a biopharmaceutical research company.
Research is who we are. Innovation is the lifeblood of our
company. Then we can deliver for the mission to the patients.
And I can tell you at Merck, and I am very proud of this, we
always put patients at the center, and we always look at ways
to do that, and that will continue to be what we do.
I do think actually what we are doing is consistent because
it allows us to be sustainable for the long term to deliver for
patients into the future.
Senator Markey. I just think----
The Chair. Thank you.
Senator Markey. I just think it has turned into medicine
for the shareholders and not medicine for the people like my
father.
The Chair. Okay. Let me--that is the last line of
questioning. So, let me thank our three panelists for being
here today, and all the Senators who participated. We are now
going to turn to our second panel. Thank you all very much,
gentlemen.
Mr. Davis. Thank you very much.
Mr. Boerner. Thank you.
The Chair. Thank you all very much for being here. We have
three very knowledgeable guests, panelists, on prescription
drugs and pricing.
Our first witness will be Peter Maybarduk, who is the
Director of Access to Medicines Program at Public Citizen.
He is a lawyer who has advocated for stronger price
regulation and stronger public health protections in patent law
in the U.S. and around the world. Mr. Maybarduk, thanks very
much for being with us.
STATEMENT OF PETER MAYBARDUK, J.D., ACCESS TO MEDICINES
DIRECTOR, PUBLIC CITIZEN, WASHINGTON, DC
Mr. Maybarduk. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy,
Members of the Committee, thank you. Public Citizen is a
national public interest organization. We have 500,000 members
and supporters, and for 50 years we have advocated with success
for health and consumer protections.
Drug prices are high because of monopoly power, leading to
the rationing of treatment and preventable suffering. 1 in 3
Americans has failed to take medicine as prescribed due to
cost. Like Louise Chisholm of Fort Worth, who tells us of
Merck's diabetes drug, I need JANUVIA to control my blood
sugar, but I can't afford it while on Social Security.
Robert Cherivano of Loveland, Colorado, and his wife both
trying to afford J&J XARELTO, why do we have to pay so much? We
are 90 and 81 on Social Security. Does anyone care about the
elderly? Keith Clyburn, Lafayette, Louisiana, I am paying for
ELIQUIS and other pricey meds from BMX. So, what do I do? I
ration them so that I can eat and pay rent.
Patients for Affordable Drugs has compiled 34,000 such
stories from people struggling to afford their medicine, and
that is a tiny fraction, a mere sample of the heartbreaking
problems out there.
High prices cost people their health. They can cost lives.
They force impossible family budget decisions. We all pay for
high prices, whether we are patients or not, whether out of
pocket or through higher insurance premiums and wasted tax
dollars. Medicare and Medicaid spent nearly $200 billion on
prescription drugs last year.
Americans pay the highest prices in the world three times
what other countries pay, and that is net prices not list, to
the point of the last panel--three times more in net prices,
the real prices. We also do the most to support research and
development.
The world's largest biomedical research funder is a public
funder, the National Institutes of Health, and we should be
very proud of it, contributing more than $45 billion a year and
laying groundwork for many, if not most, new medicines.
Plus, public support is now indispensable to the late stage
development of 1 in 4 drugs also. We the people drive
innovation together. So, Americans first pay for the research,
then contribute to the development.
Then on top of it, when the drug comes to market pay the
highest prices in the world. Other countries broadly negotiate
prices to protect their people, but here, pharma has accrued
tremendous influence in our politics, spending hundreds of
millions a year in lobbying, outranking every other industry.
Now, our Government provides patent protection and
exclusivity on medicines. In theory, this should support
innovation. But in practice, drug corporations write the rules,
extending monopoly power sometimes for decades, blocking
competition far longer than this body intends.
Senators, it is not a market in the way that you may
believe, respectfully. The corporations testifying here today
claim any price relief would compromise their ability to invest
in new medicines.
No, that framing erases the millions of Americans rationing
treatment. It erases the tens of billions of dollars the tax
taxpayers invest in R&D for real health priorities.
It erases the hundreds of billions of dollars the industry
spends on self-enrichment. Last year, drugmakers selected for
Medicare negotiation spent $10 billion more on stock buybacks,
dividends, and executive compensation than they spent on R&D.
J&J and BMX each spent $3 billion more on these self-
enriching activities. And over the prior decade, Merck's
buybacks and dividends also exceed R&D by $3 billion. J&J spent
an impressive $43 billion more on buybacks and dividends than
R&D over this period. Of course, drugmakers do not set prices
according to R&D costs.
Instead, the price of a patented drug is simply the most
that we as a society are willing to pay to care for our sick
and loved ones, where monopoly power blocks affordable
alternatives, blocks market competition, and we have little
choice.
Today, perhaps for the first time, our Country is making
progress, challenging high prices and rationing, including
through price negotiation, encountering price spikes, and we
commend the Committee's attention to this problem. But the
problem is getting worse, much worse, and more action is
needed.
We should negotiate prices from the moment a drug hits
market, not wait a decade as we are today, which cost taxpayers
tens of billions of dollars. We support legislation before your
Committee to strengthen market competition and transparency and
accelerate generic entry. Ultimately, we will have to confront
monopoly power.
That is the rotten foundation allowing drug makers to
project influence, to game the law, and keep prices high.
Other real challenges, including providing patient
assistance and challenging middlemen who take advantage, real
problems, but these flow inevitably from the patent monopolies
that make it so lucrative and so easy to rip off patients.
We can, we must do better for health, for access to
medicines. Thank you for your time. Please count us with you in
this fight.

Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy and Members of the
Committee,
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the high prices
Americans pay for prescription drugs. I am Peter Maybarduk, Access to
Medicines Director of Public Citizen. Public Citizen is a national
public interest organization with more than 500,000 members and

health, safety and consumer protections; for corporate and government
accountability; and in more recent years, for affordable access to
essential medicines and biomedical technologies.
I. The Drug Pricing Crisis at the Hands of the Pharmaceutical Industry
This hearing unfolds against the backdrop of a drug pricing crisis
in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
(CDC) data from 2021 shows approximately 9.2 million Americans aged18-
64 are unable to take medications as prescribed due to costs. \1\ 2023
Kaiser data on all adults shows that three in 10 Americans have not
taken their medications as prescribed due to costs, 82 percent of
Americans say the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, and 73
percent say that the government is not doing enough to regulate drug
prices. \2\ People with disabilities are three times more likely not to
take medications as prescribed due to cost barriers. \3\

Americans also confront the highest drug prices in the world,
paying nearly three times more for the same drugs than other countries.
\4\ For the 20 top-selling drugs worldwide, drug corporations made more
than $100 billion from sales to American patients in comparison to $57
billion from all other countries combined in 2020. \5\ This pricing
disparity is even more egregious considering significant taxpayer
funded contributions to drug development. The taxpayer funded National
Institutes of Health is the largest public funder of biomedical
research in the world, investing nearly $45 billion in U.S. taxpayer
dollars. \6\ Much of this funding focuses on the foundational research
on biological targets for drug action that drug development is based
upon. \7\ Further, recent estimates suggest that publicly supported
research was critical to the late-stage development of one in four
drugs. \8\

fact-sheet (last visited Feb. 5, 2024).
Excessive drug prices and self-imposed rationing by American
patients are the outgrowth of unregulated pharmaceutical monopoly power
over drug prices. Prescription drug corporations receive government-
granted patent protection on drug inventions and statutory
exclusivities on medicines. In theory, this incentivizes innovation of
new medicines, and it is critically important that we support research
and development. But in practice, the rules have been written by or
with the deep influence of drug corporations, to maximize their ability
to extract rents from our healthcare system. Corporations extend their
exclusive power over new drugs through an array of anticompetitive
tactics to the detriment of American patients. \10\ For example, many
have abused the patent system to obtain subsequent patents over the
same medicine with marginal differences or benefits to retain longer
periods of exclusivity, sometimes decades. \11\

High Cost of Prescription Drugs in the United States: Origins and
Prospects for Reform, 316 JAMA NETWORK 858 (2016).
\11\ Other tactics they use to maintain their extraordinary
pricing power over essential medicines include switching patients from
branded medications with patent protection nearing expiry to new drugs
with no added clinical benefit and longer patent protection. Drug
corporations also pay generic companies to delay their competing
products in order to extract more profits.
Pharmaceutical companies have exploited their monopoly power to
accrue tremendous influence in our political system and protect their
exceptional profits. The pharmaceutical industry expends hundreds of
millions of dollars each year in lobbying efforts to advance its
interests, outranking every other industry. \12\ When Medicare Part D
was established to cover prescription costs for seniors two decades
ago, pharmaceutical companies successfully lobbied to deprive the
program of the power to negotiate drug prices. \13\ Federal law
requires private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid to cover FDA approved
drugs, which effectively provides a government mandate to buy
companies' monopolized drugs with absent or weak measures to contain
costs. \14\

Drugmakers' largely unregulated, and government-expanded, pricing
power has rewarded them with exceptional profits. To protect these
profits, pharma trade groups claim that any measure that could deliver
drug pricing relief to Americans will restrict resources to invest in
new medicines and help patients in the future. \16\ That framing
usefully erases the millions of Americans that currently self-ration
their medicines and are harmed due to pricing abuses. It also erases
the tens of billions of taxpayer dollars invested annually in research
and development, and the hundreds of billions the industry spends on
self-enrichment.

The Biden administration is making significant progress in
addressing our Nation's drug pricing crisis through implementation of
Medicare drug price negotiation, inflationary rebates, the cap on out-
of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month for Medicare enrollees,
the caps on annual out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs in the
catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D that will be set at $2,000 next
year, and other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. Bipartisan
reforms which this Committee has considered and advanced can build on
that progress. \17\ However, far more is necessary to provide material
relief to all patients facing unbearably high prescription drug prices,
including people with private insurance and those without insurance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ Specifically, Public Citizen supports legislation to promote
generic competition and lower drug prices through taking on drug
corporation citizen petition abuse and exclusivity ``parking'',
clarifying the scope of orphan drug exclusivity, and providing greater
transparency for generic applicants. Additionally, Public Citizen has
supported bipartisan measures advanced through the Judiciary Committee
that address pay-for-delay, product hopping and citizen petition
abuses.
\18\ Public Citizen also supports legislation to build on the
Inflation Reduction Act, through expanding the number of drugs
negotiated, who benefits from negotiated prices, and reducing and
removing the negotiation delay periods currently mandated. Public
Citizen has also supported legislation reducing the biologics
exclusivity period to 5 years, in parity with that afforded small
molecule drugs, and legislation to require reasonable pricing of
federally----funded medical inventions. Public Citizen has repeatedly
called on Congress to advance insulin access reform to ensure people
without insurance and with private insurance can access affordable
insulin. Public Citizen also strongly supports additional solutions to
address patent thicketing suggested by the Initiative for Medicines,

To highlight the need for stronger measures to deliver drug pricing
relief to millions of Americans, this testimony focuses on the drug
pricing abuses of Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and Bristol Myers Squibb.
In our view, these corporations have taken advantage of weaknesses in
our health system to price gouge Americans and used suspect patenting
practices to unfairly extend their monopoly power.
II. Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and Bristol Myers Squibb Engage in
Pricing Abuses of Life-Saving Medicines
Merck
Merck takes advantage of its monopoly power to excessively price
its blockbuster drug, Keytruda, which treats many different cancer
types, \19\ and Januvia, a widely used drug to treat diabetes. \20\
Additionally, Merck exploits its monopoly protections to price gouge
Americans on the federally funded COVID-19 treatment, Lagevrio, that
cuts the risk of hospitalization. \21\ For Keytruda and Januvia, Merck
has been granted patent protection beyond their active ingredient or
mechanism, which helps prolong its monopoly control over these drugs by
deterring manufacturers from bringing more affordable alternatives to
market.

Keytruda
______
First, Merck exploits its monopoly protections in Keytruda to price
the drug outrageously. The price of Keytruda for just 3 weeks is over
$11,000, \22\ and some patients may need to adhere to Keytruda for one
to 2 years. \23\ The extraordinary list price of the drug, amounting to
over $190,000 a year, means that insured patients routinely hit their
out-of-pocket limits, which can be thousands of dollars every year.
\24\ In 2023, Merck made $25 billion off of Keytruda according to its
latest filing with the Securities Exchange Commission. \25\ Of the $18
billion in sales of the drug globally in the first 9 months of 2023,
Merck extracted $11 billion in revenue from American patients. \26\
Evidence suggests the price of Keytruda is not keyed to its research
and development costs. Merck itself did not make the original research
and development contributions critical to the drug's discovery: it
obtained ownership of the drug, and many others, via a corporate
acquisition in 2009 for $41 billion. \27\ In just 2 years, Merck has
more than made up for those costs with $46 billion in sales for the
drug. \28\

Second, Merck appears to be engaging in patenting practices
designed to unfairly extend exclusivity over this biologic drug to
prevent more affordable biosimilars from coming to market. \29\ The
Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge (I-MAK) found that 129
patent applications have been filed to cover Keytruda, and 50 percent
of these applications were filed after the drug's FDA approval in 2014,
cutting against claims that these patent applications furthered
innovation incentives for the drug's discovery. \30\ Fifty-three patent
applications have been granted to date, and the primary patents
covering the antibody that's considered the main component of the drug
were filed in 2008 and will expire in 2028. \31\

The other patents protect, among other things, methods of producing
the drug and its use to treat different cancer types. \32\ But method
of production patents are more critical to biologics like Keytruda than
small molecule drugs because the techniques for producing these drugs
are more challenging. \33\ As such, it's more difficult for
manufacturers to work around these patents to create more affordable
biosimilar alternatives. \34\ Additionally, once the mechanism of
action is known for a biologic in addressing one condition, testing its
use for other similar indications becomes obvious. \35\ Therefore,
obtaining multiple patents for different clinical indications for these
drugs appears problematic. The secondary patents on Keytruda grant an
additional 8 years of Merck's monopolistic pricing power over the drug,
and as a consequence of this exclusivity, it is estimated that
Americans will spend $137 billion on Keytruda. \36\

In sum, Merck appears to be unfairly extending its exclusivity over
Keytruda, which will cost American patients billions in the coming
years, in light of the filing pattern of patent applications on
Keytruda particularly after its FDA approval, and the granted patent
protection to deter biosimilar competitors after the expiry of primary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
patents.
Januvia
Merck's pricing of Januvia, which treats diabetes, also exemplifies
the pricing abuses rampant to the pharmaceutical industry. Merck
charges Americans as much as $6,900 per year for Januvia, while the
same drug can be purchased for $900 in Canada and $200 in France. \37\
Medicare Part D spent more than $4 billion on just this one drug
between June 2022 and May 2023, \38\ and the drug has been selected by
CMS for the first round of Medicare price negotiation. The drug on
average costs Medicare nearly $5,000 annually per enrollee, with out-

Merck has managed to extend its monopoly pricing power over Januvia
through unfair patenting practices. Januvia was first approved by the
FDA in 2006, \41\ and the original patent covering Januvia's active
ingredient, filed in 2002, expired in 2023. \42\ Americans already
should have access to lower cost generics. Indeed, Merck lost
exclusivity for the drug in 2023 in Europe. \43\ However, according to
the FDA's Orange Book, one patent set to expire in 2027 stands in the
way of low-cost generics for American patients. \44\ That patent covers
a specific salt form of the active ingredient created from a reaction
with phosphoric acid. \45\ According to Merck, innovating patents after
the filing of the primary patent ``enhance the benefits and
convenience of treatments for patients.'' \46\

The validity of the patent and Merck's argument that these
secondary patents, at least for Januvia, benefit patients are belied by
the litigation surrounding this patent. Although a district court
ultimately upheld the patent based on technical legal rules, it noted
that the earlier patent claimed salt forms of Januvia's active
ingredient, and most egregiously, the earlier patent disclosed that a
salt could be formed using phosphoric acid and even lists it as one of
eight preferred acids for creating such salts. \47\ The second patent
simply covers the salt form product formed by a reaction of phosphoric
acid with the active ingredient. \48\ In essence, Merck was able to
extend its monopolistic pricing power over Januvia by claiming
something it had basically previously disclosed, and what many would
consider an obvious variation of the active ingredient. Further,
Merck's claim that there is some corollary benefit to patients that
arises from its salt patent is contradicted by the record: to reject
the generic manufacturer's challenge to the patent's validity, the
district court found that the active ingredient by itself was fine and
did not need to be reacted with a salt. \49\

flawed, as it noted earlier that Merck had been motivated to find a
salt form of the compound because it proved unsuitable for making
pharmaceutical tablets and was unstable. Id. at 7. Even if this were
true, this should have provided the motivation for a person to arrive
at this salt version of the active ingredient, rendering the patent
claim obvious and invalid.

Lagevrio
A 5-day-course of Lagevrio, which cuts the risk of hospitalization
from COVID-19, costs $17.74 to produce, but Merck charged the Federal
Government $712, or over 40 times more, for the drug in 2021. \50\ The
government had contracted with Merck to supply 1.7 million courses of
treatment at this price for a total of $1.2 billion. \51\ The pricing
of Lagevrio was particularly egregious because the Federal Government
invested an estimated $29-35 million in the development of the drug.
\52\ In 2023, Merck's sales of the drug brought in $1.4 billion, but in
the previous year, Merck made nearly $6 billion off of the treatment.

In sum, Merck has been engaging in excessive pricing abuses with
respect to Keytruda, Januvia, and Lagevrio, which bring in billions
every year for the company. Additionally, it has sought to extend its
monopolistic pricing power over Keytruda and Januvia using patenting
practices we should deem unfair.
Johnson & Johnson
Like Merck, Johnson & Johnson benefits from monopoly protections to
price gouge American patients on vital medicines. These drugs include
(1) Stelara, which helps treat psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's
disease, and ulcerative colitis; \54\ (2) Xarelto, which prevents and
treats blood clots and reduces health risks for patients with coronary
or peripheral heart disease, and is licensed for sale in the U.S. from
Bayer AG; \55\ and (3) Darzalex, which treats multiple myeloma. \56\
Imbruvica is another possible example of Johnson & Johnson's drug
pricing abuses. Johnson & Johnson commercializes Imbruvica, which
treats blood cancers, \57\ outside the United States and has co-
exclusive rights with AbbVie to commercialize the drug in the United
States, though AbbVie states it is ``the principal in the end-customer
product sales.'' \58\ The companies share profits and losses equally
from the commercialization of the drug. \59\ Even if Johnson & Johnson
does not ultimately control the prices of drugs in the United States,
it profits equally from the abuses of its commercial partner.

the entry of biosimilar competitors to Stelara. \63\ Their complaint
alleges that Johnson & Johnson defrauded the Patent and Trademark
Office by intentionally misleading the examiner on the patentability of
a subject patent in Stelara, purchased a manufacturer that had patents
in the methods of producing biosimilar alternatives to Stelara, and
used these fraudulently and unlawfully obtained patents to delay
alternatives that would have been more affordable to patients. \64\

Johnson & Johnson benefits from the unfair patenting practices of
another company to prolong its exclusive authority to price and sell
Xarelto in the United States. Johnson & Johnson licenses Xarelto from
Bayer AG, a German company that owns the patents in the drug. \70\
Johnson & Johnson received FDA approval for Xarelto in 2011, \71\ and
the patent protection for two of three patents listed for the drug in
the Orange Book expire in 2025. \72\ But the protection of a third
patent covering the 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20-mg tablets of the drug expires
in 2034. \73\ Bayer AG describes that the patents covering the active
ingredient of Xarelto in the U.S. expire in 2025. \74\ Thus, the
secondary patent expiring in 2034 for the drug prolongs Johnson &
Johnson's monopolistic pricing power over these Xarelto tablets by
almost a decade in excess of the protection afforded by the primary
patents. This secondary patent appears to be a significant barrier to
generic entry, as Johnson & Johnson and Bayer are relying solely on
this patent's claims in lawsuits seeking to prevent at least three, and
likely more, manufacturers from selling generics of the 10, 15 and 20-
mg doses of Xarelto. \75\

While the earlier patents cover the active ingredient, its
combination with other substances to form the drug, the process of
preparing the drug, a solid oral version of the drug, and its use for
preventing or treating cardiovascular issues, the primary marginal
benefit claimed by the later-expiring patent appears to be its
protection over a once-daily tablet version of the drug. \76\ Bayer
itself states in its annual corporate statements that the patent
covering 10, 15, and 20-mg once-daily tablets in Europe is set to
expire in 2026. \77\ If this patent survives litigation in the U.S., it
will likely be another instance in which Americans are uniquely

patent thicket depriving U.S. patients of more affordable alternatives
of the drug, with 88 patents granted to date. \85\ The House Oversight

active ingredient was filed in 2006 and was expected to expire in 2026.
\86\ Citing I-MAK, the Committee detailed how a ``drip----feed'' patent
strategy was employed to prolong monopoly power over Imbruvica. \87\
Under this strategy, multiple additional patents were filed covering
aspects of Imbruvica that had already been disclosed in earlier patents
but with more pecificity. \88\ The sheer number of patents providing
protection on the drug is designed to discourage generic competition
against the drug. Even then, the Committee reports that nearly a dozen

Bristol Myers Squibb has sought to extend its monopoly protections
over Eliquis using unjust patenting practices. Although generics
received FDA approval in 2019, \98\ none will come to market until
2026, with some alternatives prohibited until 2031 due to patent
litigation and settlements. \99\ The company's patent for the active
ingredient of Eliquis was filed in September 2002, and was set to
expire in February 2023. \100\ But BMS received an extension of its
patent term until November 2026 using a Federal law that can provide
extensions for time lost in the premarket government approval process.

On top of its extension on the primary patent, BMS and Pfizer
obtained a patent on a pharmaceutical composition with a particular
crystalline form of the active ingredient that expires in 2031. \102\
In patent litigation, a generic manufacturer argued the claim was
obvious because someone would have been motivated to develop the same
claim based on what was known at the time. While American courts upheld
the patent claim based on a finding that there was no need that would
have motivated someone else to pursue this invention, the UK courts
invalided the patent. \103\ That court argued that it would have been
obvious because someone in the field would have arrived at the
invention, and if the court believed BMS's argument that there really
was no need that would have driven the obvious invention, then the
patent would have been invalid for lack of utility. \104\ Ultimately,
the patent appears to have marginal value given that it was not
addressed to a particular issue at the time, but the consequences of 5
years of additional monopoly power over the drug will be enormous.
American patients will continue to face hundreds of dollars in out-of-
pocket costs and the coffers of public programs will be stretched in
the absence of lower cost generics.

Thus, Bristol Myers Squibb's pricing practices are yet another
example of how drug corporations price gouge American patients.
Further, Bristol Myers Squibb engages in patenting practices of
marginal value that appear to be widespread in the pharmaceutical
industry to extend monopoly control over drug prices and unfairly
deprive U.S. patients of lower cost generics.
III. These Companies Spend Billions on Self-Enriching Activities, Often
in Excess of Research and Development Expenses
All three companies have alleged that the Medicare price
negotiation provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act would detract
from the innovation of new life-saving medicines and sued to invalidate
these measures. \110\ But there is a wealth of evidence that
contradicts claims that drug price regulation will impact the
innovation of new medicines. First, experts, and even the Congressional
Budget Office, conclude there is no connection between a drug's
research and development cost and its future price. \111\ Rather, the
current price of drugs reflects the maximum that companies believe
healthcare payers will pay for monopolized drugs with few if any
adequate therapeutic alternatives. \112\ More specifically, the
Congressional Budget Office found that only 13 fewer drugs out of 1,300
(1 percent) would come to market over the next 30 years as a result of
the Inflation Reduction Act. \113\ Second, compared to the rest of the
globe, the United States is an outlier that does little to protect its
residents from the unfair pricing power of drug companies, \114\ and
bringing American policy into alignment with those of other countries,
including other high-income peers, will not destroy the incentive to
innovate new medicines. Finally, drug corporations spend in excess on
executive compensation, share buybacks, and dividends which enrich
their shareholders, cutting against the industry's mistaken impression
that it is strapped for resources to research and develop new
medicines. \115\ For example, in just 2022, the manufacturers of the
drugs selected for Medicare price negotiation spent $10 billion more on
these self-enriching activities than research and development. \116\

Stock buybacks enrich investors by reducing the number of
outstanding shares in a company. The fewer shares there are in
investors' hands, the more each share is worth. When a company buys
back and cancels 10 percent of its shares, that makes each share still
held by an investor or insider rise in value, as it represents a
greater claim on the company's earnings. Spending money this way allows
companies to enrich shareholders silently, as well as the executives
often paid in stock. \117\ Stock buybacks are particularly problematic
as they have historically increased stock value without raising taxable
income, can provide a mistaken impression about the economic health of
a company, and detract from more worthwhile investments in a company's
own workers and productive capacity, such as research and development
efforts. Dividends are another way of returning cash to investors. Each
fiscal quarter, publicly traded companies typically issue fixed
dividends to shareholders that rise when business is good and shrink or
get suspended when business is bad. \118\

Looking at these self-enriching activities, Johnson & Johnson spent

million on executive compensation. \120\ The company spent
approximately $3 billion more on these self-enriching activities

spending patterns from 2012-2021, Johnson & Johnson spent $43 billion
more on stock buybacks and dividends than research and development.
\122\ Similarly, Merck's spending on stock buybacks and dividends over
this period exceeded its research and development costs by $3 billion.

In sum, the spending patterns of all three companies belies their
impression to the public that their profits are re-invested in research
and development capacities; instead, they reallocate their profits
mostly to the benefit of their shareholders and executives. As such,
there is no necessary relationship between providing drug pricing
relief for millions and harming resources for innovating new medicines.
Conclusion
Supermajorities of Americans want decisive government action to
rein in the price gouging tactics of the pharmaceutical industry. And
though most drug corporations have been happy to benefit from an array
of government policies that have expanded their monopoly power over
drugs to the detriment of patients, many now fiercely resist any
efforts to deliver material drug pricing relief to millions of
Americans. The drug pricing tactics of Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and
Bristol Myers Squibb are representative of the broader exploitative
practices endemic to the pharmaceutical industry. They use their
monopoly control to price life-saving medicines excessively, and either
pursue, or benefit from, additional patents of marginal value to extend
their power to exorbitantly price drugs. This profiteering demands
greater action from the Biden administration and Congress, which would
not tangibly impact the innovation of new life-saving medicines.
______

Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy and Members of the
Committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the high prices
Americans pay for prescription drugs. Public Citizen is a national
public interest organization with more than 500,000 members and
supporters. For 50 years, we have advocated for stronger health, safety
and consumer protections; for corporate and government accountability;
and for affordable access to medicines.
Drug prices are high because of monopoly power, leading to
treatment rationing and preventable suffering. Three in 10 Americans
have not taken their medications as prescribed due to costs. Americans
confront the highest drug prices in the world, paying nearly three
times more for the same drugs than other countries. In 2020, for the 20
top-selling drugs worldwide, drug corporations made far more from U.S.
sales than sales to all other countries combined ($101 billion to $57
billion). Drug pricing abuses drain the coffers of health programs. Of
$400 billion spent on retail prescription drugs in 2022, $135 billion
came from Medicare and $45 billion from Medicaid.
This pricing disparity is even more egregious considering taxpayer
funded contributions to drug development. The world's largest
biomedical research funder is a public funder, the National Institutes
of Health, contributing more than $45 billion a year and laying
groundwork for many if not most new medicines.
Our government grants patent protection and exclusivities on
medicines. In theory, this should support innovation. In practice, drug
corporations too often are writing the rules to extract maximum rents
from taxpayers. In 2022; the manufacturers of the ten drugs selected
for Medicare price negotiation spent $10 billion more on self-enriching
activities--stock buybacks, dividends and CEO compensation--than on
R&D. Drugmakers do not set prices according to R&D costs. The price of
a patented drug is the most that we, as a society, are willing to pay
to care for our sick and loved ones, where monopoly power blocks
affordable alternatives and we have little choice.
Drugmakers extend their exclusive power over new drugs through
anticompetitive tactics. Many have abused the patent system to obtain
subsequent patents over the same medicine with marginal differences,
sometimes for decades.13 The pharmaceutical industry has accrued
tremendous influence in our political system, outranking every other
industry in lobbying spending.
Today, perhaps for the first time, our Country is making progress
challenging high prices and treatment rationing, including through
price negotiations and countering price spikes, among other measures.
We commend the Committee's attention to this problem. Far more is
necessary.
Ultimately, we will have to confront monopoly power. That is the
foundation allowing drugmakers to project influence, game the law and
keep prices high. Other real challenges in medicine pricing and access,
including secrecy, cost caps, patient assistance, and middlemen taking
advantage, flow inexorably from the lucrative patent monopolies that
make it so possible and so easy to rip off taxpayers. Thank you for
your time, and please count us with you in the fight.

STATEMENT OF TAHIR AMIN, LL.B., CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
INITIATIVE FOR MEDICINES, ACCESS & KNOWLEDGE, NEW YORK, NY
Mr. Amin. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and
Members of the Committee, it is my honor to be invited here to
share with you a root cause of why the U.S. pays by far the
highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That root
cause is how the pharmaceutical industry manipulates the patent
system to lengthen patent protection and its market monopoly in
order to block competition, all while increasing prices.
I qualify as a UK attorney in intellectual property, and I
have been in the field for 30 years. I spent my first decade of
my legal career practicing as an attorney at international law
firms and for multinational companies, including American
companies.
Through this work, I learned both the legal and business
side of intellectual property and its importance to inventors,
investors, and companies. I also learned how to use loopholes
to game the system.
These loopholes enabled me to invent intellectual property
rights so companies could obtain and maintain a monopoly in the
market, while continuing to extract maximum profits. It was the
reason why I co-founded IMAK and left the commercial world.
America is in a severe drug pricing crisis.
More than one-third of Americans say they are not able to
fill a prescription for medication because of its cost. Black
Americans are most heavily impacted, as they are more likely to
require medication for chronic conditions and earn less.
Now, prescription drug spending on retail and non-retail
drugs is poised to grow 63 percent this decade to $917 billion,
and branded prescription drugs, which are under patent
protection, account for 84 percent of that spending.
These price hikes correspond with a dramatic increase in
patenting activity in the pharmaceutical sector. Now, we have
analyzed the top 10 selling drugs in the United States, and we
have found a total of 1,429 patent applications have been filed
as of 2022.
741 patents have been granted on these drugs. On average,
that is, more than 140 patent applications filed per drug, and
74 patents granted per drug. That is 66 percent of those
patents are filed after the drug is approved by the FDA.
Now, if we look at some of the drugs that are on the
discussion today with the companies that were here, KEYTRUDA,
Merck's ELIQUIS, STELARA, Johnson & Johnson, also IMBRUVICA,
which is AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson.
Between them, there is a combined of 494 patent
applications filed on them, of which 235 were granted patents.
I just want to dig a little bit deeper into Merck and
particularly Senate Lujan's questioning of whether Merck would
sort of allow biosimilar competition once the primary patent
expires.
You have to remember, KEYTRUDA actually represents 47
percent of Merck's total pharmaceutical revenue. Now, as of
June 2002, we have counted 180 patent applications, of which 78
are granted. They have patent protection at least until 2039,
which is in total 37 years of patent protection since they
filed their first patent, which is 2002. You are supposed to
get a patent for 20 years, remember.
Market and media analysts a current reporting that we
should see biosimilar competition in 2028, to Senator Lujan's
question. I put myself on record here today, we will not see
biosimilar competition until 2034.
They will litigate the hell out of it, and they will use
every cent that they can to kind of not leave $100 billion on
the table, which is what those patents are worth to them.
All this talk of R&D and new indications, these patents are
already disclosing the earlier patents that should be expiring
in 2024. Bristol-Myers Squibb, same problem. Bristol-Myers has
actually increased the price of ELIQUIS by 124 percent since
its induction in 2012.
That is higher than the general rate of inflation. They
have filed more patents here in the United States, 2.4 more
times than in Europe. In fact, the patents that the CEO from
BMX was talking about, the relevant patents, those were
actually invalidated in Europe and that is why we have generic
competition in Europe.
But those patents are actually preventing competition here
in the United States and it is going to cost us $48 billion in
branded ELIQUIS. So, this Committee should recognize that the
use of patent thickets to extend the market monopoly period on
a product is not a case of a few bad actors, it is endemic.
If you want to get to the heart of the problem, the first
and most important thing Congress can do is solve the problem,
is raise the bar for what classifies as an invention that
deserves a patent. It is an enormous monopoly power that
should--in the single hands of a drug maker, and we shouldn't
leave it to the market and litigation to resolve these issues.
The patenting activity goes well beyond the time limits in
monopoly that the Constitution required. Lawyers, exploit
sophisticated legal marketing Jedi tricks that they use under
the guise of innovation.
We need to actually not get sidetracked by this innovation
talk. Most of these patents are tweaks deliberately for the
financialization of profits, and that is what the
pharmaceutical industry does today. I have been in the
business, and I know what it is about. Thank you.

I. Introduction and Background
My name is Tahir Amin. I am a Founder and Chief Executive Officer
of the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, also known as I-
MAK, a non-profit organization working to address structural inequities
in how medicines are developed and distributed. We do not accept
funding from branded or generic pharmaceutical companies.
I qualified as a UK attorney and have nearly 30 years of experience
in the field of intellectual property. I have experience working with
the intellectual property and patent systems of several countries in
the world, including the U.S., both at the practice and policy level.
I spent the first decade of my legal career practicing as an
attorney at international law firms and multinational companies
securing and protecting intellectual property. Many of my clients were
American companies, as was one of my employers during this time.
Through this work, I learned both the legal and business side of
intellectual property and its importance to inventors, investors and
companies. I also learned how to use loopholes to game the system.
These loopholes enabled me to ``invent'' intellectual property rights
so companies could obtain and maintain a monopoly in the market, while
continuing to extract maximum profits.
After a decade in private practice seeing how intellectual property
rights--and especially patents--are often misused for commercial gain,
I co-founded I-MAK to help restore integrity and to the patent system.
For the past 15 years, I have worked alongside patients and advocates
to remove unmerited patent rights that stand in the way of generic and
biosimilar competition and keep life-saving medicines out of reach of
the patients who need them.
I speak to you today as someone who has seen both sides of this
issue.
II. The Link Between Patents and Drug Prices
America is in a drug pricing crisis. More than one-third of
Americans say they have not filled a prescription for medication
because of its cost. \1\ Black Americans are most heavily impacted as
they are more likely to require medication for chronic conditions, such
as high blood pressure or diabetes, while having median incomes of
nearly $30,000 less than white households. \2\

Prescription drug spending on retail and non-retail drugs is poised
to grow 63 percent this decade, reaching $917 billion dollars. \3\ This
increase is fueled by spending on patent-protected branded drugs. While
branded drugs make up just 8 percent of prescriptions versus 92 percent
for generics, they account for 84 percent of all drug spending in the
U.S. \4\ Even after adjusting for general inflation, U.S. prescription
drug spending increased by 76 percent from 2000 to 2017.

activity in the pharmaceutical sector.
It took 155 years for the USPTO to issue its first five million
patents in 1991. \5\ It has taken less than one fifth of that time for
the USPTO to issue its next 6 million. This would suggest that over
half of all inventions in the history of the U.S. patent system
occurred in the last 30 years. But have we really become more inventive
in the last 30 years, or have we just become better at ``inventing''
patents because our patent system is no longer stringent enough?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://10millionpatents.uspto.gov/
A similar picture emerges when we drill down into pharmaceutical
patents specifically. The number of pharmaceutical patents granted in
the U.S. more than doubled between 2005 (1,580 patents) and 2015 (3,742
patents). \6\ But nearly 80 percent of the drugs--products based on

A total of 1,429 patent applications have been filed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
as of 2022;
741 patents have been granted on these drugs in
total;
On average, that is more than 140 patent applications
filed per drug, and 74 patents granted per drug.
On average, 66 percent of patents filed on these
drugs are after the first approval for marketing by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
On average 55 percent of the granted patents for
these drugs were filed after FDA approval.
Over four times as many patents were granted on these
top 10 selling drugs in 2021 when compared to Europe.
Keytruda (Merck), Eliquis (Bristol-Myers Squibb
(BMS)/Pfizer), Stelara (Johnson & Johnson) and Imbruvica
(AbbVie/Johnson & Johnson) were 4 of the top selling drugs in
2021. As of June 2022, these four drugs alone have had at least
494 patent applications filed on them, of which 235 were
granted patents.
Most of the patent applications (305) for these four
drugs were filed after FDA approval.
A closer look at some of these best-selling drugs reveals the
following.
Keytruda (Merck)
Merck's Keytruda belongs to a class of drugs known as immune
checkpoint inhibitors used for cancer immunotherapy. It was first
approved in September 2014. At the last count in July 2023, it has
received an additional 35 FDA approvals across 16 different types of
cancer.
Keytruda is projected to become the best-selling drug ever, taking
over AbbVie's Humira. Its worldwide sales are forecasted to be $27.19
billion in 2024. In 2023, global sales for Keytruda were $25 billion,
with $15 billion in the U.S. alone. Keytruda represented 47 percent of
Merck's total pharmaceutical revenue in 2023.
As of June 2022, there are at least 180 patent applications and 78
granted patents covering Keytruda and its various indications. 61
percent of the 180 patent applications were filed after the first FDA
approval for Keytruda in 2014. \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ https://drugpatentbook.i-mak.org/
The first patent filed in relation to Keytruda was 2002. Based on
our findings, the latest expiring patent for Keytruda will be in 2039,
which will be 11 years after the key patents covering the drug are set
expire (2028). In total, Merck currently has 37 years of patent
protection for Keytruda (it is worth noting that patents are granted
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for 20 years for an invention). This protection includes
Market and media analysts are currently reporting that we could see
biosimilar competition for Keytruda when the key patents on the drug
expire in 2028 (often referred to as the patent cliff). Given the
patent thicket that Merck has accumulated around Keytruda, I think that
is wishful thinking. If we have learned any lessons from how AbbVie was
able to extend its market monopoly on Humira for an additional 7 years
beyond its key patent and generate $102 billion in revenue alone in
that period (which included continued price increases) because of its
patent thicketing strategy (see Figure below \10\), then we can expect
Merck to do the same. Based on an analysis of all Keytruda's patents,
after all the patent litigation and settlements are done, we will be
fortunate if we see biosimilars for Keytruda enter before 2034--roughly
6 years after the key patents expire. I also predict, as AbbVie did
with Humira, that Merck will continue to increase prices for its
branded Keytruda during the additional market monopoly period because
of its extended patent protection. I do not see Merck leaving some $100
billion plus on the table, they will use whatever patents they have to
litigate for every cent of it.

Imbruvica (AbbVie/Johnson & Johnson)
Imbruvica is a drug used to treat a variety of B cell cancers,
including leukemia and lymphoma. It was first approved in 2013 and is
approved by the FDA for several different indications.
The price of Imbruvica has increased by 108 percent in the U.S.
since it was introduced in 2013, compared to a 30 percent general
inflation increase in the same period. \11\ Imbruvica's list price has
increased nearly 32 percent in the U.S. in the past 5 years, from $431
in 2019 to $567 per capsule (70mg).

skyrocketed in Price, Fierce Healthcare, 10 August 2023, available at
https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/here-are-25-Medicare-part-d-
drugs-have-skyrocketed-price
As of June 2022, AbbVie has filed 195 patent applications, of which
96 have been granted to date. That roughly works out to over one patent
filed every month for the last 14 years. Over half of these patent
applications were filed after Imbruvica received its first FDA
approval. Currently, granted patents for Imbruvica give AbbVie patent
protection for 29 years, until 2036--nine additional years beyond its
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
original 20 years of patent protection.
Despite generic companies litigating AbbVie's patents, we have
already seen six companies enter into patent settlement agreements. As
a result of these agreements, competitors will delay introduction of
generic versions of Imbruvica until 2032 and 2033. These 5 additional
years of market monopoly because of extended patent protection could
help AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson secure over $7 billion dollars in
revenue.
Eliquis (Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)/Pfizer)
Eliquis is an anticoagulant medication used to treat and prevent
blood clots.
Sales for Eliquis in the U.S. increased by 10 percent to $8.6
billion in 2023. Eliquis accounts for 27 percent of BMS's sales in the
U.S. The price of Eliquis has increased by 124 percent since its
introduction in 2012 as compared to 31 percent general inflation
increase during the same period. \12\ In January this year, the list
price for Eliquis increased by 6 percent from the year before. This
increase outpaced inflation and the annual price increases of the top
50 best selling drugs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ Ibid
As of June 2022, BMS/Pfizer have filed at least 43 patent
applications for the drug, of which 22 are granted. Sixteen of these
patent applications were filed after FDA approval. There are 2.4 times
more granted patents in the U.S. than in Europe. Generic versions of
Eliquis entered some European countries in 2022 after several patents
that would have extended the market monopoly period were found invalid.
\13\ However, in the U.S. these same patents were held valid after
litigation and generic versions are not expected to enter until 2028.
As a result of extended patent protection, generic versions will have
entered Europe almost 6 years earlier than in the U.S. By our estimate,
BMS/Pfizer will make $48 billion in revenue during this extended market
monopoly period. \14\

III. Solutions to the Patent and Drug Pricing Problem
This Committee should recognize that the use of patent thickets to
extend the market monopoly period on a product is not a case of a few
bad actors. This is an endemic problem across the pharmaceutical
industry.
If we want to get to the heart of addressing our National drug
pricing crisis, the first and most important thing Congress can do to
solve this problem is raise the bar for what gets patented. Over the
last 30 years, more and more patents have been sought and granted for
things that are not new inventions given what we know in the
pharmaceutical sciences today.
For example, no reasonable researcher would call combining two
existing drugs or switching dosages novel science by today's standards.
And yet, drugmakers regularly get 20 years of patent protection for
this commonly practiced knowledge.
In 1962, Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee said:
``If you want to tweak a drug, and you want to get another patent
on it, the modified version has to be significantly better,
therapeutically, for patients.'' \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101807/
A patent puts enormous monopoly power into the hands of a single
drugmaker. That power should only be granted if the invention is
original and materially better than what already exists. We cannot rely
on the market and litigation to resolve these problems; they need to be
addressed before a patent monopoly is granted in the first place.
IV. Conclusion
The Constitution grants Congress the power to ``promote the
progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to
authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings
and discoveries.''
But patenting activity today goes well beyond the time limited
monopoly intended by the Constitution. Today's patent system has become
less an engine for real invention than a tool for companies and their
lawyers to exploit using sophisticated legal and marketing Jedi tricks
under
This is not an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry.
Drugmakers and their armies of patent lawyers--people like me in my
former life--are simply doing what the system incentives them to do,
and what they are bound by their shareholders and clients to do.
But it is in Congress's power to end this perversion and restore
integrity to the patent system. Instead of incentivising investment in
minor modifications for the purposes of extending a patent, we need a
system that incentives bold research--breakthroughs that are
therapeutically better than existing alternatives and fill a real
market need, not low-hanging fruit designed to maximize profits.
Congress has the ability to return the patent system to what it was
always intended to be: not a vehicle for unprecedented profits, but an
engine for inventions that are truly original and unprecedented.
______

A root cause of why the U.S. pays, by far, the highest prices in
the world is because of how the pharmaceutical industry manipulates the
patent system to lengthen patent protection and its market monopoly.
I. The Link Between Patents and Drug Prices
Keytruda (Merck), Eliquis (Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)/Pfizer),
Stelara (Johnson & Johnson) and Imbruvica (AbbVie/Johnson & Johnson)
were 4 of the top selling drugs in 2021. As of June 2022, these four
drugs alone have had at least 494 patent applications filed on them, of
which 235 were granted patents. Most of the patent applications (305)
for these four drugs were filed after FDA approval.
Keytruda (Merck)
There are at least 180 patent applications and 78 granted patents
covering Keytruda and its various indications. 61 percent of the 180
patent applications were filed after the first FDA approval for
Keytruda in 2014. Given the patent thicket that Merck has accumulated
around Keytruda, we will be fortunate if we see biosimilars for
Keytruda enter before 2034--roughly 6 years after the key patents
expire (2028). During that extended monopoly period Merck will continue
to increase prices and could pocket over $100 billion in sales.
Imbruvica (AbbVie/Johnson & Johnson)
AbbVie has filed 195 patent applications, of which 96 have been
granted to date. As a result of patent litigation generic companies
have entered settlements and will delay introduction of generic
versions of Imbruvica until 2032 and 2033. These 5 additional years of
market monopoly because of extended patent protection could help AbbVie
and Johnson & Johnson secure over $7 billion dollars in revenue.
Eliquis (Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)/Pfizer)
BMS/Pfizer have filed at least 43 patent applications for the drug,
of which 22 are granted. There are 2.4 times more granted patents in
the U.S. than in Europe. Generic versions of Eliquis entered some
European countries in 2022 after several patents that would have
extended the market monopoly period were found invalid. However, in the
U.S. these same patents were held valid. after litigation and generic
versions are not expected to enter until 2028. As a result of extended
patent protection, generic versions will have entered Europe almost 6
years earlier than in the
U.S. BMS/Pfizer could make $48 billion in revenue during this
extended market monopoly period.
II. Solutions to the Patent and Drug Pricing Problem
If we want to get to the heart of addressing our National drug
pricing crisis, the first and most important thing Congress can do to
solve this problem is raise the bar for what classifies as an invention
that deserves a patent.

STATEMENT OF DARIUS LAKDAWALLA, PH.D., DIRECTOR, RESEARCH,
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCHAEFFER CENTER, LOS
ANGELES, CA
Dr. Lakdawalla. Thank you. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member
Cassidy, and honorable Members of the Committee, thank you for
the opportunity to testify today about drug prices and the
assessment of medical technologies.
My name is Darius Lakdawalla. I am an Economist and a
Professor at the USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical
Sciences and USC Price School of Public Policy. I am also the
Director of Research at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health
Policy and Economics. The opinions I offer today are my own and
don't represent the views of the University of Southern
California or the USC Schaeffer Center.
I would like to start with a story. In December 1984, a
young boy from Indiana named Ryan White was diagnosed with
AIDS, a result of a transfusion with infected blood. In the
immediate wake of his passing in 1990, Congress passed the Ryan
White Care Act, ensuring affordable care for HIV/AIDS patients.
The value of this program was fully realized 5 years later,
when highly active antiretroviral therapy emerged as a
lifesaving treatment for patients with HIV. Today, 9 out of 10
patients receiving care through the Ryan White Program enjoy
viral load so low that they are no longer infectious.
Thanks to breakthrough medical innovation and to forward
thinking public policy that made innovative HIV therapies
affordable to many, HIV positive patients can now expect to
live well into their 70's and beyond.
But increasing patient access through bold expansion of
affordable care means little when there are no valuable cures
or treatments to access, and breakthrough medical therapies
provide little value if high cost sharing pushes them out of
patients' reach. This is the fundamental tradeoff we are here
to address today.
This tradeoff between innovation and affordability has
played out in different approaches taken across the globe.
There is little doubt that U.S. consumers access newer drugs
sooner and more often than their overseas counterparts, and
this increased access to the latest treatments matters.
Schaeffer Center research suggests that introducing
European style pricing policies would ultimately reduce
innovation and cost American consumers just over half a year of
life expectancy, about what would be lost if all American
surgeons suddenly forgot how to perform heart bypass surgery.
Yet there is no denying the sentiment that U.S. consumers
unfairly pay higher drug prices than their peers overseas. The
deteriorating accessibility of prescription drugs in recent
years threatens to derail the access advantages and health
gains American consumers have so far enjoyed and is one
component of this growing sentiment.
Even patients with good insurance are struggling to access
the therapies their doctors prescribe. Plans frequently employ
coinsurance requirements and utilization management tools that
severely restrict access. These changes likely harm health,
since the link between increasing out-of-pocket costs and worse
patient adherence is well-established.
Surprisingly, coverage has deteriorated even while the
average manufacturer net prices of brand drugs, the amount
manufacturers receive after rebates and discounts, have
declined in each of the last 5 years.
Shaeffer research analyzing the flow of money spent on
insulin, found that while net prices fell by 31 percent, total
expenditures remained nearly constant because intermediaries
were pocketing the additional rebates and price concessions
instead of passing them on to consumers.
Transparency and pricing throughout the pharmaceutical
distribution system would be a major step toward ensuring that
drug prices reflect the actual value provided to patients, and
don't simply enrich intermediaries.
Rewarding drugs that do provide value promotes investment
in the right kind of therapies and ensures good health will be
increasingly within the reach of American patients for
generations to come. Decades of economic research demonstrate
that where innovators predict higher returns, innovative effort
and discovery follow.
Outside the U.S., many countries adopt pricing approaches
that either fail to measure value to patients or make it hard
to predict future returns to innovation. The UK, Australia, and
Canada employ relatively transparent and predictable methods
that nonetheless rely on quality adjusted life years, which
discriminate against vulnerable patients.
On the other hand, France and Germany avoid qualities and
focus on rating clinical benefits in a way that often fails to
correspond to the eventual price. These tradeoffs also
underscore the risks of so-called reference pricing approaches
that would tie American prices to those charged by other
countries.
In so doing, Americans would be forced to live with the
vagaries of pricing systems designed and implemented elsewhere
around priorities that may differ from ours. Ultimately, the
right policies for American patients need to focus on the
affordability of good health.
Affordable and generous health insurance, transparent and
predictable pricing, and an emphasis on value to patients
provide the ingredients for a better approach that secures the
health of American families now and for generations to come.
Thank you very much.

Key Points:
The challenge for public policy is to sustain the
pace of medical innovation while ensuring that valuable new
technologies remain affordable and accessible.
The U.S. is by far the largest market for
pharmaceuticals in the world and the engine of global
pharmaceutical innovation. Other countries, in effect, free
ride off the innovation stimulated by the American market.
Despite stable or falling net prices paid to
prescription drug manufacturers over the past decade, novel
medicines lie increasingly beyond the financial reach of
American patients.
Blunt price controls are not the solution to the
worsening affordability of prescription drugs or to global
free-riding: Schaeffer Center research suggests that
introducing European-style pricing policies would reduce
Americans' life expectancy.
Instead, aligning drug prices with the actual value
provided to patients stimulates innovation that benefits
patients and discourages innovation that does not.
Legislation to increase drug price transparency,
coupled with better information about value, can help payers
and consumers spend their money wisely.
Affordable and generous insurance for prescription
drugs ensures that drugs remain within the financial reach of
American families.
Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Honorable Members of
the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about
drug prices and the assessment of medical technologies.
My name is Darius Lakdawalla, and I am an economist, a professor at
the USC Mann School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and USC Price
School of Public Policy, and the Director of Research at the USC

have been studying innovation in the health care sector for nearly
three decades, I co-wrote the chapter in the Handbook of Health
Economics on intellectual property and biomedical research, and I co-
authored the book Valuing Health on modern methods for valuing medical
technology. The opinions I offer today are my own and do not represent
the views of the University of Southern California or the USC Schaeffer
Center.
The Value of Innovation in Global Context
In December 1984, a young boy from Indiana named Ryan White was
diagnosed with AIDS, as a result of a transfusion with infected blood.
While his doctors gave him just 6 months to live, Ryan outlasted those
predictions and lived six more years. In the immediate wake of his
untimely passing in 1990, Congress passed the Ryan White Care Act,
which has since ensured affordable care for generations of HIV/AIDS
patients. While the Act played a critical role in the fight against HIV
almost immediately, its full value would not be realized until 5 years
after its passage, when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
emerged as a life-saving treatment for patients with HIV. The Ryan
White Care Act put effective medical care within reach for many HIV+
patients that would otherwise have gone without it, while medical
innovation brought new forms of treatment that changed the lives of
patients and their families. Today, 9 out of 10 patients receiving care
through the Ryan White program enjoy viral loads so low that they are
no longer infectious. Thanks to breakthrough medical innovation, and to
forward-thinking public policy that made it affordable to many, HIV+
patients treated with HAART in a timely fashion can now expect to live
well into their 70's and beyond.
The case of HIV illustrates a pair of health policy truisms.
Increasing patient access through bold expansion of affordable care
means little when there are no valuable cures or treatments to access.
At the same time, breakthrough medical therapies provide little value
if high cost-sharing pushes them out of patients' reach. The challenge
for public policy is to sustain the pace of medical innovation while
ensuring that valuable new technologies remain affordable and
accessible to the patients who need them.
At first blush, it may seem impossible to navigate the narrow
straits between affordability and innovation. Medical innovation
investment carries high risk that drives up the cost of discovery.
Among investigational medicines that undergo human trials, 90 percent
will fail to launch. Pharmaceutical and medical device firms will
undertake these costs only if they expect to recoup the cumulative
costs of their investments and receive a reasonable rate of return.
However, these returns on innovation must ultimately be paid by all
Americans, through out-of-pocket payments, health insurance premiums,
and taxes. In this respect, therefore, greater rewards for innovators
lead to more innovation but less affordability. The converse is also
true: bluntly lowering prices makes new medicines more affordable for
today's patients, but limits innovation for future generations of
patients.
This tradeoff between innovation and affordability has played out
in the different approaches taken across the globe. There is little
doubt that U.S. consumers access newer drugs sooner and more often than
their overseas counterparts. Academic research shows how this tendency
results in more and earlier new drug launches in the U.S., and
correspondingly fewer and later launches in other countries. Schaeffer
Center research suggests that introducing European-style pricing
policies would ultimately lower innovation and cost American consumers
just over half a year of life expectancy, about what would be lost if
American surgeons suddenly forgot how to perform heart bypass surgery.
\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Bypass surgery adds about 1.1 years of life to patients
treated with it. The lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease is around
60 percent. Thus, even if every heart disease patient received bypass
surgery, it would add just over half a year of life.
Meanwhile, academic research finds that the American healthcare
system performs better than its European counterparts in treating
disease. For example, American mortality rates from breast, colorectal,
and prostate cancer have fallen faster than European rates. Indeed, an
analysis of cancer care across 16 countries found countries where
cancer spending has grown more rapidly have also experienced faster
declines in cancer mortality rates. According to our research, where
the U.S. lags is in the prevention of chronic diseases like heart
disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Faster growth in American obesity
appears to have played an outsized role in driving these differences.
In short, America's relatively low life expectancy appears to be in
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
spite of, not because of, its healthcare system.
Despite the good news, however, there is no denying the sentiment
that U.S. consumers unfairly pay higher drug prices than their peers
overseas. On the one hand, we cannot readily observe the actual extent
of the difference between U.S. and overseas prices. Too often, price
comparisons in the public discussion rely on U.S. list prices, which
are easily accessible, but almost never reflect what is truly paid for
a drug. While researchers have a rough idea of the average discount
paid in aggregate, this provides little insight into the actual prices
of specific drugs. Economic principles predict that volume will be
higher on drugs offering higher discounts. Therefore, applying the
average discount to the list price of every individual drug will
overstate U.S. prices.
Nonetheless, economic principles also predict that U.S. prices
probably are higher than prices overseas, even if we do not know by
exactly how much. The culprit is the problem of ``free-riding.'' The
U.S. is by far the largest market for pharmaceuticals in the world.
Smaller market countries have rational, self-interested incentives to
pay lower prices, knowing that their small size allows them to save
money without meaningfully reducing global pharmaceutical innovation.
In effect, their lower reimbursements ``free-ride'' off the American
market, which remains the engine of pharmaceutical innovation that
benefits patients throughout the world.
Americans have understandably become frustrated by footing so much
of the world's bill for innovation. Unfortunately, we have no reliable
ways to coerce other countries to act against their own self-interest.
And, while it may seem tempting to stop paying higher prices and to
join with the free riders, the resulting slowdown in innovation would
harm American patients and their families most of all. Fortunately,
there are actions we can take to ensure that patients benefit from
medical advances, today and in the future.
Ensuring Patient Access to Treatments: Net Prices Are Not the Problem
The deteriorating accessibility of prescription drugs in recent
years threatens to derail the access advantages and health gains
American consumers have so far enjoyed. Even patients with ``good''
insurance are struggling to access the therapies their doctors
prescribe. Plans frequently impose co-insurance requirements, where
patients pay a share of their drug's list price, exposing them to
artificially inflated list prices even when drugs' true costs are much
lower. Plans are also restricting access or denying it altogether for
an increasing share of drug compounds. Since 2012, the three largest
pharmacy benefit managers have excluded a sharply increasing number of
drugs from their formularies--last year, each of them excluded from
coverage more than 600 products. At the same time, the average
manufacturer net prices of brand drugs--the amount manufacturers
receive after rebates and discounts--have declined in each of the last
5 years.
If it is getting cheaper to buy these drugs from manufacturers, why
are they growing harder for patients to access? Part of the answer can
be seen in a 2021 analysis of the flow of money spent on insulin.
Between 2014 and 2018, net manufacturer prices for insulin fell by 31
percent, but the total expenditure per unit of insulin remained nearly
constant. Growing discounts and concessions offered by manufacturers
were not being passed on to patients or taxpayers in the form of lower
insulin expenditures. Instead, those savings were being pocketed by
intermediaries in the pharmacy distribution system, including pharmacy
benefit managers, pharmacies and wholesalers. Pending legislation aimed
at increasing transparency in the distribution system will shed more
light on the commercial practices that enable PBMs to divert savings
like this and provide more insight into where our drug spending is
going. Neither third-party payers nor consumers observe the net prices
they themselves are paying for individual drugs. Even large self-
insured employers may be unable to get simple answers about how much
they are paying for a given drug, no matter how widely used.
Transparency in pricing would be a major step toward ensuring that drug
prices reflect the actual value provided to patients, and don't simply
enrich intermediaries.
Some academics and Federal agencies have asserted \2\2 that price
transparency harms consumers, purportedly by providing a means for
pharmaceutical firms to cooperate with each other in raising prices.
This argument is specious. In the first place, there are no academic
studies showing that pharmaceutical price transparency limits
competition; the argument against transparency proceeds primarily by
means of a flawed analogy to a 25 year-old study of the Danish ready-
mix concrete industry. Moreover, the critique of price transparency
rests on the quaint notion that confidential rebates yield vigorous
price competition that benefits consumers. On the contrary, our
research illustrates how confidential rebates explain why competition
among branded drug companies is currently associated with higher-not-
lower-list prices for drugs, and correspondingly higher costs for
patients paying co-insurance for their medicines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See page 362.
In addition to hitting American families in the pocketbook, higher
out-of-pocket costs for drugs also harm health. The link between
increasing out-of-pocket costs and patient adherence is well-
established. USC Schaeffer Center research found that higher out-of-
pocket burden corresponds with lower patient utilization of insulin,
while other studies have found similar relationships between patient
costs and adherence in rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, and chronic
kidney disease. In addition, USC Schaeffer Center research demonstrated
in the context of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that prior
authorization and step therapy restrictions in Part D plans harmed
patient health. Patients in plans with more restrictions were less
likely to use NOACs, had worse adherence when they did use NOACs, took
longer to fill their initial NOAC prescription, and faced higher risk
of mortality/stroke/transient ischemic attack. This research does not
imply that every access restriction harms patient health. Rather, it
highlights the need to evaluate the risks and benefits of access
policies, just as we evaluate the risks and benefits of new medicines.
Sustaining Innovation for American Patients and their Families
Fortunately, reforms that promote patient access do not have to
lower medical innovation. Indeed, our research shows that generous
prescription drug insurance unlocks affordability and access for
patients while still enabling sufficient rewards for innovation. This
is not to say, however, that all innovation should be unquestioningly
rewarded. The goal is to encourage innovations that benefit patients
and their families, and to discourage those that do not. These goals
can best be achieved when prices reflect value to patients.
Decades of economic research demonstrate that innovation follows
pricing incentives. Where innovators expect higher returns, innovative
effort and discovery follow. In contrast, innovators will avoid
investing where they expect lower returns. As a result, aligning the
price of every drug with the value it brings patients stimulates
innovation that benefits patients and discourages innovation that does
not. At a minimum, this requires a transparent and predictable approach
to price-setting that rewards value. Predictability matters, because
innovation investments follow what innovators expect prices will be,
often many years in the future. Second, value must be measured in a way
that holistically reflects what patients and their families care about.
Doing otherwise stimulates the wrong kind of innovation.
Looking outside the U.S., many countries adopt pricing approaches
that force a tradeoff between predictability and the holistic
measurement of value. The United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada employ
relatively transparent systems that set prices based on three kinds of
data: the clinical benefits of the new drug, the expected economic
benefit of the new drug, and the likely cost impact of the new drug.
Even though prices are not determined in a purely formulaic manner,
drugs are more likely to be reimbursed when their prices result in
sufficient economic benefit, and vice-versa. And, since economic
benefit is computed using a known mathematical framework, this approach
results in more predictable pricing outcomes.
However, while these countries employ a more predictable approach,
they also rely on old-fashioned methods of economic analysis--for
instance traditional cost-effectiveness calculations using quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs). While many have correctly observed the
ethical challenges posed by the discriminatory nature of QALYs, our
research demonstrates that traditional QALYs also get the mathematics
and economics of value assessment wrong for patients.
On the other side of the coin are countries like France and
Germany, which recognize the pitfalls of traditional economic
evaluation of new medicines. For the most part, these countries focus
on clinical benefits as the main criterion for reimbursement decisions,
rarely if ever attempting to form specific economic estimates of value.
While these countries avoid flawed estimates of value, their approach
compromises predictability. In contrast to economic evaluation, which
is focused on estimating a monetary benefit, clinical evaluation
typically considers many dimensions of health improvement without a
clear and quantitative method for weighing these different dimensions
against each other. For example, one academic study found that only 2
out of the 5 official criteria specified for clinical benefit in France
are statistically associated with the official rating of clinical
benefit. Moreover, even if estimated clinical benefits are predictable,
their effect on prices may not be. Under the German system, which uses
a very specific, albeit complicated, process for measuring clinical
benefit, there remains no clear quantitative relationship between
measured clinical benefit and negotiated prices.
These tradeoffs also underscore the risks of so-called ``reference
pricing'' approaches that tie American prices to those charged by other
countries. In so doing, Americans would be forced to live with the
vagaries of pricing systems designed and implemented elsewhere, around
priorities that may differ from ours. Moreover, academic research finds
that bringing reference pricing to the U.S. would likely inflate
overseas prices but leave U.S. prices largely unchanged. The net result
will be little if any benefit for American families in the short-term,
and some degree of harm to long-term medical innovation in the bargain.
Instead, aligning prices with value encourages innovators to invest
in areas that patients value. Achieving this outcome requires better
information about value, which is ironic because we already have an
overload of certain kinds of information about value. Prescription
drugs nearly always arrive to market with studies estimating their
value, often many of them, and they frequently reach divergent
conclusions. Instead of even more studies, payers and consumers need an
objective review and translation of the evidence on value. This might
not result in a single, incontrovertible estimate of economic value,
but even a range of values, when objectively determined, would benefit
the people and organizations ultimately footing the bill for
prescription drugs. Better information about value, coupled with price
transparency, helps ensure payers and consumers spend their money
wisely.
While it is yet to be determined what the true impact of the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will be on biomedical innovation, there
is strong evidence that cuts to Medicare's pharmaceutical spending will
reduce discovery of new treatments as well as new uses for existing
drugs. But there are ways to mitigate these adverse impacts. Most
importantly, it is essential that Maximum Fair Price (MFP)
determination hew to the principles of transparency and value to
patients. Economic research provides transparent approaches that can be
leveraged by CMS, and relying on economics no longer means relying on
the old-fashioned QALY. For example, one new value assessment method
based on research at the USC Schaeffer Center corrects the QALY's
errors by recognizing the long-established principle that goods are
more valuable to people who have less of them. Analogously, health
improvements are more valuable for people with disabilities, terminal
illness, or other severe disease. This approach comports with Federal
law by avoiding value assessments that discriminate against vulnerable
patients with disabilities or terminal illness.
Finally, Medicare Part D's benefit design also implicitly
encourages high list prices. Part D insurers favor high list prices in
part because they move patients more rapidly to the catastrophic phase
of coverage, where Federal reinsurance payments await. While the IRA's
Part D benefit redesign provisions may moderate these reinsurance-
related incentives somewhat, other program features (such as an intense
focus on premiums) suggest the upward pressure on list prices will
continue absent other market changes.
Sustaining Affordable and Valuable Innovation
Ultimately, the right policies need to focus on the affordability
of good health, not simply of health care. This is especially true for
diseases with few or no treatment options. The least affordable drugs
are those that have not yet been discovered. For example, in the days
before the discovery of effective vaccines, freedom from the most
devastating consequences of COVID-19 could not be bought at any price.
To be sure, affordable and generous insurance for prescription drugs
remains part of any solution, because today's medicines already put
good health within reach for millions of Americans suffering from
chronic disease. Making prices transparent and generating actionable
information on value will help wring out wasteful spending that fails
to benefit patients and their families. Finally, rewarding drugs that
do provide value helps sustain innovation and ensures good health will
be increasingly within the reach of Americans for generations to come.

Ensuring Affordable and Valuable Pharmaceutical Innovation for Patients
Increasing patient access through bold expansion of affordable care
means little when there are no valuable cures or treatments to access.
At the same time, breakthrough medical therapies provide little value
if high cost-sharing pushes them out of patients' reach.
This tradeoff between innovation and affordability has played out
in the different approaches taken across the globe. There is little
doubt that U.S. consumers access newer drugs sooner and more often than
their overseas counterparts. And this increased access to the latest
treatments matters. Schaeffer Center research suggests that introducing
European-style pricing policies would ultimately reduce innovation and
cost American consumers just over half a year of life expectancy, about
what would be lost if American surgeons suddenly forgot how to perform
heart bypass surgery. \1\ Thus, even though other countries likely
free-ride off the revenue generated in the American market, importing
overseas pricing policies will harm the health of American families.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Bypass surgery adds about 1.1 years of life to patients
treated with it. The lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease is around
60 percent. Thus, even if every heart disease patient received bypass
surgery, it would add just over half a year of life.
Nonetheless, the deteriorating accessibility of prescription drugs
in recent years still threatens to derail the access advantages and
health gains American consumers have so far enjoyed. Even patients with
``good'' insurance are struggling to access the therapies their doctors
prescribe. An increasing number of plans frequently impose co-insurance
requirements and exclude drugs from their formularies. These changes in
the marketplace likely harm health, since the link between increasing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
out-of-pocket costs and patient adherence is well-established.
Surprisingly, coverage has deteriorated even while the average
manufacturer net prices of brand drugs--the amount manufacturers
receive after rebates and discounts--have declined in each of the last
5 years. Transparency in pricing throughout the pharmaceutical
distribution system would be a major step toward ensuring that drug
prices reflect the actual value provided to patients, and don't simply
enrich intermediaries.
Rewarding drugs that do provide value helps sustain innovation and
ensures good health will be increasingly within the reach of American
patients for generations to come. Decades of economic research
demonstrate that innovation follows pricing incentives. Where
innovators expect higher returns, innovative effort and discovery
follow. As a result, aligning the price of every drug with the value it
brings to patients stimulates innovation that benefits patients and
discourages innovation that does not.
Ultimately, the right policies need to focus on the affordability
of good health, not simply of health care. The least affordable drugs
are those that have not yet been discovered.

The Chair. Let me start the questioning by saying that I
have heard some of my Republican colleagues talk about free
market capitalism. Mr. Maybarduk, isn't the entire
pharmaceutical industry based on Government granted monopoly
power?
Mr. Amir, you may want to also speak to that. What does
that have to do with free market capitalism if the Government
is guaranteeing monopoly for many, many years?
Mr. Maybarduk. Well, precisely, Senator. Prices are high
because drug makers have monopolies over products we can't just
substitute. A patient can't just say, I will take this
alternative. The patents block them from having affordable
access. That is a monopoly, not a market system.
American taxpayers stand up to the world's largest and most
productive funder of biomedical R&D at NIH. And it is we the
people that fund the risk--we the people that support the risky
early stage research that has led to such significant medical
breakthroughs in the areas of mRNA, cancer, heart disease, gene
therapy.
The Chair. In other words, the Government has played a very
active role in the entire process. Mr. Amin, what about free
market capitalism and monopolies?
Mr. Amin. Well, I mean, it is--the Constitution grants
Congress the power to promote the progress of science and
useful laws, securing for limited times a right to their
inventions. What we have now is a system where the patent
system is not a limited time.
It is in a monopoly that gets extended, extended, extended.
When we think about the free markets and the principles of
capitalism, it is interesting Senator Paul mentioned Milton
Friedman.
In fact, the neoliberals actually didn't like monopoly
power, and they really did actually believe in the free market,
but the fact that the intellectual property system, the patents
has been corrupted by the modern pharmaceutical system to kind
of extend those monopolies, actually goes against the
principles of free market.
o, in a sense, they are not living up to the bargain of the
free market.
The Chair. Okay. Mr. Lakdawalla, what do you think about
free market capitalism and Government protection of monopolies?
Mr. Maybarduk. Thank you, Chairman. Well, truly free
markets exist only on the whiteboard in my classroom at USC,
first of all. But it is also true that without patent
protection, there would be no innovation. That is a result that
has been known in economics for centuries.
The real question is how do we balance patent protection,
which induces innovation, against the value of new innovations
and being able to broadcast them more widely after the end of a
patent? And that tradeoff can be tricky, although in the case
of pharmaceuticals, we have a useful instrument which is health
insurance, and that allows patients to access drugs at much
lower prices than what manufacturers receive even during the
patent period.
That is an opportunity for us to expand accessibility even
during the patent protection period.
The Chair. Thanks very much. My last question for all three
of you is I believe you all heard the CEO's testimony in
response to questions. What would you say, briefly, about their
responses?
Did they in fact, effectively address the issue as to why
we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription
drugs, and why one out of three people can't afford the
medicine that doctors prescribe?
Mr. Maybarduk. Well, Senator, we heard some wild stuff up
here this morning, including a lot of blaming middlemen for the
problem of high prices. Look, drug makers' high prices are the
whole reason that we have a middleman problem.
It is because we have exceedingly high prices at the outset
that there is an attractive market for middlemen to enter. But
the fish rots from the head. If you break up the market, if you
look at where the revenue is, drug makers capture two-thirds,
$323 billion. Pharmacy benefit managers are a small slice, $23
billion.
You can't fix the problem of the pharmaceutical industry by
going off middlemen who are just trying to skim off the top.
You have to get to the root of the problem, which is the
monopoly power.
The Chair. Mr. Amin.
Mr. Amin. I agree with what Peter says, and I would just
add that some of the answers that these CEOs gave, for example,
the Merck CEO about allowing biosimilar competition in when
their primary patent ends, I believe that is not going to
happen. I think if you look at all the patents that they have
stacked up, they know what their game plan is.
You just have to look at what happened Humira and AbbVie.
Similarly, I believe you just look at what is happening with
these weight-loss drugs. We are looking at the patents on those
now. These are potentially going to become $1 trillion drugs.
The Chair. Okay. Dr. Lakdula--Lakdawalla--pardon me for----
Dr. Lakdawalla. No problem. I think an important point that
maybe is often missed is that net prices of pharmaceuticals
have been falling for the past 10 years very consistently. CMS
recently released its national health expenditure accounts
data, and it confirms this fact as well. We have to reconcile
that with rising costs for consumers.
I think intermediaries are actually playing a bigger role
than it might appear. About $0.40 of every dollar spent on
pharmaceuticals goes to intermediaries. And unlike
pharmaceutical firms, they are not engaging in innovation that
ultimately improves health.
The Chair. Thank you very much.
Senator Cassidy.
Senator Cassidy. Thank you all. Mr. Maybarduk, I think it
is made very persuasively--by the way, clearly, patents are
part of the free market system, is the way that you protect
intellectual property, and you incent creativity.
Now, whether it is being abused is another issue. And you
mentioned the patent thickets, which is actually legislation
sponsored by John Cornyn to do away with them. So, that is
recognized. But I think without protection of intellectual
property, we would not have this innovation. Now, why would
you--why would you put the time into it?
Let's just make that point. But Mr. Maybarduk, Dr.
Lakdawalla makes, I think, a persuasive point that without the
profit incentive, you will not get the innovation. Are you
disputing that?
Mr. Maybarduk. I am not.
Senator Cassidy. You are just kind of--the degree of the
profit taking, if you will. I will point out, by the way, that
the three examples you gave seem to be all Medicare patients
and there is legislation out there which will cap the out-of-
pocket exposure to--for Medicare patients on these expensive
drugs. I think it will be $2,000 in June 2025, and the
catastrophic portion is going away now.
But Dr. Lakdawalla, that said, somebody is paying. Yes,
insurance is making it more affordable. Medicaid is making it
more affordable. Medicare is making it more affordable. I could
go down, but somebody is paying. In my state, I was recently
told that pharmaceutical costs for the Medicaid program are now
35 percent of the total. And so, yes, maybe we could do some
value-based purchasing.
That is a lot of money, though. That is a huge program.
That is not hospitals and doctors. It is a pharmaceutical cost.
So, I think Mr. Mubarak would say, listen, they have got enough
profit to innovate. What we are really talking about is more
than the profit required to incent. Would you disagree with
that?
Dr. Lakdawalla. Well, I think the question is really how
much--whether we want to decrease profits or not. And we know
that whenever you decrease profits, you get less innovation.
The research that we have done gets exactly that question.
If you were to reduce prices and profits, what would the net
result be? You would certainly save money, but you would also
lead to fewer new drug discoveries and----
Senator Cassidy. Are we at the sweet spot now, or could we
do something to make drugs a little bit more affordable to the
Medicaid program, for example? Because I am looking at this
gene therapy and obviously how they are initially price is only
based upon the restraint of the company.
But if you have a compelling gene therapy, they could
almost name their price and it is going to be very difficult
for a Medicaid program not to cover. So, but this could
bankrupt taxpayers. So, thoughts on that?
Dr. Lakdawalla. Yes. So, I don't think we are at a spot
where lowering prices makes us better off. But for gene
therapies, I absolutely agree there is a significant problem.
And the issue is that the prices are all paid upfront when
there is the most uncertainty about whether the gene therapy is
going to work in the long run.
Senator Cassidy. Now, value-based purchasing could
obviously play a role here. But if you do value based
purchasing, you still have a--how do you negotiate the upfront
cost? I come up with a drug for a gene therapy for sickle cell.
I treated a lot of sicklers.
You want to treat them, and you charge $20 million a
person. I can't believe they would get that, but you see, the
only thing that would stop them from asking that may be the
sticker shock. So, how do you negotiate that first out of the
gate price?
Because I think that is a kind of a question that is kind
of hanging out there. And you are the free market guy, so I
would like your opinion. You are the whiteboard guy.
Dr. Lakdawalla. On the white board, yes. That is correct.
It is actually not the case that you should negotiate the
actual price upfront. Instead, a value based price would mean
that the price will respond over time. So, imagine a situation
where gene therapies were paid for in installments----
Senator Cassidy. I get that. And believe me, I have written
about that in Stat, if you ever wish to dig up something out of
Stat behind a paywall. But it still means that if you have got
an initial high price, no matter what your value-based
purchasing arrangement is, it could still be something which
society could not afford. What do you think of the German
model? Dr. Baker, I think, came up with that in which there
is--you know, you can ask whatever price you want for the first
2 years, but then after that, there is going to be some sort of
negotiation based upon real world data.
Dr. Lakdawalla. Yes. I think the challenge with the German
model is it is actually very hard to predict the outcomes. That
if you look at the ratings that the Germans produce of the
benefits of drugs, they are not well correlated with negotiated
prices.
If I am an innovator trying to figure out what I am going
to get paid in Germany, it is really hard. And if you can't
predict your returns, then they are not going to work as
financial incentives.
Senator Cassidy. Mr. Amin, have you had a chance to
evaluate the bill that is working its way through Judiciary
Committee--it might be included in a year end package. It is to
its effectiveness in addressing patent thickets. Yes, push your
button----
Mr. Amin. Senator Blumenthal and Cornyn's bill?
Senator Cassidy. Yes.
Mr. Maybarduk. I think it will potentially cap the
biologics patents that can be enforced to about 20. I have
actually given some technical advice on that bill. I don't
think it is going to resolve the problem.
Senator Cassidy. You don't think it is going to resolve the
problem?
Mr. Maybarduk. No.
Senator Cassidy. I see. Okay. Well, thank you all. Very
thoughtful.
The Chair. All right. Thank you all. Very good discussion.
Appreciate you being here. That is the end of our hearing
today, and I want to thank all of our witnesses for their
participation.
For any Senators who wish to ask additional questions,
questions for the record will be due in 10 business days,
February 23rd at 5.00 p.m.. And finally, I ask unanimous
consent to enter into the record three statements from
stakeholder groups and experts about the cost of prescription
drugs.

Families USA,
Washington, DC 20005,
February 8, 2024.
Senator Bernie Sanders, Chairman
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,
Dirksen Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC 20510.
Dear Members of the House of Representatives,
Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy, on behalf of Families
USA, we want to thank you for holding this important and timely hearing
and offer our appreciation for lifting up the reality of high drug
costs in the United States. It is well documented that the United
States is paying significantly higher prices for prescription drugs
compared to peer countries. A recent report from the Assistant
Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) found that in 2022, across all brand
name and generic drugs, families in America pay nearly three times as
much as 33 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries. \1\ And this gap is continuing to widen as drug
prices in the U.S. continue to skyrocket. This problem can easily be
traced directly back to failures in U.S. patent policy that incentivize
big drug corporations to keep old drugs on the market and push out
healthy competition, as well as these corporations' ability to price
gouge year over year with no repercussions.

Congress and the Biden administration have taken meaningful steps
to address high drug costs for Americans, importantly through enactment
and implementation of the Medicare price negotiation program and
inflationary rebates. It is essential that Congress build off this
critical progress by taking additional steps to further address this
uniquely American failure.
The Impact of High Drug Prices on Families
While high drug prices are a source of seemingly constant policy
debate in Washington, DC, for millions of America's families, they are
a painful and burdensome reality that often impacts their ability to
meet basic necessities of life. For example, consumers facing increased
drug costs report cutting back on key areas of their budget, such as
buying food. \2\ For some the choice is even more dire, with research
showing that nearly three in ten adults--approximately 80 million
people--in our Country have not taken required medicine as prescribed
due to its costs. \3\ Approximately one in five adults forgo essential
medications altogether because they can't afford to fill their
prescription in the first place. \4\ The impact of being forced to make
these decisions has on health is clear: medication nonadherence, such
as rationing or skipping needed medication, causes an estimated 125,000
deaths a year. \5\

While people who need high-priced drugs often face the most
significant financial pain from high and rising prices, the impact of
the skyrocketing cost of drugs is widely felt beyond the pharmacy
counter. Approximately 20 percent of health insurance premiums are
driven by the rising cost of prescription drugs, which means as drug
prices continue to rise so do premiums, deductibles, and other health
care costs for all families--even those who are not taking prescription
medications. \6\

Big Drug Corporations Abuse U.S. Patent System to Protect Profit and
Limit Competition
The business model of big drug companies is rooted in exploitation.
They take extreme steps to create a monopoly drug market and then abuse
it for profit, including price gouging, protecting drug exclusivity
through anticompetitive behavior, and increasing profits on old drugs
rather than investing in new and innovative treatments to help our
Nation's families. \7\ Drug companies regularly deploy a barrage of
tactics to extend their exclusivity periods, keep generics off the
market, and maintain their market dominance. \8\ Common examples
include blanketing one drug with multiple and overlapping patents to
create a ``patent thicket'' and ``product hopping'' a patent by making
minor tweaks to existing drugs that typically confer no additional
clinical benefit but allow for extended patent protections. In fact,
the 10 top-selling drugs on the market today have been granted an
average of 74 patents per drug, with an average of 140 patents filed
for each of them. \9\

Once these big drug corporations have blocked other competitors,
they are free to raise their drug's price year after year at shocking
rates, even long after the drug's release. We see this problem across
the drug market: Between July 2021 and July 2022, 1,216 drug products
had price increases that were higher than the inflation rate (8.5
percent). Some drug prices increased by more than 500 percent. \10\
These prices are not being justified by any additional benefits or
effectiveness of that drug. In fact, one study of high-spend drugs
showed that seven of the 10 drugs reviewed provided no additional
clinical benefit relative to other available drugs. \11\

Drug-Pricing-Issue-Brief.pdf.
These abuses only occur because of the loopholes littered
throughout the U.S. patent system and are major contributors to the
uniquely high drug prices that American families face.
Proposed Legislation Could Address Corporate Pricing Abuses
Recently, Congress took important steps to systemically bring down
drug prices and rein in the rate of skyrocketing price increases. The
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 is landmark legislation that
includes several key provisions to address the high prices that are a
hallmark of the American experience with prescription medication. The
recently passed reforms include giving Medicare the authority to
negotiate the price of drugs, as well as penalties (through rebates)
for big drug companies that raise the price of their drug higher than
the rate of inflation. These are both foundational steps that change
the incentives specific to the U.S. market that have led to these high
drug costs.
Congress can build on this foundation to further rein in
prescription drug costs and make health care more affordable for
everyone in two key ways:
1. Extending the reforms in the IRA to apply to the
commercial market to better protect all consumers from high and
irrational drug costs. This includes allowing the commercial
market to adopt Medicare's negotiated rates and extend the
inflationary rebate to fight price gouging year over year in
the commercial market.
2. Close loopholes that allow companies to create monopoly
drug markets and prevent generics from coming to the market in
a timely fashion. This includes ending patent abuses like
patent thickets and product hopping, simplifying the generic
approval process and ending pay for delay policies.
Conclusion
High and rising drug costs are a uniquely American problem and a
major factor as to why health care affordability is an American crisis.
Drug prices threaten the health and financial security of families and
individuals in every state and community. Big drug companies abuse the
patent system, delay the entry of generic drugs, and price gouge to
support their greed while families and individuals go into medical
debt, ration or skip medications, and have to choose between filling
their prescription or filling their fridge. Even those not taking
prescription drugs are left with difficult financial decisions due to
rising insurance premiums, higher deductibles, and stagnant wages--all
of which can be tied back to rising drug costs. This cannot be allowed
to continue. We appreciate the important work of this Committee to
address these concerns and look forward to continuing to work with you
to ensure all families can achieve affordable health and health care.

Dear Members of the House of Representatives,
As organizations representing patients and consumers, we write in
opposition to H.R. 485, the so-called Protecting Health Care for All
Patients Act of 2023. This bill claims to protect people from
discrimination but would in fact result in harm to patients if enacted
into law.
There is no single factor more important in arriving at an
appropriate price for a new drug than the value to patients. It is
axiomatic that to stimulate and reward innovative new drug development,
we should pay more for high-value drugs and less for low-value drugs.
Put another way, we want drugs with high clinical effectiveness against
the disease or condition they target and with a low burden of
undesirable side effects or toxicities.
Patients in this country--especially those with disabilities--need
a reliable system for evaluating the value of a medicine. Comparative
Effectiveness Research (CER) can clearly and transparently assess the
value of drugs in order to both inform patient decisionmaking and
arrive at appropriate prices. Instead of prioritizing legislation that
could lower prices, assess value, and improve health, the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced a version of H.R. 485 that
would impose further limits on CER. If enacted, language referring to
``similar measures'' in the current version of the bill would introduce
ambiguity across the health sector that could invite lengthy lawsuits
from an industry eager to stop any efforts to constrain its ability to
set prices as high as it wants for any drug--regardless of the drug's
value. This is not a new fight. Powerful drug companies have fought to
block CER for years with the single goal of preventing policymakers and
payers from scrutinizing value in order to rein in prices.
If the leaders of this bill truly wish to protect people with
disabilities from discrimination, they would instead advance
legislation to address our drug price system at its core given that
high drug prices disproportionately harm people living with
disabilities, chronic conditions, and low-income communities. In fact,
a recent study found thatpeople living with disabilities were about
three times more likely to ration medications as those without a
disability. High drug prices also disproportionately impact people of
color. Big drug companies exacerbate health inequities and inflict harm
by charging prices as high as the market will bear, untethered from the
value of a drug and at the expense of people's lives and livelihoods.
To be clear, we emphatically support measures that protect people
with disabilities, the elderly, and those with chronic or terminal
illness from analytical tools that are discriminatory. Due to concerns
about the use of the Quality Adjusted Life Year (or QALY), we believe
its use should be prohibited in Federal programs. But we must also
preserve the ability of our Nation to employ other measures that value
all lives equally, such as the Equal Value of Life Years Gained
(evLYG). Unfortunately, the leaders of the bill have rejected
amendments that would ban QALYs while preserving non-discriminatory
tools to assess value. So in the interests of patients, consumers,
employers, taxpayers, and all Americans who pay for health care and
prescription drugs and who need and want high value, innovative
treatments, we urge a no vote on H.R. 485 in its current form.
