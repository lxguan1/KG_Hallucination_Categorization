The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:02 a.m. Mountain, ARUP Laboratories, 540 S. Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah, Hon. Jason Smith  presiding. Chairman SMITH. The committee will come to order. Without objection, the gentleman from Mr. Utah, Mr. Owens, and the gentlewoman from Utah, Ms. Maloy, are authorized to participate in the hearing of the best committee in Congress and ask questions. Good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining us, and especially thank our host, ARUP Labs, for welcoming us to your impressive facility. It is incredible to be able to watch the future of medicine happening right before us during this hearing. I also want to thank Congressman Moore for hosting us here today. We had a great tour this morning of a private charity that helps meet basic needs and uses the power of meaningful work to help lift families out of poverty. And I am looking forward to another great event here. Everyone here should know that back in D.C., Blake is not shy about sharing how Utah could be a model for the rest of America at everything. So he is your advocate and he never stops. And we are proud that he is one of our shining members of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means Committee is in Salt Lake City to listen and learn directly from Americans making the next generation of medicines and the patients who are benefiting from those breakthroughs to see what Congress can do to encourage medical innovation in America. American innovators are the world's best. Our researchers, scientists, and doctors discover and develop new tests, treatments, and technologies that have improved the lives of millions. Today, new treatments are providing levels of quality care and transforming lives in ways that once seemed unthinkable. Today, tens of millions of Americans can consult with their doctor, have their vital signs monitored, receive drug infusions or even dialysis all from the comfort of their home. Patients have more control over their care and, most importantly, these breakthroughs are improving their health. Thanks to the work of this committee, seniors are one step closer to having access to more cutting-edge treatments. Just recently, the committee voted, with support of both Republicans and Democrats, to allow Medicare to cover anti-obesity medication, multi-cancer early detection screenings, and breakthrough medical devices. When these bills become law, seniors will have access to some of the most advanced treatments available. Importantly, the legislation is an investment to help America tackle the explosive growth of healthcare spending in the coming decades. With 95 percent of adults 60 and older having at least one chronic disease, innovation and access is a must for the long-term health of our country. America has the infrastructure, the people, and know-how to stay the world's leader in medical innovation, but the next groundbreaking cure or treatment will only be found because of strong support for research and development. Policies coming out of Washington must encourage more R&D to happen here in America. We must act to ensure Americans stay at the forefront of developing the best, most effective medical treatments. One of the first steps to growing R&D is cutting the red tape keeping new breakthroughs, like revolutionary Alzheimer's medication, out of the hands of patients. Legislation also approved by this committee this year would provide better access to these innovative therapies. The next step is looking at the Tax Code to foster an economy where innovators want to take risks and invest in more R&D. The 2017 Trump tax cuts encouraged American companies to hire new workers, create new products, and invest in America. More than $2 trillion was invested in new facilities and R&D activities, but it also succeeded in another key way: jobs. The R&D deduction supports 2 million jobs directly and 21 million more indirectly. These pro-growth policies under President Trump led to bigger paychecks for workers, low unemployment, and a booming economy. The House of Representatives took action earlier this year to keep our R&D incentives strong, but a massive tax hike awaits American families, farmers, innovators, and job creators. Republicans on this committee have formed tax teams to find ways to protect Americans from these tax hikes and also find new ways the Tax Code can be utilized to better incentivize research and development here in the U.S. and to outcompete our competitors like China. Members are fanning out across the country to listen to Americans directly affected by these issues and turn their ideas into policies that help workers, that help families, farmers, and small businesses thrive. Part of that effort includes this hearing today and listening directly to our witnesses here today about their stories and ideas for keeping medical innovation alive and well in America. We also want to hear from everyone that is in the audience. There will be clipboards, as you see before you, passed out, and we ask that you take time to fill them out and let us hear from you. It will be entered into the official hearing record, and we will take those back to Washington as we consider how to unleash medical breakthroughs across the country. I am now pleased to introduce the host of this committee, Mr. Congressman Moore. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman. And before we hear from our witnesses--that will be next, correct?--I just wanted to echo that welcome to everyone. To my colleagues that are not on this committee, Mr. Owens and Ms. Maloy, thank you for also being here. A sincere thank you to all the committee staff--we know where this really all gets done--to be able to organize and make all this happen. So thank you all for being here. And to our witnesses, I look forward to hearing you in just a moment. But you sensed some levity when Chairman Smith joked that I am not bashful, and I am probably a little outspoken on the best practices that we see out of Utah. I am passionate about it. I mean it. And I want our federal government to operate a lot more like some of the things that I have grown up with and some of the things that I have seen work time and time again, from this morning, where we go out of our way to help those in need, to creating innovation that is not going to stymie our ability to not only lower costs but provide care for those that need it. So, again, thank you, Chairman, and thank you all for being here. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Thank you, Blake. I am pleased to recognize the gentleman from Utah, Mr. Owens. Mr. OWENS. Thank you. Are we ready to do the questions right now or just---- Chairman SMITH. No. Mr. OWENS. Okay. Well, first of all, just know, back in D.C., Blake, Celeste, and John, we are continually talking about this remarkable state we live in. I have been blessed the last 10 years to be a Utahan, and I cannot say enough. Matter of fact, I warn my colleagues whenever they come to visit--and they will all tell you this--the warning is, if you come out to Utah too often and stay too long, you become a Utahan. So let's keep that up. Let's keep up with innovation. Let's keep our service, our collaboration, which you do so well with. And I am just very, very excited to be a part of this panel. Thank you so much for the opportunity, and I look forward to the things that will come out of this for sure. Chairman SMITH. Thank you, sir. I am pleased to recognize the gentlewoman from Utah, Ms. Maloy. Ms. MALOY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being in Utah. This is really important. I have been in Congress for a short time, and some of the best news and some of the worst news I have heard from constituents comes out of the healthcare industry. Some of the worst news is we have got constituents who struggle to afford medications, rural patients who don't have access, independent pharmacies that are going under, which harms patients. It also harms Main Street economies, especially in our small towns, and we have got families choosing between medical bills and mortgages. The best news is we have more telehealth access, more remote patient monitoring, more home dialysis, and Utah companies that are doing really innovative research that will make people's lives better. And so I am excited to be here supporting your committee and talking to people in Utah about the need to unleash American innovation both in technology, which we are sitting right here looking at--they are working while we are talking-- and in policy, which this committee is doing. So thank you for allowing me to be a part of it. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I will now introduce our witnesses. We have, first, Kasey DeLynn Shakespear, who is a parent of a rare disease patient and a rural health champion. We have Ms. Heloisa Soares, who is an associate professor and medical director of Clinical Trials Office for the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah. We have Frank Watanabe, who is president and CEO of Arcutis Biotherapeutics. And we have Kelvyn Cullimore, who is the CEO of BioUtah. Thank you all for joining us today. Your written statements will be made part of the hearing record, and you each have 5 minutes to deliver remarks. Mr. Shakespear, you may begin when you are ready. STATEMENT OF KASEY DELYNN SHAKESPEAR, PARENT OF A RARE DISEASE PATIENT, RURAL HEALTH CHAMPION Mr. SHAKESPEAR. My name is Kasey Shakespear, and I am here today to discuss with you my family's medical journey with innovation and the limitations of living in a rural community. Chairman SMITH. Could you pull your mic a little bit closer? Mr. SHAKESPEAR. Sure. In 2021, my wife and I were expecting our third child. We found ourselves facing the unthinkable during an OB appointment at 19 weeks gestation. Our unborn son was diagnosed with bilateral renal agenesis, formally known as Potter Syndrome. BRA is a congenital condition in which the fetus does not develop kidneys. BRA is considered by medical text as a universally fatal condition with no treatment options. One in three BRA babies die before birth--thank you. One in three BRA babies die before birth with the others dying shortly after due to underdeveloped lungs. When we received the news, my mind immediately went to which cemetery will we bury my son in, and how will we explain to our other children why their brother isn't coming home? Unlike me, my wife did not accept defeat. She researched and discovered an innovative clinical trial happening at a handful of centers around the country called the Renal Anhydramnios Fetal Therapy Trial, or RAFT. RAFT is an innovative treatment program that involves serial amnioinfusions of fluid into the womb with an ultrasound-guided needle. The closest centers to us that offered RAFT were in Denver, Colorado, 630 miles away, and Pasadena, California, 380 miles away. We chose to go to Pasadena and met with Dr. Ramen Chmait and Dr. Martha Monson at L.A. Fetal Surgery. My wife and unborn son were screened and deemed eligible to be entered into the trial as a fetal-maternal pair. However, Dr. Chmait counseled us that pursuing treatment would be a long road. If we proceeded, it could threaten our marriage, my career, our financial stability, our home, and the well-being of our other children. And treatment was still a Hail Mary with a small chance of success. We considered the factors and decided to pursue treatment. Doing so required us to temporarily relocate from rural Utah to Pasadena, California. Over the next 11 weeks, my wife received 11 serial amnioinfusions. At 31 weeks gestation, my wife's sac began to leak, and we had to halt treatment. The original medical plan was for my son to be cared for at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, but he was measuring too small to receive a peritoneal catheter for PD dialysis. We found ourselves suddenly forced 360 miles north to Palo Alto, California, just 1 week before my son's birth, at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford. In late 2021, my son was born with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. The amnioinfusions had been successful, but over the next 5 and a half months, he would battle for his life daily in the NICU. He was placed on dialysis 2 days after birth with an Aquadex machine, which was developed for adults with congestive heart failure but adapted for neonates to receive dialysis. He went through blood pressure issues that were ultimately resolved with angiotensin II, becoming the first neonate kidney patient at Stanford to ever be treated with this innovative medication. During his NICU stay, he contracted a serious infection, underwent multiple high-risk surgeries, experienced seizures, and overcame it all. At 6 months old, my son was transported via air ambulance to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he was admitted for 2 weeks at Intermountain Health Primary Children's Hospital. During that time, my wife and I were trained on how to perform all the necessary functions to care for our son and administer dialysis on a nightly basis at home. He was discharged from the hospital for the first time at 6 and a half months old. It has been just over 2 years since my son was discharged, and over that time, he has been readmitted five times for stays varying from 3 days to a little over 3 weeks, each stay requiring a life flight from St. George due to the complexity of his condition. Although telehealth has helped us connect with some specialists, we have had to travel 9 hours round trip from St. George to Salt Lake City every single month to attend mandatory in-person dialysis appointments. Our little Isaac is now nearly 3 years old and active on kidney recipient lists in multiple regions. We hope to receive a call any moment to bring him in to receive his kidney. My wife and I have walked through hell to save our son, but we were only able to do so because the stars aligned for us. We received tremendous support from family, friends, neighbors, members of our religious congregation, and complete strangers. We found RAFT and were able to navigate the American healthcare system because of our education. We were able to overcome the cost of treatment because of insurance, and the ability to continue working remotely, as well as the generosity of so many people. And we continue to receive adequate care thanks to programs such as Utah Medicaid's Medically Complex Children's Waiver program. Our story stands as a testament to the innovations and technology that our healthcare system has to offer, but according to HRSA, a little over 25 million rural Americans live in health profession shortage areas. Innovations in healthcare brought about lifesaving procedures for my son, but our opportunity is not representative of so many others. My wife receives messages on social media from frantic parents trying to find treatment options for BRA and other similar conditions almost on a weekly basis. Many rural Americans simply cannot make it work to pursue care. There are so many details and barriers about the challenges that my family has faced that I wish I could share, but I can testify that the cost of accessing these innovative treatments coming from rural America is extremely high. I applaud this committee for your efforts to improve care, especially in rural communities, and I want you to know that what you are doing makes a difference to families like mine. But I implore you to keep working to ensure that every American has an equitable opportunity to receive this type of innovative care in their most dire moments. Thank you.    T6531A.003   T6531A.004   T6531A.005   T6531A.006 Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Shakespear. Powerful testimony. Dr. Soares, you are now recognized. STATEMENT OF DR. HELOISA P. SOARES, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL TRIALS OFFICE, HUNTSMAN CANCER INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH Dr. SOARES. Thank you so much for the opportunity of being here. Thank you. I am Dr. Heloisa Soares. I am a medical oncologist at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, and I care for patients with neuroendocrine cancers, a cancer that is very rare and poorly understood. Improving cancer care is particularly personal to me. My father lives with a rare cancer for which there has not been a lot of medical innovation in the last several years, and he doesn't have any treatment options. In a twist of faith, my own 35-year-old brother was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer, the cancer that I specialize at. It was devastating to me initially, but he underwent his complex surgery and is now on a clinical study. He asked me last year if he should put his affairs in order because of his cancer, and I look him in the eyes with confidence and I told him, yes, but not because of the fact that you have this cancer. You should always do that because that is what responsible people do. Live your life, enjoy life, and if you want to expand your family, do so. Live your dreams. And I can say that with confidence because of the medical innovations that we have been able to provide to our patients. And I am not saying this out of nothing. I have here behind me Charlene Edwards, who is a patient of mine, who has been living with neuroendocrine cancer for the last 18 years. When Charlene was diagnosed, the doctors gave her very little hope and told her that there was only one treatment that was available. At the time, she felt that she was without really any hope. However, there are several new treatments that have been developed to treat her cancer, and now I can think about at least five other medical treatments that we can use for this disease. In fact, Charlene has benefited from some of these treatments in clinical trials and as a standard of care. Which brings me to the fact that I am the medical director for the Huntsman Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Office. I oversee more than 250 active clinical trial treatments at a given time. I can do that because the Huntsman Cancer Institute and the National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center serves the entire Mountain West, including Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Nevada. Thirty percent of our patients that are in clinical trials come from far away, from rural and frontier regions, more than 150 miles away from me. These trials represent lifelines for these patients, offering novel treatments when there is little hope with conventional treatments. We are constantly developing new treatment strategies to care for our patients in the frontier and rural population. One example is the development of clinical trials using short course radiation for patients. I had patients that had declined radiation treatment for their cancers, because traditionally these treatments have to be delivered within a span of 5 to 6 weeks. However, our tireless radiation oncology teams and researchers have developed the strategies to deliver these radiation treatments effectively and safely in a much shorter span of time. So now patients can receive the care that they need and continue to live their lives and not have to go away from family for so long, which can be a barrier because of financial issues, or even because they have to care for their children or elderly patients or spouses that are also sick. To address distance as a disparity for our rural and frontier populations, we have developed additional several strategies. We collaborate very closely with different centers, including Sweetwater Regional Cancer Center in rural Wyoming, to enhance accessibility for patients to care and clinical trials. We also, an example that I am proud to say, we have our neuroendocrine cancer designation care program providing specialized care for patients who travel from far away, and they can have access to our experts and the standard of our treatments. But to do all this, we need help. Federal support is crucial to sustain these efforts. Innovative programs need to be supported and recognized. Our nationally appraised Huntsman at Home program delivers specialized care to patients at their home, but programs like that need a sustainable funding pathway, as they not fit the traditional reimbursement model for inpatient or outpatient care. So I am here in front of you to advocate for a few things. Development of innovative payment models to support these new care modalities, extending healthcare--telehealth services and refining care models so I can care for the patients receiving advanced therapies, such as cell therapy or theranostics, which is the use of radioligand therapies in these patients, and I can monitor them from a distance, leveraging technology and novel strategies. And also, asking to leveraging AI and data science to advance cancer care. There is a need for federal support to enhance the infrastructure of data management and sharing across healthcare systems. Medical innovation is the cornerstone of our progress for cancer care. Innovations had allowed me to conduct telehealth visits, coordinate local care with patients at home, administering treatments remotely, and significantly enhance symptom management and the quality of life of our patients in our community. Another day Charlene, reminded me that Huntsman Cancer Institute is located at Circle of Hope Drive. Thanks to medical innovation that we have, I can share hope to my patients and to my brother. It takes a village to take care of our patients, and I ask for federal support to continue doing so and continuing doing our job. I am honored to be here in front of you, and I am grateful for Congress' role in advancing innovations, and I hope to receive the support that I can continue to care for my community. Thank you very much.    T6531A.007   T6531A.008   T6531A.009 Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Watanabe. You are now recognized. STATEMENT OF FRANK WATANABE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ARCUTIS BIOTHERAPEUTICS Mr. WATANABE. Thank you. Chairman Smith, Congressman Moore, members of the committee, I am honored to share my perspectives as president and CEO of Arcutis Biotherapeutics. In addition, I am also on the board of directors of Bio. Arcutis was founded in 2016 to develop novel treatments for dermatologic diseases. The FDA approved our first product in July of 2022, and has granted us two additional approvals since; in fact, the third one this week. We have grown from three employees in 2016 to nearly 350 today, with operations in all 50 states and employees in 39 states, including an office near here in Park City, Utah. Turning to the broader U.S. biopharmaceutical sector, our industry plays a vital role in improving public health in the U.S. and around the world. Our innovations transform patient care, improve outcomes, and give hope. Roughly a third of the increase in Americans' life expectancy over the last quarter- century can be directly attributed to biopharmaceutical innovations. For example, the American Cancer Society estimates that cancer death rates in the United States have declined by one- third since 1991, preventing 3.8 million deaths, and much of that is due to better cancer treatments. Biopharm also contributes to our economy, employing more than 2 million people in more than 127,000 firms across the country, and we constitute somewhere between 5 and 7 percent of U.S. GDP. We also contribute directly and indirectly to U.S. national security. It is my fervent belief that promoting our sector should be a cornerstone of our government's policy agenda. Although we are the undisputed global leader in biopharm, that leadership cannot be taken for granted. Today, we face threats from both overt policy choices and long-term neglect. We have seen what can happen in other critical industries like semiconductors when neglect or misguided policies cause the U.S. to lose our leadership position. Biotech companies are committed to championing broad access to transformative therapies. Policies that focus all of the scrutiny on biopharmaceutical innovators ignore the real barriers that affect American's access to innovative treatments. A significant factor in the high and ever-increasing cost of innovative therapies in the United States is the growing power of middlemen who, in most cases, pocket more than half of what is paid for treatments. For example, my company only realizes about 40 cents every dollar that is paid for our treatment with the remainder going to intermediaries. In particular, concentration in the PBM sector gives these firms immense power to influence prices, control access to treatment, and deny coverage. And the growing trend of PBMs merging with other intermediaries only increases their power. This vertical integration also gives intermediaries significant power over physicians' ability to select treatments for their patients with utilization management criteria like prior authorizations and step edits substantially restricting doctors' ability to tailor treatments for their patients. Congress should urgently move forward with PBM reforms, and the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act is an important step forward. Another major barrier to American's access to innovative therapies is patient out-of-pocket costs, which insurers and PBMs continue to increase through higher patient copays, expanded high deductible plans, and increased use of patient co-insurance. Congress should pass the bipartisan Help Ensure Lower Patient Copays Act to reduce patient out-of-pocket burdens. The IRA is already negatively impacting drug development. Fortunately, there are two bipartisan bills that could help. First, the ORPHAN Cures Act would fix the IRA's disincentive around rare disease drug development. And second, the EPIC Act would fix the so-called pill penalty that favors biologics. Both biologics and small molecules are critical to treating patients. Our R&D investment should flow to the best science that can have the greatest impact, and these two bipartisan bills would help make that possible. Intellectual property protections are the foundation of our industry but currently are under threat both at home and abroad. I implore Congress and this committee to fervently defend IP rights against those threats. U.S. small and mid-sized biotech companies, or SMEs for short, account for three-fourths of the global drug pipeline, and roughly a third of all new drugs approved by the FDA since 2009 were developed by smaller biotechs. Congress should prioritize fostering investments in SME biotechs. My written comments contain details on specific policies, and I would be happy to answer more questions on specific ideas if you would like later. Investing in domestic biomanufacturing, strengthening our local workforce, and ensuring critical cutting-edge clinical studies are conducted in the United States should be a core tenet of our government's agenda. Finally, the interconnected bioscience ecosystem is not confined just to biopharmaceuticals. Promoting biopharmaceutical innovation can also strengthen the broader U.S. biotechnology ecosystem where innovators are applying biotechnology to food security, sustainability, and climate change. Thank you for your time.    T6531A.010   T6531A.011   T6531A.012   T6531A.013   T6531A.014   T6531A.015   T6531A.016   T6531A.017   T6531A.018   T6531A.019 Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Cullimore, you are now recognized. STATEMENT OF KELVYN CULLIMORE, CEO, BIOUTAH Mr. CULLIMORE. Thank you, Chairman Smith and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing. I am also grateful to Representative Blake Moore, our Utah member of the committee, as well as Representatives Celeste Maloy and Burgess Owens, members of the Utah delegation, for engaging in these important discussions. My name is Kelvyn Cullimore. I am the president and CEO of BioUtah, the trade association for the state's life sciences industry. BioUtah is a common voice for the industry consisting of medical device development and manufacturing, diagnostics, biotechnology, and biopharmaceuticals. In addition to my position at BioUtah, I have personal experience in the industry as a medical device entrepreneur. I co-founded Dynatronics, a Utah-based manufacturer of physical therapy products. I have also served for 13 years as the first mayor of Cottonwood Heights, a Salt Lake City suburb. So I am very sincere when I say thank you for your service. We are immensely proud of what we are building here. We have organized an onsite innovation showcase with nearly 20 Utah life sciences companies exhibiting their contributions to healthcare innovation. We encourage you to pay them a visit if you haven't already. Despite the 100-degree temperature today, you may know that Utah has the greatest snow on Earth, but you may not know that over the past decade, Utah has been the third fastest growing bio-innovation hub in the Nation. One of the first COVID-19 tests to receive FDA emergency use authorization was developed here in Utah, as was the saliva-based test for COVID-19. Utah companies are also creating lifesaving solutions for stroke, advances in genetic-based cancer diagnostics, drug discovery for MS, Alzheimer's, and other neurodegenerative diseases, treatment for Parkinson's disease, regenerative cell- based therapies that alleviate pain and restore function in patients with degenerative diseases of the spine, improved heart valve replacements, cutting-edge diagnostics for chronic kidney disease, brain computer interface technology that would make Elon Musk jealous. And AI-enabled drug discovery and more are all part of Utah life sciences world. I have seen firsthand the challenges faced by our industry and, more specifically, how government's laws and regulations can promote or impede innovation. In Utah, we are very fortunate to have a state government that supports our industry. However, no matter how favorable a state's innovation landscape, misguided federal policies can erode any home team advantage. To that end, we offer a number of policy considerations. First, we urge enactment of the Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products of 2023 to provide provisional Medicare coverage for FDA-authorized breakthrough medical technologies. Such a policy would accelerate patient access to innovative treatments. PhotoPharmics, a Utah company working on phototherapy to treat Parkinson's disease, received that designation from the FDA, opening the door for early coverage under the prior Medicare Coverage for Innovation Technology, or MCIT, final rule. But when this policy was reversed by the current administration, the resulting uncertainty caused investors to pull back, delaying efforts to bring this product breakthrough technology to market and depriving Medicare patients of this important therapy. We applaud the committee for marking up this legislation last week with strong bipartisan support. We also want to thank the committee for agreeing to fix the drafting error that inadvertently omitted diagnostics from the marked-up bill. We thank our Representatives, Moore, Maloy, and Owens, for supporting the bill. We have great hope this legislation will better serve patients by breathing new life into this expedited coverage concept. Secondly, robust R&D is essential to creating solutions to serious medical conditions. However, policies like the Inflation Reduction Act or changes to R&D expensing under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act can put brakes on the R&D momentum. We urge Congress to establish a pro-innovation tax structure, including full and immediate expensing of R&D costs, bonus depreciation for equipment, and other pro-innovation provisions as proposed in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024. BioUtah supports this House-passed bipartisan tax bill which favorably addresses these policies. Furthermore, tax policies related to capital gains and that operating losses should be carefully crafted to attract investment in the life sciences innovation. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have overreached in restricting merger and acquisition activity. This is particularly problematic for life sciences where M&A plays a critical role in bringing new therapies to market. That process is like a relay race where M&A allows companies to pass the baton and leverage complementary expertise which would otherwise be too costly or duplicative. More details on these and other policy considerations can be found in my written testimony. To sum up, Utah has a thriving patient-centered life science ecosystem fueled by entrepreneurship, a passion to innovate, and a unique culture of collaboration. Federal policies can either empower or undermine these strengths. Creating a sound tax structure, ensuring timely Medicare coverage of breakthrough products, and taking a reasoned approach to M&A, Congress can help unleash the full potential of life sciences innovation in Utah and beyond and spark the next generation of technologies, treatments, and cures that will change patients' lives. I thank the committee for taking the time to come to Utah, and I welcome any questions you may have.

I want to thank each and every one of you for your testimony, and we will now move to questions and answers. Mr. Shakespear, access to new and innovative treatments can be a challenge in any community, but we know it can be particularly difficult to those living in rural America. As the parent of a son who was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, can you talk about the challenges you face coming from a rural area in finding access to necessary innovative therapies and how you are able to manage the logistics today? Mr. SHAKESPEAR. Thank you, first of all. When we were diagnosed, it was unknown to the physicians in Utah that the RAFT trial even existed, and so the burden fell on my wife and I to find that treatment. So as I mentioned, if it wasn't for our educational backgrounds, then it would have been impossible to find the treatment to start with. But managing the back and forth, there is a lot of logistics that go into relocating, you know, 500, 600 miles away and having to stay there consistently. So that was a major challenge, but now that we are back home, there is still a lot of coordinating with physicians. My wife is a full-time scheduler. She is the care coordinator for my son, and she stays busy all week long and usually has multiple appointments every week. And then we have two older children, so it becomes quite a burden to manage all of the schedules and care for everybody's needs. But in addition to that, being on a kidney registration list, if you have ever had an organ donation, you know pretty much your entire life is tentative status, hoping to be able to do things but waiting to see if you get that call that disrupts everything. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Watanabe, many tax provisions have expired or have been phasing down over the past few years, including those which reward innovation right here in the U.S., like research and development. Looking ahead to 2025, this committee is exploring how the Tax Code can help better facilitate innovation, especially in the biotech industry, create new technologies, and encourage domestic manufacturing. With your experience and understanding of drug development, what would you recommend Congress look at when it comes to supporting healthcare innovation through the Tax Code? Mr. WATANABE. Thanks for that question, Chairman. Yes, I am glad you asked that question. I think there are a number of specific provisions. You know, first one is restoring full depreciation, deductibility for R&D investments. You know, the committee has already taken that up. The bill has passed the House. We hope to see that pass through. You know, the challenge there is that small companies are paying taxes even though they are not making any money because they are not able to fully deduct their R&D expenses, and particularly for smaller companies, that can be crippling. I think another potential opportunity is looking at monetization of net operating losses. Many small companies have large numbers of NOLs, and an ability to monetize those in the early stages when they can invest in R&D is something that could make a meaningful difference in capital access for smaller companies, which is becoming increasingly difficult. Along with that, I think corrections to section 382 would be an important consideration. In some cases, bringing investments into a new company--into your company--new investments in your company causes you to lose your ability to use your NOLs, and correcting that would be an important change. Section 1202 is a very important tool for early-stage investments. My company benefited from section 1202. Preserving that and potentially even expanding 1202 I think would be another important opportunity to foster investment in especially early-stage R&D companies. And then also, the passive activity loss rule in the 1986 tax reforms has really significantly impaired the ability of investors to benefit from flow-through losses from their investments. That would be another thing that the committee could address that would particularly foster investment in early-stage companies. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I was thinking you were a tax lawyer for a second. Dr. Soares, you have been at the forefront of innovative treatments in oncology and helping cancer patients navigate what is called the six scariest letters in the English language. This committee recently approved legislation introduced by Representatives Arrington and Sewell that expands Medicare coverage to multi-cancer early detection screening tests. Can you discuss how having Medicare cover innovative early detection tests can improve the care you are able to provide your patients and ultimately lower healthcare costs? Staff. We are going to pull pause for 1 second. We are just going to get the mike's working again. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Your time is still running, Chairman. Chairman SMITH. Okay. My mike is working. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Now mine is back. Dr. SOARES. Oh, yes. Now it is back. Thank you for the question. I think novel ways to monitor cancer when it is already diagnosed or detected are key. I think it is important to have that validation. I can share with you that now there are tests that are available that I can use. There are blood tests that I can monitor the tumor cells that are potentially present after patients receive treatment, and that has been fundamental to potentially helping decrease the need for patients to come to the cancer center. I can alternate between doing CAT scans to monitor recurrence versus these blood tests. So that has been fundamental to keep patients on surveillance, on monitoring, and then also decreasing the cost of doing these scans and visits if I can do that with blood. So I think there has been a lot of progress in monitoring and detecting minimal residual disease in cancer patients, and it has been substantially important to keep patients compliant with their care that has been designed for them. In terms of early detection, I think there are several technologies that are very promised and then they are approved to be safe. They will be fantastic for our patients and for improving their survivals. Chairman SMITH. Thank you very much. I recognize Mr. Moore. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman. Again, I would like to welcome my colleagues. Just appreciate you being here. I appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedules to be here. I really am honored that the chairman would bring the committee here today so we can showcase what Utahans are so proud of. I would also like to thank ARUP for hosting us today. Utah has some of the most innovative and fastest growing life science sectors in the country. And as up here, we sacrifice a little bit of our ability to hear, it just showcases there is work to do, and this is a working lab, and, you know, there is a lot to be done. And so we appreciate the productivity that comes from this part of the First District. As the IRA, Inflation Reduction Act, that was signed into law last Congress is implemented, I remain concerned not only about the law's impact on medical innovation, particularly for rare diseases, but that it may result in increased use of prior authorization in step therapy, fewer covered medicines, narrower pharmacy networks, and fewer plan options for seniors covered under part D. A lot of times these pieces of legislation get branded as, you know, a way to lower costs and this and that, but the reality of what takes place during this is going to limit all of the important aspects to providing care and getting that care to individuals at a lower cost but at the same time identifying cures and promoting that type of innovation. There was bipartisan interest in reforming the Medicare Part D benefit for several years prior to the passage of IRA. So I would urge members of this committee particularly to work together towards improving the Part D program for seniors. So I just want to mention that, because I think it is so important to all the companies and the things they are working on in this area. I am not going to rehash the fact that tax is going to be important next year. Mr. Watanabe, you have already identified so much of that. I would ask Mr. Cullimore and--again, Frank, please share-- could you speak to net operating losses? You introduced it a little bit. Just the specifics of how it can be beneficial to a company, how they would use it, with some specific examples about some of these tax implications that you have already introduced. Mr. Cullimore. Mr. CULLIMORE. I feel inadequate to answer that sitting next to what looked like a tax attorney, but let me take a shot at it. The NOL monetization concept is very important for early- stage companies because, as they built up losses, as they are doing research, they are building up these losses, but capital becomes so critical to their success. And so the ability to monetize those either through a device of being able to market those like a tax credit could be marketed or to be able to utilize those like an earned income tax credit on a personal tax return, things of that nature, that generates capital that further advances the work. Now, we recognize there is a cost associated with that, but there are abilities to get returns on those kinds of investments. Someone asked me, how would you pay for something like that? The IRA, when it was passed, it supposedly generated a lot of savings, they say. Most of those savings are being redirected in other government programs. If even a fractional portion of that were redirected to this, it would fully cover any kind of cost associated with that. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you. Anything to add, Frank? Mr. WATANABE. I was going to say maybe just in terms of putting it into operational practice, you know, our company has been in existence since 2016. We have generated something like a billion dollars in losses trying to get our first product to market before we generated a single dollar of revenue. You can't use your NOLs until you are profitable. I would hope that maybe sometime in the next 5 years it will be profitable, right, but that is a long time to be sitting in that hole. Our ability to sell our NOLs to another company and bring that money in to invest into R&D immediately would make a huge difference for us and for earlier stage companies. And, you know, it is not really a cost to the government. It is just a shifting of when those NOLs are used because I have a right to use them eventually. It is just a matter of can I use that money today to invest in research and development versus waiting another 5 years or so until I start generating profits and can start to exploit my NOLs. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Excellent. Thank you for those specific examples. Dr. Soares, as I wrap up, there is so much that the Huntsman Cancer Institute does for this community. It doesn't exist without strong private sector involvement in donations and philanthropy. And just thank you for being here. That is what makes this area thrive so much. But just briefly, as you embrace AI and other types of technologies, what barriers exist for you all that you can't necessarily, you know, find those new next generation innovative technologies that will help you find those cures? Dr. SOARES. Yeah. Thank you so much for this question. And I am very proud of living in Utah and being at the Huntsman Cancer Center. As you said, you come here and this place is amazing and you just stay. There is a need for AI to be able to have data-sharing integration and management. In management, there is a lot of different electronic medical records that are very separate and spread. The AI technology can leverage that. We can integrate this data. We can share them in the proper ways, and that will lead to so much more innovation. So I think working on ways that we can safely integrate AI and share data will be imperative for us to continue to advance and also use that to identify the patients that will benefit from new treatment options. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you. Thank you for your indulgence, Chairman. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Owens. Mr. OWENS. Thank you again, Chairman Smith, for coming to this beautiful Salt Lake City and for this important field hearing today. I am so proud to sit next to my good friend Blake Moore. He has been a fierce champion for Utah's unique ecosystem, one that has helped our nation to thrive, our state to thrive. Today's hearing is highlighting medical innovation. Here in this state, it is the fastest growing state in the union since 2010 and a national innovator in other fields of education, workforce, transportation, IT, and aerospace. I am so proud to see so many Utahans as witnesses today and eager to share our story as a model for the rest of the country. Mr. Cullimore, what has made Utah so successful in developing in its life sciences industry, and what lessons can we take from the entrepreneurial culture here? Mr. CULLIMORE. Thank you, Representative Owens. As you are aware, Utah is a great state for doing business. We have been recognized nationally as the number one state for doing business, the best state to open a business. The entrepreneurial spirit here goes back to the pioneer heritage that founded this state, and that heritage has carried on today. We have many large companies that operate in the state of Utah, but many of them are here because they acquired technology that was developed here in Utah. We have a phenomenal academic system here with our universities who generate great technology. We also have a great workforce here, and we have the ability to generate great ideas because of the existing critical mass of companies that are here that spin off from other companies. You can trace many of the companies back to other companies that were here, people who have spun off from them. And so we are very fortunate to have a very high-growth industry in the life sciences here. Most people are unaware of that. We are the number three state in the nation in density of employment in life sciences behind only Massachusetts and New Jersey. So we are recognized as the life science hub, and that kind of success begets additional success. Mr. OWENS. Thank you. You talked a bit earlier, you might want to elaborate, any more on Utah's ability to track funding since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in terms of shutting off opportunities for future generic competition? Mr. CULLIMORE. Well, the Inflation Reduction Act, I don't think we have seen the full impact of that yet. I think as the specifics come forward and we see the impact that can have, it is going to have an even greater chilling effect on research and development in the therapeutics field. I think we are already seeing--and Frank can testify to this better than me--how investors are very concerned and withholding funding until they see how some of this pans out. And I am afraid what they see will discourage them even further. So that is a challenge. That is going to be a challenge in the pharmaceutical area for that, and Utah has a lot of early-stage pharmaceutical companies. And so we have some concerns. Some of the things that Frank talked about that could improve it are important steps, but overall, the bill is still of great concern. Mr. OWENS. Thank you. Mr. Shakespear, you made some comments earlier. Any additional comments or insight on how to support the rural community for issues that you are having right now in the health arena? Mr. SHAKESPEAR. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I would urge you to put it in the hands of the parents in rural America to decide whether they are willing to pay the price to pursue these innovative treatments. It is difficult to bring them to close proximity to everybody in rural America, and I recognize that. And you have to understand as well that not every urban center is even created equally, because the treatments that saved my son are still not available in Utah. But in many instances throughout our journey, medical providers at times tried to make the decision for us on whether we would be willing to pay the price to continue with treatment, and I would just urge that in every situation the parent gets the choice in that right. Let the patient choose whether they are willing to pursue that or not, and don't make assumptions about whether the patient is willing to go that distance when making decisions about legislation and things regarding continuing to research and develop these innovative treatments. Mr. OWENS. Thank you so much. And I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Ms. Maloy. Ms. MALOY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shakespear, before I ask a question, I just have to say I am really impressed. We asked you to come here and talk about something really deeply personal and really emotional, and you have been very poised about it, so thank you for that. You know, I have spent most of my life in really rural areas too. You and I were talking before the start about some of the places that we both know. And we all know, we talk about it all the time in Utah, how we are losing our rural kids to urban areas. They have to leave to get jobs. And the Governor of Utah has made a big push to bring more jobs to rural areas, and that is wonderful. But your story is a reminder that even when us rural kids grow up and can get jobs in our small hometowns, if anything goes wrong, we still have to move to urban areas where we can get medical treatment or whatever else the problem is. So thank you for being here and talking about the challenges you are facing and what we can do to better support rural areas because they are important to the economy. I don't even have a question for you. I just want to say thank you. Mr. Cullimore, you talked about how the state does a good job of supporting the bio-life industries and how we need more federal cooperation. Could you talk about what the state is doing well and how we could support that from a federal level? Mr. CULLIMORE. Well, the state of Utah has identified the life sciences industry as one of its five target industries for development. To that point, they have taken the approach of providing funding in critical areas that encourage development of these companies. So, for instance, last legislative session, the legislature passed a life science initiative bill to provide money to develop a workforce specifically for life science needs, which can be very unique. They have also established a fund called the Utah Innovation Fund, which is intended to help bring technologies that are early, early stage at our universities and institutions out to an investable stage. It is really hard to get these early technologies to a point where an investment community will take a look at them. And so that is a key bridge that they have helped to provide. And they have provided research and development credits and other kinds of incentives for companies. So from a federal perspective, I think continuing to provide the kinds of tax things that Frank articulated earlier are critical to making sure that we have that, trying to limit the kind of barriers that we face. The life science industry is probably the most regulated industry in the country, and finding ways to reduce those barriers will help bring products to market a lot faster. Medicare itself could be a great toolbox or a great sandbox for doing some of that. Ms. MALOY. Thank you. Mr. Watanabe, you talked about PBMs, and it is something that I hear about a lot. I have independent pharmacists and even, you know, larger chain pharmacies that we have all heard of. They come talk to me about how there is a middleman that is making all the money. You talked about the same thing. I know it is something all of us up here are hearing about. What would your ideal PBM solution look like? Mr. WATANABE. How much time do I have? I do think that the intermediaries in the healthcare system have become a real problem and are probably one of the major drivers of growth. The concentration in the PBM sector and now increasingly with the insurance sector is also a problem. They have immense power vis-`-vis physicians, pharmacies, and the innovators. They now control access to care in many cases, right. They are dictating to doctors what drug their patients can receive rather than the doctor making the decision for themselves what is the best choice. And at the same time, they are extracting large amounts of money from the companies who are innovating, and they are not passing that money on, those savings on to the patients, as it was originally intended. I think, you know, increased transparency is a very good first step, but I think there are a number of other things that Congress can look at to reduce the power of these intermediaries and ideally to ensure that any savings that are realized in the system are passed on ultimately to the patients who need access and, you know, who are spending an immense amount of their own money caring for themselves or for their loved ones. Ms. MALOY. Yeah. And we just heard Mr. Shakespear testify he would like to have parents make more of those decisions, not have them be made by somebody who crunches numbers in an office somewhere. And I agree with him. Dr. Soares, I am almost out of time, but quickly, what federal policies do you think are acting as barriers to Americans getting their cancer screenings and being responsible upstream for their own health? Is there anything we can do to support you there? Dr. SOARES. I thank you for the question. I think there are many things that can be done. Some of them we touched about, step therapy and step therapy in preauthorizations. This hugely affects how I can care for my patients. Patients might elect not to continue treatment, because if I have to start with a medication that I don't think is ideal but step therapy requires me to do, they might have a lot of side effects from that treatment. And they might decide that they don't want to have the treatment anymore because they got traumatized by the side effects. But I have tools to help the patient. It is just that these issues are limiting my ability of providing the best care that I want. And it goes also for testing, novel testing and innovations. There are these preauthorizations that are put in place that I cannot give the treatment or do the test that I need for my patients. So that is an issue. Also, we need to continue telehealth coverage. That is the only way that I will be able to continue to provide the care for my rural population. As you heard, at least 30 percent of the patients that we have in clinical trials at Huntsman are rural. So that is my people. I need to be able to provide care for them. So we need federal support for that. Ms. MALOY. Thank you. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Dr. Wenstrup. Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being here today. I really appreciated hearing from each and every one of you. I want to say to Mr. Shakespear, it was several years ago, probably about 6 or 7 years ago, it was actually a Member of Congress whose daughter was one of the first to receive the treatment that your son treated. And, you know, you mentioned something about the stars aligning, and she was one of the lucky ones where the stars aligned as well. And, you know, this requires early diagnosis and treatment, which is what we talk about all the time, and improving medicine requires early diagnosis and treatment. You know, a close acquaintance of my family who happens to be on Medicaid had the same similar situation, but when she was pregnant, she was only offered termination. And that is a sad day in America. Dr. Soares, you talked about home health and things like that. We are working on that--home health, hospital at home. And I do want to talk--and I will ask you something later-- about the delays that you brought up, the delays in care that are offered. And, Mr. Cullimore, you hit on a few things. You talked about MCIT being repealed by the Biden administration, which held up then new innovations getting to market. The Biden administration promised they would come out with a new form of it; they did not. And so we have our bill, which you mentioned, and I appreciate that. So you guys are hitting on all cylinders today, as far as I think this committee is concerned. You know, I am co-chair of our Doctors Caucus. And, you know, really, one of the themes that we are trying to promote-- in Washington, too often, when you bring up healthcare, everyone starts talking about Medicare, Medicaid, Affordable Care Act, Blue Cross Blue Shield; they are not talking about the health of patients. And that is a problem. And our goal should be to make America the healthiest nation on the planet and work towards that. Besides, that is where the real return on investment is--prevention, cures, all of these things that we are talking about today. You know, I practice predominantly in an urban area, but I represent urban and rural. So these issues are common throughout, especially in underserved areas. But one of the things that is a real concern to me in medicine today--and we really need your voice out there so that Congress does act on some of the things. Similar to what we do with semiconductors, we need to do for pharmaceuticals, especially generics. You know, we are reliant on China for our generic medications. We have to turn that around. It is a national security risk. It is a national health security risk. When my daughter can't get amoxicillin for her ear infection, that is a problem. And so this is something that I would like to address. We talked about, you know, pro-growth tax incentives. We are on board. I have a bill to address the generic issue. Just, can we at least look at our battlefield medicines? If you would have told me when I was a surgeon in Iraq that I relied on China for my protective equipment and my pharmaceuticals, how did we get here? We have to turn this ship around. And we need everybody talking about that and the dangers involved with that. So maybe we can do like we did with semiconductors and address some of those tax issues that would allow us to bring that back. And I do have a bill up for draft discussion. If we can at least start with our battlefield medicines, will that not tug at some people's heartstrings to say, yes, we have make that domestic? So we need your help in that area too. But, Dr. Soares, you mentioned step therapy. I have had that bill for years. I don't know why we can't get that through. The Safe Step Act, as it is called, we are going to continue to push that. Same with prior-authorization bills. It is: Speed up care. You know, you have decisions being made by people that don't see patients, and some have never seen patients. And this is a real problem in patient care. Because it all comes down to that. So one of the questions I have for you, Dr. Soares, it comes to--you do clinical trials. Thank you for doing that. That is how we get things to market. And you know the problem with getting through FDA approval. But it is even tougher for you, treating patients, when you get something approved by FDA with the indication of something you are treating and Medicare won't cover it. Can you address that relationship with your patient and how that is affected when someone else is deciding that they can't get something that can make them healthy? Dr. SOARES. Yeah. Thank you for question. And this is very upsetting. I had several patients that I would like to have provided a treatment--in this case, we are talking radioligands, radioisotopes. And even though has been approved by the FDA for one niche of what the therapy benefits, it is not really paid by Medicare to all the indications. So my patients die, because I cannot give them the treatment that they deserve. And, you know, thankfully we have done a lot of innovations and I have many more treatment options for my patients, but that particular treatment is the cornerstone of longer progression for survivors and survival for these patients. I had personally lost patients because I had not been able to provide the treatments because I have been told they were not covered by Medicare. And that is unacceptable to me. Mr. WENSTRUP. That seems immoral and sinful to me, and people that aren't standing over patients trying to help them making those decisions. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Estes. Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, you know, once again, I want to thank you for holding a hearing outside the bubble in Washington, D.C. I know many Members like myself go home every week and listen to our constituents, but having these hearings around the country is really important for us to be able to talk with people in, I will use the term, the ``real world,'' as opposed to what is going on in Washington. And it is great that we are able to take this information to make sound policy decisions. I am just going to dive right into questions today. I have a lot of things to go over. And, Dr. Soares, thank you for your testimony. And I want to thank you for what you do to help advance medical breakthroughs in the country. And cancer has impacted most of us, if not personally, then a family member or a close friend. And there have been so many innovations in the field of cancer treatment. Can you talk a little bit about why it is important for the United States to remain the leader in medical innovation? Dr. SOARES. Thank you for the question. We are extremely successful in medical innovation. There are so many pathways that are so important for us to continue to lead. It is important for our patients, for our communities, for our economy. The amount of economic revenue that is generated from research, in many aspects, is also huge. So, from the aspect of healthcare, delivering healthcare to our patients is key. It is also economically important. And, also, if we keep our drugs here, we don't have to depend on other countries to supply. Because, as was mentioned, drug searches, this is a huge issue. And I also have not been able to provide chemotherapy drugs and symptom control management drugs to my patients because they are not here. So it is such a multilevel importance that we continue to lead all these efforts. Mr. ESTES. Yeah. Well, thank you. And, Mr. Watanabe, you have heard--and I know you talked about it, our chairman talked about it--how important research and development is, and the issues there, and just how important that is for medical R&D to help save lives. I have been a fierce advocate of making sure that the Tax Code encourages U.S.-based research and development. And you talked about it a little bit, but do you want to talk some more about how the Tax Code helps or does impact the R&D that gets developed? And what other points do we need to do in Congress to help make sure that--and encourage innovation in the U.S.? Mr. WATANABE. I think I mentioned in my comments, I think, first of all, it is important to recognize that most of the innovation that is happening now is happening in small companies, companies like mine, and, you know, not companies who are generating billions of dollars in profits from existing drugs. And, as a result, capital is probably the most important thing for small companies like mine. It is very expensive to develop drugs. I mentioned my company spent almost a billion dollars getting our first product to market, with no revenue. So this committee in particular and Congress more generally--you know, policies that foster our ability to acquire capital, like the Tax Code changes that I mentioned but other measures that foster an environment that is friendly to capital formation for small companies, is vital, because that is what gives us the resources to run the clinical studies, to do the basic research that leads to the medical innovation. And then I think, you know, the other aspect that Mr. Cullimore touched on is M&A. Most drugs are developed--new drugs are developed by small companies, but they aren't marketed by small companies. Typically, the company is bought or the drug is bought by a large company. And that M&A activity is critical to then getting the medication to patients. And some of the steps by the FTC, in particular, against mergers and acquisitions are really actually going to inhibit R&D and the ability for us to deliver new drugs to patients. Mr. ESTES. Thank you for those comments. I mean, a lot of times, in my conversations, a lot of folks have said, ``Well, research and development only helps big companies,'' but it is really the small ones that are so much more greatly affected through that. It is critical that we keep innovation here in the U.S., but it is also critical that we make sure healthcare is affordable. You know, in my home state of Kansas, there are a lot of rural Kansans, as we have talked about today, and we need telehealth to help make sure we have better outcomes. And, unfortunately, some of the higher costs, driven by the incorrectly named Affordable Care Act a decade ago, have prevented Kansans from getting some of that medical care. And, as we mentioned before, or has been mentioned earlier, the so- called Inflation Reduction Act is only making it worse. And so we need to make sure that--you know, as we look ahead, CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, is already projecting that premiums are going to go up and that seniors will have fewer drug choices in their drug insurance because of these disastrous pieces of legislation. So I want to make sure, as we look forward, that we can actually implement policy that helps make sure that we have drug treatments and other treatments available to patients. So thank you all for your time in being here. And I will yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mr. Hern. Mr. HERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congressman Moore, thanks for hosting us here in your beautiful city. I would like to thank the witnesses for being here. It has been great to work on healthcare in Ways and Means in my 4 years on the committee. And when we talk about healthcare, things usually turn very partisan, with the exception of innovation. And you probably saw, last week we had a great markup. A lot of bipartisan bills came out of there, a lot of, you know, ``kumbaya,'' ``let's go get 'em.'' And then we had CMS come out and support the mental illness treatment using PDTs, so that is great. And while I wish everything could be as positive as last week, it is sad that what we are dealing with is stifled innovation and a decrease in patient access due to the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that had zero Republicans on it. And one consequence of the IRA that I am extremely concerned with is the harm it is going to do to research of rare diseases treatments, as we have been talking about. I know on a personal level how having a rare disease can affect an individual and their family. I will always advocate for those who are suffering from a rare disease and support efforts to bring treatments for these diseases to market. Over 90 percent of rare diseases have no FDA-approved treatment. And that is millions of patients across America with no options. According to the 2021 National Organization for Rare Diseases report, about 25 percent of drugs on the market with an orphan designation are approved for more than one orphan indication. Under the IRA, there is no incentive for companies to investigate these additional uses, because as soon as they receive additional orphan designation, they are eligible for government-mandated price controls. That is why I am proud to co-sponsor the ORPHAN Cures Act. This bill fixes one of the many IRA consequences that would only hurt individuals who are already suffering enough. The ORPHAN Cures Act would ensure that orphan drugs treating one or more rare diseases are excluded from Medicare price negotiations. You know, this hearing we are having today, this markup, is exactly what the Chairman wanted to do when he became the Chairman of Ways and Means just almost 2 years ago, was to get out and listen to the experts, listen to the people that are receiving the brunt of, or the lack of, work from Washington, D.C. And you all have expressed, you know, intimately the issues you are having in order to get to this--not some, you know, politician, not some person on the Hill that has read something in a book. You are telling us from your heart what is really mattering. And we really need to listen to this. And it is really sad, quite frankly, that we don't have any of our colleagues from across the aisle that could be hearing exactly what you are saying. This isn't political. This is real. This is people's lives, as Dr. Soares said. This is people's lives that we are not being able to help. And, you know, Dr. Watanabe--Watanabe--I will get that right in a minute--you know, it is sort of interesting, some of the concepts that you came up with. Monetizing net operating loss, that is interesting. The passive versus non-passive investing. You are not asking for the federal government to give you money; you are asking to have an opportunity for just the timing of the tax. That is something that, you know, everybody on this committee needs to hear. Everybody--not just us on this side of the aisle, but everybody--needs to hear that. So I really appreciate that. And can you tell us what is going to happen if there are no fixes to the ORPHAN Cures Act? What is that going to look like for, you know, the support to incentivize research and development for rare disease treatments? Mr. WATANABE. Yeah. Congressman, thank you for your question. You know, my own company doesn't work in the orphan disease space, but a number of my colleagues at BIO, on the BIO Board of Directors, do, and I can tell you that it is already having an impact. Exactly as you described, the IRA has set up a disincentive for pursuing any follow-on indications for an orphan drug. You know, historically, that has been the model, that you get your orphan drug approved for its first indication and then you look to see what other possible rare diseases that drug may treat. And, you know, some of the best cures out there for these rare diseases are repurposed from a different initial indication. Companies are not pursuing those follow-on indications anymore precisely, as you said, because the IRA creates this disincentive for them to do that. I think your ORPHAN Cures Act is an incredibly important fix to the IRA. And we are really hope that we see passage of that bill very soon, because, you know, every day that this disincentive is in place is days that new innovations aren't being developed for people who are suffering from rare diseases. Mr. HERN. Thank you for your comments. We are already seeing, you know, what is happening to Part D. You know, we have lost--you know, prices have gone up 21 percent. We are losing options in the marketplace. People are leaving the market because of what is happening with the price controls. It is something that we on this committee have got to get fixed. It is disastrous for our seniors. And just because, you know, somebody says it is great, the results of the actions are showing something completely different. So, again, we thank you all so much for your, you know, expert testimony. And, again, we need to have all of our colleagues out here. And I want to thank the chairman once again for having these field hearings on all the different topics we have had this year related to the American people. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Mrs. Miller. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you, Chairman Smith. And I would like to thank all of you for being here today so that we can have very good conversations back and forth. I am from West Virginia. This is my third trip to Utah, and it is incredible. But we have an expression in West Virginia. Our mountains are a lot closer, they are a lot lumpier. And there are areas that--the expression is this--and people will look at me and go, what does that mean? And I will say, it means the sun only shines between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., because our mountains are so close. It is just so different. But, you know, because I represent rural West Virginia, where the access to care and innovation can really be a challenge for all of our patients--and an issue that I am particularly passionate about, of course, is care for patients with end-stage renal disease. Kidney care doesn't often see innovation--which I think you are a living example of--which is an extremely pressing issue for us. But we also have to consider the very basic challenges rural patients face when they are trying to access lifesaving dialysis services, which, again, we have already mentioned. Many ESRD patients in my district have to travel for hours to a dialysis center to receive the care they need, dialyze for two or three hours, then drive back home those hours. And they must do this three times a week just to survive. This burden on some of our most vulnerable patients really is unbearable. And, thankfully, the new technology exists for patients to receive home dialysis. Home dialysis can be a godsend for rural patients, people who have jobs or families, or are without access to transportation. And I have worked very hard in Congress to increase that access of home dialysis just for our ESRD patients. So, Mr. Shakespear, I am a mother, I am a grandmother, and I was so touched by your testimony about your son. You know, everyone here, your heart just aches, understanding, or trying to understand, what all you have been through, and how any parent would go to the ends of the Earth to save their baby. Unfortunately, for parents like us in rural areas, as you have pointed out, there are some patients that don't get care. And it is just, care is so far away, it makes it difficult. Can you sort of walk us through--I know you have talked about it, but--what was it like finding the care for Isaac? And, you know, can you explain, was it a pediatric nephrologist or a dialysis clinic, or was it a social worker? How did you work all that to navigate for healthcare? Mr. SHAKESPEAR. One of the challenges has been that Isaac has received care across many different organizations, and, unfortunately, care coordination across different organizations is very challenging. So, when we initially found out about his diagnosis, he received care from a high-risk fetal obstetrician, fetal surgeon, with Dr. Chmait. And then we had to coordinate with another high-risk OB at Stanford in order to transfer Isaac from Los Angeles to Stanford for birth. And then, throughout the process, in the NICU, he was cared for by a wide variety of specialists--nephrologists, neonatologists, and then lots of -ologists. But each condition that he came across usually required a different specialist. And then it was 24/7 care, and so we were dealing multiple nephrologists, multiple neonatologists throughout the process, and sometimes changing over in the middle of crisis situations. And so most of the burden for coordinating that care has fallen on my wife and I. But my wife has a bachelor's degree in early childhood education. I have a bachelor's degree in biology and a master's degree in healthcare administration and public health. So, when I say it's because of our education, I understand the system, I understand the biology, she understands the development component. And so you could not have picked a better set of parents to be thrown into that situation. But I know that we are very unique in understanding what is happening and being able to communicate those things across different teams. And so, throughout the process and every hospitalization, we have had to be advocates for our own child and understand the treatments that he was going through and ask questions and be able to explain in clinical terms to the next provider. Mrs. MILLER. I need to ask one more---- Mr. SHAKESPEAR. Uh-huh. Mrs. MILLER . Question, so thank you. Mr. Watanabe, Chairman Smith recently created 10 tax teams, because you all know about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we are just focused on what we can do for 2025 and how we can put these things in order. I am heading one of the tax teams, and what I am hearing about the most is the corporate tax rate. And because of President Trump's work and all of that that happened, we tried to create a favorable environment for companies engaged in R&D. And it is disturbing to me that our medical supply chain is heavily reliant on foreign manufacturers. Could you explain to me the benefits of a 21-percent cooperate tax rate and how that helps you? Mr. WATANABE. Well, you know, as I mentioned earlier, the smaller companies, most of us are not actually profitable, so we don't pay taxes, at least at the moment, although we all hope to at, you know, sometime in the very near future. But I think, you know, it is also important to understand that small biotechs exist inside of a much larger ecosystem. And I mentioned earlier, for example, the importance of M&A to finish development and to bring the therapies to patients. So I think that any change that fosters the health of the overall biotechnology sector in America, like the corporate tax code, will have a very positive effect on R&D. And I certainly don't want to suggest that large pharmaceutical companies--I was employed at Eli Lilly and at Amgen in the past. They invest immense amounts of money in research and development. And to the extent that they have to pay higher tax bills, all of those dollars are dollars that they will not then spend on R&D and develop additional therapies. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you so much. I apologize. I yield back my time. Chairman SMITH. Mrs. Steel. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing here in Utah. When Congressman Blake Moore said that it is over 100 degrees, I couldn't believe it, because I came here only to ski, so I always thought that you have much cooler weather. But thank you, witnesses, coming out here. Because when we hear from you, then, you know, we know which direction that we have to move. A lot of times, we try to introduce the bills, and you know what? Sometimes those bills actually create more loopholes, and then it is not really helping. So thank you very much for coming out today. And telehealth--I am so into telehealth. Especially California, during COVID, we were totally shut down for a few years. So telehealth has been a vital lifeline for patients living in urban, suburban, and rural areas across the country. And, last June, Ways and Means took a proactive step in passing the Telehealth Expansion Act, which would allow 32-plus million Americans with health savings accounts to have a permanent access to telehealth and remote care services without first having to meet their deductible. This legislation must pass before--it is going to be expired by end of this year. And thank you, Mr. Shakespear, for, you know, you sharing your personal story. And it is really sad, you know, what you have to go through. Of course, you have happy times too, but, you know, when baby comes, usually you have to be really happy. Actually, my grandson was just born 2 months ago. Nine- pounds premature, so he was in NICU for 8 days. And I remember that, you know what, those 8 days, that, you know, I hoped that he's going to come out healthy. Fortunately, he is healthy. But, you know, what you are going through I cannot really imagine. But, you know, could you explain just a little more about-- since I know that you are chair of the Utah telehealth advisory board at the same time that, actually, telehealth helped to connect with the specialty care providers for your son. So could you tell us how important it is that, you know, we have to move forward with this? Mr. SHAKESPEAR. Absolutely. So understand that when we have to travel to Salt Lake City for an appointment, it is not only 9 hours of our time but it is the cost of gas to travel up here, it is the cost of lodging--typically we have to stay oversight somewhere--it is the cost of food. And I do want to acknowledge, our insurance programs and Medicaid do assist with us this. But when you look at raising gas prices, inflation for the cost of food and for lodging, those rates that we are reimbursed don't change when those price goes up. And so those exacerbated prices make the problem worse for us personally. But being able to access telehealth from home just gives us a component of being able to keep a consistent schedule, reduce cost, and really protect our son, because taking him out into public is dangerous until he has a higher immune system. It has been huge to be able to get in quicker as well. Oftentimes, if we are scheduling an appointment, sometimes it is a month out, but telehealth, we can get in that week. So it makes a significant difference in a number of ways for us to be able to access that. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you. And another concern here is, I am concerned that, under current Biden policies, seniors are seeing fewer Part D plans, increased premiums, and fewer drug options. I also think this hearing must address the CCP manipulation on American companies. Economic diversification is an important tool to halt our current dependency on the CCP on our healthcare supply chain. I introduced the Medical Supply Chain Resilience Act, which would allow USTR to establish trusted trade partners, diversify medical devices and pharmaceuticals. This framework can help eliminate barriers to trade, expand supplier networks, and allow for the investment in domestic manufacturing. So I want to ask Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Cullimore: As the CEOs, can you share your perspectives on the greater issues of sole-sourcing products in China instead of in the United States or with trusted allies? And what does the future hold if we don't change that course? Mr. WATANABE. So I guess I will start. Yeah, this is a major issue, I think, that we need to address as a country. And I think it is even more acute than some of the issues that Dr. Wenstrup mentioned. You know, for example, it is not just generic drugs that we rely on. In fact, most of the drugs that we take in this country are being manufactured with chemicals, starting chemicals, that are coming from China. China manufactures the majority of the starting chemicals. China has our entire biopharmaceutical industry by a stranglehold. You know, I think one of the challenges has been that, as margins have been squeezed by pharma companies through IRA and through PBMs and through a whole variety of things, we are always looking for ways to reduce costs, and, unfortunately, China typically is the cheapest place to buy supplies, it is the cheapest place to run clinical studies, it is the cheapest place to manufacture your product. And so companies looking at their bottom lines are shifting overseas. We, as a company, have chosen not rely on China for any purpose, one, because, as a former CIA and former Naval intelligence officer, I think we are in the middle of a cold war with China. But, secondly, you know, we saw in the pandemic, if we rely on overseas sources, particularly overseas sources from a country that is not terribly friendly to us, and something like the pandemic happens, we can't rely on those sources anymore. And it would be far worse if our two countries were to actually come into conflict. So I fully support the BIOSECURE Act and the broader push by Congress to build resiliency in the U.S. biopharmaceutical sector. Mrs. STEEL. You know what, my time is up, Mr. Chairman, so I--is it okay? So, Mr. Cullimore. Mr. CULLIMORE. Oh. Just briefly, the pandemic shined a bright light on this problem, and many companies have recognized that and are trying to disentangle as much as they can from those kinds of sources in their supply chain. That said, it is very important, I think, that we be judicious in how we approach it. Because sometimes major tariffs or things of that nature can have an immediate effect on U.S. companies that is very negative. And so I think, while the concept of bringing and reshoring is important, it needs to be done in a way that doesn't create short-term harm that is very significant. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Feenstra. Mr. FEENSTRA. Thank you, Chairman Smith, for having this today. And I also want to give a special shout-out to my good friend, Representative Moore. Thank you for having this in your district. It is truly impressive, what you are doing here. It really is remarkable. And I thank each one of you for your witness and testimony. You think about where the U.S. stands. I mean, in the last couple years, last decade, we have for the most part been number one in the world in innovation when it comes to healthcare. And we are losing that. We are losing that grip on what we can do. And it just seems like, through IRA, that we want to go back to that European-style government price control, the quick solution to try to bend this curve, which is a false narrative. And it really concerns me. And, then, when we talk about supply chains, when we talk about the tax ramifications, our tariffs, our regulatory environment, there are so many things that are really pinch points to us just being innovative. So my question is, we are all sitting here trying to figure out, what are the solutions? And, Mr. Watanabe, I mean, if you look at the supply chain--and you talked about, obviously, China and things that are going on there--what would be the number-one thing that you could say to us, hey, this is the first thing you need to tackle? I mean, is it the amortization of R&D expensing, or what would you look at and say, this is the key? Mr. WATANABE. I think probably the single most important thing that Congress can do to maintain our leadership in biopharmaceutical innovation is to address access and reimbursement issues in this country. Because if we don't fix the currently broken reimbursement system in this country, there isn't going to be any money for future innovations. Mr. FEENSTRA. Boom. Thank you. Exactly. Reimbursement. I am glad you said that. And that hasn't been really talked about today. Dr. Soares, you have also mentioned in your testimony that, because of the IRA, that a lot of cures are going to be gone. I mean, you talk about biologics, you talk about orphan drugs, all these other things that are going to be on the sunset or go away because of what is happening. Can you address that? And what is any type of solution? You know, do we have to roll back this? Or how do we fight against this? Dr. SOARES. Yeah, there are treatments that will go away, and there are treatments that have already gone away and I have not been able to offer to my patients. I think continuing federal funds and reforms to allow them to keep--that we can be able to incentivize the companies to still have them, that will be key. It is very disheartening when we have treatments that are effective and, for reasons that are not in the physicians', in the healthcare control, we cannot offer to them. I cannot speak necessarily of a given policy. That is not what I am expert on. But I can tell you for a fact that some of the treatments have been going away and I have not been able to offer to my patients with rare cancers. Mr. FEENSTRA. Yeah. I want to pivot, Dr. Soares. You and I are sort of kindred spirits on talking about rural healthcare---- Dr. SOARES. Yes. Mr. FEENSTRA . And the rural access points. I have done my research in maternal care. You have done it, obviously, in cancer areas. Can you talk and give this group here solutions to the deserts that are out there in healthcare? I mean, what do you see--I mean, I have done my research and said, all right, this is X, Y, and Z. But for you, what do you see as the opportunity for us? Dr. SOARES. Yes. Thank you for that question. That is actually one of my tasks, is to provide care and clinical trials to our patients. And then there are several steps. A, obviously, access to telehealth is key. And then providers that have multi-license so they can even go outside of their states and provide the care. Access to being able to get the labs done locally so I can monitor that for the patients, and I can also be coordinating. Continued support of patient navigations that can be reimbursed and help with all of this navigation of rural care. Really, integration of the EMR systems, that it can talk, and AI can help with that. And regulations that allow us to send the drugs to the rural patients. Because right now there is a lot of regulation that shipping outside even state lines or farther can be very complex and expensive. Mr. FEENSTRA. Yes. Dr. SOARES. We have multiple meetings at the Huntsman Cancer Institute to brainstorm how we are going to give and take and deliver cutting-edge therapies to other patients at their homes. I can monitor them, but there are regulations that are needed to be in place for me to be able to actually get, in an affordable way, the drugs to the patients in their homes. Mr. FEENSTRA. Yep. Yep. Dr. SOARES. And I will be forever thankful for help with that. Mr. FEENSTRA. Yep. Thank you, Dr. Soares. Thank you for those comments. And I will be working on those issues and try to help in those areas. Thank you very much. I yield back. Chairman SMITH. Ms. Malliotakis. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here in Salt Lake City for the first time. And I want to thank our witnesses for sharing their expertise and their personal experiences on the topic of healthcare innovation and access. Under the Biden administration, we have seen significant barriers for Medicare beneficiaries' access to innovative technologies and bringing new drugs to the market. It can take up to 5 years after FDA approval for medical devices to get Medicare coverage. Innovative treatments see that same lag time. Furthermore, the Democrats have made their intentions clear to oppose the pro-growth tax policies from the 2017 Trump tax cuts that have created a more competitive tax code, they have created millions of jobs, they have helped encourage and sustain innovation in the United States by giving businesses the tools to grow, conduct research and development, and reinvest back into their companies and employees and their communities. But even more concerning is the implementation of the so- called Inflation Reduction Act and the harmful impacts the Medicare drug price negotiations program will have on premiums and the development of critical lifesaving drugs. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a study by Milliman titled, ``Expected Impact of Inflation Reduction Act Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program on Medicare Part D Beneficiary Out-of-Pocket Costs.'' Chairman SMITH. Without objection.   Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. According to the study, the IRA's government price-setting scheme will cause Medicare beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket costs to jump by $70, or 12 percent, for those who utilize these negotiated drugs under part D in 2026. Low-income beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs will increase by a staggering 27 percent. And on top of the rise in premiums, the Congressional Budget Office's conservative estimates say that 13 fewer drugs will come to the market over the next 30 years, with outside experts projecting the number will be around 135 new cures. I will start with Mr. Watanabe. Thank you for your mention of the impact that this will have on especially the orphan drugs. And I am also proud to be a co-sponsor of the ORPHAN Cures Act. The President said recently that the Democrats, quote, ``finally beat Medicare,'' unquote, and I am afraid that the data in Medicare Part D would agree. My question is, do higher out-of-pocket costs lead to patients stopping treatment, perhaps, or maybe trying to ration their medication? What impact would this have as a whole? Mr. WATANABE. Yeah, there is no question that increased patient co-pays has an impact on patients adhering to therapy or even fulfilling therapy. I think it is well-known in the biopharmaceutical industry that anytime the patient is paying more than about $35 out of pocket, the rate at which the patient refuses to accept the medication at the pharmacy counter goes up. And that is leaving aside, you know, conversations between a doctor and a patient when the doctor says, ``Hey, I am going to prescribe this medication for you, but the co-pay is going to be X'' and the patient walks away. And this unfortunately is occurring both across commercial and Medicare plans, where there is constant increase in cost- shifting to the patients, which is unfortunately impacting the standard of care. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. And I see all your fellow witnesses nodding their heads that they are in agreement that this is a concern. I want to also talk about manufacturing and R&D. I recently introduced the bipartisan Supply Chain Security and Growth Act, which will onshore critical supply chains in pharmaceuticals, in medical devices, and other manufacturing back to the United States by providing credits to companies who choose onshoring their manufacturing. Mr. Cullimore, can you speak to the importance of these types of incentives as we work to onshore these particular drug productions and, in particular, reduce our reliance on foreign nations, Communist China, which we unfortunately rely on far too much for APIs and other pharmaceuticals? Mr. CULLIMORE. Thank you for the question. It is really important to understand that the reason people have gone to China and other places is because it is cheaper. Now, to bring them back, to reshore those kinds of processes, the investment of dollars to make that happen is significant. We just met with a company that was looking at doing the chemicals, the APIs, as they call them, that they are doing overseas, bringing them here, acknowledging that it was going to be a significant investment. A bill like you are proposing would provide incentives and a pathway for those kinds of reshoring activities to occur. Because the biggest problem is not just the lower costs; it is the investment that it requires to reshore and do all of those kinds of things. So you are right on track with that. Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that. And, you know, we see shortages, about 250 different drug shortages, things like antibiotics and chemotherapies. We need to onshore this stuff. If COVID taught us anything, it is that we cannot rely on countries, particularly a communist country like China, for this. And so we, as a committee, are working very closely to try to address this issue, and hopefully we will be able to do it in the near future. Chairman SMITH. I would like to thank each and every one of our witnesses for your testimony, for answering our questions, for being here, and for your ideas. I also want to thank each member of the committee. The members of this committee are spread in thousands of different directions, and for them to make it a priority to come up here to hear from real Americans of the issues that you are facing-- I admire your hard work, and I appreciate the sacrifice that you have all made. Please be advised that members have 2 weeks to submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and your answers will be made part of the formal hearing record. LOCAL SUBMISSIONS FOR THE RECORD =======================================================================  PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS FOR THE RECORD =======================================================================  Chairman SMITH. And, with that, the committee stands adjourned.
