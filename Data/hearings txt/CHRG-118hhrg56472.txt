THE COLLAPSE OF PRIVATE PRACTICE: EXAMINING THE CHALLENGES FACING INDEPENDENT MEDICINE ---------- THURSDAY, MAY 23, 2024 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Health, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:02 a.m. in Room 1100 Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Vern Buchanan  presiding. Chairman BUCHANAN. Good morning. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today to discuss the crucial issues before us, the collapse of the private practice and the impact it is having on patients, as well. Americans across the country are hurt by skyrocketing inflation from the past four years. I am a former business owner, and I know firsthand how inflation harms small businesses trying to benefit their communities. Physicians are no different. Nearly 90 percent of the medical groups reported increased operating costs last year, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Physicians' costs increased by over 63 percent from 2013 to 2022, making it harder to run a business, let alone their own practice. During the same timeframe, Medicare's formula for calculating physician payments has increased by only 1.7 percent. In fact, the--adjusted for inflation, the practice cost--Medicare physicians' pay rate plummeted 29 percent over the past 2 decades, with large changes year over year. So how can we get doctors to afford to stay in private practice when their costs are skyrocketing, their reimbursement rates continue to get cut? Many times, physicians are forced to sell their practice or consolidate, and with a larger system stay afloat. Let me be clear. Whether or not to sell a practice should be the choice of the physician based on what works best for them, their family, their practice, and their patients. They should not be forced into a practice consolidation. And I will just tell you myself, as a businessperson for 30 years before I got here, I started, my wife and I, a small business. It was the American dream. We created 5,000 jobs from nothing as a couple of blue-collar kids. So a lot of times that leads to other opportunities. I am not saying that is good or bad or indifferent, but that is just my story. But there is other stories like that. So when I hear people are getting crunched in terms of whether they can even stay in practice, I don't like hearing that. But I will talk more about that today. Further, I am concerned that our--being transformed from entrepreneurs into employees. According to American Medical Association, the AMA, between 2012 and 2022 the share of physicians working in private practice fell by 13 percent compared to 3 decades ago, where there were--there are now 30 percent fewer physicians in private practice. A thriving health care ecosystem should be included in a balance of large health systems and small, local, mom-and-pop practices. Back in the day, it was much easier and less expensive for young doctors coming out of medical school to start a practice in their hometown. Now, when I talk to young doctors coming out of medical school, many of them tell me it is too expensive of an endeavor, and they would rather work for a larger system, where they can collect a steady paycheck and not worry about the increasing administrative burdens associated with running a practice. Another issue I continue to hear from our docs is the growing rate of frivolous lawsuits against medical--the medical community. AMA analysts show that in 2019 medical liability premiums increased by 27 percent, almost double the rate from 2018. Between 2020 and roughly 2022, 30 percent of premiums increase year to year. I am extremely worried about the pressure the trial bar is putting on physicians, at least in my state. I can talk about that, and then I hope that we can talk about what it costs, defensive medicine, and many of the doctors that are surgeons, maybe they are 60, they are leaving their practices early because they don't want to take the potential risk. Chairman BUCHANAN. With that I look forward to the discussion today. Now I recognize the Ranking Member Doggett for his opening remarks. Thank you. Mr. DOGGETT. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This is an important set of issues that affects our health care providers, and it affects the quality of health care. I come at it from the experience of having a father who was in solo practice as a dentist for about 35 years. I handled the yard work and the cleanup around there, but I still meet a few people who were children when he practiced who valued that personalized care and remind me of it. Today's health care system is so much different. I don't think in any part of health care that kind of experience could occur. There are so many barriers to entry and getting a practice started and then maintaining it and so, we find today over 70 percent of physicians who are employed by a health care system or a corporate entity. This consolidation is creating greater obstacles for the few remaining independent practitioners who are struggling to compete, and has significant implications for taxpayers and patients. There are so many challenges. Your testimony, from reviewing it, deals with a number of them that our physicians are facing. And while I agree that physicians are sometimes over-regulated, the regulator that seems to be interfering the most for many comes in the form of private Medicare Advantage plans. MA plans continue to interfere with the doctor-patient relationship through burdensome prior authorization requirements, step therapy, and other management tools. Intended to reduce unnecessary health care utilization, these tools often lead to delays and denials of urgent medical care. One study found that 82 percent of denials that were appealed were ultimately overturned and found to be necessary and appropriate care. But a small, independent practice that is struggling to get a prior authorization request approved often can't afford to go forward with the appeal. For the care that is delivered, many physicians face inadequate payment, and I know you will be discussing that. Medicaid reimbursement in my home state of Texas is pitiful. We all know well that the Medicare physician fee schedule is a source of stress that we hear about each year. We are hearing about it from health care practitioners across the country. Private MA plans, however, frequently provide lower payments than traditional Medicare, which is difficult to believe. At the same time, in an upside-down system, Medicare Advantage is being dramatically overpaid, $84 billion in wasted taxpayer dollars this year alone. Yet, insurers are not required to reimburse doctors at least the traditional Medicare rates. With Medicare Advantage now providing coverage for over half of Medicare beneficiaries, physicians are being squeezed further. As recommended by the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC--sometimes the source of great concern and criticism by health care practitioners--but on this issue they say that approval of an inflation update is very important. We must find an acceptable way to pay for that update. But I think that an inflation update alone, though that is a priority of physicians now, is not a panacea. That schedule has become largely irrelevant if over half of the people covered by Medicare are being handled through private Medicare Advantage plans that distort the payment system. We need to strike a balance to protect the long-term solvency of Medicare, and hold these MA plans accountable for appropriately reimbursing providers. Payment tweaks alone will not address what is already a broken market. Due to a lack of antitrust enforcement, nearly 80 percent of metropolitan areas have highly concentrated physician markets. Independent physicians are struggling to compete, as they not only face a competing practice being taken over by private equity, but the same forces leading to vertical consolidation that use their immense resources to buy a hospital system and physician practices forcing the few remaining independent providers out of network. For many independent practices, private equity can appear to be a savior. For physicians struggling to compete with a large health care group, it is easy to understand the allure of these PE buyouts and quick cash infusion. Private equity may help some of these practices, but too often any benefit is solely to the senior physicians who may be about to retire. In my hometown of Austin, I have seen the aftermath of these buyouts. Junior associates, nursing staff, administrative support teams are fired. Prices increase and doctors are pressured to prioritize profits over patients. Practices either go bankrupt or are bundled until we have only one physician group covering a particular specialty. I look forward to your testimony and our discussion on the many anti-competitive behaviors that have gone unrestrained for too long, and how best we can advance a fair, just, and affordable health care system that supports our health care practitioners and their patients. Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I am really excited. We have got great witnesses today, you guys that are actually in the trenches. Many of us up here haven't been where you have been, and you are dealing with the reality, especially in the last 10 years or so. So the witnesses: Dr. Jennifer Gholson out of Mississippi; Dr. Tim Richardson, a private physician out of Wichita, Kansas; Chris Kean, a private--she is a chief operating officer, so that will be interesting, San Antonio, Texas--Dr. Desai from north Dallas; and Dr. Jha from--with Brown University. So Doctor, why don't we start with you, Dr. Gholson? We will move this way. Five minutes each. STATEMENT OF JENNIFER GHOLSON, MD, FAMILY PRACTITIONER, SUMMIT, MISSISSIPPI Dr. GHOLSON. Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Doggett, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Jennifer Gholson, and I am a family physician from Summit, Mississippi. I am honored to be here today representing the more than 130,000 physicians and student members of the American Academy of Family Physicians. My remarks today are made in my capacity as a AAFP representative, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer or any other organizations with which I am affiliated. As a former solo practice owner, I applaud the committee for holding today's hearing. It was not long ago that the majority of primary care was delivered by physicians in solo or independent practice who were uniquely connected to the community they served. However, over the last few decades, we have propped up a health care system with misaligned incentives that rewards consolidation and under-invest in primary care. Every system is perfectly designed to achieve the results it gets, and our current system is designed to ensure the death of independent medicine. I have practiced primary care for more than 20 years. In 2011 I opened my own brick-and-mortar family medicine practice in my rural community which had lacked any primary care practices previously. To say running my own practice was hard would be an understatement, but it was also rewarding. Plans provided no transparency on their contracted rates, meaning I didn't know what I would be paid until I had already signed on the dotted line. Many plans also closed their networks completely and would not contract with me initially. I was an early adopter of value-based payment through participation in an ACO, where we achieved share savings while providing quality care to patients. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to participate in an ACO. There was at least one year when the shared savings payment helped me keep my practice doors open. When the pandemic hit, and Mississippi required us to stop seeing patients in person, we were able to pivot to providing care via telehealth the very next day. I was able to cultivate meaningful, trusted relationships with my patients, many of whom became like family, while maintaining my own clinical autonomy and decision-making authority. Around 2021, the tide started to change. Prior authorizations were increasing while payments were shrinking. Physician practices already get paid two to three times less for services than hospitals, who are able to charge facility fees. Primary care is at its best when it is delivered by a physician-led team. However, it was hard for my practice and others to compete with hospitals for the same staff. They can offer signing bonuses, higher base salaries, an array of technology that practices often can't. Eventually, the draw of hospital employment became too alluring for my staff. I had the privilege of working with an incredible nurse for my--almost my entire career. She ended up leaving because, as she put it, primary care had become too hard, and she couldn't do it anymore. She went to work for a hospital-employed pulmonologist. We both cried when she left. Soon after, both MPs on my team decided to leave, as well. One went to a hospital-owned practice closer to her home, and the other to a subcontractor for managed care companies that offer more flexibility. After they left, I tried to make things work, but the hits kept coming and burnout seemed inevitable. For example, health plans started clawing back money that they had already paid me because of minor billing mistakes, instead of allowing me to resubmit claims. Eventually, for myself and for my patients, I had to reevaluate whether keeping my practice doors open was the right choice. I knew it would take at least six months to try and replace my staff, and the administrative burden I faced further eroded the time I was able to spend on patient care. In the decades since I opened my practice, a pharmacy, an urgent care, and a physical therapist had also opened in my small town. The presence of my practice has made a positive economic impact on the community and, most importantly, a positive personal impact on my patients. I decided to close my practice in the summer of 2022. While this is my story, it is not unique. It is the story of many other family physicians who have been forced into a false choice of either selling their practice, often for pennies, or closing their doors entirely. Thankfully, Congress can advance policies that will better support the success of practices of all sizes and ownership types. These include improving payment for primary care, addressing misaligned incentives such as facility fees that encourage consolidation, and minimizing the administrative burden that independent practices face. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify and share my story. I look forward to answering your questions.  GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BUCHANAN. Thanks, Doctor. Dr. Richardson. STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY RICHARDSON, MD, INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN, WICHITA UROLOGY Dr. RICHARDSON. Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett, I am Dr. Timothy Richardson, a urologist and partner in Wichita Urology, an independent physician practice in Wichita, Kansas. I also serve as a board member of the Large Urology Group Practice Association. My practice is a single specialty group of 12 doctors that serve over 1.1 million lives in a geographic area covering two- thirds of the State of Kansas. We have 13 clinic locations throughout the state that makes it possible for the rural patients to receive critical cancer care and advanced urological treatments where they live. We greatly appreciate the Ways and Means Committee interest in examining the challenges facing independent physician practices. While Wichita Urology is no stranger to the mounting pressures independent practices face, we are fortunate to have remained independent. Unfortunately, this is not the case for many of the other practices across the country, despite a commitment to their patients and their communities. In response to the double whammy of increasing regulatory and administrative burdens alongside declining reimbursement, independent physicians have responded by working harder and more, leading to burnout and early retirement, thereby compounding the shortages and the onus on those who remain in the practice. In fact, yesterday I personally performed 10 surgical procedures and saw 24 clinic patients before racing to catch a 3:00 p.m. flight to be with you here today. I am reminded of what occurred to a colleague's practice in Shreveport, Louisiana, which peaked at 20 urologists but over time dwindled down to 8 as hospitals recruited their doctors, who could be relieved essentially of 100 percent of their administrative, practice management, and regulatory burdens overnight, alongside an RVU pay schedule that substantially reduced their patient care burdens. In the face of seemingly endless, expanding workload in private practice, hospitals can offer higher starting salaries on the promise of a work-life balance that limits working hours. Pay differentials, subsidized by site-of-service disparities, made it impossible for them to compete for the nursing staff. That practice eventually collapsed, and the patient access plummeted as more physicians left the practice and the hospital system that acquired the group closed all of the outlying offices northern--in the northern part of the state, where there had formerly been 11 clinic sites. Just as important, patients lost a one-stop-shop of coordinated and personalized care with physician-patient relationships that had been built over the decades with patients and their families. This is not an isolated incident, but a nationwide trend. Hospital-employed physicians increased by more than 70 percent between 2012 and 2018, and another 5.1 percent between 2022 and 2023. More than half of the physicians are now employed by hospitals. It is not hard to understand why. Hospitals have focused on acquiring physician practices because that strategy simultaneously quashes competition in the local market and captures downstream revenue from ancillary services such as radiation therapy, imaging, and physician-administered drugs, often times purchased at 340B prices. The revenue a physician generates for a hospital employer far surpasses the cost of the employed physician's salary. For example, a recent Merritt survey found that urologists generate $2.1 million while receiving an average salary of 386,000. Similar returns on investments exist for other specialists. A major factor contributing to provider consolidation is the inability of private practices to remain financially viable. Medicare reimbursement payment updates do not come close to matching the rising practice costs. More recently, physicians have taken payment cuts. Physicians only received a nominal 10 percent increase over the last two decades, while the practice cost inflation rose 47 percent. That is simply not sustainable. Meanwhile, hospitals have received compounding payment updates based on their input cost, amounting to 70 percent over the last two decades, and enjoy a substantial site-of-service payment advantage for the identical services. As an example, Medicare pays hospitals more than twice the amount a physician receives for a cystoscopy with lithotripsy stent procedure at an ambulatory surgery center, even though this requires essentially the same staff, infrastructure, time, and technical training to perform. Similarly, hospitals receive more than two-and-a-half times more than physicians to infuse identical part B drugs. Studies have shown that Medicare could save over $150 billion by equalizing these payment disparities. Yet simply cutting the hospitals does not assist physician practices. We would suggest an approach that modestly reduces the HOPD payments and modestly increases physician payments to protect the patient access. Just as troubling as the reimbursement challenges is the regulatory burden physicians confront, and the lack of alternative payment models available to most doctors. Only 17 percent of participating providers received an APM incentive payment in 2023. CMS failed to implement or even test any of the 17 physician-focused payment models that were recommended by PTAC. MIPS has been an even bigger disappointment, and only served to burden physicians with onerous, expensive, and largely meaningless reporting requirements. The MIPS reporting program costs nearly $13,000 and takes more than 200 hours per physician per year. That is time that could be spent with patients. Just as troubling, high performers were not properly compensated because the MIPS's zero-sum game provides bonuses only to the degree other physicians are penalized, and less than 0.3 percent were penalized. We agree with MedPAC's statement: MIPS is, as presently designed, is unlikely to succeed in helping beneficiaries choose clinicians, helping clinicians change practice patterns to improve value, or helping the Medicare program reward clinicians based on value. MIPS should be terminated. The Stark Law also remains an impediment to value-based care delivery. It must be modernized to reflect how care is delivered today, not three decades ago, when it was first conceived. The physician entrepreneur should be encouraged, not vilified. I would like to thank the committee for focusing on promoting and protecting independent practices and patients we serve. We look forward to working with you to reform these programs to make them more efficient and improve patient outcomes.  GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I do want to note our next witness. She is the chief operating officer of a practice. So you are responsible for paying the bills, so you have got probably a unique insight. You know, everybody else is a doctor, but you are actually up there having to pay the bills and deal with that reality. Go ahead. Five minutes. STATEMENT OF CHRISTINE KEAN, COO, THE SAN ANTONIO ORTHOPAEDIC GROUP Ms. KEAN. Thank you, Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett, for allowing me the opportunity to provide boots-on- the-ground testimony about what it is like to be an independent medical practice in health care today. My name is Christine Kean. I am testifying on behalf of myself, as chief operating officer of TSAOG Orthopedics and Spine, and all 41 physicians of our group. We are a fiercely independent, 100 percent physician-owned group taking care of patients in the greater San Antonio region for over 75 years. I have been fortunate to have worked alongside the dedicated physicians and health care professionals of TSAOG for the past 23 years. The group is a fully integrated, private health care entity consisting of non- operative physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and anesthesiologists. Our physicians and the ones that came before them built this group to help patients navigate an often confusing health care environment by providing as much physician-directed care as possible under a seamless umbrella. Our patients are able to obtain X-rays or more advanced imaging such as MRI or CT; receive their physical or hand therapy in person, or even virtually; see us after hours, during the week, and on Saturdays in our urgent care solution, OrthoNow; be seen for preventive bone health care. And if they require surgical intervention, we have two outpatient ambulatory surgery centers that provide basic and complex orthopedic surgeries to include spine and joint replacements. If inpatient hospital care is required, this will also be directed and led by our physicians at one of three community- based hospitals in the region. Think of us as a small ecosystem for orthopedic care in San Antonio. Creating an entity like this is rare. It is extremely challenging to do, and even more difficult to maintain. It requires our physicians to be fully focused on all aspects of the patient treatment plan, to include their own, as the physician, not me, as an administrator, is solely responsible for the liability of every patient they care for. Meanwhile, they, alongside our administrative team, are also responsible for the nearly 600 professional team members they employ to make right business decisions taking into consideration the complex health care regulatory environment we live in today, as doing so ensures a future will exist for them and our patients for generations to come under this model. I am here today to help you understand the challenges of maintaining this environment, and why so many private practices across the country are collapsing. There are three main challenges facing independent medicine in our market across the country. Number one--and I think you know what I am going to say-- the source of revenue to maintain this environment is fixed, decreasing, and largely not in our control. A typical Medicare patient 3 years ago reimbursed the practice $89.05. Today it reimburses $2.59 less, and we face more cuts next year. This must change. No entity can stay in business with reductions like this, especially when the inflation rate over those 3 years was 16 percent. Physicians can no longer subsidize the cost of care for the Federal Government, nor should they be required to do so. Number two, expenses have increased dramatically. And I will give you one example, but there are many more: 3 years ago an entry-level certified medical assistant hourly rate was $13.50 an hour; today it is 16.50. This represents an annual increase of over $200,000 to our organization for just one position needed to care for patients. While giving pay increases is something we are very proud to do and good for our team members, increasing expenses without the ability to increase our fee for services puts us at a disadvantage to other non-health care employers in the market. And number three, relationship with insurance carriers and others has become at times hostile and not conducive to maintaining a healthy balance required for the delivery of health care today. Simply put, if any health care relationship remains unbalanced, as it is in many of our communities, it will severely limit patient choices, drive up costs, and undermine the integrity of patient care. Patients may even lose their ability to see their doctor. I noted earlier that we have been in practice for over 75 years, longer than most insurance carriers have been in existence. Believe it or not, we didn't always have health insurance, but we did have doctors. As an independent physician group we have taken pride in caring for our neighbors and friends, not allowing for shortcuts in care, and making sure that a return on investment is not the determining factor in physicians' decision-making. And the results bear this out, as we are consistently offering innovative, cost-effective solutions while being recognized for the best care in the region, and we have the patient outcomes to prove this. Thank you for providing this forum to learn, and for inviting me to speak to you directly. I am very happy to take your questions. Thank you.  GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. Dr. Desai. STATEMENT OF SEEMAL DESAI, MD, FOUNDER, INNOVATIVE DERMATOLOGY Dr. DESAI. Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Doggett, and members of the subcommittee, my name is Dr. Seemal R. Desai. I am the president of the American Academy of Dermatology Association that represents more than 17,000 physicians nationwide, and I am the founder of Innovative Dermatology, a private practice with 2 locations in Dallas. I see firsthand the lifesaving work that dermatologists provide for patients, which is especially timely today, during National Skin Cancer Awareness Month, when we are raising awareness of statistics such as the fact that one person dies every hour from melanoma. I have seen how skin disease can devastate a family. At a young age my brother was diagnosed with vitiligo, a devastating skin disease that causes one to lose their own skin color, resulting in large white patches all over the body, a disease which can feel like a death sentence, especially for patients with skin of color, often leaving patients feeling anxious, depressed, and withdrawn. At the time of my brother's diagnosis, my family would make a 450-mile journey from our home in Atlanta to see the only vitiligo specialist in this country. I saw how critical it was to be able to have access to a high-quality specialist, particularly for a disease which such profound psychological impact. And witnessing my family's patient experience, along with watching my recently-departed late father, a dentist, inspired me to go into medicine. Now, I am proud that I achieved my dream of opening my own private practice in 2011. The threats facing small practices have grown immensely over the last decade, and the end is nowhere in sight. I started my career with great optimism, but the continual state of medicine in this country has continually directly affected my practice. As president of the Academy, this makes me incredibly concerned about the physicians I represent and, most importantly, the patients we treat. The greatest challenge facing practices and patients is the failure of the Medicare physician fee schedule to keep up with inflation, especially when physicians are the only Medicare providers that do not receive any inflationary updates. Since 2001 the cost of operating a medical practice has increased almost 50 percent--to be precise, 47 percent. And when adjusted for inflation, Medicare physician reimbursement rates declined by 30 percent from 2001 to 2024. What business can survive under these circumstances? This payment structure disproportionately threatens the viability of all medical practices, as well as those serving rural, low-income, and underserved communities. This issue is further exacerbated by rising costs and inflation, ultimately leading to less health care options for patients. Congress must adopt a permanent Medicare payment update that fully acknowledges the inflationary growth of health care costs while working towards long-term reform. The Academy urges Congress to establish a positive annual inflation adjustment, and to increase the budget neutrality threshold by passing H.R. 2474 and 6371. Since I began practicing, I have increasingly had to grow my patient volume to keep up with demand while simultaneously juggling skyrocketing overhead costs. In 2014 I brought on another board-certified dermatologist to reduce wait times and increase critical access for patients suffering from deadly skin cancers like melanoma and a whole host of other skin conditions. Keeping up with those increasing overhead expenses and paying salaries of another physician, a part-time physician assistant, and multiple medical assistants was costly and became unsustainable. To continue serving my patients in the best way, I made a decision to combine part of my practice with a larger group to help manage human resource burdens, the vicious cycle of billing and insurance issues, and to help make sure my clinic would continue to function, and frankly, because, as a solo doctor, I was burning out. Fortunately, I maintain full clinical autonomy in a patient-centric model, providing timely and essential access to care. Another challenge that I encounter multiple times every day when I see patients is the incredible amount of resources we spend on prior authorizations, on medications that will keep patients out of the hospital. This includes staffing a dedicated, full-time employee simply to handle prior authorizations. In closing, on behalf of our members and the patients I represent as the president of the American Academy of Dermatology Association, thank you for giving me the honor to testify in front of you today. We stand ready to help the committee as you confront the challenges facing practices and health care in this country, and I look forward to your questions.  GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. Dr. Jha. STATEMENT OF ASHISH JHA, MD, DEAN, BROWN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Dr. JHA. Good morning, Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Doggett, and members of the subcommittee. It really is an honor to be here. I have practiced medicine for over 20 years, and in that time I have seen American medicine change. I have also seen so many colleagues and friends leave private independent practice. Now, when I was a kid growing up in India, I would follow my uncle, who was a physician, who made house calls. He mostly made house calls. He got paid whatever the patient gave him. Sometimes he didn't get paid at all. But he made an enormous difference in people's lives, and inspired me to become a doctor. During those years a doctor could keep in his or her head everything they needed to know to care for people. Today a primary care physician caring for a complex, sick population must coordinate care across dozens of specialists, manage a dizzying array of medicines, tests, and procedures. Providing care in an independent, small practice has gotten harder, to be sure. But on top of that, there is an array of forces driving the demise of independent practices. Let's start with hospitals and health systems. They have been on a buying spree. Some of these purchases likely have been helpful, maybe closely aligning hospitals and physicians to provide high-quality care, but many have not. We have all seen stories about how a hospital buys a practice. Nothing changes, but because it is now billed as delivered in a hospital-based location, the cost to the patient goes up due to facility fees. The access isn't any better, the quality isn't any better, but these fees make private practices an acquisition target, and cost Medicare and consumers real money. Large corporations have gotten into this game, the most well-known of which is Optum, a part of the UnitedHealth Group. Optum now owns or manages 1 in 10 practicing physicians in America. And then there is Medicare Advantage. The commercial takeover of Medicare has made life much more complicated for that independent physician. While payments that doctors receive under MA usually don't match what they receive under regular commercial contracts, they face all the same hurdles and then some. The most obvious example you have heard about today is prior authorization. Most MA plans require prior authorization. Every MA plan has its own set of rules, and prior authorization makes doctors' lives harder and hampers their ability to provide the care they think their patients need. Further, initial denials of care authorization have grown substantially in recent years. And finally, last but certainly not least, there is private equity. Recently a colleague of mine in Florida sold his small cardiology practice to a private equity firm. Although he was initially reluctant to sell that practice he had run for over 20 years, he was persuaded by what seemed like a great price. Over time he got pressured to change his documentation so they could bill more aggressively, and eventually he found himself changing the way he practiced medicine. And last, but not least, he heard from some of his longstanding patients that his practice had stopped taking their insurance, meaning he could no longer take care of them. My colleague is not alone. PE firms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars buying up physicians, practices, hospitals, and nursing homes across America. These acquisitions usually increase costs. They can reduce access. They can even harm patient safety. So thankfully, there is action, action we can take, and you have heard about many of these today. First, I think congressional action on site-neutral payments is essential. It just makes no sense to pay more for the same care in the same location, just because the ownership of that practice has changed. I believe transparency around ownership is essential, so we know who is buying up practices and what they are doing with those practices. And vigorous enforcement of our existing antitrust laws is critical to ensure that we reduce market consolidation. And finally--and you have heard this from my colleagues today--it really is time to address the fact that there is no inflation adjustment with the physician fee schedule. That just makes no sense. Physician pay should absolutely keep up with inflation, and we have got to make that a real priority. My belief is, if we do all of these things, we can have a dynamic health care system where independent practices can thrive and flourish, and patients can have more choices, lower costs, and better care. Thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.  GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BUCHANAN. I thank all of you. We are going to move into the questioning session part of it. But if you can be somewhat concise, I know there is--these are not simple, but Dr. Gholson, let me ask you. You are talking about your practice, 20 years. You had to unfortunately close the business. If you look back, what--could you have done anything different? Or a lot of the rural communities that you are in, that you service, the numbers don't add up, especially with--you know, whether--you are getting cut many times every year over the years. What are your thoughts on that? Dr. GHOLSON. In my community one of the biggest barriers I believe I had was that the local hospital considered me as competition, instead of a community partner, and so they continued to expand around me. And so there were often times where, say, my patients would go to their emergency room, and be admitted, and they would not list me as the primary care physician because I wasn't employed by the hospital. And then, when the hospital would discharge that patient, instead of sending them back to me as their primary care physician, they would send them back to one of their hospital-employed physicians, which was disrupting the care. That was a major issue for me, because managing a transition from a hospital to your practice helps keep people out of the hospital. It was also very difficult to contract with insurers because I am--it is just me. I am the CEO, the CFO, the COO. I mean, I do all of that. And so, you know, often they would say, ``We don't know if we need you in our network,'' and I am like, I am the only doctor in this town. How could you not need me?  Dr. GHOLSON. So I think that was--those were probably the two biggest challenges, is not being able to be competitive with contracting. I mean, what we get paid for primary care, it is just--it is prices, the price of goods increases. Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I have got to move along---- Dr. GHOLSON. Sure. Chairman BUCHANAN . Because I want every--Dr. Richardson, you talked about administrative burden has gotten a lot worse. Can you better--a little bit more--articulate that aspect? Dr. RICHARDSON. Sure. Most of it--well, I shouldn't say most of it. A lot of it revolves around MIPS. I have three staff that are constantly reporting following up--towards the end of the year I had a conversation with our director of operations and said, ``How much time do you spend reporting and dealing with MIPS?'' She said, ``Towards the last two months of the year, it is at least half of my day. Our head IT, it is at least half of his day. Our head nurse managers, at least half of her day, and throughout the year it is a never-ending game.'' Sure, the costs of practice are going up every year, so you have to keep adding in administration for that, decreasing reimbursement. So we are constantly pressured to try to add new service lines of treatment for the patients to try to maintain revenue. But at the end of the day, it is just the increased cost, the increased need to try to employ more staff, and the competition to try to employ those staff with competing hospitals in town that can pay those staff more. But MIPS, especially towards the end of the year, is a huge burden for my office staff. Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Kean, what is your--you got a unique perspective. You know, like she said, everybody is the CEO, and the CEO of their own practice. But what is your sense that is the biggest challenge, the top one or two challenges that you face every day or every week in your practice or your business? Ms. KEAN. Yes. I think, you know, aside from the payment issues, it--certainly, prior authorization has been just an absolute disaster. And it really isn't--it doesn't do anything to improve care. It does absolutely nothing to improve care. But it does allow insurance carriers to deny care. And if they don't deny it on the first prior auth attempt, you know, doctors will get on the phone, spend all kinds of time with the insurance carriers getting it approved. We examined over 30,000 orders in our practice in 1 year. We have a research entity that helps us do that. And more than--less than one percent of the authorizations that we requested ever fully got denied, and I think that that is just because the patient abandoned the care. So if they are approving it 100 percent of the time, why are they doing it? It is because it is a billing game. Because if you don't have the prior auth on the bill, which you will, then they can deny the care later that you already performed. And so I think prior authorization is a really big thing that we have tried to address in Texas. We do have a gold card bill there, which we are very proud to support. It is a good start, but we need help with that. It only protects the fully- funded plans. Chairman BUCHANAN. Okay. Let me ask both of you about private equity. You touched on it. Here is the thing--I see it. Everybody is getting paid less, but yet private equities--I have been in, you know, through the 1980s, with the junk bond deals, and leverage, and all the other stuff, they are usually looking to make 20 to 25 percent. So one side you have got, you know, where people aren't getting paid enough, but yet they are buying these practices, and it is working for them. And I am sure in five to seven years they are looking to get that kind of return. And I have heard a lot of horror stories on some of it, where doctors thought it was one thing and it ends up being another, they got out of it. But both of you, I would just like to have you quickly weigh in on that issue of private equity. Dr. DESAI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for the question. I think one of the things that I use as a litmus test when looking at patient care models, be that solo private practice, be that a group, be that a hospital system, multi-specialty, private equity, invested, I think the important north star that we have to consider is where patient care lands between the sanctity of the physician and the patient. And my philosophy and the Academy's position is that we want to ensure the highest level of patient care when a patient sees a board- certified dermatologist for their melanoma, to save their life from skin cancer, or a horrible inflammatory skin disease. I think we have to be very careful when evaluating models because it is not a one-size-fits-all approach, as you alluded to in your comments, Mr. Chairman. So I think the important message here is that we have to make sure we understand what is happening between the doctor and the patient in that exam room, and how is that patient accessing the treatment in the best way. Chairman BUCHANAN. Private equity, Doctor? Dr. JHA. Chairman Buchanan, so this is a really important issue. And it is, first of all, even hard to know how much private equity is in health care, because there is no real transparency. But they have figured out how to make a buck in the system. Their general strategies tend to be they buy up a lot of practices in a market, gain a lot of market power, and then go to the insurers and say, ``We now own all of these practices. What are you going to do? How do you run a network without us?'' And they jack up prices. Ultimately, guess who pays that? Consumers, employers. Guess who doesn't get to see any of that? The physician who is in those practices. So that is their number-one strategy for how they are doing it. They are doing a whole bunch of other things, changing the way they do billing. This colleague of mine I mentioned who sold his practice initially thinking, well, I can just practice medicine and not worry about the business, he found himself practicing medicine differently because of the pressure he was getting. So private equity is a real problem. I think we need to begin with transparency. We need to know what these guys--who they are, what is--what the investments are. We need to have vigorous antitrust enforcement so that you don't gain monopoly market power. And I think there is a series of other things we can do, but we have got to get on this. Chairman BUCHANAN. And let me just say, you know, kind of close to home for me, my nephew graduated as a doctor, a radiologist, wanted to take a job in Florida, interviewed, all that. And then he found out that they were selling out to a, you know, a private equity firm. So he decided to look other ways, and he went out of state to find another opportunity. He joins that firm, is with it now, and then within six months that equity firm bought that one out. So I know there is a lot of discussion about that, but I am just concerned about where all that is going, and the impact that has. And with that I will turn it over to Mr. Doggett. Mr. DOGGETT. Well, thank you very much. I would just continue on that subject. One study I have seen found that private equity-owned medical practices charge 20 percent more, on average, per insurance claim than independent practices, and that an estimated 80 percent of private equity-owned physician practices significantly increased prices just after the takeover. I think the estimates I have seen are that, over the last decade, private equity has invested more than $1 trillion in health care. You have given the example there in Florida, but overall-- similar studies have also shown a number of physicians exiting from the practice after the private equity takeover. Overall, is it fair to say that private equity's role, with reference to physician practices, is to increase prices to both insurers and to the Medicare system, and to decrease the quality of care? Dr. JHA. Yes, Ranking Member Doggett, that is a--it is a really important question. And here is where I think the evidence is. I think, first of all, you have cited the key studies on this. There is a way that private equity firms do this. They first make sure that people are billing kind of as aggressively as possible. Second, as I said, they start getting market power. And, you know, we all--I think all of us agree physicians need to be reimbursed more. That is not what private equity is doing. They are getting higher reimbursements, but they are pocketing that difference. Physicians are not better off. And so what we are seeing is, as you said, a lot of physicians who are just deciding they don't want to practice in that kind of environment anymore, and leaving those practices. And then there are studies like one that came out about six months ago that showed that, when private equity took over hospitals, over the next two years medical errors, adverse events went up. And if you say, well, what happened there? My best guess is, you know, that they probably cut back on staffing in that hospital. That is another way to save money. But we know staffing can make a real difference in terms of patient safety. So ultimately, what we need to do is we need to look at behavior. When there is bad behavior, we need to have clear policies and approaches to dealing with that bad behavior. I don't want to paint too broad a brush stroke. I am sure there are private equity acquisitions that have probably been fine. But overall, when you look at the overall system and see where people are going, it is causing increased costs for consumers and the taxpayer. Doctors are worse off. Patients are worse off. Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you very much. Now, Dr. Gholson, you really seem to be exhibit A for what is wrong with the system now. You heard Dr. Jha also reference the need for vigorous antitrust enforcement. I know one of the things that the FTC has recently done that sparked some controversy relates to these non-compete clauses that seem to have a big impact within the health care system. How with the FTC's recent action on that and other enforcement, which has been lax for years, what impact do you think that will have? Dr. GHOLSON. I think it will have a positive impact. At the heart of the issue is the relationship between a physician and their patient, and there should be nothing that comes in between that. And currently, with non-compete clauses, it does. For instance, when I was considering selling my practice, I considered going to work for the hospital, but I would have been under a non-compete. And due to the expanse of where they had practices and outlying hospitals, if I were to break that non-compete, I think I would be 80 miles away from where I live, and I would have had to uproot my family. So it just was not an option. One of the things that does concern me with the FTC ruling is that it doesn't include non-profits, and we do have hospitals that are--that would fall under that purview as a non-profit. So I would urge that that be considered, that non- profits should come under that ruling, as well. Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you very much, and for your testimony, generally. Dr. Jha, let me also ask you about Medicare Advantage. I have seen estimates that we are paying about $1,500 per Medicare recipient more, per year out of the Medicare trust fund to MA plans, than on traditional Medicare. And yet these plans, some of them, won't pay the health care provider as much as traditional Medicare. Could you just comment about any recommendations you might have for what we can do about it? Dr. JHA. Yes. So Congressman Doggett, as you alluded to, Medicare Advantage has just taken off. It is now a majority of Medicare patients are in Medicare Advantage. This is really a phenomena of the last 10 years. If you ask the question why, it is because we are overpaying for Medicare and--Medicare Advantage. And that is not, again, translating into better care for patients or better reimbursement for physicians. There is a series of policy things--risk adjustment, how you do regional, benchmarking--a series of policy options that we have, but we have got to implement them. Just paying more to insurance companies when they are not generating more value for consumers, patients, or taxpayers doesn't make a lot of sense. Mr. DOGGETT. Thanks to all of you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Smith. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our panel, as well, sharing your perspective. Thank you for being on the front lines of health care, where I know it is challenging and it hasn't been getting any easier for various reasons. I am concerned that, instead of finding true reforms, we have just seen over the last few years we just shift around who gets paid, how much, and then there are more regulations, and then there are responses to that. And ultimately, patients aren't any better off with more government intrusion and involvement. But it is very interesting to hear, Dr. Gholson, your experience, your perspective, that you found the competition to be the local hospital, who wouldn't refer to you. Would that be accurate? Dr. GHOLSON.  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. And that perhaps the full choices to patients were not disclosed to the patient. That is--I am troubled by that, and especially in the broader picture of how we oftentimes hear about how referral, the referral process, should or should not be in other respects. But, you know, when we have these changes in ownership of practices, it is disruptive, obviously, as was touched on, that insurance plans may not be accepted anymore, and how disruptive that is, ultimately, to patients, and especially those in more rural areas. When I represent one of the most rural districts in America, this can be very disruptive. There aren't that many choices. Mere access is our goal sometimes, when in more urban areas it is--you know, there might be more choices among providers. But to take away even some of that very basic access, I think, is troubling. I will also point to the regulations and requirements that oftentimes originate here in Washington being a huge problem, and I think the latest is the new staffing mandate for nursing homes. So just in Nebraska--we are a pretty rural state--just in Nebraska, the Biden Administration expects us to come up with 450 new nursing FTEs. Where will they come from? Will they come from the hospitals and the practices that you mention-- which, I am guessing, you might already face a shortage in their support staff or, you know, nursing providers. I find this unconscionable, that they would even think of this. And we have nursing homes in rural America already struggling without the new mandates. And I think we all know what the mandates are really about, but it is very unfortunate that these poorly thought-out policies tend to be happening so much these days. Dr. Gholson, though, could you perhaps elaborate more on, you know, the recommendations or insights that you think we should pursue to address the workforce shortages, whether it is MDs, whether it is other providers that--you know, that full spectrum there, what can we do to bring some relief to the shortages? Dr. GHOLSON. So in Mississippi one of the things we have done is increased the number of residencies, family medicine residencies in Mississippi, with the belief that where people train they will stay. And so I would encourage--more GME funding would be one thing that you could do to help increase rural physicians. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. What did they do in Mississippi to increase those slots? Dr. GHOLSON. So we established the Office of Mississippi Physician Workforce, and our state legislature appropriates funding every year to assist with the start-up cost for residency, because that seems to be the biggest issue for starting new residencies, is that initial start-up cost. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Do you ever find that there could be some stakeholders who want to participate in creating more slots, rather than just waiting for the Federal Government to put more money into those? Dr. GHOLSON. Yes. A lot of the hospitals, when they are looking at supporting the Graduate Medical Education, they will often put up some of their own funds because they see the economic impact down the line. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. But there would not be something at the Federal level that would stand in the way of their wishing to do that. Would that be accurate? Dr. GHOLSON. The only thing I see is that sometimes there is a cap on payments at the Federal level that should probably be looked at for GME funding. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Okay, all right. Thank you, I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Sewell. Ms. SEWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank our witnesses. Supporting our nation's physicians is pivotal to reducing negative health outcomes. Dr. Gholson, I represent Alabama, next door to Mississippi. And I think one of the reasons why I am so passionate about making sure we increase the number of slots, the GME slots--and I want to thank our colleague, Representative Fitzpatrick, and I for working so hard to try to increase the number of slots. We promote a bill, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, and we have tried to increase as many as we can in order to increase the workforce. The belief is that, as you said, if they do a residency in these smaller rural communities, hopefully they will stay. My district, Alabama's 7th congressional district, is both urban and rural. And like you, I have many independent physicians that are struggling. In fact, one is Dr. Steve Furr. Dr. Furr is a practicing rural family physician in my district from Clarke County, Alabama. Not only does Dr. Furr practice at the Family Medical Clinic of Jackson, Alabama, but he also serves as the national president for the American Academy of Family Physicians. Dr. Furr, like many family physicians, has served in his community as an independent physician for 25 years without an inflationary update in 10 years. Yet, of course, all of his medical equipment has--costs have increased. And after COVID, obviously, the price of having good nursing support staff has increased, as well. We should be doing everything we can to ensure that independent physicians have enough capital to sustain their practices without having to resort to consolidation with large health systems, which is why I am also a very proud cosponsor of H.R. 2474, which is the Strengthening Medicare for Patients and Providers Act. It has strong bipartisan support. I think it is the right thing to do for our nation's physicians. This bill would provide physicians with the inflationary increase that they need by changing the Medicare payment rate to reflect the Medical economic index for inflation. This would help providers like Dr. Furr and other independent physicians. I think it is really important that we do whatever we can to level the playing field so that independent physicians have just as much of a chance as these big, private equity firms. And I am committed to trying to do everything I can to see that through. I know our whole committee is. Dr. Jha, thank you for sharing your expertise in today's hearing. How can we best support independent physicians in rural and underserved communities that do not desire to be consolidated with larger systems and larger practices? Dr. JHA. Yes, thank you, Congresswoman, and you actually laid out a lot of the issues. And I think our--my colleagues have here, as well. I mean, first of all, I do think we really do need to look at reimbursements for primary care more broadly. Nothing against our specialist friends who are on the panel, but primary care reimbursement continues to be a serious problem for family practitioners, general internists, pediatricians. I think that is an area that requires more attention. I think that would be helpful to all primary care physicians, certainly in rural areas. There is no question about it in my mind that--you know, if you think it is hard practicing in a world where a majority of your Medicare patients are MA in an urban setting, it is incredibly hard in a rural setting. You don't have the ability to have a full-time person just managing prior authorization. Ms. SEWELL. Yes. Dr. JHA. That is untenable. So some of the policy issues that I have talked about with MA, you know, with site-neutral payments, those are all going to be helpful everywhere, but particularly for the rural provider who is just much more vulnerable to these kinds of things. Ms. SEWELL. Absolutely. Dr. Gholson, can you talk a little bit about your experience, and what recommendations you would give this committee in order to help support independent physicians? Dr. GHOLSON. Well, I agree with my colleague. Paying primary care is vital to the--being able to sustain primary care independent practices in rural America. And the budget neutrality issue is also something I think that needs to be looked at. I love my colleagues. I don't want them undervalued because I feel like I need to be valued more. We have talked about prior authorizations, the administrative burden. That is key. It is just really paying us for the work that we do, and the value that we bring not only to our patients, but we bring value to our communities. Ms. SEWELL. Absolutely. And often times you are in communities where there is a medical desert. And so you also provide economic opportunity. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Kelly. Mr. KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for taking a day out of your life to be here today to try to explain your business model. You guys have so much non- productive labor, but everybody in business has that today. I am just going to take a couple of seconds to push a bill that we are going to be dropping on the 5th of June. It is the Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act. Ms. DelBene is on this, Dr. Bucshon is on this, Dr. Bera is on this. And at this point I want to take the time that I have remaining and give it to my friend, Dr. Wenstrup, who is actually in this business, and goes through what you go through every day. But I got to tell you, I wish I could say that there is help on the way. I don't know how anybody runs a profitable business anymore, especially anytime the government gets involved in it. So at this point, Dr. Wenstrup, take it away. Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Kelly, I appreciate you obliging me and giving me more time, and I will use my time when it comes about, too. Before I get started, without objection, I would like to enter a statement for the record on behalf of my friend, colleague, and fellow co-chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus, Dr. Murphy. He is away. He is going to be undergoing surgery. I want you all to keep him in your prayers. And without objection, I would like to submit his statement for the record. Chairman BUCHANAN. So ordered.   Mr. WENSTRUP. So obviously, everyone--everything you have said is spot on. We have covered all the points. But our country is facing a critical shortage, and access to quality care is definitely a problem. One thing I do want to say is that I hope that we don't, as the medical professionals, reduce the level of expectations in our education and training, as it will make it even more difficult to defend our value. We have got to do that. You mentioned board certification. That is important in every one of our specialties, because it represents ascertaining the highest level of quality care that you can provide. And I get that. You know, it is so hard to fathom what has happened to medicine because providers are the product. We are the product and are the key to a healthy nation to begin with. And it just--and we need a strong, uninterrupted doctor-patient relationship to exist. When I first started in practice, I set up my own practice. I had two employees. And if someone was sick, my mom came in. You like that, don't you, Dr. Gholson? And it was wonderful, it was wonderful. And as time changed, I joined a large orthopedic group, but I still practiced as an independent physician, I felt it. You know, it was the type of practice where at Christmas time people are bringing your gifts, you have developed relationships, and I think that is the key to a successful outcome. One of the reasons I ran for Congress is I looked at Washington and I said we have people making health care decisions that have never seen a patient, have no idea what it is like being out in the trenches. And the profession has changed a lot since I started that practice which I valued, but it was no problem when I went to a larger group because we were all of the same ilk. We were independent, we were practicing. Our reputation mattered in the community. That is what mattered, not what Washington thought. I have always felt it really didn't matter to me. Yes, you know, if you want us to do this, submit this and that--which, obviously, as you know, and as everyone has commented, got worse and worse and worse, and more and more burdensome. But I remember starting out in practice. And every day from Washington I was hearing about greedy doctors, greedy doctors. This is the 1980s. And I thought I am $185,000 in debt. That is cheap today, that is cheap today. And I worked during school to keep it down. I am not greedy. And I figured I will make a good living as long as I do a good job and take care of people. That is all it comes down to. I am against fraud. We want to catch people that are committing fraud and everything else. But other than that, get out of our way. Let us take care of people. We get on calls for prior authorization, and I am talking to somebody who is not in my specialty telling me what I can and can't do. I ask them for their license and how the patient can make an appointment for them, because if they are going to take over the care they should take over the liability. And I am just sick of it. They take no liability, but they determine the outcome of the patient, they delay the treatment of the patient. All of these things. We have got to take control, and we have got to start telling Washington, as providers and as Members of Congress, enough is enough. My time has expired here, but I am just getting warmed up.  Mr. WENSTRUP. I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Stay tuned for act two.  Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Chu. Ms. CHU. Dr. Jha, thank you for your testimony. Every year, especially over the last few years, especially during the last half of the year, physician group after physician group will come in pleading not to just get zero percent increase in their Medicare fees. Current law has the updates at 2.93 percent for 2024, but it will drop to 0 percent for 2025 unless Congress intervenes. So the physicians say the updates are insufficient, and that there is no means to deal with inflation. And of course, they talk about that, with this insufficient Medicare payment updates, it is really difficult to deal with their practices. We have heard a lot about these challenges today from so many of you who have testified. What do you recommend we do to upgrade how Medicare pays physicians in a way that will improve value without breaking the bank? Dr. JHA. Yes, Congresswoman, thank you for that very important question. I guess I would begin by saying that part of the reason they come in every year is because we have a long tradition of not fixing things for the long run, and then doing this kind of BandAid fix every year. We did that for a year. Eventually, MACRA solved one part of that problem, but then now we have this issue. Look, I think we need a long-term fix on inflation adjustment for our physician fee schedule. I just--I have not encountered someone who does not think that that is the case. Where there is some disagreement is exactly how do we do that. And do we use the Medicare economic index that tracks costs of practice? What proportion of that over what time? I think MedPAC has laid out a strategy and an approach that I think is pretty reasonable. I suspect other people may be-- you know, may not disagree with their--I mean may not fully agree with their approach. But the bottom line is that, instead of fixing this--you have plenty of other issues you need to be dealing with. Having to do this every single year creates uncertainty, it wastes time, and it creates hardship. And for physician practices planning out next year, if they don't know what they are going to get paid, that makes them more susceptible to being--to saying, fine, I will just take the deal from the hospital or the private equity firm. So a long-term fix is what we need at this moment. Ms. CHU. Thank you for that. Dr. Jha, you also highlight the issue of frequent wrongful prior authorization denials in Medicare Advantage plans. I am especially concerned that a growing number of these denials are determined by flawed algorithms and unvetted AI tools that fail to account for beneficiaries' individual circumstances. In 2022 the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general found that AI denials led to amputations, fast-spreading cancers, and other devastating diagnoses for some seniors. In response to these AI denials, I sent a letter to CMS last year detailing specific enforcement actions the agency can take to increase oversight of AI tools in Medicare Advantage coverage decisions. And earlier this year I was pleased that CMS finalized new prior authorization rules instructing plans to make coverage decisions based on individual circumstances, as opposed to AI. But questions about the enforcement of these instructions remain. So Dr. Jha, can you elaborate on how the rampant use of unvetted AI tools by MA insurers creates unnecessary burdens for physicians, and contributes to harmful outcomes for patients? And what additional measures should be taken to enforce these rules and ensure that private insurers are not leveraging AI tools to unlawfully deny care for seniors on Medicare Advantage? Dr. JHA. Yes, and again, I think we have heard almost everybody on this panel talk about prior authorization and its problems. I think there was a report out--I want to say it was ProPublica, but one of these news outlets--that looked at Cigna. Their denial--they spent a second-and-a-half per claim to make their denials. This is not a physician carefully reviewing the circumstances and making a clinical determination. The way that most of these insurance companies work is, if you can use an algorithm, you deny first a whole set of things. You just have raised the bar for the physician to have to come back, argue for the case. And a lot of physicians in a busy practice will just give up. And that is actually the strategy. Look, I think there are instances where prior authorization can make sense. If you are doing something somewhat experimental, extraordinarily expensive, extremely unusual, going through an extra burden or an extra hurdle can make sense. But I think, for more routine things, a lot of what CMS laid out--I think it was in your letter, as well, Congresswoman--is really smart. I think we have got to have actual physicians involved in the decision-making, transparency about authorized pre-authorization rates and denial rates. There is a lot of work to be done. But again, what I would love to see is long-term fixes on these, because Medicare Advantage is here to stay, and we have got to make sure that we solve these problems for the long run. Ms. CHU. Thank you, I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. Dr. Wenstrup. And we are going to move two to one now. Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, one of the things I want to continue with what I was saying, when I said I didn't care what Washington thought, I didn't want them to have to worry about what I was doing, either, you know, at the same time. I cared about what the patient's results were, what they thought, what my referring doctor thought, what my hospital community thought, what my fellows around me, my society thought, all those types of things. Because when you do that, you are going to be fine. But if you are doing something out of the extraordinary or something inappropriate--Dr. Jha, you kind of touched on that-- I understand that. You know, let's have some oversight here and there. Our society should have oversight over how people practice. All those things are important. But I remember in my first term here with the Doctors Caucus, we were meeting with CMS, and they said to us, ``All the things we are starting to implement are really starting to work.'' I said, ``For who? For who?'' I said, ``You have taken the joy out of taking care of people. You have made it such a burden to actually put your hands on someone's shoulder, and take care of them, and tell them you are going to be there for them, because you spent more of your time trying to appease they who never see the patient.'' You know, going forward, okay, what are we going to do going forward? You know, at the GOP Doctors Caucus we talk about our focus on making America the healthiest nation on the planet. What are we doing? Is everything we are doing leading to better health for all of America? And how do we incentivize prevention, and how do we understand here in Washington the return on investment when we actually have a cure for something, and the cost of it pales in comparison to treating someone for 25 years? Those are the types of things we need to work on here, and move forward as a nation so that we can do more for patients. Because there is a greater value to the healthy human being, and even those with chronic illnesses if we can keep them healthy. Guess what? They can go to work. They can do things and pay taxes, which is more money we can get our grubby little hands on up here. And that is, you know--but the value of the healthy human being is never really considered. We have to keep promoting this. I do want to spend time talking about something that I know will be near and dear to Dr. Gholson. Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio is starting a new DO school. Why are they starting DO? Because DOs tend to gravitate more towards primary care. And look, you know, the practice that I have as a podiatric surgeon, you know, we are doing vascular, we are doing orthopedics, we are doing dermatology, we are doing a little bit of everything--sports medicine. We do a lot of prevention. We do a lot of prevention, try to prevent ulcerations, limb salvage, those types of things. So this is near and dear to my heart, that we focus on preventive care and incentivize it. You know, the doctor that does the CABG, the open heart surgery, that is great. You save a life, you should be rewarded for that. That is tremendous. But the primary care doctor that works with the patient that prevents them from ever needing that CABG, you really don't get rewarded for that. We need to focus on those types of things. That will be better for us as a nation. So Xavier started the DO school because they tend to focus more towards primary care, which we need in southern Ohio tremendously. At the end of the Trump Administration we did pass 1,000 new residencies with--a large focus should be going to rural. So I am trying to coordinate residency programs in our rural areas because, as you said, people stay. These are some of the solutions, though. These are the things we have to focus on. But I want to go back to the problem, and I really want my colleagues to focus on this. We need to take control. We passed the No Surprises Act in a bipartisan fashion to take anxiety away from patients who worry about--so they don't have to worry about their bill, it will be taken care of between the insurance provider and the doctor. We did it in a way that we hoped would be fair to everyone, and where doctors would want to be in network, and insurance companies would want you in network. And HHS went and changed the bill to exactly what we said we didn't want. These are problems we have here. But we need your voice to keep talking about these things so that we can make the changes. And so, I don't really have a question, but I want to go back to that with Dr. Gholson and get your comments on that, because I hope this is going to be a successful thing. And you have somewhat mimicked that with--I think it sounds like what you did at the state level by helping to get the residencies underway. Can you comment on that a little more? Dr. GHOLSON. On the work that the OMPW has done? Mr. WENSTRUP. Yes. Dr. GHOLSON. Yes. So we started that about 11 years ago with the idea that we needed to increase physicians in rural areas. Specifically, we needed to increase well-trained family medicine physicians in rural areas because we felt like that family physicians could take care of maternity needs, they could take care of pediatric needs, they could take care of preventative visits. It was--seemed like the best solution to help with our lack of medical care in rural areas. We too recently started a DO school in Mississippi. It is relatively young. I think they have graduated their second or third class, and it has been good to see their commitment to primary care in the state. But it is a pipeline. It doesn't happen overnight. One of the things we also did is we started the Rural Medical Scholarship Program. So we encouraged our medical students at both the MD university and the DO university to choose to go into primary care, and so they were able to graduate medical school with no debt. Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you. My time is expired, but thank you very much. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Hern. Mr. WENSTRUP. I greatly appreciate it. Mr. HERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the witnesses for being here today and, as my colleague from Pennsylvania said, taking some time out of your life to come talk to us about something that you do every single day. I will--as my colleagues up here have described, I want to describe a health care system that I grew up in many years ago in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. I remember seeing the same doctor for every ailment I had, from the time my brother accidentally shot me with a bow and arrow to the scar on my face from a barbed wire fence to broken bones and even the common cold. This was a time before there were third-party billers, electronic health records. If my mom couldn't pay the bill that day, which she usually couldn't, she put it on the ledger. And when she got paid, she paid the doctor. And guess what? That system worked. I am here today, and getting to talk about the very thing that I grew up in. It seems so simple, you know, a patient and a doctor together were the heart of the health care system. But sadly, we are a long way from those days. Now we have third-party billers, huge health systems, and no one knows how much anything actually costs. One thing that really concerns me that I am glad this hearing highlights is the fact that the health care system will buy up a physician practice, jack up the prices--and sometimes overnight--and get paid much higher rates than private, physician-owned practices for the same exact services. A lot of times this is because these hospital systems tack on a so- called facility fee. Study after study after study shows that patients are being charged exponentially more for the same services. According to an analysis of six outpatient procedures released last fall, hospital common procedure prices were substantially higher, in some cases five times higher than when performed at a physician's office. There is no evidence that outpatient care in hospital-owned facilities for the same services results in better outcomes. So patients are left with no added benefits, just higher prices and less choices. This is why I introduced H.R. 3417, the FAIR Act, which would require all off-campus outpatient departments to have separate NPIs so they cannot change--charge onsite hospital prices. Dr. Richardson, you touched on this a bit in your testimony. Would you agree that requiring unique identifiers for on and off-campus facilities and other site-neutral policies would lead to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients? Dr. RICHARDSON. Thank you for the question. Absolutely. We have a very comprehensive one-stop-shop practice, where we offer radiation therapy, diagnostic therapy, surgical therapy, medication therapy, clinical trials-- basically, treatments and diagnosis throughout the gamut. If we sold to a hospital system overnight, by changing nothing, not changing the sign on the door, not changing the physicians, not changing location, overnight it would cost two to three times more for any of the insurance companies or Medicare, and the patient's out-of-pocket, as well. So it absolutely makes a big difference, when all of a sudden you are billing under a hospital code instead of an outpatient procedure code or an outpatient clinic code, that the price just skyrockets. And it has nothing to do with quality of care. It has nothing to do with access of care. In fact, most of the time it would actually decrease access, because all of a sudden we are not motivated to work as much because we are getting paid substantial rates on RVUs, because the hospital can't afford to do it due to their site of service disparity and benefits and advantages in that realm. Mr. HERN. Thank you. Another issue that I am gravely concerned about and interested in is this idea of physician- owned hospitals. I know we all have our opinions on the Affordable Care Act, and my opinion is there was a lot wrong with it, but today I focus on the ban on opening new, physician-owned hospitals. I found it a bit foolish that we have sat back and watched hospitals and health care systems take over and buy physician practices now employing upwards of 75 percent of our physicians, but do not let physicians, the ones providing the care, invest and run their own hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals have shown to provide equivalent or higher quality care more efficiently and at a lower cost, compared to community hospitals, resulting in significantly better patient experiences and outcomes. Ms. Kean, you noted the benefit patients see from going to an independently owned hospital group. Do you think allowing physicians to own hospitals would create more competition? And also, what type of benefits have you seen regarding patient care when physicians own their own place of work? Ms. KEAN. Yes, I know a lot about that. You know, as I said, we are 100 percent physician-owned, as a practice here in San Antonio. We own two outpatient ambulatory surgery centers 100 percent, and we also manage them, and that is physician- led. We do not own a hospital. We were not able to do that, unfortunately. But we did partner with a hospital in San Antonio to help us, you know, get control over the care that they are receiving in the hospital system. But yes, I don't see a reason why a physician can't own a hospital. I understand that there is regulatory, you know, requirements as far as a referral relationship and where that patient is going to go. But the physician actually knows where the best place is for the patient to receive care. And I think we just need to let them do that. Mr. HERN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I do want to note that when I said I got shot with--by a bow and arrow from my brother, that they all kind of smiled like they have worked on people who had been shot by bow and arrows before.  Mr. HERN. So Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. Chairman BUCHANAN. By the way, I have got two brothers, so I know----  Chairman BUCHANAN. And three sisters. So I got--Mr. Davis, you are recognized. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank all of the witnesses for very interesting insights and this discussion. I have been thinking I have been around health care now, I guess, for a pretty good period of time. I have worked in clinics, I have sat on the board of hospitals. I have taught at medical schools. I hope that I can leave today with a feeling that, yes, we are all concerned about conserving the private practice of medicine, the independent, private practice. I remember when I used to teach a course at the University of Illinois School of Medicine, and we taught a course called The Realities of Medicine. As young medical students would come in, they would talk about their goals and what they wanted to do. Of course, many of them would indicate that they wanted to do family medicine, family practice. They wanted to be internists. By the time they graduated, many of them would have changed their positions and changed their minds, and would decide that they needed to go into something that compensated them a little differently, that the reality was they may have wanted to do one thing, but when it got down to deciding, they would find it necessary to decide that they want to do something else. And I guess there is always this business of economy, the business of our economic system, and the business of where do we and how do we equalize or try and equalize systems so that the systems work together. I am a sociologist. I am a big fan of a fellow called Frederick Douglass, who used to say that he knew one thing if he didn't know anything else, and that is that in this world you may not get everything that you pay for, but you will certainly pay for everything that you get, and that you pay one way or you would pay the other. I wonder if each one of us could give one thing you think we can really do that would help conserve and preserve the independent, private practice of medicine. I have been reading the papers, and I have read several stories in the last weeks or two. So Dr. Gholson, why don't you just start and go? Dr. GHOLSON. It is tough to give you just one thing, so I am kind of torn between get rid of prior authorizations absolutely, completely, and for--as primary care, paying us for what we are worth. Dr. RICHARDSON. Thank you. I think maybe one of the biggest indicators or the biggest thing to keep us in business is just updating the physician fee schedule so we can actually keep pace with the cost of running a practice. Our overhead, employee overhead, has gone up 30 percent in the last 2 years. Our medical insurance goes up 10 to 20 percent every year. We literally just can't keep pace with it, and we can't keep hiring. So updating that fee schedule that keeps pace with that cost would be beneficial. Ms. KEAN. I would like to get the medical record back in the hands of the physicians, instead of these AI tools and insurance carriers. It has become a billing weapon, and not the medical record that it used to be. I would like to see us get that back. Dr. DESAI. Congressman Davis, thank you for the question. We have got to fix the Medicare physician reimbursement schedule. And H.R. 2474 and 6371 need to be passed to allow physicians to maintain practices to preserve that sanctity, which you so appropriately referenced, between the patient and the physician. We have got to fix that, and we need your help. Dr. JHA. Congressman, my--if you--number one for me is site-neutral payments. I think it is a major reason why we are having--we are seeing physician practices get bought out. Second, dealing with Medicare Advantage prior authorization that we have talked about. I also think physician fee schedule is important. But if I had to order it, site-neutral; going after MA; dealing with private equity. Those are major forces in the health system that we have to deal with. Mr. DAVIS. Thank you all very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes, Mrs. Miller, you are recognized. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you, Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett, and thank you all for being here today. I cannot agree more with the physicians on our committee and the life that they have led, the lives you all have led, and how important you are. You are so important. I live in West Virginia, a very, very rural state. You know, sometimes it can take from an hour to almost five hours, really, to get to your doctor or to your hospital because our terrain is just very challenging. But we need care. And, you know, just for a routine checkup sometimes, it is critical that our local, rural physician practices exist so that they aren't always burdened, you know, with the far drive and the expensive visits to a hospital for something very minor. That has worried me for years, having to go to a hospital for something very minor when you could go to your family physician. Today's economic environment, with inflation through the roof, and thanks to the reckless spending that continues to go on with this Administration, many independent physician practices cannot afford to keep their doors open. Frankly, I think the Federal Government doesn't reimburse well enough to make it feasible for you to do it at all. So this is a huge issue for physicians, as well as patients. Dr. Gholson, I was really disheartened to hear about your struggles and your practice that you endured because of bad policy. And I know firsthand how devastating it is to rural communities to lose their local doctor. So to help paint the picture for my colleagues that may not be from rural areas--and there are a lot of them that aren't here that really ought to hear this--can you go into detail about the different physician-patient relationships that happen in independent practices, particularly in rural areas, compared to physicians in these huge practices? Dr. GHOLSON. So to paint the picture of how rural my community is, we are a one-stoplight town. Mrs. MILLER. Yes. Dr. GHOLSON. My patients would be able--they could walk to my practice to see me, because we were right downtown. I was able to do home visits with my patients, which gave you incredible insight to what was going on in their life. I would see them at Walmart, and they would talk to me about their care. I would see them in church, and they would ask me questions about which specialists they felt like they needed to go to. And even though I closed my practice in 2022, I still get those questions from my former patients, even today. So you really are part of the community. You are part of the fabric. You sponsor the local baseball teams. You are at the team events for--as team physicians. The whole community becomes like family. Mrs. MILLER. You are almost the elder of the family, so to speak. I mean, you are that--you are just that important. As much as I would love to see every independent practice thrive, I know that there are tons of challenges out there that you all face that can drive you to close or sell your practices and move into a larger health system. Prior to having to make the impossible choice to close your practice, can you tell us some of the pressures that come with competing for your workforce with the larger health systems, or if there is any pressure to consolidate your practices? Dr. GHOLSON. So for me, competing with the local hospital is probably the biggest thing with my workforce. I could not compete with what they were able to pay my nursing staff. We already had a nursing shortage going into COVID, and COVID exacerbated the nursing shortage. A lot of nurses started doing travel nursing. Mrs. MILLER. Oh, yes. Dr. GHOLSON. And so it was just very difficult to compete, and physicians--and the hospitals had an advantage because of the facility fees they were able to garner from the care that they were receiving. So that made it very difficult to compete. Mrs. MILLER. You are right. Dr. Richardson, in order for people to understand more the business side of Medicare reimbursement simply not being enough to even cover the costs of operating in a rural area, are there examples where Medicare regulations or reimbursement requirements have limited your practice's ability to provide high-quality services to your rural patients? Dr. RICHARDSON. I think it is just more of everything is more difficult when you are treating patients in rural areas. Unless you actually have a provider in that area, from a specialist standpoint, you are traveling. I mentioned earlier we have 13 clinics throughout the state. Those are clinics where we actually get in our car, grab our staff, and grab our equipment, our scopes, our drugs, put them in our trunk, drive to that community to run a clinic, and sometimes do some simple outpatient surgeries at that local, rural hospital, and then drive back. So it is just an increased burden. It is a burden to your quality of life. It is a burden to your practice at home. We have had the discussion of consolidating care and making patients drive to the Wichita metro area because we are so overburdened there, and we just haven't had the heart to do it because many of these patients simply cannot or would not make the travel. They don't have the social support or the resources to drive three to four hours. Mrs. MILLER. That is right. Dr. RICHARDSON. And honestly, I think one of the biggest improvements we have had over the last couple of years, one of the good things that came out of the pandemic, was actually telemedicine. Mrs. MILLER. Right. Dr. RICHARDSON. There are so many of these patients in rural Kansas that need a five-minute appointment with me that can easily be done over telemedicine. And so we have tried to take advantage of that when possible. Mrs. MILLER. Thank you for that answer. And I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. Mr. Fitzpatrick, you are recognized. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here today. Medicare physician pay and its impacts on patient access to care remains a major issue in my community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania, as it has been and continues to be across the country. While I was pleased that Congress acted in the March 8 government funding package to address the Medicare physician pay cuts, predictable, sustainable reforms are still needed to prevent this in the future. As you all are well aware, adjusted for inflation and practice costs, Medicare physician pay plummeted a total of 29 percent from 2001 to 2024, and physicians now face another steep 3 percent payment cut at the end of this year. My first question to you, Ms. Kean: Can you discuss some of the impacts that this pressing financial instability is having on physician practices, including things like difficulty in retaining staff, trouble keeping their doors open, rising costs, administrative burdens, and the like? Ms. KEAN. Thank you for the question. Yes. I mean, trying to retain our staff has been very, very difficult, and it is not just the hospitals that we are competing against. I am competing against retail entities that can just simply raise their prices. We can't do that. And so that is probably the biggest thing that is the impact there. And yes, Congress, you know, must act. You know, Congress must act to avoid these cuts. And we all cheer that, you know, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It is as bad as it has ever been, and it needs to be addressed immediately. If this panel is trying to figure out how to protect private practices, that is the number-one thing. There is nothing else after that. Mr. FITZPATRICK. And have you seen a disparate impact in rural communities, underserved communities? Ms. KEAN. Yes, absolutely. I mean, the rural communities are impacted in a greater way. They are losing their doctors. And, you know, just listening to the physicians here--I am not a physician, but I am an advocate for them, and when I hear these stories, it just breaks my heart. It shouldn't be like that. And it is because of these things that, you know, we are talking about today that are getting in the way of taking care of patients, and for patients--or for doctors to even want to be doctors. We need help. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Dr. Desai, you had stated in your testimony that since 2001 the cost of operating a medical practice has increased by 47 percent. Could you explain how these operating costs have impacted your practice and others like yours? And how do you think Congress can address this? Dr. DESAI. Congressman Fitzpatrick, thank you for the question. You are absolutely right. The cost of seeing patients and providing the care that these patients deserve and need is astronomically different from when I started in practice. When you look at the inflationary updates that Medicare hospitals and skilled nursing facilities get that physicians simply haven't been a part of and have been excluded from, it makes it incredibly difficult to see patients on a day-to-day basis. I can just give you an example. In my practice alone we have to increase the volume of patients that we have to see on a day-to-day basis to justify the increasing overhead costs that I have to pay for these medical assistants to be able to be in the exam room typing on an iPad, when I should be spending time with you, checking you for skin cancer and melanoma and creating that relationship, which I do on a clinical basis, but I am challenged at the same time to make sure I have assistance there to help me that I can afford to keep to be able to see those patients that I need to see because the overhead is high. So it is an incredibly vicious cycle. And what concerns me the most is that my job is to save lives from skin cancer, make people's skin disease better, keep people out of the hospital. It becomes incredibly challenging to do that when the day-to- day practice of medicine keeps it very hard to simply keep the lights on and to pay the bills to run the practice. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Thank you, Dr. Desai. I just want to associate myself with the comments of Dr. Wenstrup. The world needs the United States of America, and the only way we can be there for America and the world is if we are healthy. And the only way we can be healthy is if the doctor- patient relationship is healthy, as well. And the more--the criticism that I have always shared with my colleagues about the CFR, it is a cumulative registry. We always add to it, we never address what is redundant, what is duplicative, and what is actually outcome-determinative in the opposite effect, the opposite direction of what the intended purpose of that regulation was. So I am hopeful that we are going to continue to work together on this committee to address the redundancies. We talked about several of them here. Prior authorization is probably--I mean, in addition to physician cuts, Medicare payment reimbursement, the amount of time you have to spend dealing with bureaucrats rather than serving your patients could lead to the death of health care in America. And we have to address it with urgency. I yield back, sir. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Beyer. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for holding this and thank you for being here today. My sister, my father-in-law, and my uncle all had full careers as independent physicians, and I very much appreciate that this is one of those wonderful pieces of Ways and Means where almost everybody on the committee agrees that we really need to make sure that we preserve the independent physician practices. To that end, Dr. Jha, I am the father of two Brunonians, so I am glad to have you here. But you championed site neutrality. And 10 years ago Mike Pompeo, when he was a humble member of the House, and I sponsored a site neutrality bill, and I have done that every year since, which means I get a lot of visits from hospitals who tell me why this is such a bad thing, that they deserve to get more because they are taking care of the indigents. They have to be there 24 hours a day. They have all these arguments. From your perspective, why is site neutrality still so important? Dr. JHA. Yes, Congressman thank you. Site neutrality is just critical for all of the reasons you have heard today. Look, if the issue for hospitals is they have to take care of a sicker, a more indigent population, we should figure out how to pay for that directly. But what site neutrality does is it totally perverts the health care marketplace, where there is now this very large incentive for hospitals to buy up physician practices. And that doesn't increase access, it doesn't increase quality. All it does is it just allows Medicare to pay a lot more. Consumers pay a lot more through private insurance. And there has been progress on site neutrality. I don't want to say we have made no progress, but there are really large sets of issues that are still not addressed. I think I have heard from my friends and colleagues in the hospital industry who worry about this. You know, we have a long history in American health policy of doing X to solve Y. If the problem is that hospitals are not getting paid enough for certain things, let's pay them more to do those certain things. Let's not have a policy that totally perverts the marketplace. I think that is not the solution. And it is creating--I mean, if you think about where private physicians have been largely getting bought out, it has largely been hospitals. Yes, private equity more recently. Yes, MA is a huge part of the problem. But it is hospitals that have been buying out practices because of a government policy that we can reverse. Mr. BEYER. By the way, that was exactly my family's experience. My father-in-law retired, turned the practice over to his younger colleague who, two years later, sold it to the hospital because he had to. So Dr. Gholson, we really appreciate all the challenges that you and your practice have faced. You talked about--let me quote--50 percent of your time on cumbersome administrative tasks. We spent a lot of time up here on AI, and one of the things that seems to be exciting is ambient clinical documentation. Can you use that? Is it affordable for a practice in Mississippi? Would that change your life much? Dr. GHOLSON. So yes, I use AI now to help create patient education materials. It saves time. I do have to review them. I am really looking forward to seeing what AI does in the documentation arena, because we spend a lot of our time documenting. So I think there is some promise with AI. I also am concerned on the flip side of what insurers are going to do with AI that may be detrimental. So I think it needs to have some guardrails. Mr. BEYER. Yes, yes, yes. Every doctor I know is terrified of a machine algorithm making the decision of what patient care is. Ms. Kean, you are not a big fan of the way we do EHRs. How would you fix the electronic health record system? Ms. KEAN. Oh, boy. That is a big question. You know, I think that interoperability is probably the biggest thing, and that is, you know, every single one of us, when you come to our practice, we are going to ask you the same questions. Why do we have to keep asking those questions over and over again? Isn't there a way that we can communicate so that, you know, if the first physician asks those questions, it can be passed through to all of us? We need help with that. It doesn't seem like it is happening. We do get medical records from other providers, and it does come in automatically. But in order to actually figure out what the care happened, you have to go through all of the MIPS checkboxes of everything that somebody has asked the questions about that does not provide any real information to the doctor that needs to treat the patient. We need to know what that other doctor had to say, and what they are sending to us for---- Mr. BEYER. Yes. Ms. KEAN . And how we are going to be able to evaluate that, and then get that information back to them. The rest of the information that we are being asked is really for the record, from a billing perspective, and that is it. Mr. BEYER. Great, thank you. I know the Veterans Affairs Department and the Department of Defense are trying to work hard just to make veterans and active duty military EHRs work together, and it has been a huge and problematic problem. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Tenney, you are recognized. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses and for your expert testimony. I also really appreciate the insight that we receive on this committee from some of our doctors: Dr. Wenstrup, also Dr. Murphy, and also Dr. Ferguson, who serves on the main committee. And I have also served on numerous hospital boards, nursing home boards, and we have seen this shift away from the doctor- patient relationship that we were all concerned about happening if we tried to centralize and federalize our system, our health care system. I am a practicing attorney. We see this, a similar thing, happening in our legal field, where the bureaucrats decide what legal questions are answered. The bureaucrats decide what decisions judge make--judges make. My dad was also a judge. But I want to just touch on a couple of things, but I first want to ask all of you, because we have talked about these issues in getting more doctors, better doctors, getting--more interested in getting into the health care system. Could I ask you, do you agree--and I am going to ask each one on the panel--that we need to have and protect a merit-based system in our health care field, that we have the very best people going into this field? And I just want to start with Dr. Gholson and go all the way across the board. Do you think that that--we should continue--or continue to protect a merit-based system in terms of who gets to be a physician? Dr. GHOLSON. I do think we need to protect the merit-based system, but I also think that the merits need to be transparent. We need to know the playing field by which we are being judged. And right now that is not happening. Ms. TENNEY. Okay. Can you just go on and give us, like, a one-sentence answer? Thank you. Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, definitely merit-based. You can't walk into an ER and have someone treating you that was there because of other factors besides their merit. Ms. TENNEY. All right, thank you. Ms. Kean. Ms. KEAN. Yes, I absolutely agree. Ms. TENNEY. Dr. Desai? Dr. DESAI. Thank you, Congresswoman. Absolutely. I think we need to cultivate the best and brightest minds in this country to go into medicine. We need that for the future of the health care system. We have those people in our country. We need to promote them to become doctors. Ms. TENNEY. So transparently, we want to make sure that everyone is qualified based on a neutral standard, not we don't know who they are, we just know they are excellent when they take their boards. Dr. DESAI. And if they want to be a doctor, they can become a doctor. Ms. TENNEY. That is great. Thank you. Doctor Jha. Dr. JHA. Yes, I think I agree with my colleagues. Transparent standards, merit-based. Very clear that we want a workforce that can take care of the American people at the highest quality possible. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you so much. I just--I want to jump into a couple of questions. So Medicare reimbursement to these providers, various providers, doctors who are failing to keep up with the increasing costs of operating a physician practice, I hear--almost every doctor I have had in the last 20 years has retired or been--ended up as a hospitalist. You know, the cost of operating a practice, we have outlined this all day today. Medicare beneficiaries in my underserved area--Dr. Gholson, I have towns in my district that have a stop sign, not even a stoplight, so--and we have a dire physician need in upstate New York, way up in the rural areas. So these are huge problems. And the 2023 Medicare Trustees report identified ongoing reimbursement gaps as a threat to long-term access to physicians for Medicare beneficiaries. I wanted to ask you to what extent has the growing gap between the operational costs of independent physician practices and Medicare's actual payment affected the viability of practices, and how has it impacted patient access in rural areas? And I want to ask Dr. Gholson that, and also Dr. Richardson. If you could, just comment. We are struggling to get any kind of MD in federally-funded health care spaces in my--in entire counties in my district. If you could just say-- -- Dr. GHOLSON. Yes, I would--it impacts it tremendously. Every January I hold my breath, waiting for the fix. In the meantime, I am having discussions with my office manager of what staff I am going to reduce hours or let go, which is going to impact the access that my patients have to me. Ms. TENNEY. And Dr. Richardson. Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, I think I mentioned earlier that our employee overhead has gone up 30 percent in the last year, and that is not the only sector within our business that we are paying more for. So I would venture to say Medicare Advantage plans actually decrease access because, at least where I am, most of the specialists try not to participate in them. The patients are always coming in saying, ``Well, I am trying to find an insurance plan that my doctor accepts,'' and those Medicare Advantage--or disadvantage plans, whatever you want to call them--are actually decreasing access in my area. Ms. TENNEY. Well, let me ask you, outside of congressional intervention, you know, to update the physician fee schedule, what else can we do? What kind of targeted reforms can we do generally to the practice of medicine to create a stable, predictable fee schedule that you can rely on, not knowing, you know, year end to the changes? What can we do? And I only have a few seconds left, but if you could, jump in. Dr. RICHARDSON. It has got to be tied to just the cost of taking care of patients. As long as we are taking care of--and we are able to keep a business open to take care of the patients, whatever that fee schedule is---- Ms. TENNEY. Well, what can we do in Congress? I mean, we would love to be able to give you better access to that care, and better access to a reliable, stable, predictable fee schedule. Dr. RICHARDSON. Well, mark the index to the MEI, you know, the updates need to be, I think, indexed to the MEI to adjust for the cost of business. Ms. TENNEY. Great. Thank you so much. I thank you all for your great testimony. And I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Moore, you are recognized. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman Buchanan. Thanks for holding this important Health Subcommittee hearing today on the challenges facing independent physician practices. And your expertise is very much appreciated today. Thank you, witnesses. A contributing factor to the collapse of private practice are maybe well-meaning but overly burdensome reporting and administrative requirements placed on physicians such as the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. Quality measurement in MIPS can be costly, time-consuming, and, at times, bear little relation to physicians' actual performance in providing quality care to beneficiaries. One estimate found physicians spend an average of $12,800 annually to comply with MIPS's quality measure reporting, devoting approximately 53 hours per physician. A 2022 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that MIPS scores are inconsistently related to performance, and physicians caring for more medically and socially vulnerable patients were more likely to receive low scores, despite providing high-quality care. Kind of counterintuitive, if you will. And among a survey of small, rural providers, few participants felt that MIPS would improve quality care or-- sorry, improve care quality, or provide administrative relief. I had a group--as soon as I came, one of my first meetings I came on when I came on the Ways and Means, even--came and laid all this out for us on the issues that exist within the quality care standards within this program. And this is not a big attention-getting issue. This isn't going to cause a lot of bickering back and forth between parties. This is a fundamental problem, the way that CMS operates and it has existed for years. It should be low-hanging fruit. And I would love to just get a little perspective to find ways to accurately reflect patients' outcomes and the value a physician is providing to the Medicare program. Dr. Desai, do you feel that quality reporting metrics and MIPS, more broadly, do a good job of accurately assessing the level of care you provide to patients? What recommendations do you have to reform these quality measures? Dr. DESAI. Congressman Moore, thank you very much for that very pertinent and valuable question, and I appreciate you bringing up the challenges of reporting burdens, because reporting is burdensome. MIPS has not shown to help make care better as a well- rounded outcome for patients. I can tell you, from my experience, the art of that office visit, the 20 minutes that I want to spend with you talking about your skin disease, some of that goes into clicking buttons on an iPad that have nothing to do with what you are there to see me for. For example, if you are coming in to see me to take care of a melanoma, which is a deadly skin cancer, half of the things that I have to report in your chart that day have nothing to do with your medical history related to your skin cancer. We know that MIPS has caused challenges, and I will give you one example. There was a study that actually showed doctors who took care of patients from a higher social risk perspective ended up with lower MIPS scores, and actually got decreased reimbursement, even though they were taking care of patients who are much more at risk, and have much more complex medical illnesses. So we have got to fix MIPS. It hasn't improved anything. And what is challenging is CMS is now going into the next phase of MIPS value pathways and other systems which are seemingly supposed to improve that process, and have already, prior to implementation, posed major challenges. Mr. MOORE of Utah. So again, counter-intuitive. Dr. Richardson and Dr. Jha, I saw you nodding, as well. Anything to quickly add to that? Dr. RICHARDSON. No, the reporting is largely meaningless. He is spot on. Most of what we are reporting and spending office time and personnel time to do has nothing to do with the care that the patient is there for, especially when you are dealing with specialists. I take care of a lot of advanced prostate cancer patients, and we are spending time charting, documenting, following up, finding out if they had their colonoscopy or if they want to stop smoking. And granted, those things are great from a general practitioner standpoint, but many of these reporting details, from a specialist's standpoint, are completely meaningless. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you. Dr. RICHARDSON. And there is no tie to quality or value. Dr. JHA. Yes, and I will say this. This is a very classic problem of policy. I think it was a well-intended program when it was first created. It had bipartisan support. Some of us were hopeful that it would actually work. It really hasn't. Like, the evidence here is MIPS doesn't improve quality, it just burdens physicians. And at this moment we have just got to find a path forward. And I will say quality reporting is important, as a concept. The measure should be we should have a smaller number of measures, it should be automatically collected, and they should focus on things that patients care about, patient outcomes. We can do that. We have the technology. That is not what MIPS is achieving today. Mr. MOORE of Utah. Even in my remarks that talked about being well-meaning, well-meaning at first and it just hasn't-- it hasn't hit the mark. We are working on a lot of things to enhance transparency and incorporate provider, patient, and other stakeholders' perspectives. Right from your initial responses, like, you give me more motivation to continue on with that initial conversation I have. Our team is all in on this, and would love to engage with any of you and continue to any of my colleagues. So again, thank you, Chairman, I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mrs. Steel, you are recognized. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Apart from Hawaii, California ranks first among the states with the highest cost of living, between 35 to 45 percent above the national average. California consumers have been--I mean, have seen--prices grow about 20 percent overall in 2020, and many are experiencing continued rising prices, especially in services such as medical care, housing, and electricity, and others. At the same time, California seniors are facing a physician shortage heightened from the pandemic, physician burnout, rising overhead costs, and declining reimbursement. And the physician shortage is impacting patients across--access to necessary care. And it is much worse in California. And I am just so glad that all the witnesses are coming here that, you know, we can discuss about independent physicians. And thank you for all coming. And I just want to ask all the witnesses. California's physician practice landscape is rapidly changing toward an increase in market consolidation and vertical integration. That is what I see in California. What do these trends mean for patients I represent and to the doctors, for especially independent doctors? You can just--anybody who wants to answer it is going to be great. Dr. JHA. Well, maybe, Congresswoman, I will just start by saying very quickly the evidence on consolidation is actually quite clear when--whether it is vertical consolidation, it is horizontal consolidation, consolidation that is really not focused on integration and improving care tends to cost more, patients have worse experience, physicians who practice in them are--worse experience. It is sort of one of those rare things where everybody is worse off, except maybe the provider organization that can make more money. So there is a series of things that we can do to deal with that consolidation. We have talked about a lot about some of those policies: site neutrality, dealing with MA, vigorous enforcement of antitrust. But this is an issue that is really prominent in California, but it is prominent across the country. Dr. DESAI. Congresswoman Steel, thank you very much for bringing that up, and I appreciate you asking about seniors, because I think it is incredibly important that we realize that, when we talk about Medicare payment system, we are talking about seniors being able to see a doctor for the health care they deserve, that they have dedicated their lives for, and that they need. And I think that all of my panelists agree that, once we get the appropriate level of inflation-adjusted reimbursement tied to the MEI with bills like H.R. 2474 and 6371, we can at least start to preserve and ensure that seniors have the access that they need. I will also mention that when we talk about access to care, we need to make sure that the health care system still attracts young students and young, bright minds to go into medicine who want to become doctors and serve patients. Otherwise, when we all become seniors, who is going to take care of us? I give you an example of my daughter, an 11-year-old. She wants to be a dermatologist and take care of patients with skin disease when she gets older. I hope there is a practice of medicine and dermatology for her to become one. I honestly don't know what the future holds, and I really appreciate you bringing up the aspect of seniors' care, because it represents a phase of life that we will all be in at some point. Thank you. Mrs. STEEL. Ms. Kean, before you go, you know, you were talking about the redundancy that, you know, you were asking these questions that every patient is coming in, and AI is a really big part of it. And I am glad that I am not on the--just the Ways and Means Committee and our Health Subcommittee, but I am on the AI task force, too. So we have been talking a lot about health care issues because we want to prevent that redundancy and time wasting with the patients, and you can see--actually give more to, you know, patients' attention instead of that, you know, asking same questions over and over and then try to get the records, you know, from the other doctors. So I just want to talk about just a little bit more that, you know what--we have a policy, and you cannot really share much about these patients and other stuff. How are we going to help, and how are we going to store these, you know, data? Because I am on the Select Committee on China, too. So, you know what? We see a lot of these data that has been stolen. So, you know, how are we going to really, you know, store all these data, and how are we going to share only with our physicians? Ms. KEAN. Yes, I think that, you know, putting the care back in the hands of the patients, and the medical records back in the hands of the patients, I think, is probably the primary thing that could happen. If you allow them to contain that, to have access to the medical records, we are huge proponents of that. We want patients to be 100 percent involved in their care, and that means knowing what is in their charts. I think that that is probably a way to go, and to find some way to protect that would be, you know, critical. Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I have a lot of questions here, so I am going to just submit in writing. Chairman BUCHANAN. Okay. Mrs. STEEL. Thank you. Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Van Duyne, you are recognized. Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Two weeks ago the House Committee on Small Business held a hearing on examining the impacts of the regulatory burden on small practices. I am glad to see us holding this hearing in this committee, and it is clear that over-regulating is killing private practices. In Texas's 24th district I have hosted a number of roundtables with doctors, who have--many of--are attendees here today as a witness. Dr. Desai, thank you so much. It is great to see you here today. I appreciate you making the trip up. I always make it a point to ask our physicians how much time that they spend in a screening. You were talking about this earlier, doing administrative work versus face to face with their patients. And it is shocking to hear the time that our medical providers have to spend on compliance. And they would rather, obviously, strongly prefer to spend the time with their patients. In fact, one local doctor--I am sure you remember this--she even shared a heartbreaking story about how she had finally achieved the American dream. She had opened her own practice, only to be forced to sell it because it got too expensive to keep up with all of the government red tape. When regulatory costs reach the point that it is no longer feasible for small, private health care practices to keep their doors open, it leads to one thing, and you have been mentioning this all day: consolidation. That decreases quality of care, it limits competition, which increase costs, and it limits the possibility of physicians owning their own businesses, thereby restricting access to care and ultimately hurting patients. We can't continue to allow over-regulation to shut the doors of small care providers, and I am glad that our committee is focused on finding solutions to provide better and more affordable patient care. Dr. Desai, it is great to see you again. And I would like to ask you what reforms that you would like to see that would encourage higher quality care in Medicare, while reducing those kind of burdens for physicians. Dr. DESAI. Congresswoman Van Duyne, it is great to see you, as well. And thank you, in particular, for your leadership and all of the work that you are doing in this space, along with the subcommittee and the committee. I think you hit the nail on the head. I think the fact that we are here in a meeting talking about physicians not being able to dedicate their time to serving the patients' needs because they are too busy filling out paperwork, clicking buttons, on a phone call, hiring dedicated employees that are full-time equivalents with full salaries simply to do burdensome paperwork like prior authorizations like we have talked about is the problem. I think we have got to make sure that we, as physicians, get reimbursed for the care that we are providing. And I think the important message here is, with all of your leadership on bills like H.R. 2474 and 6371, we can at least start to make sure that those of us in private practice, those in academic practice, those in large groups--this is all across the entire health care spectrum--can continue to practice, and see those patients, and keep the doors open. I will give you one quick example. I had a patient with severe eczema, which typically is something that we treat on a very common daily basis, itchy red rash over the body. I can get that better pretty quickly. This patient, a young law student, an SMU law student, ended up in the ICU in the hospital with total body erythroderma. Just picture a full-body burn. The reason she ended up in the hospital, a 21-year-old law student, highly-functioning, bright young lady ended up in the hospital because of the fact that the insurance company would not prescribe her the biologic medication that would get her clear in two to three doses because they wanted her to--a cream for a rash that covers 80 percent of her body. Ms. VAN DUYNE. That is crazy. Dr. DESAI. She was in the hospital in the ICU, almost died, and now is recovering from that. So---- Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you for sharing that. Dr. DESAI. Thank you. Ms. VAN DUYNE. You know, we have heard many of the Democrats that have labeled private equity as a villain, and I have heard from a significant number of physicians that they are starting to look into private equity as an investment so they don't have to consolidate. What are the positive impacts of private equity investment in medical practices? Dr. DESAI. I think when we talk about competition, I think competition is a good thing. I think access is a good thing. I think when you have only one or two players in town, if you will, that is a problem. We, everyone in this room, is a patient at some point in their life. We want to be able to pick the doctor that we like, that we believe in their credentials, that we connect with, that we can have a rapport with. If you have only got two to choose from, that is going to limit your options. And I think, when we encourage competition broadly in the best interests of the highest quality patient care, that is where we need to land. Ms. VAN DUYNE. And you are saying private equity is something that actually helps increase the competition within those markets, as opposed to decrease? Dr. DESAI. Well, and I think I would frame it in the way that private--not all private equity is bad. Not every academic medical center is great. Not every hospital system is great. I think we can't label a one-size-fits-all approach. I think we have to be open minded to make sure, hey, if you are a doctor in this practice model and you can deliver exceptional care, then you are doing a great job. Ms. VAN DUYNE. Excellent. Thank you, and I yield back. Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Estes, you are recognized. Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for allowing me to waive on to the Health Subcommittee, which I am not currently a member of. And thank you to all the witnesses who spent a lot of your time today talking about issues that are important to you, but also important to us. I want to particularly welcome Dr. Richardson to our committee who is from Wichita, and I have been to their facility there, and I appreciate the opportunity to see, you know, the day-to-day activities. You know, as you noted, Dr. Richardson, your practice doesn't just serve patients in Wichita, but across the State of Kansas and into Oklahoma. And also, you know, across the country, physicians like you are serving rural Americans, providing quality health care to parts of our country that are too small to support specialists on their own. Unfortunately, we are seeing the bureaucratic red tape, lower reimbursement rates, rising prices are all weighing heavily on your independent physician practices. And we are seeing those private practices close or consolidate as a result. Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that Dr. Wenstrup gave me from a primary care physician who talked about being an independent physician versus being a hospital employee, and I would like to submit that for the record. Chairman BUCHANAN. Without objection.    T6472A.054 Mr. ESTES. Thank you. You know, as I have spoken with patients and physicians and support staff throughout Kansas, consolidating or closing practices is not helping Kansans receive more or better-quality care. With fewer and fewer doctors and nurses in private practice, patients are seeing increased costs and, in some cases, worse outcomes. The Kellogg School of Management notes that prices increase 14 percent when a private practice is acquired by a hospital, and a National Opinion Research Center survey found that 45 percent of physicians report deteriorating patient-provider relationships after consolidation. These increased costs and diminished outcomes are not the recipe for a healthy society, and our committee must prioritize solutions that preserve the vital role of private practices. Dr. Richardson, I am especially intrigued by your practice because you have been able to stay independent while serving more than a million patients throughout rural parts of our state. In your testimony you highlighted the fact that Wichita Urology has managed to remain independent, in part because of the shortage of urologists in Kansas. Unfortunately, urology is far from the only specialty with a physician shortage in Kansas, which, as you know, often impacts, most importantly, the rural parts of our state. Can you elaborate on how your private practice is still open to serve these rural areas, and how that is not often an option for physician groups that have been acquired? Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, thank you. Thank you for being here, and nice to see you. Yes, we are not unique in the specialty in our area that does these outreach clinics. Gastroenterology, cardiology, rheumatology, a lot of the specialists do the same outreach clinics throughout rural Kansas because they know it is needed, because they know that those patients can't drive three to four hours, and those patients don't often have any specialists in those areas. Speaking on consolidation, there is a hospital system that does own specialists that do no outreach, right? So that is-- that is the picture of consolidation in our area. The independent physicians are reaching out doing telemedicine, driving, having clinics at these rural communities to reach those rural patients while the consolidated hospital system is not. They are allowing those patients to drive. You also mentioned the increased cost of running a medical practice, the inflation. It is that reason only that we have considered consolidating ourselves back to Wichita, and taking our staff out of those outreach clinics. It is not because we don't enjoy seeing those patients in the rural areas. It is not because those rural patients don't need it. It is because we almost can't afford it with the difficulty in hiring new nurses, new MAs, the increased cost of running health care. We have talked about, just from a financial standpoint, consolidating. And like I said, we haven't had the heart to do it, and I hope we won't, and I don't think we will. But that is the only reason we have even had that conversation. Mr. ESTES. Yes, I thank you for that. I know we have much more importance around--the folks that live in Wichita or other urban areas don't realize and take--I mean, they take health care for granted because you may have 10 or 20 specialists 10 or 20 minutes away that you can actually interact with. It is not necessarily the case in rural areas. You also mentioned about site-neutral payments, and they don't necessarily equalize. Can you provide further details on how policies could be managed without necessarily reducing payments to hospitals? Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, like I said in my opening statement, I don't think the right thing is to just decrease payments to hospitals. That doesn't necessarily help physician practices stay in business. It doesn't help access, it doesn't help the patients. But I do think that it is an unfair, unlevel playing field. Right now we are competing with those systems for the same providers, the same doctors, the same nurses, the same MAs, which makes it difficult for us to run an independent practice. So I think site neutrality is, if not the most important, one of the top two important things of keeping independent physicians in practice. We are simply just competing against someone that we can't beat. And so I think a more reasonable solution would be to modestly have a decrease in the HOPD payment and a modest increase in the physician. Knowing that is asking to just decrease payments for hospitals. That doesn't help our practice to stay in business, that doesn't help us serve patients, and it certainly doesn't help increase access. Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, and thank you to all the panelists. Again, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I would like to submit a letter in the record from a doctor in my community.  GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BUCHANAN. Let me just kind of give you one easy one, but I need to get kind of your thoughts and ideas on this because we are going to wrap up, we are just about done. Tort reform. I am from Florida. We have a lot of frivolous lawsuits, a lot of lawsuits, and I am curious about how that impacts your business--one, from premiums and two is just from defensive medicine. I don't know how you can measure that, but I think it is something that probably can be measured, where people do procedures or things because they just want to be careful or be sure about that. The other thing is I can just tell you in our area we have a lot of doctors, in their late 50s, early 60s, that have made good money, surgeons and others, and they want to hang onto it, and they are worried about practicing out there. If something goes wrong, someone is going to take their net worth. And so it is a big, big issue in Florida. But Doctor, why don't we start with you, and we will just run through here real quick? This is going to be the wrap-up question. Dr. GHOLSON. Thank you for the question. In Mississippi we had state-level tort reform in the early 2000s, which made a huge impact on our ability to continue to practice medicine. For family medicine in particular, it did decrease the number of family medicine physicians who did OB, and we are actually seeing the consequences of that now. But I do know, for family medicine doctors who want to do OB, the price of malpractice is still an issue. It is still overtly high. Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes. Dr. Richardson. Dr. RICHARDSON. So tort reform is never going to be turned down by physicians, and it is a very important thing to discuss, and I think it is a very good thing. It is very specific, or it is very specialty-specific and very state specific. There are some specialties where tort reform is absolutely crucial to allow them to stay in business and continue to work until they are 65. In some specialties, it is not as crucial. I think it pales in comparison to moving the needle compared to site neutrality and physician fee updates. But it is certainly an important thing to address, especially in some specialties in states. Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes, and I do know every state is different. I put that--50 states, you all look at this a little bit differently. Ms. Kean. Ms. KEAN. Yes. We in Texas passed tort reform a little over 20 years ago. And it--I can tell you, it just, you know, firsthand, it absolutely impacted the malpractice rates our physicians were paying. It decreased it substantially. Texas is a very friendly state for physicians. We see a lot of physicians that want to come there because of tort reform. They feel like, you know, they won't lose, you know, everything that they have worked so hard for if something terrible happens. And so I would absolutely look to Texas to see how they did that, because it is working very well for us. Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes, I have heard good things about Texas. Dr. Desai. Ms. KEAN. It is working. Dr. DESAI. Mr. Chairman, thanks for this important question and topic. I will quote you a statistic. I read a study by the AMA that said in 2022 over 30 percent of physicians reported being sued. That is a staggering number, and that is exactly, to your point, why there is so much concern from physicians to even go into medicine or to continue practicing and doing procedures that are well within their scope of practice, but out of fear that they could be sued, potentially by anyone, depending on their state legislation. At the American Academy of Dermatology Association, we certainly support broad, Federal medical liability system reform, but we have got to put in common-sense limits into these medical liability regulations. Thank you. Chairman BUCHANAN. Doctor Jha. Dr. JHA. Yes, very briefly, I am going to largely echo what Dr. Richardson said. I mean, this is an important issue. I think there is good evidence that the malpractice system in our country leads to over-utilization of certain types of testing. The defensive medicine we talked about, the data on that, I think, is quite clear. There has been progress at the state level. There are certain specialties that are still at risk. It is one part of the bigger picture we have been talking about today, which is how do we keep independent physicians in check. We have got to deal with all of the other stuff: site-neutrality, Medicare Advantage, physician fee schedule updates. If we do all of that and make this a part of that solution, I do think we can get to a better place. Chairman BUCHANAN. I think part of the reason that they go after--in our state, again--the doctors is because they have a reputation to protect, and they know that. And I think for some of them, they take advantage of it. But I am glad to see what Texas and some of the other stuff has done. Now, everybody should have their day in court, in a sense. But my point is we need to take a look at stuff that is frivolous. But I want to thank all of you. I think it has been very productive. I think our members are excited about the input we have gotten. As someone mentioned earlier, you are all busy, all successful people. We really do appreciate you coming up, and you do have a big--you do make a big difference. Thank you, and have a great day.  Chairman BUCHANAN. Again, let me just add one thing. I would like to thank our witnesses for appearing before us today. Please be advised that members have two weeks to submit written questions to the witnesses--with answers later in writing. Those questions and your answers will be made part of the formal hearing record. With that, the subcommittee stands adjourned.
